S	Cheung, KM; Choi, T			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Choi, Thomas			Statistical ARQ Link Analysis and Planning for Dynamic Links	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In [1] and [2], we discussed automatic Repeatre-Quest (ARQ) link analysis and planning in terms of effective data rate, effective throughput, latency, and frame-error-rate (FER), under the standard assumption that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) remains the same throughout the ARQ communication session. In [3], we argued that the concept of constant SNR might not be valid when considering events over a long time horizon, as many link parameters are inherently statistical. This is particularly true for long-haul ARQ links because the channel SNR changes during subsequent retransmissions of un-received or non-decodable frames. As shown in [3], this inaccurate assumption of constant SNR might be non-consequential for static links such as S-band and X-band, but can lead to large discrepancies in the analysis and planning of the more dynamic communication links such as Ka-band and optical communication frequencies. In this paper, using similar techniques developed in [3], we incorporate the effect of changing SNR, or link uncertainty, into the analysis of ARQ links. SNR is no longer considered as a fixed value, but a random variable whose long-term statistics can be characterized with a probability distribution function. We consider two limiting cases: 1. "Fast-varying" SNR: when SNRs in subsequent retransmissions of a code-block can assume different values, and they are independent. One example is the deep space link when the ARQ acknowledgement time is much larger than the coherency time of the channel. For communications between Earth's ground stations and spacecraft at Mars, the round trip light time is 20-40 minutes, and this is much more than the typical atmospheric coherency time of Ka-band. 2. "Slow-varying" SNR: when SNR values in subsequent retransmissions of a code-block remain the same. One example is the proximity link between a low-Mars-orbit orbiter and a surface asset at Mars. In this case, the ARQ acknowledgement time is of the order of milliseconds and we can assume identical channel environment in subsequent re-transmissions. We expect the ARQ behavior of real-world dynamic channels would fall in between the "fast-varying" and "slow-varying" cases, thus providing interesting insights on the ARQ data return performance and latency performance. We illustrate the aforementioned analysis using the NASA (1024, 1/2) low-density-parity check (LDPC) code.

One or more ground-based optical terminals are assumed to communicate with the spacecraft. Both short-term and long-term link outages will arise due to weather at the ground station(s), space platform pointing stability, and other effects. To mitigate these outages, an Automatic Repeat Query (ARQ) retransmission method is assumed, together with a reliable back channel for acknowledgement traffic. Specifically, the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) is used, which is a component of the Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol suite that is well suited for high bandwidth-delay product links subject to disruptions. We provide an analysis of envisioned deep space mission scenarios and quantify buffering, latency and throughput performance, using a simulation in which long-term weather effects are modeled with a Gilbert-Elliot Markov chain, short-term outages occur as a Bernoulli process, and scheduled outages arising from geometric visibility or operational constraints are represented. We find that both short- and long-term effects impact throughput, but long-term weather effects dominate buffer sizing and overflow losses as well as latency performance.

S	Clark, I; Adler, M			IEEE	Clark, Ian; Adler, Mark			Summary of the Second High-Altitude, Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test for the LDSD Project	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA's Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator Project is developing and testing the next generation of supersonic aerodynamic decelerators for planetary entry. A key element of that development is the testing of full-scale articles in conditions relevant to their intended use, primarily in the tenuous Mars atmosphere. To achieve this testing, the LDSD project developed a new test architecture for the qualification of their supersonic parachute. A large, helium filled scientific balloon is used to hoist a 4.7 m blunt body test vehicle to an altitude of approximately 32 kilometers. The test vehicle is released from the balloon, spun up for gyroscopic stability, and accelerated to over four times the speed of sound and an altitude of 50 kilometers using a large solid rocket motor. Once at those conditions, the vehicle is despun and the test period begins. The second flight of this architecture occurred on June 8th, 2015. This flight sought to build on the very successful shakeout test of 2014 by testing an updated design of a new 30.5 meter nominal diameter supersonic parachute that applied lessons learned from the first flight. Two other supersonic decelerators were also tested: a 6 m diameter Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD), and a 4.4 m diameter trailing ballute. This paper summarizes the results from that test.

S	Clark, JJ; Meakin, P			IEEE	Clark, Jessica Juneau; Meakin, Peter			The Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission: Fault Protection Performance and Lessons Learned	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Fault protection as a discipline involves a collection of flight software logic and operational processes for detecting unacceptable anomalous behavior, responding prior to reaching criticality, restricting the propagation of a failure beyond a fault containment region, and recovering the vehicle back to full or degraded functionality if possible. The System Fault Protection (SFP) design for the SMAP Earth orbiter was put to the test during its 90-day vehicle Commissioning activities. During this time, the SFP software autonomously protected the vehicle from multiple faults to critical hardware, and the operations team successfully returned the observatory to its science state. The SFP also performed well in the presence of anomalous behavior below true safety limits by not taking unnecessary response actions, instead allowing the operations team time to monitor the behavior. Certain aspects of the SFP design were modified during operations via both parameter updates and a full flight software update in order to better match the vehicle behavior in the flight environment. An evaluation of the SMAP SFP performance during vehicle Commissioning will be provided in this paper, as well as a set of lessons learned largely focused on visibility, SFP mutability in operations, responses to peripheral device faults, and Safe Mode recovery and design. By capturing some of the knowledge gained during SMAP Commissioning, it is intended that this paper provide guidance for making future System Fault Protection designs more robust and supportive of operations.

S	Cole, B; Dinkel, K			IEEE	Cole, Bjorn; Dinkel, Kevin			Multidisciplinary Model Transformation through Simplified Intermediate Representations	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				There has long been a challenge of making engineering tools from multiple disciplines interoperate. This problem extends to system modeling practices. This challenge has been confronted with a wide variety of techniques. These techniques include attempting to interface tools together into combined suites, attempting to find underlying commonalities in mathematics, supporting connections through semantic encoding, various graph mappings and transformations, and code wrappers. All of these approaches have strength s and weaknesses. These are measured in multiple areas: relative freedom of action of individual domain engineers in developing their own tools, speed of execution, ease of creation, traceability, fidelity of information transfer, and degree of alignment between the concepts of different domains. This paper presents an approach to this interoperation problem currently being used in the World-Wide Web. The approach is to develop easy-to-parse formats that allow flexibility to both the file author and file interpreter. Many of the formats that are currently deployed sacrifice runtime performance for the ability of third parties to easily understand what to do with the data. XML became popular earlier as a de - facto standard format for many web applications, but is now being replaced by JSON to enhance human readability and provide a simpler data model. This is the basis for work in this paper. Our approach, which provides the key to interoperation, is a simplified "shrapnel" intermediate collection of objects and relationships that is the result of a breakdown of the system model into minimal pieces. It is then reassembled on the destination side, forming a two-step transformation. Previous efforts with single-step transformations have proven too difficult to create efficiently. In contrast, the use of this approach leads to an almost automatic procedure for transformation development. The Europa project is a large engineering project that must coordinate the efforts of many different teams with different specialties. The traditional form of exchanging engineering information has been documentation. The vision of model-based systems engineering is to make this information exchange much more digital. This paper presents the application of our simplified format to connecting two different engineering tools to the system model, with a focus on a dynamic mission simulation encoded in Modelica.

Interfacing TuLiP with the JPL Statechart Autocoder: Initial progress toward synthesis of flight software from formal specifications	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				This paper describes the implementation of an interface connecting the two tools : the JPL SCA (Statechart Autocoder) and TuLiP (Temporal Logic Planning Toolbox) to enable the automatic synthesis of low level implementation code directly from formal specifications. With system dynamics, bounds on uncertainty and formal specifications as inputs, TuLiP synthesizes Mealy machines that are correct-by-construction. An interface is built that automatically translates these Mealy machines into UML statecharts. The SCA accepts the UML statecharts (as XML files) to synthesize flight-certified(2) implementation code. The functionality of the interface is demonstrated through three example systems of varying complexity a) a simple thermostat b) a simple speed controller for an autonomous vehicle and c) a more complex speed controller for an autonomous vehicle with a map-element. In the thermostat controller, there is a specification regarding the desired temperature range that has to be met despite disturbance from the environment. Similarly, in the speed-controllers there are specifications about safe driving speeds depending on sensor health (sensors fail unpredictably) and the map-location. The significance of these demonstrations is the potential circumventing of some of the manual design of statecharts for flight software/controllers. As a result, we expect that less testing and validation will be necessary. In applications where the products of synthesis are used alongside manually designed components, extensive testing or new certificates of correctness of the composition may still be required.

Overall, the High Temperature Boost (HTB) PPU has 87% improvement in PPU specific power/mass and 38% improvement in-space solar electric system mass saving. The objectives of this Phase 1 study are to develop a High Temperature Anode Power Supply 10kW Prototype module with new extreme environment component and packaging technology and determine the component reliability and packaging survivability for at least 50 cycles in the temperature range of -55 degrees C to +160 degrees C. After cycling, the functionality is tested at room temperature and elevated temperature (base plate at 100 degrees C). Selection of high temperature components and advanced packaging techniques enables operation at a higher base plate temperature of 100 degrees C. SiC MOSFETS and diodes were chosen as well as high temperature capacitors designed to operate at 1kV and 2.2 mu F at 150 degrees C.

A Different Kind of Organizational Silence: When Individuals Fail to Recognize a Problem Exists	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				After major disasters, significant contributing factors are commonly identified but too often only with hindsight. For individuals to report potential problems before the disaster, three steps need to occur: 1) he or she needs to recognize an event as a risk, problem, or possible wrongdoing, 2) he or she needs to choose to either speak up, neglect the problem, or leave the organization based on an assessment of the benefits and costs of each alternative, and 3) he or she must take action if speaking up is the chosen response. The organizational silence literature focuses mostly on step 2, where the culture of the organization causes individuals to choose to not speak up even when a problem is recognized. In this paper, we focus on step 1: where characteristics of the organization or the particular problem cause individuals to fail to recognize a problem exists. We first examine the 1998 incident at Wallops Flight Facility where an aircraft crashed during an engine water ingestion test. We then describe a series of behavioral lab experiments conducted to demonstrate how different conditions in the situation can influence the participant's ability to recognize increasing risk in a task.

Science investigations should utilize the optical telecommunication links between spacecraft and Earth to examine changes in the phase, frequency, amplitude, and polarization of radio signals to investigate planetary atmospheres, planetary rings, planetary surfaces, planetary interiors, solar corona and wind, comet mass flux, and fundamental physics. The proposed system in this paper provides an architectural improvement to the present state of the art optical communication systems utilized by NASA. In this paper we develop an optical receiver to provide amplitude, phase, and Doppler frequency for optical Science measurements in addition to detecting Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) signals. Currently available direct detection PPM does not provide these features. First we propose how to construct an optical receiver with mirrors, splitters, and photon counting detectors that produce in-phase and quadrature components. We analyze the performance of proposed optical system for PPM. The paper provides derivations, and analysis of proposed optical receiver. The innovations are methods to extract phase, Doppler frequency from PPM intensity modulated optical signal. We demonstrate how the receiver can detect the PPM data and at the same time provide phase information for science measurements. Numerical results are provided for the proposed optical receiver.

This paper describes how such challenges have been partly addressed by the Model-Based Systems Engineering Team (MSET) on the Europa Project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), through the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) techniques. The paper first discusses the principle of Single-Source-of-Truth (SSoT) and how it can be supported by the use of a wellstructured system model relying on a rich vocabulary (e. g., based on the SysML language). The application of modeling patterns to organize the Flight System design information and make it queryable is then examined, with specific examples used on the Europa project (such as launch dry mass, electrical power, thermal power, fields-of-view). The benefits of checking formal rules to verify the correctness of the model and ensure that changes were properly incorporated are also discussed. The paper then presents model organization strategies that maximize the reuse of information across multiple design architectures that are explored in early formulation, as well as various practices used to control the numerous changes made to the model as the design matures. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the lessons learned from using a system model on the Europa project in order to capture design information about the Flight System. This has proved to play a key role in delivering high-quality representations of the spacecraft design to a variety of stakeholders as well as demonstrating its viability.

These have been extremely successful in supporting a series of landed Mars mission, greatly increasing data return relative to direct-to-Earth lander links. Yet their relay services are fundamentally constrained by the short contact times available from the selected science orbits. Future Mars areostationary orbiters, flying in circular, equatorial, 1-sol orbits, offer the potential for continuous coverage of Mars landers and rovers, radically changing the relay support paradigm. Achieving high rates on the longer slant ranges to areostationary altitude will require steered, high-gain links. Both RF and optical options exist for achieving data rates in excess of 100 Mb/s. Several point designs offer a measure of potential user burden, in terms of mass, volume, power, and pointing requirements for user relay payloads, as a function of desired proximity link performance.

The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) was developed as a metric for the maturity of new technology, but, in the past, assessing the TRL was often done informally and inconsistently. This frequently led to discrepancies between the TRL as perceived by the technologist and that perceived by a project. JPL has developed a guideline for their projects to provide a basis for a consistent Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA). Highlights of this guideline are presented here. It is anticipated that the implementation of this guideline will enable the hand-off from technologists to project engineers leading to greater acceptance of technologies by flight projects. On completion of a satisfactory TRA, an agreement can be made between the parties on the maturation plan required for successful infusion of the technology into a flight mission.

A Study of Adaptive Coding and Modulation Over Free Space Optical Link Using OCTL Data	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In this paper we utilized the downlink channel data captured at the Optical Communication Test Laboratory (OCTL) in support of the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (LLCD) to evaluate the potential performance gain of using adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) scheme to increase data volume while mitigating weather impairment. The study assumed that the estimated signal and noise photon counts statistics generated by concurrent processing of the downlink signal is available in real time to drive a closed-loop control of the code rate and the PPM order of the downlink. Downlink data from two representative passes were used. Pass no. 12, which occurred on October 29, 2013 and lasted 24 minutes and 15 second, recorded several link outages due to thin cloud and cloud interruption and is used to calibrate the symbol error constraint for the adaptive modulation algorithm. Pass no. 20, which was 19 minutes and 16 seconds long and occurred on November 18, 2013, operated over very clear sky and large sun-earth-probe (SEP) angle (approx. 170 degrees) and provided a representative sample of a clean optical channel. This study ignores constraints such as peak and average power limitations and processing overhead. Impacts of delay in the control loop are not addressed in this study, therefore any performance enhancement indicated by this study is only applicable to a short propagation delay environment. For deep space environment, further analysis will be required to determine the benefit of ACM.

On the Performance of Adaptive Data Rate over Deep Space Ka-Band Link: Case Study Using Kepler Data	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Future missions envisioned for both human and robotic exploration demand increasing communication capacity through the use of Ka-band communications. The Ka-band channel, being more sensitive to weather impairments, presents a unique trade-offs between data storage, latency, data volume and reliability. While there are many possible techniques for optimizing Ka-band operations such as adaptive modulation and coding and site-diversity, this study focus exclusively on the use of adaptive data rate (ADR) to achieve significant improvement in the data volume-availability tradeoff over a wide range of link distances for near Earth and Mars exploration. Four years of Kepler Ka-band downlink symbol signal-to-noise (SNR) data reported by the Deep Space Network were utilized to characterize the Ka-band channel statistics at each site and conduct various what-if performance analysis for different link distances. We model a notional closed-loop adaptive data rate system in which an algorithm predicts the channel condition two-way light time (TWLT) into the future using symbol SNR reported in near-real time by the ground receiver and determines the best data rate to use. Fixed and adaptive margins were used to mitigate errors in channel prediction. The performance of this closed-loop adaptive data rate approach is quantified in terms of data volume and availability and compared to the actual mission configuration and a hypothetical, optimized single rate configuration assuming full a priori channel knowledge.

These experimental results are of value for the diagnostic of anomalies on the surface of tar-coated pipes used in protecting the underground power transmission cables (feeder pipes). A test-bed was designed and implemented using an aluminum tubes (10 '' diameter) with an acrylic tube coating (0.25 '' thickness). Two identical wave launcher/receiver arrays, each of 32 elements around the tube for relatively uniform radiation/reception, were designed and fabricated at the frequency of interest (similar to 6 GHz). This arrangement was put in a specially designed small anechoic chamber and attached to a network analyzer. A variety of tests were performed to stablish the launch efficiency, prove surface wave propagation along, and reflection from different types of anomalies on the coating. In the paper, a number of test results and supporting graphs will be provided and future work for improving the performance of the launch array and the test-bed arrangement for better results will be outlined.

Specifically, it presents industry status on key advanced electronic packages, factors affecting accelerated solder joint reliability of area array packages and approaches for characterizations of assemblies under accelerated thermal loading. Examples on projecting cycles-to-failure (CTF) from one accelerated thermal cycle condition to another for column grid arrays (CGAs) also presented. It was shown, even for thermal cycling, the limitation of projection using mildly accelerated thermal CTFs to a more severe accelerated thermal CTFs, both for CGA assembled with eutectic tin-lead solder and ball grid array (BGA) Pb-free assemblies. Examples also given for projection life of complex spacecraft using accelerated testing and analysis; thereby, reducing risk. Quantitative assessments necessarily involve the mathematics of probability and statistics. In addition, accelerated tests need to be designed which consider the desired risk posture and schedule for particular project. Such assessments relieve risks without imposing additional costs and constraints that are not value added for a particular mission.

The NASA SBIR program selects a portfolio of technology proposals, submitted by small businesses to an annual solicitation. Funding may be awarded in two tranches, a 6-month phase I award and a subsequent, 2-year phase II award. Over the last decade, the total annual awarded funding was about $100-140M with Phase I awards growing from $100-125K and phase II awards from $500-750K. Typically, about 15-20% of submitted Phase I proposals are awarded and only these awards are eligible to submit a phase II proposal. The success rate at phase II is about 40%. We looked at NASA SBIR data between 1999 and 2006 to determine the impact of receiving a phase II award on invention and innovation by using patent activity as a proxy. Data from all NASA Mission Directorates and over a range of years were considered and combined into a statistically significant collection. We examined the phase II proposed technologies and the subsequent patent history of the submitting companies in the five years after the award cycle. We find that phase II awarded companies had a significantly greater number of awarded and cited patents, over this time frame, than companies not awarded an SBIR phase II. Specifically, we find an overall increase in awarded patents of 39% for SBIR awarded companies versus non-awarded companies. This difference is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. We also examined subsets for these data to quantify the effects of company size and previous patent awards on these trends.

While there has been extensive work on improving parametric methods for cost estimation, there is very little focus on the use of cost models based on analogy and clustering algorithms. In this paper we summarize the results of our research in developing an analogy method for estimating NASA spacecraft flight software using spectral clustering on system characteristics (symbolic non-numerical data) and evaluate its performance by comparing it to a number of the most commonly used estimation methods. The strengths and weaknesses of each method based on their performance are also discussed. The paper concludes with an overview of the analogy estimation tool (ASCoT) developed for use within NASA that implements the recommended analogy algorithm.

S	Horner, MD; Eremenko, A			IEEE	Horner, Matthew D.; Eremenko, Alexander			Europa Spacecraft Configuration Optimization for the Solar Powered Vehicle	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				A mission to Europa has been on the minds of NASA and JPL for many years. After the Galileo mission to Jupiter in the 1990s there have been various proposals for missions to the Jovian moon. The most recent proposal, previously named the Europa Clipper, has gone through numerous iterations of spacecraft configurations on its road to becoming an official NASA project in June of 2015. Most of these configurations included options for either multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generators (MMRTGs) or solar power. In 2014, the decision was made to focus on solar arrays as the source for spacecraft power. The decision to move forward with a baseline design that utilized only solar arrays as its power system meant that some configuration choices had to be reevaluated. Initially, a configuration was adapted to keep as much of the previous spacecraft design the same while replacing MMRTGs with solar panels. This proved to be difficult as the arrays presented a slew of new challenges that the nuclear vehicle was not optimized for. The solar arrays needed to be large due to Jupiter's substantial distance from the Sun. This meant that many of the instrument and radiator FOVs would now be obstructed, or would receive reflected light and heat from the large panels. Also, the mass of the panels meant that mounting near the bottom of the spacecraft would be sub-optimal as the wings would cause major disturbance to the vehicle as they oscillated in their deployed state. Another major, and possibly the largest, concern was the fact that as the high gain antenna pointed to Earth for communication, the Ice Penetrating Radar (IPR) would cast a large shadow on the cell-side of the array. This resulted in an estimated 10% power loss to the vehicle. On top of all this, NASA announced the selection of the instruments that would fly on the Europa mission and replace the notional instrument suite that had been used to develop and submit the project proposal. The selected instruments, while not varying widely from the notional suite, did come with a new set of challenges including a size increase over the notional package, thus requiring more room for accommodation. They also introduced new features not previously addressed by the notional package, such as a two-axis gimbal on one of the imagers. Additionally, two new instruments, an ultraviolet plume-hunting spectrograph, and an atmospheric dust analyzer we added to the payload and presented new challenges not previously covered in the proposal. Finally, additional payloads were under consideration, such as a 250kg ejectable payload that would be released at Jupiter and would accomplish flybys of some of the other Jovian moons. All of this resulted in a drastically different "family" of configurations that were capable of addressing these issues, and staying flexible to the numerous potential changes that could come. This paper discusses the details of the various configurations considered to address these items, and the configuration concepts that were selected as the baseline for moving forward with the proposal.

Using the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) limbed robotic mobility system, the outpost site can be prepared in advance through leveling, paving, and in-situ structures. ATHLETE will be able to carry pressurized and non-pressurized payloads overland from the lander descent stage to the outpost location, and perform precision docking and assembly of components. In addition, spent descent stages can be carried to assembly locations to form elevated decks for external work platforms above the planet surface.

While ontologies and patterns are absolutely necessary, an MBSE effort must also design and provide practical demonstration of value (through human-understandable representations of model data that address stakeholder concerns) or it will not succeed. This paper will discuss opportunities that exist for visualization in making the richness of a well-formed model accessible to stakeholders, specifically stakeholders who rely on the model for their day-to-day work. This paper will discuss the value added by MBSE-driven visualizations in the context of a small case study of interactive visualizations created and used on NASA's proposed Europa Mission. The case study visualizations were created for the purpose of understanding and exploring targeted aspects of requirements flow, allocation, and comparing the structure of that flow-down to a conceptual project decomposition.

Our MBSE frameworks and languages contain semantic richness sufficient to describe our systems at any particular point in time, often with an emphasis on the description of the system at major milestones. This is unarguably a real asset. However, when we apply MBSE in service of missions that are in development, rapidly evolving, of a larger scale, and where interpersonal communication is a critical part of the design process, we discover that our frameworks and languages are still not quite rich enough to enable us to ask the kinds of questions and get the kinds of answers we want in order to address the concerns of day to day work. This paper will discuss some patterns and tools we have developed to help address some of the not-always-explicit SE concerns that we have identified through our MBSE work. Particularly, this paper will discuss flexible yet practical methods for defining and capturing maturity, workflow, and agreement traceability within our system models, extensible ways to perform and track model audits, and ways to report and interact with this knowledge in the context of MBSE applied to support NASA's Europa Project.

Since Jupiter and Saturn dominate the dynamics of our solar system, improved knowledge of their orbits will result in a global improvement in the accuracy of the ephemeris. The Cassini spacecraft has been orbiting Saturn for over a decade, a third of Saturn's orbital period. This has provided an unprecedented opportunity to improve all components of Saturn's orbit by combining periodic very long baseline inferterometry (VLBI) measurements of Cassini's sky position with respect to background radio sources, which in turn can be tied to the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). The orbit of Cassini about the center of mass of Saturn is determined from Doppler tracking by the Deep Space Network. Combining these observations, we obtain the barycenter position of the Saturn system in an inertial frame at multiple epochs, with typical uncertainties of 0.3 milli-arcseconds in right ascension and 0.4 milli-arcseconds in declination. These results are then provided to JPL's ephemeris group for inclusion in future ephemeris solutions. At most epochs the largest component of the error budget is uncertainty in the ICRF position of the phase reference radio source used. These source positions are being continuously improved through additional VLBI observations. These VLBA observations have improved our knowledge of Saturn's orbit by nearly an order of magnitude. This technique will be expanded to include astrometric observations of the Juno spacecraft as soon as it enters Jupiter orbit in mid-2016. Although the orbital phase of the Juno mission is expected to last only a bit over one year, it will still allow a significant improvement in Jupiter's orbit. Previous missions to Jupiter have been single-epoch flybys with the exception of Galileo, for which the accuracy of VLBI position measurements was severely limited by failure of the high gain antenna. The Juno mission is scheduled to end in February 2018, five months after the scheduled end of the Cassini mission. At the ends of their missions the Juno and Cassini spacecraft will be destroyed in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn to eliminate the possibility of a future crash onto any of the liquid-containing moons of these planets that may be habitats of life.

A new wax-based hybrid fuel formulation has been developed that could withstand the harsh and variable Mars environment protected solely by a minimal layer of passive insulation. This formulation could provide substantial energy savings for a notional lander and is critical for rover mobility. Preliminary thermal cycle testing has determined that the formulation can survive the expected temperature extremes and lifetime thermal testing is currently underway. A complete preliminary design using this new fuel formulation combined with a low temperature oxidizer such as Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen (MON30) is presented. Several key features associated with a complete hybrid MAV concept are investigated to determine their mission suitability (e.g. Thrust Vector Control and restartable ignition options). Potential challenges along a path towards developing such a system are outlined and future work is suggested as a means of technology maturation. The hybrid design presented here was the lowest Gross Lift Off Mass (GLOM) result of a 2015 Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) led MAV concept study [1].

S	Kolcio, K; Fesq, L			IEEE	Kolcio, Ksenia; Fesq, Lorraine			Model-Based Off-Nominal State Isolation and Detection System for Autonomous Fault Management	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				This paper presents a model-based fault management (FM) system designed to provide off-nominal state detection and isolation capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The ability to autonomously isolate spacecraft failures to component levels will enable faster and more targeted responses and recovery thereby reducing down time. The use of model-based systems and practices is being explored by the FM community as a viable approach to developing more capable, autonomous systems in order to meet mission objectives. Model-based systems can provide better fault identification than traditional methods of fault detection such as limit-checking. They also lend themselves to more straight-forward approaches to verification and validation. We have chosen a particular model-based technique called Constraint Suspension for autonomous fault detection and isolation that does not require explicit fault modeling. The system is composed of a diagnostic engine and nominal system models of the target application, for example sensors and actuators. Sensed data are propagated through models of nominal system behavior. Faults are diagnosed when inconsistencies arise between sensed and modeled data. Several benefits result from this choice. First, because knowledge of faulty behavior is not required, it is possible to detect unanticipated and unforeseen faults. In fact, anomalous, degraded, and failed states all can be detected. Second, the same models used for nominal analyses and operations can be re-used for fault management, saving development resources and time. Third, the core diagnostic engine algorithm is complete and requires no additions to accommodate a potentially growing number of faults over time resulting in a relatively compact software footprint. Related to the second and third points is that the core algorithm and, potentially, models can be reused from mission to mission. Finally, the system can be used early in the design phase as a tool for sensor placement analyses and model verification. Health information produced by the FM system can be used to make resource allocation and planning and scheduling decisions by ground operations or by other on-board autonomy agents. Autonomous fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) on board space vehicles will provide protection and increased mission availability and reliability. On the ground such systems enable lights-out monitoring as well as training and support for operators. This paper presents the development of fault detection and isolation algorithms and models. Application of the system to a spacecraft attitude control system is discussed. Finally we apply Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) modeling patterns to the fault management system models as a way to facilitate the development of the models through the use of SysML.

Until now FPA calibration was performed offline in MATLAB or IDL due to the high throughput required to process incoming data - a staggering 1.1 Gbit/sec on a CPU. Techniques better suited to this sort of high-throughput processing are described, as well as pitfalls. The real-time analysis of data produced by these algorithms is used to identify sources of electronic noise and interference in the imaging spectrometer and to characterize the FPA. Additionally, the methods for optimizing the calculation routines used in the software, such as Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Dark Subtraction Filters (DSF), are described along with their applications. This software has been used to provide critical support for the testing of several imaging spectrometers, such as AVIRIS Next Generation(2), NEON-3(3), PRISM4 and CWIS5.

The Model Payload comprised a suite of science instruments, and was structured to meet the science objectives of the mission. The science objectives were defined in terms of a set of specific physical measurements that would need to be made, including quality attributes such as resolution, accuracy, coverage, etc. The Model Payload was designed to acquire these data with the required attributes. A set of notional instruments was chosen to be able to meet the full set of science objectives. Each notional instrument was based on current capabilities and technologies of actual, similar instruments, and modeled with enough detail to be able to estimate aspects of the instrument such as power usage, pointing stability needs, thermal accommodation needs, etc. This paper discusses the basis for the Model Payload and how it was used to develop the mission design, observation and data acquisition strategy, needed spacecraft capabilities, spacecraft-payload interface needs, mission system requirements, and operational scenarios. Then we present a comparison of the Model Payload to the actual payload, recently selected by NASA for the proposed Europa Mission. The focus is on how well this process enveloped and constrained the design space and guided the development and analysis of not only instrument requirements, but also those of the flight system and the mission operations system. Specifically, we discuss those areas in which the Selected Payload drove the mission design and which areas remained unchanged. Lastly, we present lessons learned from the use of a Model Payload.

Enhancing the Cassini Mission through FP Applications after Launch	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Although rigorous pre-emptive measures are taken to preclude failures and anomalous conditions from occurring in JPL spacecraft missions prior to launch, unforeseeable problems can still surface after liftoff. In the case of the Cassini/Huygens Mission-to-Saturn spacecraft, several problems were observed post-launch: 1) immediately after takeoff, the collected engineering/science data stored on the Solid State Recorders (SSR) contained a significantly higher number of corrupted bits than was expected (considerably over spec) due to human error in the memory mapping of these devices, 2) numerous Solid State Power Switches (SSPS) sporadically tripped off throughout the mission due to cosmic ray bombardment from the unique space environment, and 3) false assumptions in the pressure regulator design in combination with missing heritage test data led to inaccurate design conclusions, causing the issuance of two waivers for the regulator to close properly (a potentially mission catastrophic single-point failure which occurred 24 days after launch) amongst other problems. For Cassini, some of these anomalies led to arduous work-arounds or required continuous monitoring of telemetry variables by the ground-based Spacecraft Operations Flight Support (SOFS) team in order to detect and fix fault occurrences as they happened. Fortunately, sufficient funding and schedule margin allowed several Fault Protection (FP) solutions to be implemented into post-launch Flight Software (FSW) uploads to help resolve these issues autonomously, reducing SOFS ground support efforts while improving anomaly recovery time in order to preserve maximum science capture. This paper details the FP applications used to resolve the above issues as well as to optimize solutions for several other problems experienced by the Cassini spacecraft during its flight, in order to enhance the spacecraft's overall mission success throughout the 18 years of its 20 year expedition to and within the Saturnian system.

Mars-Moons Exploration, Reconnaissance, and Landed Investigation (MERLIN)	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			TAGISH LAKE METEORITE; TELEVISION OBSERVATIONS; SURFACE-COMPOSITION; TROJAN ASTEROIDS; IMAGING-SYSTEM; MARTIAN MOONS; IMPACT EJECTA; DUST BELTS; PHOBOS; ORIGIN	MERLIN, the Mars-Moons Exploration, Reconnaissance and Landed Investigation, is a concept for the first mission to land on the Martian moon Phobos and the first U.S. mission to conduct an in situ investigation of a D-type body typical of the outer solar system. Understanding Phobos and Deimos provides key information for understanding the history and evolution of our solar system and drives MERLIN's combined orbital and landed mission design. MERLIN would perform 9 months of orbital reconnaissance of Phobos and Deimos, characterizing their geology and a landing site on Phobos. Once landed, MERLIN would perform 90 days of complementary measurements of chemical and mineralogic composition. Phobos' size and mass provide a low-risk landing environment for a small-body lander. Controlled descent is so slow that the landing can be rehearsed and even repeated, yet gravity is high enough that surface operations do not require anchoring. Imaging of Phobos from past missions demonstrates the existence of regions suitable for landing and provides knowledge for planning the orbital and landed investigations. MERLIN's dual orbital and landed data would deliver seminal science directly traceable to NASA's Strategic Goals and Objectives, NASA's Science Plan, and Decadal Survey goals, while simultaneously closing strategic knowledge gaps (SKGs) to prepare for future human exploration. MERLIN's landed compositional measurements would unravel the origin of Mars' moons, addressing the goal to understand how solar system objects formed and evolved. MERLIN would determine the inventory of prebiotic materials on Phobos, addressing the goal focused on the distribution of volatiles and organics across the solar system, and the origin and requirements of life. MERLIN's high-resolution images during low flyovers would investigate processes that affect the local regolith and provide geologic context for landed measurements. MERLIN would characterize the geology, surface regolith, and internal structure of Mars' moons, addressing the goal to understand processes that shape planetary bodies, and how those processes operate and interact. MERLIN's combined remote and landed investigations would deliver pioneering data about Phobos, characterizing an object on the flexible path for human exploration.

The analysis capabilities presented in this paper include automated terrain classification, automated rock detection, digital elevation model (DEM) generation, and multi-ROI (region of interest) route planning. These analysis capabilities enable to fully utilize the vast volume of high-resolution orbiter imagery, quantitatively evaluate surface mobility requirements for each candidate site, and reject subjectivity in the comparison between sites in terms of engineering considerations. The analysis results supported the discussion in the Second Landing Site Workshop held in August 2015, which resulted in selecting eight candidate sites that will be considered in the third workshop.

The model is based on data from the Galileo spacecraft. Measurements of the high-energy, omni-directional electrons from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) and magnetic field from the Magnetometer (MAG) onboard Galileo are used for this purpose. Ten-minute averages of the EPD data are used to provide an omni-directional electron flux spectrum at 0.238, 0.416, 0.706, 1.5, 2.0, and 11.0 MeV. Additionally, data from the Geiger Tube Telescope onboard Pioneer 10 and 11 are used to calculate the flux of 31 MeV electrons. The Galileo Interim Radiation Electron model v.2 (GIRE2) combines these datasets with the original Divine model and synchrotron observations to estimate the trapped electron radiation environment. Unlike the original Divine model, which was based on flybys of the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft, the new GIRE2 model covers about 7 years of data and more than 30 orbits around Jupiter from the Galileo spacecraft. The model represents a step forward in the study of the Jovian radiation environment and is a valuable tool to assist in the design of future missions to Jupiter. This paper gives an overview of GIRE2 and focuses on its application to the design of the future NASA mission to Europa. The spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and perform multiple flybys of the moon Europa, which is embedded in the middle of a very strong radiation environment. The radiation environment surrounding the moon as well as along the trajectory are described in the paper together with the implications of this environment on the design of a mission.

This paper discusses the particular PHM-based solutions for some HH&P technologies that are, namely by NASA designation, the Autonomous Medical Decision technology and the Integrated Biomedical Informatics technology. Both of the technologies are identified as essential ones in NASA's integrated technology roadmap for the Technology Area 06: Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems. The proposed technology solutions are to bridge PHM, an engineering discipline, to HH&P domain in order to mitigate the risks by focusing on efforts to reduce countermeasure mass and volume and drive the risks down to an acceptable level. The Autonomous Medical Decision technology is based on wireless handheld devices and is a result of a paradigm shift from tele-medicine to that of health support autonomy. The Integrated Biomedical Informatics technology is based on Crew Electronic Health Records (CEHR) system with predictive diagnostics capability developed for crew members rather than for healthcare professionals. The paper explores the proposed PHM-based solutions on crew health maintenance in terms of predictive diagnostics providing early and actionable real-time warnings of impending health problems that otherwise would have gone undetected.

System-level power and data usage must be well understood and analyzed to verify design requirements. Numerous cross-disciplinary tools and analysis models are used to simulate the system-level spacecraft power and data behavior. This paper addresses the problem of orchestrating a consistent set of models, tools, and data in a unified analysis toolchain when ownership is distributed among numerous domain experts. An analysis and simulation environment was developed as a way to manage the complexity of the power and data analysis toolchain and to reduce the simulation turnaround time. A system model data repository is used as the trusted store of high-level inputs and results while other remote servers are used for archival of larger data sets and for analysis tool execution. Simulation data passes through numerous domain-specific analysis tools and end-to-end simulation execution is enabled through a web-based tool. The use of a cloud-based service facilitates coordination among distributed developers and enables scalable computation and storage needs, and ensures a consistent execution environment. Configuration management is emphasized to maintain traceability between current and historical simulation runs and their corresponding versions of models, tools and data.

In addition to having one of the brightest and youngest surfaces, this small Saturnian moon was recently discovered to have a plume erupting from its south polar terrain and a global subsurface ocean. The Cassini Mission discovered organics and nitrogen-bearing molecules in the plume, as well as salts and silicates that strongly suggest ocean water in contact with a rocky core. However, Cassini's instruments lack sufficient resolution and mass range to determine if these organics are of biotic origin. The Enceladus Life Finder (ELF) is a Discovery-class mission that would use two state-of-the-art mass spectrometers to target the gas and grains of the plume and search for evidence of life in this alien ocean.

We describe an in-flight pointing calibration model to aid the design and analysis of large aperture spacecraft telecommunications systems and to inform requirements on the spacecraft attitude control system (ACS) and ground support equipment. Understanding the expected residual in-flight antenna pointing calibration error allows the determination of the potential need for alternative methods to aid spacecraft high gain antenna pointing. The physically based time domain model incorporates both ground station and spacecraft contributions to the residual in-flight pointing calibration error. Spacecraft contributions are dominated by antenna pointing deviations from the commanded pointing positions due to spacecraft ACS performance limitations. The treatment of residual calibration error within a spacecraft's high gain antenna pointing budget is analyzed. The interpretation of in-flight calibration results is discussed. NASA's Europa mission is used as an example to evaluate the utility of this model for future large aperture deep space missions. The mission proposes to fly a 3-m Ka-band high gain antenna for science data return to Earth. Using typical assumptions for ground and spacecraft performance a 3-s residual pointing calibration error of 0.20 mrad is obtained.

It was launched on January 31, 2015 from Vandenberg AFB upon a Delta II 7320 launch vehicle. Due to external considerations, SMAP's launch vehicle selection remained an open item until Project Critical Design Review (CDR). Thus, certain key aspects of the spacecraft design had to accommodate a diverse range of candidate launch vehicle environments, performance envelopes, interfaces and operational scenarios. Engineering challenges stemmed from two distinct scenarios: decisions that had to be made prior to launch vehicle selection to accommodate all possible outcomes, and post-selection changes constrained by schedule and the existing spacecraft configuration. The effects of the timing of launch vehicle selection reached virtually every aspect of the Observatory's design and development. Physical environments, mass allocations, material selections, propulsion system performance, dynamic response, launch phase and mission planning, overall size and configuration, and of course all interfaces to the launch vehicle were heavily dependent on this outcome. This paper will discuss the resolution of these technical challenges.

Dual-Frequency and Dual-Polarization Antenna Array for Satellite Deployment	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The development of an aperture coupled microstrip dual-band and dual-polarization 6x6 antenna array system on RO4003C is presented. The antenna array has a multilayer structure that consists of square microstrip elements, placed on each substrate layer to provide dual frequency operation at 14 and 35 GHz. Dual polarization is achieved by using two right-angled microstrip lines and two perpendicular slots to feed the antennas. The microstrip feed line is placed orthogonally from the center of the slot on the ground plane between the substrates. The energy from the microstrip feed line is aperture coupled to each square antenna element through the slot. Two right-angled non-overlapping slots are used on each antenna to enable the two different polarization states. The antenna array has 14 GHz patches on the top substrate layer and 35 GHz patches on the lower substrate layer in order to maintain a similar percentage bandwidth. The microstrip feed lines are located at the bottom of the feed substrate. A symmetric feed structure is followed for the antenna array. The aperture coupling feeding network has the advantage of reduced spurious radiation compared to edge or probe feeds as it utilized highly linearly polarized feed lines and slots, and a large ground plane to prevent backside radiation. The designed antenna array has linear polarization at 45-degrees and 135-degrees at the Ku- and Ka- frequency bands. The array is designed using a hybrid simulation scheme in Keysight Advance Design System (ADS). The ADS Schematic is used for the feed network while the ADS Momentum is used for the antenna elements and the entire array structure simulations. In this way, all aspects of the design (microstrip antenna elements and feed lines) can be optimized independently. This array is suitable for airborne (small remotely piloted), and small-satellite NASA flight programs.

While there have been several successful autonomous rendezvous and docking flight systems, a compact and standardized solution for the retrieval of very small passive objects has yet to be demonstrated. Development of a notional standard, on-orbit sample capture/return architecture would not only enable NASA missions such as potential Mars Sample Return and lunar sample return, but it could also minimize the cost and risks associated with those future missions. The testbed presented in this paper was designed for the Space Rendezvous And Capture Competition (Space RACE), a candidate competition being developed for NASA Centennial Challenges. The competition, in which competitors would build mobile robotic platforms to autonomously chase and capture a mock Orbital Sample (OS), emulates major aspects of proposed on-orbit sample capture: locating and tracking a passive target using limited fiducials, developing an approach algorithm, grappling the target, and manipulating the target for insertion into a notional Sample Return Capsule. These elements would also be pertinent to orbital debris cleanup and terrestrial applications such as warehouse packaging and autonomous harvesting. A prototype was built and successfully used to test the Space RACE concept. The prototype consists of a flat, circular track 17m in diameter, four PulsON 410 Ultra Wideband ranging radios, and a four-wheeled robotic platform called the OS-Bot. An on-board autonomous controller uses the ranging radios in the prototype to calculate the position of the OS-Bot in real-time and follow a predefined, arbitrary path. This method of navigation avoids the use of track-fixed fiducials and allows the simulation of any orbital scenario. The system also supports mounting of additional radios on competitor platforms, allowing for minimally invasive monitoring of competitor position and velocity. These aspects both prevent competitors from merely "line-following" to the OS and allow the simulation of numerous mission scenarios which approximate orbital dynamics. Results are presented in this paper for the successful testing of this platform using low resolution sensors in an environment subject to frequent multi-path ranging errors. In addition, a filter is presented which could improve the response of the controller and deliver more robust operation.

In order to minimize shielding mass, an efficient layout of electronics within the vault is necessary to keep shielding area to a minimum while providing protection from the severe radiation environment surrounding Jupiter. Tight placement of internal electronics can, however, result in integration difficulties due to access problems for mounting hardware, routing constraints for harness management and vault wall penetrations, as well as thermal requirements for the enclosed electronics. Each of these aspects play into the configurations and integration requirements of the baseline Europa project vault. In order to study the potential geometries for the vault, conceptual physical models have been constructed, as well as multiple CAD based geometries in order to study potential layout configurations. These configurations have leveraged prior mission experience from the Curiosity rover as well as the JUNO radiation vault.

S	Sturm, EJ			IEEE	Sturm, Erick J., II			Contingency Planning for Cassini's Final Mission Phase	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				During the eleven years that the Cassini spacecraft has spent in Saturn orbit, it has flown throughout the Saturnian System. One place it has never been, however, is between Saturn's rings and atmosphere, which is exactly where it is headed for its final months. Two environmental factors pose a risk to the spacecraft in this region: D Ring dust and thermosphere density. Dust particle impacts could potentially damage sensitive components of the spacecraft or instruments. High thermospheric densities could cause the spacecraft to lose attitude control and tumble. Fortunately, these factors are anticorrelated; dust particle counts increase with radial distance whereas atmospheric density decreases, leaving a corridor of reduced risk between the rings and atmosphere. While this corridor reduces risk to the spacecraft, it does not eliminate it. Additional risk reduction could be had by restricting the spacecraft to certain orientations while within the corridor; however, this would come at the expense of science, as the safest orientations do not point the instruments in preferred directions. As such, a compromise must be achieved between risk reduction and science satisfaction. The Cassini Project maintains environmental contingency plans to respond to the uncertainties in the proximal corridor: the dustiness of the D ring and the thickness of the thermosphere. The contingency plans allow the nominal flight plan to use science-friendly orientations while within the corridor, which could then be superseded by a safer orientation should a contingency need to be invoked. This paper describes the contingency plans for dealing with deviations from the predicted environment in the proximal corridor. Moreover, it details the predicted environments, methods for detecting deviations from the predictions, the nominal flight plan, and the method for implementing the contingency responses into the spacecraft activity sequence.

Column-Grid-Array (CGA) Technology Could Lead to a Highly Reliable Package Design	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			FATIGUE LIFE PREDICTION; SOLDER; RELIABILITY; SNAGCU; MODELS	An analytical stress model is developed for a short cylinder (beam) with clamped and offset ends. The offset is caused by an external lateral force that has to be determined from the known offset. It is envisioned that such a beam can adequately mimic the stresses and strains in a column of a column-grid-array (CGA) solder joint interconnection. Such an interconnection is characterized by an elevated stand-off height of the solder joints compared to the joints in a widely used today ball-grid-array (BGA) system. In a simplified and conservative analysis the ends offset in a CGA joint can be determined beforehand as a product of the known thermal mismatch strain between the IC package and the printed circuit board (PCB), and the position of the joint with respect to the package mid-cross-section. The objective of our analysis is to use the developed model to demonstrate that the application of CGA technology enables one not only to significantly relieve the thermally induced stresses in the solder material, but to do that to an extent that the induced stresses remain within the elastic range. The analysis is limited therefore to elastic deformations. It should be emphasized that while the classical Timoshenko short-beam theory seeks the beam's deflections caused by the combined bending and shear deformations for the given loading, an inverse problem is considered here: the lateral force and the induced stresses are sought for the given end offset. In short beams this force is larger than in long beams, since, in order to achieve the given displacement (offset), the applied force has to overcome both bending and shear resistance of the beam. The carried out analysis and the numerical data indicate that by employing beam-like CGA solder joints one could possibly manage to remain within the elastic range, i.e. to avoid inelastic strains and, hence, low cycle fatigue conditions. If this is achievable, the fatigue lifetime of the solder material will increase dramatically, because the low-cycle fatigue condition will be replaced by the linear accumulation of elastic damages. The numerical example indicates that the stand-off of the CGA joint should be rather large to make the shearing stress low compared to the normal bending stress. The height-to-diameter ratio of the CGA joint should be increased to the level of about 12-13. In such a situation the Bernoulli beam model, could be used instead of Timoshenko model for stress evaluations. The further increase in the stand-off height over this ratio, even if it is technologically achievable, is not advisable, since this will not lead to an appreciable further stress reduction. Future work will include, but might not be limited to, the finite-element-analysis (FEA) computations and experimental evaluations (such as, e.g., shear-off testing and/or temperature cycling) of the induced stresses in, and the fatigue lifetime of, typical BGA and novel CGA joints. We would like to point out that a solder joint in isolation is neither reliable nor unreliable, and that reliability has meaning only in the context of interconnections either within package or outside of package onto PCB. For this reason the future work should include also better understanding of how to translate the stress relief in a single joint into the improved reliability of an interconnection as a whole, thereby leading to a highly-reliable solder joint interconnections and, since these interconnections are the bottle-neck of the today's IC packaging technologies, to a highly reliable package design as a whole. Particularly, for BGA/CGA package assemblies, it is critical to determine the effective offset values for the peripheral joints.

This system of ground software is able to build commands, validate them, and radiate the commands to the spacecraft, all without human interaction. In the case of an off-nominal scenario, the system will abort gracefully and notify the mission operations team of the problem. The system was phased into operations during the first three months of the SMAP mission and handles over 90% of the weekly commanding of the vehicle. The gradual introduction of the automation in flight, along with an extensive test campaign, was instrumental in the success of the software. The automation has enabled substantial efficiencies in operations team staffing and has improved reliability by removing the potential for human error. The system also allows the SMAP project to be more responsive which has shown significant benefits in areas of data latency and science accuracy.

S	Tirona, J			IEEE	Tirona, Joseph			On the Maneuvers Operational Response for NASA's Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) Mission	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Soil-Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) spacecraft requires various kinds of in-orbit maneuvers over the course of its three-year mission. The types of maneuvers include pre-planned commissioning maneuvers to reach its science orbit, regularly executed orbit maintenance maneuvers to overcome drag and other nominally occurring phenomena, as well as (the possibility of) collision avoidance maneuvers. The architecture of the spacecraft - in terms of availability of commanding via ground assets, the inherited avionics' ability to sequence and execute commands, and the capability of available subsystems able to carry out maneuvers - was well defined early in the development of the spacecraft and mission, well before the operational plan for responding to maneuver requests was cemented. [2] The systems engineering challenge became: how to accommodate all three types of maneuvers in the confines of this well-defined architecture. This paper will describe how the operations team on SMAP successfully met this challenge. Specifically, it will dive into the three pronged approach that SMAP developed to handle each type of maneuver described above - to meet the timeliness requirements leveraged on the operations team to execute said maneuvers, while continuing to fit within the allotted staffing profile during nominal operations. Defining this paradigm to fit the mission's architecture meant re-defining the original paradigm, (planned maneuvers being thought of separately than collision avoidance maneuvers), and re-classifying all responses to maneuver requests as variations and permutations of a singular operational response to a maneuver request. This paper will also describe the tools that were created to simplify the human interface and automate as much of the response as was possible. Finally, this paper will describe, at a very high level, some of the problems encountered and lessons learned by the operations team when this process was executed the first four times during the first ninety days of operations. Though the architecture of the operations team's response to maneuver requests will never be repeated exactly, the flexibility that was inserted via redefining the scope of the problem and by redefining the human interfaces should influence future projects' architectures earlier in their development -in the hopes that said influence will save time and money in the future.

S	Tung, RH			IEEE	Tung, Ramona H.			Development of Effective and Efficient Operations for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is an earth orbiting mission which launched 1/31/2015, successfully completed an aggressive Commissioning plan, and is currently collecting Science data. A 90-day, activity-rich Launch and Commissioning Phase required 7 days per week operations with heavy staffing. It was followed by a steep ramp down to a very small operations team performing mostly unattended ("lights out") operations. Completing Commissioning ahead of schedule despite major inflight anomalies was made possible by transitioning development experts into operations, preparing sequences for all baseline activities and selected contingency scenarios prior to Launch, and developing tools to streamline routine activities (sequence generation/validation, data management, telemetry query and reporting, long term trending). Powerful operations analysis tools coupled with development experience allowed the team to quickly troubleshoot, work around, and recover from a variety of significant anomalies (including several safemode entries) and still maintain schedule. To enable lights out operation, SMAP developed a reliable infrastructure relying heavily on automation. Orbit determination was successfully automated to simplify Navigation. Automatic command generation and radiation was implemented for benign routine commanding. This capability was phased in during Commissioning, and now accounts for 95-100% of SMAP commanding during the week. SMAP also developed reliable autonomous monitoring and notification systems for non-receipt of data, detection of anomalous data, and auto-commanding failures. Upon detection of problems, SMAP uses a role-based email/text notification tool to disposition anomalies. These capabilities allow the SMAP mission operations center to be largely unattended. System engineers are cross-trained to perform numerous tasks including command radiation, scheduling, and sequence integration and testing. Choosing simplification over optimization allows most tasks to be performed by a handful of people. These are some of the efficiencies that have enabled successful small team operations in the Science Phase.

Trajectory studies, for the current range of potential MAV payloads, evaluated performance using propulsion systems in the 2.5 kN to 4.5kN (600-1000 lbf) thrust range. The current study examined several propulsion system approaches, solid rocket, bi-propellant and hybrid propulsion systems and developed a ranking based on several key figures of merit. This paper details the trades conducted for the two bi-propellant propulsion systems considered for a potential MAV. Historically bi-propellant propulsion systems have been considered for this application, however the desire to minimize development risk resulted in solid rocket options being selected as the baseline configuration. This study takes a fresh look at both a conventional pressure fed bi-propellant propulsion system and a new technology development using a small electrically driven pump fed bi-propellant propulsion system. A detailed design and mass breakdown for both a pressure fed and a low- complexity electrically driven pump fed (EDPF) propulsion system for a potential MAV were generated. The results showed that the EDPF system although lower in technology readiness level (TRL) provided performance, mass and packaging benefits that ranked EPDF higher than a conventional pressure fed system.

Engineering Change Activity Analysis of Space Mission Projects	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Engineering changes and their propagation through a system provide insight into the complexity of a system. In an effort to identify systematic trends, we have analyzed two very different JPL-led space mission projects to classify the change activity and assess change propagation. The projects selected are a Mars lander mission, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), and an Earth-orbiting mission, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). Change in space system development is recorded with engineering change requests (ECRs). ECRs can be regarded as an indicator of the progression of work. We employ time analysis of ECR initiation throughout the lifecycle, correlate ECR generators with ECR absorbers, and consider the distribution of ECRs across subsystems. Further, we analyze ECR-document and ECR-ECR networks to assess project interaction. These analyses give us insight into the similarities and differences between these projects. For both SMAP and MSL, similar subsystems generate or absorb change. However, SMAP followed a progression in which change was damped over time, whereas MSL often saw acceleration of change. The two projects also differed with regard to change management, with SMAP using a hierarchical approach while MSL interactions were more widely distributed.

One of the main uses of an architecture description is to serve as a basis for analyzing how well the architecture achieves its quality attributes, and that requires architects to be as precise as possible about what they mean in claiming, for example, that an architecture supports "modifiability." This paper describes a table, generated by NASA's Software Architecture Review Board, which lists fourteen key quality attributes, identifies different important aspects of each quality attribute and considers each aspect in terms of requirements, rationale, evidence, and tactics to achieve the aspect. This quality attribute table is intended to serve as a guide to software architects, software developers, and software architecture reviewers in the domain of mission-criticalreal-time embedded systems, such as space mission flight software.

Nevertheless, observational gaps remain and thermal satellite imagery has proven useful in Hawai`i for providing synoptic views of activity during intervals between field visits. Here we describe the beginning of a thermal remote sensing programme at the US Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO). Whereas expensive receiving stations have been traditionally required to achieve rapid downloading of satellite data, we exploit free, low-latency data sources on the internet for timely access to GOES, MODIS, ASTER and EO-1 ALI imagery. Automated scripts at the observatory download these data and provide a basic display of the images. Satellite data have been extremely useful for monitoring the ongoing lava flow activity on Kilauea's East Rift Zone at Pu`u `O`o over the past few years. A recent lava flow, named Kahauale `a2, was upslope from residential subdivisions for over a year. Satellite data helped track the slow advance of the flow and contributed to hazard assessments. Ongoing improvement to thermal remote sensing at HVO incorporates automated hotspot detection, effusion rate estimation and lava flow forecasting, as has been done in Italy. These improvements should be useful for monitoring future activity on Mauna Loa.	[Patrick, M.

This design consists of a digitalized flow control valve with multipath and multistage pressure reduction structures. Specifically, the valve is configured as a set of parallel flow paths from the inlet to the outlet. A choke valve controls the total flow rate by digitally opening different paths or different combination of the paths. Each path is controlled by a poppet cap valve basically operated in on-off states. The number of flow states is 2(N) where N is the number of flow paths. To avoid erosion from sand in the fluid and high speed flow, the seal area of the poppet cap valve is located at a distance from the flow inlet away from the high speed flow and the speed is controlled to stay below a predefined erosion safe limit. The path is a multistage structure composed of a set of serial nozzles-expansion chambers that equally distribute the total pressure drop to each stage. The pressure drop of each stage and, therefore, the flow speed at the nozzles and expansion chambers is controlled by the number of stages. The paths have relatively small cross section and could be relatively long for large number of stages and still fit in a strict annular space limit. The paper will present the design configuration, analysis and preliminary test results.

An inkjet printed, roll-coated digital microfluidic device for inexpensive, miniaturized diagnostic assays	LAB ON A CHIP			English	Article							SOLAR-CELLS; LOW-COST; PAPER; RUBELLA; SURVEILLANCE; FABRICATION; IMMUNITY; PLATFORM; THERAPY; URINE	The diagnosis of infectious disease is typically carried out at the point-of-care (POC) using the lateral flow assay (LFA). While cost-effective and portable, LFAs often lack the clinical sensitivity and specificity required for accurate diagnoses. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new digital microfluidic (DMF) platform fabricated using a custom inkjet printing and roll-coating process that is scalable to mass production. The performance of the new devices is on par with that of traditional DMF devices fabricated in a cleanroom, with a materials cost for the new devices of only US $0.63 per device. To evaluate the usefulness of the new platform, we performed a 13-step rubella virus (RV) IgG immunoassay on the inkjet printed, roll-coated devices, which yielded a limit of detection of 0.02 IU mL(-1), well below the diagnostic cut-off of 10 IU mL(-1) for RV infection and immunity. We propose that this represents a breakthrough for DMF, lowering the costs to a level such that the new platforms will be an attractive alternative to LFAs for the diagnosis of infectious disease at the POC.

Localized Summability Kernels for Jacobi Expansions	MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS, APPROXIMATION THEORY AND THEIR APPLICATIONS	Springer Optimization and Its Applications		English	Article; Book Chapter						Jacobi expansions; Localized kernels; Jacobi translates; Product formulas	POLYNOMIAL OPERATORS; CONSERVATION-LAWS	While the direct and converse theorems of approximation theory enable us to characterize the smoothness of a function f : [-1, 1] -> R in terms of its degree of polynomial approximation, they do not account for local smoothness. The use of localized summability kernels leads to a wavelet-like representation, using the Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of f, so as to characterize the smoothness of f in a neighborhood of each point in terms of the behavior of the terms of this representation. In this paper, we study the localization properties of a class of kernels, which have explicit forms in the "space domain," and establish explicit bounds on the Lebesgue constants on the summability kernels corresponding to some of these.

Prior co-design work typically assume a control system in the classic state space form, and thus compromise the range of applicability. This paper considers co-design for control systems in the linear descriptor form, with the purpose to minimize the H-2 norm of a closed-loop transfer function. We demonstrate that the gradient of the cost function with respect to plant parameters can be computed analytically, and thus extend the previous gradient-based co-design algorithm to the linear descriptor system case.

Phase 1 of the project focused on design trades and cost analyses leading to a cost-optimized self powered autonomous tracking heliostat concept with a mirror surface area in the 100m(2) range. In Phase 2 30-year accelerated testing of the mirror modules based on ReflecTec film with 94% specular reflectivity bonded on composite foam substrate were initiated and completed in Phase 3. The tests with 15 coupons showed optical performance degradation of less than 5% in specular reflectance following 30-year equivalent UV testing and other abuse testing such as acid rain, bird dropping, thermal cycling, etc. A small scale prototype (3mx2m) heliostat design based on modular truss elements with removable mirror modules was developed in detail. In this phase components such as the dual-axis actuators were sized and selected based on wind load requirements and pointing accuracy demands were completed. Finite Element analyses for the mechanical structure with mirror modules were performed using three separate commercial codes - ANSYS, COMSOL and Solid Works to validate the optical errors induced by wind loads on the structure up to 35 mph. Results indicated that the RMS deflections contributed to less than 0.4 mrad pointing error. Dynamic response of the heliostat indicated that the first 5 eigenmodes were in the 17-20 Hz range. The individual structure elements such as the trusses and c-rails were fabricated locally and assembled with the mirror facets in the lab for initial fit check and testing. The nine mirror facet surface errors were characterized using photogrammetry and verified using Reverse Hartmann techniques and showed to be in the order of 1 mrad or less. A three-level controller (main, gateway and heliostat) was architected and built. Tracking of the sun is done using NREL's Sun Tracking Algorithm implemented in the gateway controller. Target-pointing vectors are calculated for each heliostat and conveyed wirelessly to the individual heliostat controllers for actuating the azimuth and elevation motors. The power subsystem consisting of solar panels and a battery provide 24V for the actuators and controller boards. The system was sized to provide adequate power for a period of Shrs of operation when power is not available. Initial calibration will be performed with on-site camera tracking the sun's image on a target located approximately 52m from the heliostat. Testing of the heliostat pointing under calm and windy conditions will be done to demonstrate overall performance that meet DOE targets of 4 mrad under 27mph winds. Commercialization efforts are underway to transition the design to the commercial sector. The project is well on its way to approaching overall cost targets and current estimates are approximately $90-110/m(2) and lower costs can be achieved with alternates to the film we have identified.

M. Keck Observatory (WMKO) since it began operations in 1994, including data from eight active instruments and two decommissioned instruments. The archive is a collaboration between WMKO and the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI). Since its inception in 2004, the science information system used at KOA has adopted an architectural approach that emphasizes software re-use and adaptability. This paper describes how KOA is currently leveraging and extending open source software components to develop new services and to support delivery of a complete set of instrument metadata, which will enable more sophisticated and extensive queries than currently possible. In August 2015, KOA deployed a program interface to discover public data from all instruments equipped with an imaging mode. The interface complies with version 2 of the Simple Imaging Access Protocol (SIAP), under development by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), which defines a standard mechanism for discovering images through spatial queries. The heart of the KOA service is an R-tree-based, database-indexing mechanism prototyped by the Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO) and further developed by the Montage Image Mosaic project, designed to provide fast access to large imaging data sets as a first step in creating wide-area image mosaics (such as mosaics of subsets of the 4.7 million images of the SDSS DR9 release). The KOA service uses the results of the spatial R-tree search to create an SQLite data database for further relational filtering. The service uses a JSON configuration file to describe the association between instrument parameters and the service query parameters, and to make it applicable beyond the Keck instruments. The images generated at the Keck telescope usually do not encode the image footprints as WCS fields in the FITS file headers. Because SIAP searches are spatial, much of the effort in developing the program interface involved processing the instrument and telescope parameters to understand how accurately we can derive the WCS information for each instrument. This knowledge is now being fed back into the KOA databases as part of a program to include complete metadata information for all imaging observations. The R-tree program was itself extended to support temporal (in addition to spatial) indexing, in response to requests from the planetary science community for a search engine to discover observations of Solar System objects. With this 3D-indexing scheme, the service performs very fast time and spatial matches between the target ephemerides, obtained from the JPL SPICE service. Our experiments indicate these matches can be more than 100 times faster than when separating temporal and spatial searches. Images of the tracks of the moving targets, overlaid with the image footprints, are computed with a new command-line visualization tool, mViewer, released with the Montage distribution. The service is currently in test and will be released in late summer 2016.	[Berriman, G.

As a science exploration framework, the Data Lab allow users to access and search databases containing large (i.e. terabyte-scale) catalogs, visualize, analyze, and store the results of these searches, combine search results with data from other archives or facilities, and share these results with collaborators using a shared workspace and/or data publication service. In the process of implementing the needed tools and services, specific science cases are used to guide development of the system framework and tools. The result is a Year-1 capability demonstration that ( fully or partially) implements each of the major architecture components in the context of a real-world science use-case. In this paper, we discuss how this model of science-driven development helped us to build a fully functional system capable of executing the chosen science case, and how we plan to scale this system to support general use in the next phase of the project.

A key component of them is a distributed storage system to enable data hosting, sharing, and publication. VOSpacel is a lightweight interface providing network access to arbitrary backend storage solutions and endorsed by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). Although similar APIs exist, such as Amazon S3, WebDav, and Dropbox, VOSpace is designed to be protocol agnostic, focusing on data control operations, and supports asynchronous and third -party data transfers, thereby minimizing unnecessary data transfers. It also allows arbitrary computations to be triggered as a result of a transfer operation: for example, a file can be automatically ingested into a database when put into an active directory or a data reduction task, such as Sextractor, can be run on it. In this paper, we shall describe the VOSpace implementations that we have developed for the NOAO Data Lab. These offer both dedicated remote storage, accessible as a local file system via FUSE, and a local VOSpace service to easily enable data synchronization.

Since there are only two MMRTG electrically-heated thermoelectric generators (ETG) available for testing, a Test Plan Development Working Group was established to determine and prioritize the performance testing that is being conducted with the Engineering Unit (EU) and Qualification Unit (QU) ETGs. This working group is comprised of subject matter experts from the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC), NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), UDRI, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Teledyne Energy Systems. The highest priority testing was concluded by the working group to be: 1) To determine the impact of thermal cycling on thermoelectric components by characterizing the evolution of the thermoelectric/electrical properties of the EU as a result of thermal cycling the ETG through a Martian Sol repeatedly; 2) to characterize the effect of a simulated cruise-phase environment on the QU by evaluating the change in performance of the ETG before and after a cruise-phase simulation; and 3) characterize and clear any potential MMRTG internal shorts to chassis by integrating the JPL derived active short technique between the internal electrical power circuit and chassis frame of the MMRTG. The data and risk mitigation techniques derived from this testing can potentially be incorporated into future missions that would employ the MMRTG or successor thermoelectric radioisotope power systems.

(TESI) has been providing reliable power to the Mars Curiosity Rover since its launch in 2011 (Mission on Mars began in August 2012). An improvement of the performance of the MMRTG is underway at TESI through a technology maturation program where higher efficiency skutterudite materials developed on the laboratory scale at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are being further developed at the production level into "flight-ready" materials and components. The success of this project will result in an enhanced MMRTG (eMMRTG) with an anticipated improvement of 25-30% in the beginning-of-life power and even greater improvement by end-of-life due to improved thermoelectric life properties. The status of the program, including engineering challenges, successes and current production capabilities will be presented.

They have consistently demonstrated their extraordinary reliability and longevity (38 years of continuous operation for MHW-RTG on Voyager), relying on materials and device technologies developed in the 1960's and 1970's. The NASA Radioisotope Power Systems Program's Thermoelectric Technology Development Project (TTDP) is pursuing the development of more efficient thermoelectric technologies that can increase performance (conversion efficiency and specific power) by a factor of 2 to 4X over heritage systems. The TTDP's Advanced ThermoElectric Couple (ATEC) task has been advancing a new set of high performance materials and segmented device technologies that would offer a factor of 2 increase in conversion efficiency over Si-Ge alloys used in the GPHS-RTG. These materials, p-type Yb14MnSb11 and n-type La3-XTe4 segmented with p- and n-type filled skutterudites, have demonstrated stable performance over two years of testing. Proof-of-principle segmented devices have achieved conversion efficiencies of up to 15% at beginning-of-life when tested in a vacuum environment at hot-junction temperature up to 1273K and a cold-junction temperature of 473K. ATEC is now focusing on developing high reliability, long life components and devices, including scale-up processing of materials with enhanced mechanical robustness, fabrication of metallized leg segments and chemically and mechanically stable hot side interfaces, as well as mechanically compliant segmented multicouple device configurations. Such devices could enable the development of more capable RTGs, including modular system architectures.

Hot Surface Ignition of n-Hexane Mixtures Using Simplified Kinetics	COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						n-Hexane; Hot surface ignition; Industrial safety; Simplified kinetics	AIR MIXTURES; THERMAL-IGNITION; TEMPERATURE; OXIDATION; REACTOR; FLOWS; LAYER	Hot surface ignition is relevant in the context of industrial safety. In the present work, two-dimensional simulations using simplified kinetics of the buoyancy-driven flow and ignition of a slightly lean n-hexane-air mixture by a rapidly heated surface (glowplug) are reported. Experimentally, ignition is most often observed to occur at the top of the glowplug; numerical results reproduce this trend and shed light on this behavior. The numerical predictions of the flow field and hot surface temperature at ignition are in quantitative agreement with experiments. The simulations suggest that flow separation plays a crucial role in creating zones where convective losses are minimized and heat diffusion is maximized, resulting in the critical conditions for ignition to take place.

Experiments were performed to measure the minimum surface temperature for ignition of a propagating flame and nonreactive two-dimensional simulations were performed to estimate the temperature a parcel of fluid experiences as it travels within the thermal boundary layer near the surface of the sphere. Reactive simulations using detailed reaction models and a one-step model were used to investigate the chemical reaction dynamics in a constant pressure reactor with a variable heat transfer coefficient, which reproduces the temperature history. It was found that, under the specific conditions studied, the chemistry is activated at T > 1000 K with no noticeable impact of the low-temperature chemical pathways.

Sub-amorphous thermal conductivity in amorphous heterogeneous nanocomposites	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							COMPUTER-SIMULATION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SILICON NANOTUBES; SOLIDS; THERMOELECTRICS; PERFORMANCE; SI; GLASSES; ALLOYS; LIMIT	Pure amorphous solids are traditionally considered to set the lower bound of thermal conductivity due to their disordered atomic structure that impedes vibrational energy transport. However, the lower limits for thermal conductivity in heterogeneous amorphous solids and the physical mechanisms underlying these limits remain unclear. Here, we use equilibrium molecular dynamics to show that an amorphous SiGe nanocomposite can possess thermal conductivity substantially lower than those of the amorphous Si and Ge constituents. Normal mode analysis indicates that the presence of the Ge inclusion localizes vibrational modes with frequency above the Ge cutoff in the Si host, drastically reducing their ability to transport heat. This observation suggests a general route to achieve exceptionally low thermal conductivity in fully dense solids by restricting the vibrational density of states available for transport in heterogeneous amorphous nanocomposites.

These systems arise as discrete isomonodromic deformations of systems of linear difference equations in which the associated Lax matrices are presented in a factored form. A system of discrete isomonodromic deformations is completely determined by commutation relations between the factors. We also reparameterize these systems in terms of the image and kernel vectors at singular points to obtain a separate birational form. A distinguishing feature of this study is the presence of a symmetry condition on the associated linear problems that only appears as a necessary feature of the Lax pairs for the least degenerate discrete Painleve equations.

Our results are as follows. First, the cross-pol volumetric coherence's unwrapped phase grows identically to co-pol volumetric coherence unwrapped phase in the strong subsurface wave guidance regime. Second, unlike co-pol volumetric correlation's inverse proportionality to InSAR baseline in this regime, said multiplicity can cause cross-pol volumetric correlation to degrade faster (inverse quadratic) versus baseline. Summarizing, the cross-pol and co-pol volumetric coherences can exhibit very different sensitivities to subsurface scatter, encouraging their combined exploitation for remote sensing of layered, penetrable media.

The images considered are from the 2010 BioSAR campaign on Remningstorp forest in Sweden. As a first step, we propose a pixel to pixel coregistration method of the images, and we assess the accuracy of this coregistration. Then, we propose descriptors for a given pixel, for each type of images. The primary challenge is to find features that go beyond the difference of geometrical configurations between the two types of information, and also that compensate the effect of the incidence angle on radar observables. As of today, we propose to analyse the combination of PolInSAR and lidar feature in order to see their variations depending on radar acquisition conditions and scatterer properties. We also test a support vector regression on two selected radar and lidar feature in order to draw some conclusions and improvements points.

Our scattering model quantifies the effects, on InSAR coherence, of subsurface layers guiding the incident wave via a succession of internal, specular reflections ("multi-bounce"). As the paper's first contribution, we reveal that multi-bounce engenders "interferometric" resonances that induce deep, periodic degradation (versus InSAR baseline length) of correlation. Second, the correlation's periodic variation versus InSAR spatial baseline, with period length invariant to variations in subsurface properties, allows robust multi-baseline extraction of subsurface topography.

InSAR measurements of subsidence in the Central Valley, California from 2007-present	11TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (EUSAR 2016)	EUSAR Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (EUSAR)	JUN 07-09, 2016	Hamburg, GERMANY	ITG, VDE, AIRBUS, Fraunhofer, DLR, EUREL, URSI, DGON, IEEE GRSS, IEEE AESS, TIMES Microwave Syst, GLOBES Elektronik GMBH & CO KG			SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; LAND SUBSIDENCE; LAS-VEGAS	Subsidence caused by groundwater pumping in the rich agricultural area of California's Central Valley has been a problem for decades. Over the last few years, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations from satellite and aircraft platforms have been used to produce maps of subsidence with cm accuracy. For this study, we have obtained and analyzed Japanese PALSAR data for 2007 - 2011 and Radarsat-2 data for 2014 - 2015. We are currently processing data from the Canadian Radarsat-1 for 2011 - 2013, and ESA's Sentinel-1A for 2015 - present. As multiple scenes were acquired during these periods, we can also produce histories of subsidence at selected locations and transects showing how subsidence varies both spatially and temporally. Geographic Information System (GIS) files have been furnished to decision-makers at the California Department of Water Resources to enable better management of groundwater resources and for further analysis of the 4 dimensional subsidence time-series maps.

These measurements revolutionized our understanding of the geomorphology, geology and geophysical processes that have shaped the evolution of the surface of Venus. However, the lack of finer resolution topography of the surface than that obtained by the Magellan mission has hampered the definitive answer to key questions concerning the processes and evolution of the surface of Venus. Cratering, surface/atmospheric interactions, volcanism and interior dynamics, to name a few, all leave their imprint on the relief of planetary surfaces in grandiose (e.g., Maxwell Montes on Venus) to subtle fashion (e.g., quasi-circular depressions on Mars). Though significant morphological work and interpretation can be done in the absence of topographic data, major assumptions and uncertainties likely remain. As part of the Magellan mission approximately 25% of the planet was mapped in radar stereo. We describe a newly NASA funded effort to systematically process all the Magellan stereo data using a rigorous stereo sensor model and automated matching routines. These results are compared to previous stereo results and some possible science applications of the stereo results are presented.

Global retrieval of surface soil moisture using L-band SMAP SAR data and its validation	11TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (EUSAR 2016)	EUSAR Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (EUSAR)	JUN 07-09, 2016	Hamburg, GERMANY	ITG, VDE, AIRBUS, Fraunhofer, DLR, EUREL, URSI, DGON, IEEE GRSS, IEEE AESS, TIMES Microwave Syst, GLOBES Elektronik GMBH & CO KG				Surface soil moisture retrievals using radar observations have been challenging due to the strong effects by surface roughness and vegetation scattering. Physically-based forward models for radar scattering are inverted using time-series retrieval algorithm to systematically correct for the effect of the roughness and vegetation. The retrievals are performed for a top 5-cm layer soil moisture at 3-km spatial resolution using the L-band radar data acquired by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite globally every three days from mid-April to early July, 2015. These were assessed over 13 rigorously-chosen core validation sites covering a wide range of biomass types and amounts and soil conditions. The soil moisture retrieval performance had an accuracy of approaching the goal of 0.063 m(3)/m(3) unbiased-RMSE (root mean square error), a near zero bias, and a correlation of 0.56. The successful retrieval demonstrates that the physically-based retrieval method is capable of characterizing soil moisture over diverse conditions of soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation on a global scale.

We know that these "twin" planets formed with similar bulk composition and size. Yet Venus followed a divergent evolutionary path, losing its surface water and becoming hotter than Mercury. How did this happen? The answer has profound implications for how terrestrial planets become habitable and the potential for life in the universe. To provide an answer to these questions a proposal has been submitted to NASA in the frame of the Discovery Program, for a mission called VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio science, InSAR, Topography and Spectroscopy). The VERITAS payload is formed by a Venus Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (VISAR), a Venus Emissivity Mapper and a Gravity Science Investigation. Interferometric Synthetic aperture radars are well-established tools for generating topographic maps of the Earth (see among the others [1]-[2]). Two spaceborne radar interferometric mapping missions, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (see for example [3]) and the Tandem-X Mission (see for example [4]) have generated unprecedented measurements of the Earth's topography and informed many area of scientific investigation. Having such a comparable data set is needed to resolve the geologic evolution of the surface of Venus. Owning to the optically opaque cloud cover of Venus, radar interferometry is ideally suited to making these measurements. In this paper we provide a look at some of the system engineering and performance considerations for this instrument.

Spectral performance of astronomical mirror coatings strongly affect the science capabilities of astronomical satellite missions. We are utilizing ALD to create a transmissive overcoat to protect aluminum film mirrors from oxidation with the goal of achieving high reflectance (> 80%) from the UV (similar to 100 nm) to the IR (similar to 2,000 nm). This paper summarizes the recent developments of ALD aluminum fluoride (AlF3) coatings on Al. Reflectance measurements of aluminum mirrors protected by ALD A1F3 and future applications are discussed. These measurements demonstrate that Al + ALD AlF3, even with an interfacial oxide layer of a few nanometers, can provide higher reflectance than Al protected by traditional physical vapor deposited MgF2 without an oxide layer, below 115 nm.

The coronagraph employs sequential deformable mirrors to compensate for phase and amplitude errors. Using the optical model of an Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we have investigated through modeling and simulations the sensitivity of dark hole contrast in a Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) for several error cases, including lateral and longitudinal translation errors of two deformable mirrors, DM1 and DM2, lateral and/or longitudinal translation errors of an occulting mask and a Lyot- Stop, clocking errors of DM1 and DM2, and the mismatch errors between the testbed and the model sensitivity matrices. We also investigated the effects of a control parameter, namely the actuator regularization factor, on the control efficiency and on the final contrast floor. We found several error cases which yield contrast results comparable to that observed on the HLC testbed. We present our findings in this paper.

The primary function of a starshade is to suppress light from a target star in order to image its orbiting planets. In order to provide the proper apodization function the edges of the starshade must follow a precise in-plane profile. However of equal importance is the issue of light from our own sun scattering off of the edges and entering the telescope. A method to alleviate this problem is to make the edges extremely sharp (< 1 pm terminal radius) such that the area available for scattering is minimized. The combination of these two requirements, along with the need to integrate the edges into a 30-40 m dia. deployable structure, present a number of significant engineering challenges. Substrate etching techniques are used to obtain both the intended profile as well as the edge sharpness. Current efforts implement an isotropic etching process on thin metal substrates. This paper discusses the progress towards producing a sharp optical edge at the coupon level. Samples have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy as well as a custom testbed to assess their scattered-light performance.

Multiple additional layers are implemented into the design serving various functions. Nanolaminate metal films are used to provide a high quality reflective front surface. A backing layer of thin active material is implemented to provide the surface-parallel actuation scheme. Printed electronics are used to create a custom electrode pattern and flexible routing layer. Mirrors of this design are thin (< 1.0 mm), lightweight (2.7 kg/m(2)), and have large actuation capabilities. These capabilities, along with the associated manufacturing processes, represent a significant change in design compared to traditional optics. Such mirrors could be used as lightweight primaries for small CubeSat-based telescopes or as meter-class segments for future large aperture observatories. Multiple mirrors can be produced under identical conditions enabling a substantial reduction in manufacturing cost and complexity. An overview of the mirror design and manufacturing processes is presented. Predictions on the actuation performance have been made through finite element simulations demonstrating correctabilities on the order of 250-300X for astigmatic modes with only 41 independent actuators. A description of the custom metrology system used to characterize the active mirrors is also presented. The system is based on a Reverse Hartmann test and can accommodate extremely large deviations in mirror figure (> 100 mu m PV) down to sub-micron precision. The system has been validated against several traditional techniques including photogrammetry and interferometry. The mirror performance has been characterized using this system, as well as closed-loop figure correction experiments on 150 mm dia. prototypes. The mirrors have demonstrated post-correction figure accuracies of 200 nm RMS (two dead actuators limiting performance).	[Steeves, John; Redding, David; Wallace, J.

Enzymes three orders of magnitude smaller than the sacculus somehow coordinate and regulate their processes to double the length of the sacculus while preserving its shape and integrity, all over a period of tens of minutes to hours. Decades of effort using techniques ranging from biochemical analysis to microscopy have produced vast amounts of data on the structural and chemical properties of the cell wall, remodeling enzymes and regulatory proteins. The overall mechanism of cell wall synthesis, however, remains elusive. To approach this problem differently, we have developed a coarse-grained simulation method in which, for the first time to our knowledge, the activities of individual enzymes involved are modeled explicitly. We have already used this method to explore many potential molecular mechanisms governing cell wall synthesis, and anticipate applying the same method to other, related questions of bacterial morphogenesis. In this chapter, we present the details of our method, from coarse-graining the cell wall and modeling enzymatic activities to characterizing shape and visualizing sacculus growth.

The monitoring information gathered is essential for developing the required higher level services, the components that provide decision support and some degree of automated decisions and for maintaining and optimizing workflow in large-scale distributed systems. Our strategy in trying to satisfy the demands of data intensive applications was to move to more synergetic relationships between the applications, computing and storage facilities and the network infrastructure. These orchestration and global optimization functions are performed by higher-level agent-based services which are able to collaborate and cooperate in performing a wide range of distributed information-gathering and processing tasks.

However, existing methods of measuring viability and concentration are relatively bulky, tedious and expensive. Here we demonstrate a compact and cost-effective automatic yeast analysis platform (AYAP), which can rapidly measure cell concentration and viability. AYAP is based on digital in-line holography and on-chip microscopy and rapidly images a large field-of-view of 22.5 mm(2). This lens-free microscope weighs 70 g and utilizes a partially-coherent illumination source and an opto-electronic image sensor chip. A touch-screen user interface based on a tablet-PC is developed to reconstruct the holographic shadows captured by the image sensor chip and use a support vector machine (SVM) model to automatically classify live and dead cells in a yeast sample stained with methylene blue. In order to quantify its accuracy, we varied the viability and concentration of the cells and compared AYAP's performance with a fluorescence exclusion staining based gold-standard using regression analysis. The results agree very well with this gold-standard method and no significant difference was observed between the two methods within a concentration range of 1.4 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(6) cells per mL, providing a dynamic range suitable for various applications. This lensfree computational imaging technology that is coupled with machine learning algorithms would be useful for cost-effective and rapid quantification of cell viability and density even in field and resource-poor settings.

The WGF method, which is based on the use of smooth windowing functions and integral kernels that can be expressed directly in terms of the free-space Green function, does not require evaluation of expensive Sommerfeld integrals. The proposed approach is fast, accurate, flexible, and easy to implement. In particular, straightforward modifications of existing (accelerated or unaccelerated) integral-equation solvers suffice to incorporate the WGF capability. The method relies on a certain integral equation posed on the union of the boundary of the obstacle and a small flat section of the interface between the penetrable media. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that both the near- and far-field errors resulting from the proposed approach decrease faster than any negative power of the window size. In the examples considered in this paper the proposed method is up to thousands of times faster, for a given accuracy, than a corresponding method based on use of Sommerfeld integrals.

Schumann resonance is the name of a standing wave of electromagnetic fields, which is one of the correlated noise sources for the second-generation gravitational-wave detectors. We measured the noise levels of the environmental magnetic field both inside and outside the mine of KAGRA site at Kamioka. In this letter, we report the result of the measurement and compare the amplitude of magnetic fields inside and outside the mine to find possible issues or gain of constructing a detector underground.

The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and the combined International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) all use millisecond pulsar observations to detect or constrain GWs typically at nanohertz frequencies. In the case of the IPTA's nine-telescope 24-Hour Global Campaign on millisecond pulsar J1713+0747, GW limits in the intermediate frequency regime can be produced. The negligible change in dispersion measure during the observation minimizes red noise in the timing residuals, constraining any contributions from GWs due to individual sources. At 10(-5) Hz, the 95% upper limit on strain is 10(-11) for GW sources in the pulsar's direction.

We report a method to measure the GW propagation speed by directly comparing arrival times of GWs, neutrinos from supernovae (SN), and photons from short gamma-ray bursts (SGRB). We found that the future multimessenger observations can test the GW propagation speed with the precision of similar to 10(-16)-10(-15), improving the previous suggestions by 9 10 orders of magnitude. We also propose a novel method that distinguishes the true signal due to the deviation of GW speed from the speed of light and the intrinsic time delay with compact binaries at cosmological distances.

Here we study an efficient method to detect a line GWB by correlating data of multiple GW detectors. We find that the width of frequency bin in the data analysis is a critical parameter, and, with the commonly-used value 0.25 Hz, the signal-to-noise ratio could be decreased by up to a factor of 6.6, compared with a finer width of 0.02Hz. By reanalyzing the existing data with a smaller bin width, we might detect a precious line signal from the early universe.

Errors that occur in the parts under TID effect are characterized at multiple levels. Results show that faithful data recovery only lasts until 9k rad. Data errors observed in irradiated flash samples are strongly asymmetric. To improve the reliability of the parts, we study error mitigation methods that consider the specific properties of TID errors. First, we implement a novel data representation scheme that stores data using the relative order of cell voltages. The representation is more robust against uniform asymmetric threshold voltage shift of floating gates. Experimental results show that the scheme reduces errors at least by 50% for blocks with less than 3k program/erase cycles and 10k rad. Second, we conduct empirical evaluations of memory scrubbing schemes. Based on the results, we identify a scheme that refreshes cells without doing block erasure. Evaluation results show that parts under this scrubbing scheme survive up to 8k PECs and 57k rad total doses.

However, such flash memory is becoming more susceptible to noise, and its reliability issues has become the major concern for its adoption by long-term storage systems. This paper studies the system-level reliability of archival storage that uses 1x-nm NAND flash memory. We analyze retention error behavior, and show that 1x-nm MLC and TLC flash do not immediately qualify for long-term storage. We then implement the rank modulation (RM) scheme and memory scrubbing (MS) for retention period (RP) enhancement. The RM scheme provides a new data representation using the relative order of cell voltages, which provides higher reliability against uniform asymmetric threshold voltage shift due to charge leakage. Results show that the new representation reduces raw bit error rate (RBER) by 45% on average, and using RM and MS together provides up to 196, 171, 146 and 121 years of RPs for blocks with 0, 25, 50 and 75 program/erase cycles, respectively.

Among the different types of radiation effects that can affect spacecraft electronics is the single event transients. The space environment is responsible for many of the single event transients which can upset the performance of the spacecraft avionics hardware. In this paper we first explore the origins of single event transients, then illustrate the bahaviors of a single event transient in a digital circuit. We then provide a discussion concerning propagation of a single event transient event at the local, subsystem, and system level. The final goal of the paper is to provide a qualitatively methodology for asessing single event transients and its effects so that spacecraft avionics engineers can develop either hardware or software coutermeasures in their designs.

The best waveguide attenuation measured of 0.014 dB/mm is still three times higher than for metal WR-10 waveguides.

Initial modeling results for the 63 A-m(2) dipole moment magnets showed that magnetic shields would be necessary in order to meet magnetic field requirements for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) spacecraft, which contains components that are susceptible to external DC magnetic fields. ME and the Elk vendor proposed cold rolled steel and mu-metal as potential shield materials along with proposed thicknesses of 0.5 mn and 1.5 mm. Magnetic shields made from each of these materials were designed and modeled in software, taking high field saturation into account. Prototype magnetic shields with these parameters were then built, measured with an existing EIK, and compared against modeling results. For single-axis field measurements along the dipole axis, modeling results were within 7 gauss of the measured values at 10 cm from the magnet, and converged to less than 1.5 gauss at distances greater than 14 cm from the magnet. Three-axis field measurements at locations of interest showed that model correlation improved to within 4 gauss at 11 cm and 2 gauss for distances ranging between 15 cm and 36 cm.

RTS will uniquely address the need for high-acuity and sensitive near-infrared spectral follow-up observations of tens of thousands of objects in mere months by combining an excellent observing site, unmatched robotic observational efficiency, and an AO system that significantly increases both sensitivity and spatial resolving power. We will initially use RTS to obtain the infrared spectra of similar to 4,000 Type Ia supernovae identified by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System over a two year period that will be crucial to precisely measuring distances and mapping the distribution of dark matter in the z < 0.1 universe. RTS will comprise an upgraded version of the Robo-AO laser AO system and will respond quickly to target-of-opportunity events, minimizing the time between discovery and characterization. RTS will acquire simultaneous-multicolor images with an acuity of 0.07-0.10" across the entire visible spectrum (20% i'-band Strehl in median conditions) and < 0.16" in the near infrared, and will detect companions at 0.5" at contrast ratio of similar to 500. The system will include a high-efficiency prism integral field unit spectrograph: R = 70-140 over a total bandpass of 840-1830nm with an 8.7" by 6.0" field of view (0.15" spaxels). The AO correction boosts the infrared point-source sensitivity of the spectrograph against the sky background by a factor of seven for faint targets, giving the UH 2.2-m the H-band sensitivity of a 5.7-m telescope without AO.

In this work, we present end-to-end performance simulations, using Fourier propagation, of several METIS coronagraphic modes, including focal-plane vortex phase masks and pupil-plane apodizing phase plates, for the centrally obscured, segmented E-ELT pupil. The atmosphere and the AO contributions are taken into account. Hybrid coronagraphs combining the advantages of vortex phase masks and APPs are considered to improve the METIS coronagraphic performance.

This vortex coronagraph operates in the L' band not only in order to take advantage from the favorable star/planet contrast ratio when observing beyond the K band, but also to exploit the fact that the Keck II Adaptive Optics (AO) system delivers nearly extreme adaptive optics image quality (Strehl ratios values near 90%) at 3.7 mu m. We describe the hardware installation of the vortex phase mask during a routine NIRC2 service mission. The success of the project depends on extensive software development which has allowed the achievement of exquisite real-time pointing control as well as further contrast improvements by using speckle nulling to mitigate the effect of static speckles. First light of the new coronagraphic mode was on June 2015 with already very good initial results. Subsequent commissioning nights were interlaced with science nights by members of the VORTEX team with their respective scientific programs. The new capability and excellent results so far have motivated the VORTEX team and the Keck Science Steering Committee (KSSC) to offer the new mode in shared risk mode for 2016B.

The MOF comprises a sodium vapor cell in a kilogauss-level magnetic field between crossed polarizers and has a very narrow transmission profile at the sodium D-2 resonance of approximately 0.008 nm. Our observations were made with the 1.5 m Kuiper telescope on Mt. Bigelow, AZ, which has a separately mounted guide star laser projecting a circularly polarized single-frequency beam of approximately 6.5 W at 589.16 nm. Both the beam projector and the 1.5 m telescope were pointed close to zenith; the baseline between them is approximately 5 m. Measurements of the guide star were made on the morning of 2016 March 24 using an imaging camera focused on the beacon and looking through the full aperture of the telescope. The guide star flux was estimated at 1.20x10(6) photon/m(2)/s while at approximately 45 minutes after sunrise, the sky background through the MOF was 1100 photon/m(2)/s/arcsec(2). We interpret our results in terms of thermal infrared observations with adaptive optics on the next generation of extremely large telescopes now being built.

Among existing solutions, the vortex coronagraph stands as one of the most effective and promising solutions. However, for focal-plane coronagraph, a small inner working angle comes necessarily at the cost of a high sensitivity to pointing errors. This is the reason why a pointing control system is imperative to stabilize the star on the vortex center against pointing drifts due to mechanical flexures, that generally occur during observation due for instance to temperature and/or gravity variations. We have therefore developed a technique called QACITS(1) (Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing), which is based on the analysis of the coronagraphic image shape to infer the amount of pointing error. It has been shown that the flux gradient in the image is directly related to the amount of tip-tilt affecting the beam. The main advantage of this technique is that it does not require any additional setup and can thus be easily implemented on all current facilities equipped with a vortex phase mask. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of the QACITS sensor at Keck/NIRC2, where an L-band AGPM has been recently commissioned (June and October 2015), successfully validating the QACITS estimator in the case of a centrally obstructed pupil. The algorithm has been designed to be easily handled by any user observing in vortex mode, which is available for science in shared risk mode since 2016B.

Installed since may 2014 on UT3, the system has been commissionned and verified for more than one year now and routinely delivers unprecedented images of star surroundings, exoplanets and dust disks. The exceptionnal performance required for this kind of observation makes the appointment: a repeatable Strehl Ratio of 90% in H band, a rough contrast level of 10-5@0.5 arcsec, and reaches 10-6 at the same separation after differential imaging (SDI, ADI). The instrument also presents high contrast levels in the visible and an unprecedented 17mas diffraction-limited resolution at 0.65 microns wavelength. SAXO is the SPHERE XAO system, allowing the system to reach its final detectivity. Its high performance and therefore highly sensitive capacities turns a new eye on telescope environement. Even if XAO performance are reached as expected, some unexpected limitations are here described and a first work around is proposed and discussed. Spatial limitation: wave-front aberrations have been identified, deviating from kolmogorov statistics, and therefore not easily seen and compensated for by the XAO system. The impact of this limitations results in a degraded performance in some particular low wind conditions. Solutions are developped and tested on sky to propose a new operation procedure reducing this limitation. Temporal limitation: high amplitude vibrations on the low order modes have been issued, due to telescope environment and XAO behaviour. Again, a solution is developped and an assessment of its performance is dressed. The potential application of these solutions to E-ELT is proposed.

But even at that speed, we are still limited by low-frequency vibrations. The current main limitation was found to be vibrations attributed mainly to the rotation of the telescope. Using the fast wavefront sensors, cameras and accelerometers, we managed to identify the origin of most of the vibrations degrading our performance. Low-frequency vibrations are coming from the telescope drive in azimuth and elevation, as well as the elevation encoders when the target is at transit. Other vibrations were found at higher frequency coming from the image rotator inside Subaru's adaptive optics facility AO188. Different approaches are being implemented to take care of these issues. The PID control of the image rotator has been tuned to reduce their high-frequency contribution. We are working with the telescope team to tune the motor drives and reduce the impact of the elevation encoder. A Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller (LQG, or Kalman filter) is also being implemented inside SCExAO to control these vibrations. These solutions will not only improve significantly SCExAOs performance, but will also help all the other instruments on the Subaru Telescope, especially the ones behind A0188. Ultimately, this study will also help the development of the TMT, as these two telescopes share very similar drives.

Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer: concept and phased implementation	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEMS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Adaptive Optics Systems V	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Exoplanets; high contrast imaging; high contrast high resolution spectroscopy; small inner working angle coronagraphy; vortex coronagraph; on-axis segmented telescopes; apodization; Extremely Large Telescopes	BROWN DWARF; CORONAGRAPH; STARS; VLT/NACO	The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) is a cost-effective upgrade path to the W.M. Keck observatory (WMKO) adaptive optics (AO) system, building on the lessons learned from first and second-generation extreme AO (ExA0) coronagraphs. KPIC will explore new scientific niches in exoplanet science, while maturing critical technologies and systems for future ground-based (TMT, FELT, GMT) and space-based planet imagers (HabEx, LUVOIR). The advent of fast low-noise IR cameras (IR-APD, MKIDS, electron injectors), the rapid maturing of efficient wavefront sensing (WFS) techniques (Pyramid, Zernike), small inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs (e.g., vortex) and associated low-order wavefront sensors (LOWFS), as well as recent breakthroughs in high contrast high resolution spectroscopy, open new direct exoplanet exploration avenues that are complementary to planet imagers such as VLT-SPHERE and the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). For instance, the search and detailed characterization of planetary systems on solar-system scales around late-type stars, mostly beyond SPHERE and GPI's reaches, can be initiated now at WMKO.

Speckle lifetime in XAO coronagraphic images: temporal evolution of SPHERE coronagraphic images	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEMS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Adaptive Optics Systems V	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Extreme Adaptive Optics; Speckles; High Contrast	COMPANIONS; STABILITY	The major source of noise in high-contrast imaging is the presence of slowly evolving speckles that do not average with time. The temporal stability of the point-spread-function (PSF) is therefore critical to reach a high contrast with extreme adaptive optics (XAO) instruments. Understanding on which timescales the PSF evolves and what are the critical parameters driving the speckle variability allow to design an optimal observing strategy and data reduction technique to calibrate instrumental aberrations and reveal faint astrophysical sources. We have obtained a series of 52 min, AO-corrected, coronagraphically occulted, high-cadence (1.6Hz), H-band images of the star HR 3484 with the SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimeter High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch(1)) instrument on the VLT. This is a unique data set from an XAO instrument to study its stability on timescales as short as one second and as long as several tens of minutes. We find different temporal regimes of decorrelation. We show that residuals from the atmospheric turbulence induce a fast, partial decorrelation of the PSF over a few seconds, before a transition to a regime with a linear decorrelation with time, at a rate of several tens parts per million per second (ppm/s). We analyze the spatial dependence of this decorrelation within the well-corrected radius of the adaptive optics system and show that the linear decorrelation is faster at short separations. Last, we investigate the influence of the distance to the meridian on the decorrelation.	[Milli, J.; Girard, J.

The statistics of atmospheric turbulence at Maunakea measured by RAVEN	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEMS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Adaptive Optics Systems V	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Atmospheric turbulence; RAVEN; SLODAR	OUTER SCALE; SLODAR	Prior statistical knowledge of the turbulence such as turbulence strength, layer altitudes and the outer scale is essential for atmospheric tomography in adaptive-optics (AO). These atmospheric parameters can be estimated from measurements of multiple Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensors (SH-WFSs) by the SLOpe Detection And Ranging (SLODAR). In this paper, we present the statistics of the vertical C-N(2) and the outer scale L-0 at Maunakea in Hawaii estimated from 60 hours telemetry data in total from multiple SH-WFSs of RAVEN, which is an on-sky multi-object AO demonstrator tested on the Subaru telescope. The mean seeing during the RAVEN on-sky observations is 0.475 arcsec, and 55 % turbulence is below 1.5 km. The vertical profile of C-N(2) from the RAVEN SLODAR is consistent with the profiles from CFHT DIMM and MASS, and TMT site characterization.	[Ono, Y.

On-sky MOAO performance evaluation of RAVEN	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEMS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Adaptive Optics Systems V	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		adaptive optics; multi-object adaptive optics; RAVEN		This paper presents the AO performance we got on-sky with RAVEN, a Multi-Object Adaptive Optics (MOAO) technical and science demonstrator installed and tested at the Subaru telescope. We report Ensquared-Energy (EE) and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) measured from science images on Subaru's IRCS taken during all of the on-sky observing runs. We show these metrics as function of different AO modes and atmospheric conditions for two asterisms of natural guide stars. The performances of the MOAO and Ground-Layer AO (GLAO) modes are between the classical Single-Conjugate AO (SCAO) and seeing-limited modes. We achieve the EE of 30 % in H-band with the MOAO correction, which is a science requirement for RAVEN. The MOAO provides sightly better performance than the GLAO mode in both asterisms. One of the reasons which cause this small difference between the MOAO and GLAO modes may be the strong GL contribution. Also, the performance of the MOAO modes is affected by the accuracy of the on-sky turbulence profiling by the SLOpe Detection And Ranging (SLODAR) method.	[Ono, Y.

The uncorrected residuals scatter the starlight and produce intensity fluctuations, which as a result creates dynamic speckle noise in the focal plane. To improve post processing of the science images, the low-order telemetry of the residuals left uncorrected by the control loop can be used to calibrate the amount of starlight leakage at small angular separations. In this proceeding, we present the preliminary simulations of point spread function calibration using the Lyot-based low-order wavefront sensor measurements (tip-tilt errors only) for a vector vortex coronagraph.

Despite their advantages and potential applications little attention has been paid to the propagation of the partial derivatives of the corresponding set of elements or coordinates, required in many orbit-determination scenarios and optimization problems. This paper fills this gap by presenting the general procedure for integrating the state-transition matrix of the system together with the nominal trajectory using regularized formulations and different sets of elements. The main difficulty comes from introducing an independent variable different from time, because the solution needs to be synchronized. The correction of the time delay is treated from a generic perspective not focused on any particular formulation. The synchronization using time elements is also discussed. Numerical examples include strongly-perturbed orbits in the Pluto system, motivated by the recent flyby of the New Horizons spacecraft, together with a geocentric flyby of the NEAR spacecraft.

This generally leads to reduced accuracy of the propagated uncertainty in the first case, or an undesirable, and often intractable, number of orbit propagations in the latter. This paper considers the application of polynomial chaos (PC) for interplanetary orbit uncertainty propagation when there is one or more planetary or natural satellite flybys. The technique of compressive sampling is used in order to improve the tractability of the problem without sacrificing accuracy. The presented PC-based method of approximating the a posteriori probability density function requires no fundamental simplifying assumptions, reduces the computation time compared to MC, and produces a sensitivity analysis for the quantities of interest.

We use isolating blocks to investigate the dynamics of objects entering the Earth Moon system in the circular restricted three-body problem with energies close to the energy of the L-2 libration point. Specifically, the stable and unstable manifolds of Lyapunov orbits and the hyperbolic invariant set around the libration points are obtained by numerically computing the way orbits exit from an isolating block in combination with a bisection method. Invariant spheres of solutions in the spatial problem may then be located using the resulting manifolds.

These advantages are multiplied for roundtrip orbiters (e.g. potential Mars sample return) where a large total Delta V would be required. In this paper we investigate the mission design characteristics of mission concepts utilizing various combinations and types of SEP thrusters, solar arrays, launch vehicles, launch dates, arrival dates, etc. SEP allows for > 50% more mass delivered and launch periods of months to years. We also present the SEP analog to the ballistic Porkchop plot - the "Bacon" plot.

This paper describes the current trajectory design concept for a multiple Europa flyby mission and discusses several trajectory design challenges. The candidate reference trajectory utilizes multiple Europa flybys while around Jupiter to enable near global coverage of Europa while balancing science requirements, radiation dose, propellant usage, and flight time. Trajectory design trades and robustness are also discussed.

However, the additional degrees of freedom of finding the best maneuver location can severely complicate automated broad-search algorithms. A computationally-efficient formulation that reduces the maneuver design space to a single dimension is presented, where the efficacy of additional maneuvers along previously computed transfers is calculated explicitly via Lawden's "primer vector." Examples include leveraging maneuvers to ease capture at Europa, phasing maneuvers to enable resonant-hopping among Saturn's moons, and broken-plane maneuvers on transfers to Mars.

Combinations of transfers can produce several different useful ballistic trajectory sequences. With the right orbit types (particularly backflips) included, a low thrust vehicle can cheaply switch between sequences that have very different characteristics. Several useful repeat sequences are presented in the circular restricted 3-body problem (CR3BP) model, and examples of these are demonstrated in the full ephemeris. These trajectory sequences would be particularly applicable for returned asteroids (in the near term) and lunar-derived resource transport (in the long term), where only very limited delta-V is available due to the large mass of the vehicle.

In addition, chemical propulsion systems can outperform much higher specific impulse electric propulsion systems when they can take advantage of the Oberth effect, i.e. an impulsive maneuver deep in a gravity well. We show that for many cases solid rockets would outperform higher specific impulse liquid systems. We also show that for low v-infinities, chemical systems would outperform electric propulsion systems for orbit insertion and escape maneuvers.

Logarithmic spirals are the simplest, but of little practical interest due to having a constant flight-path angle. We prove that the same tangential thrust profile that generates a logarithmic spiral yields an entire family of generalized spirals. The system admits two integrals of motion, which are equivalent to the energy and the angular momentum equations. Three different subfamilies of spiral trajectories are obtained depending on the sign of the constant of the generalized energy: elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Parabolic spirals are equivalent to logarithmic spirals. Elliptic spirals are bounded; never escape to infinity and the trajectory is symmetric. Two types of hyperbolic spirals have been found: the first has only one asymptote; the second has two asymptotes, the trajectory is symmetric and never falls to the origin. The solution is obtained when solving rigorously the equations of motion with no prior assumptions. Closed-form expressions for both the trajectory and the time of flight are provided.

Of particular interest are low 6.7 options for capture and walkdown to the target science orbits aided by multi-body effects due to the mutual gravitational interaction of Phobos and Mars.

An impulsive-patched-conic broad search algorithm combined with a local optimizer is used for the trajectory computations. Two classes of trajectories, (1) with a powered Jupiter flyby and (2) with a perihelion maneuver, are studied and compared. Planetary flybys combined with leveraging maneuvers reduce launch C-3 requirements (by factor of 2 or more) and help satisfy mission-phasing constraints.

This paper overviews methods that have been used to organize orbits, focusing on periodic orbits in particular, and introduces new methods based on clustering approaches.

This is a difficult problem for a number of reasons, including the fact that the gravity field is very weak, the non-gravitational perturbations are relatively more significant, and time and measurement quantity are limited by mission constraints. Therefore it is key that the radio science experiment is designed to be as efficient as possible at obtaining information about the gravity field of the asteroid. The key focus in this analysis is on the orbit size/shape, the measurement quantity, and placement.

Hyperbolic rendezvous is used to transport crew from a Mars centered orbit, to a transiting Earth bound habitat that does a flyby. Representative cases are taken from future potential missions of this type, and a thorough sensitivity analysis of the hyperbolic rendezvous phase is performed. This includes early engine cutoff, missed burn times, and burn misalignment. A finite burn engine model is applied that assumes the hyperbolic rendezvous phase is done with at least two burns.

As a result, large-scale accurate estimates of contemporary forest conditions are required. The current study utilizes Random Forest (RF) algorithms to integrate land cover, vegetation, soil, and other supplementary data with Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data to predict a wall-to-wall canopy height model (CHM) across Australia. Multiple CHMs are predicted from RF models trained from unique permutations of 6 predictor variables. Each 250m resolution CHM is independently validated against airborne laser scanning (ALS) heights from 18 countrywide sites; the best CHM yielding R-2 = 0.72, and RMSE = 7.43m. The best countrywide CHM is compared against 2 similar products from the literature, both of which are subject to intersecting ALS performance assessment also. The developed CHM product utilizes up-to-date data, and is tailored to Australia, complementing the National Ecosystem Surveillance Monitoring project mandated to the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) by the Australian Department of Environment. Furthermore, with future altimetry-based Earth observation missions due for launch, the developed CHM will act as a baseline from which monitoring investigations can be executed.

TRANSITIONAL ANNEALED ADAPTIVE SLICE SAMPLING FOR GAUSSIAN PROCESS HYPER-PARAMETER ESTIMATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION			English	Article						Gaussian process; slice sampling; simulated annealing; Markov chain Monte Carlo; sequential Monte Carlo	MODEL; EMULATORS; PRIORS	Surrogate models have become ubiquitous in science and engineering for their capability of emulating expensive computer codes, necessary to model and investigate complex phenomena. Bayesian emulators based on Gaussian processes adequately quantify the uncertainty that results from the cost of the original simulator, and thus the inability to evaluate it on the whole input space. However, it is common in the literature that only a partial Bayesian analysis is carried out, whereby the underlying hyper-parameters are estimated via gradient-free optimization or genetic algorithms, to name a few methods. On the other hand, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation could discard important regions of the hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we carry out a more complete Bayesian inference, that combines Slice Sampling with some recently developed sequential Monte Carlo samplers. The resulting algorithm improves the mixing in the sampling through the delayed-rejection nature of Slice Sampling, the inclusion of an annealing scheme akin to Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling and parallelization via transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo. Examples related to the estimation of Gaussian process hyper-parameters are presented.

Axonal Diameter and Density Estimated with 7-Tesla Hybrid Diffusion Imaging in Transgenic Alzheimer Rats	MEDICAL IMAGING 2016: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	MAR 01-03, 2016	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, Bruker, Poco Graphite, imXPAD		axonal diameter; multi-shell; HARDI; hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI); rat; Alzheimer's disease	BRAIN; MRI; DISEASE	Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is a powerful tool to study brain tissue microstructure. DWI is sensitive to subtle changes in the white matter (WM), and can provide insight into abnormal brain changes in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used 7-Tesla hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI) to scan 3 transgenic rats (line TgF344-AD; that model the full clinico-pathological spectrum of the human disease) ex vivo at 10, 15 and 24 months. We acquired 300 DWI volumes across 5 q-sampling shells (b-1000, 3000, 4000, 8000, 12000 s/mm(2)). From the top three b-value shells with highest signal-to-noise ratios, we reconstructed markers of WM disease, including indices of axon density and diameter in the corpus callosum (CC) - directly quantifying processes that occur in AD. As expected, apparent anisotropy progressively decreased with age; there were also decreases in the intra-and extra-axonal MR signal along axons. Axonal diameters were larger in segments of the CC (splenium and body, but not genu), possibly indicating neuritic dystrophy - characterized by enlarged axons and dendrites as previously observed at the ultrastructural level (see Cohen et al., J. Neurosci. 2013). This was further supported by increases in MR signals trapped in glial cells, CSF and possibly other small compartments in WM structures. Finally, tractography detected fewer fibers in the CC at 10 versus 24 months of age. These novel findings offer great potential to provide technical and scientific insight into the biology of brain disease.

Without using empirical transition criteria, the whole combustion process (including DDT) is computed within a single solver framework. In this paper, we present massively parallelized three-dimensional explosion simulations in a full-scale pressurized water reactor of the Konvoi type. Several generic DDT scenarios in globally lean hydrogen air mixtures are examined to assess the importance of different input parameters. It is demonstrated that the explosion process is highly sensitive to mixture composition, ignition location and thermodynamic initial conditions. Pressure loads on the confining structure show a profoundly dynamic behavior depending on the position in the containment.

We have observed that the loss of signaling segments can significantly increase the delivery time of LTP blocks, and potentially undermine overall LTP performance. To cope with this degradation, the paper proposes two simple enhancements which make the transmission of signaling data more robust. Both enhancements have been inserted as optional features in the Interplanetary Overlay Network LTP implementation, in order to evaluate their effectiveness on a GNU/Linux testbed running the full protocol stack. The preliminary results presented in the paper show that the proposed enhancements can significantly improve LTP performance in the presence of high losses with respect to regular LTP implementations.

Universal Rate-Compatible LDPC Code Families for Any Increment Ordering	2016 9TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TURBO CODES AND ITERATIVE INFORMATION PROCESSING (ISTC)	International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)	SEP 05-09, 2016	Brest, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE France Sect, IEEE Informat Theory Soc, URSI, Inst Mines Telecom			DESIGN	Rate-compatible (RC) codes are at the core of systems with incremental redundancy. Usually, an RC code family supports successively lower code rates by sending specific increments of additional redundancy at each rate. That is, the order of the increments is fixed. However, in some multi-hop communication systems and also in recently proposed inter-frame coding, the order in which the decoder of the RC code receives the increments is not predetermined. A different ordering of the increments at the decoder may change the codes of various rates. This paper seeks RC codes that are universally good over all increment orderings. We call RC codes satisfying this requirement universal for any increment ordering (UIO) codes. We design protograph-based Raptor-Iike (PBRL) low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles for UIO codes using protograph thresholds as components of two design metrics. One metric seeks codes that, at each code rate, have exactly the same frame error rate for all increment orderings. The other metric sacrifices strictly identical performance for every ordering to seek codes that achieve the best possible throughput in a variable-length setting with random increment ordering, as would occur with inter-frame coding. Simulation results of UIO-PBRL codes from the new ensembles show that our designs satisfy the two metrics.	[Ranganathan, Sudarsan V.

Specifically, in a recent paper [15] we precisely characterized the MSE performance of a general class of regularized M-estimators using a framework that is based on Gaussian process methods. Here, we extend the framework to the analysis of a general class of Lipschitz performance metrics, which in addition to the standard MSE, includes the l(1)-reconstruction error, the probability of successfully identifying whether an element belongs to the support of a sparse signal, the empirical distribution of the error, etc. For concreteness, we primarily focus on the problem of sparse recovery under l(1)-regularized least-squares (aka LASSO). We illustrate the validity of the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations and discuss the importance of their precise nature in optimally tuning the involved parameters of the reconstruction method.

By sparsest, we mean that each row has the least possible number of nonzeros, while balanced means that the number of nonzeros in any two columns differs by at most one. Codes allowing such encoding schemes are useful in distributed settings where computational load-balancing is critical. The problem was first studied by Dau et al. who showed, using probabilistic arguments, that there always exists an MDS code over a sufficiently large field such that its generator matrix is both sparsest and balanced. Motivated by the need for an explicit construction with efficient decoding, the authors of the current paper showed that the generator matrix of a cyclic Reed-Solomon code of length n and dimension k can always be transformed to one that is both sparsest and balanced, when n and k are such that k/n (n - k + 1) is an integer. In this paper, we lift this condition and construct balanced and sparsest generator matrices for cyclic Reed-Solomon codes for any set of parameters.

Among the different types of radiation effects that can affect spacecraft electronics is the single event transients. The space environment is responsible for many of the single event transients which can upset the performance of the spacecraft avionics hardware. In this paper we first explore the origins of single event transients, then explore the modeling of a single event transient in digital and analog circuit. The paper also addresses the concept of crosstalk that could develop among digital circuits in the present of a SET event. The paper ends with a brief discussion of SET hardening. The goal of the paper is to provide methodologies for assessing single event transients and their effects so that spacecraft avionics engineers can develop either hardware or software countermeasures in their designs	[Perez, Reinaldo] Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA	Perez, R (corresponding author), Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

SPs are nonconvex optimization problems in general, and families of NP-hard problems can be reduced to SPs. In this paper we describe a hierarchy of convex relaxations to obtain successively tighter lower bounds of the optimal value of SPs. This sequence of lower bounds is computed by solving increasingly larger-sized relative entropy optimization problems, which are convex programs specified in terms of linear and relative entropy functions. Our approach relies crucially on the observation that the relative entropy function, by virtue of its joint convexity with respect to both arguments, provides a convex parametrization of certain sets of globally nonnegative signomials with efficiently computable nonnegativity certificates via the arithmetic-geometric-mean inequality. By appealing to representation theorems from real algebraic geometry, we show that our sequences of lower bounds converge to the global optima for broad classes of SPs. Finally, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods via numerical experiments.

Problems of this form include the entangled value of two prover games, entanglement-assisted coding for classical channels, and quantum-proof randomness extractors. We introduce an asymptotically converging hierarchy of efficiently computable semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations for this quantum optimization. This allows us to give upper bounds on the quantum advantage for all of these problems. Compared to previous work of Pironio, Navascues, and Acin [SIAM T. Optim., 20 (2010), pp. 2157-2180], our hierarchy has additional constraints. By means of examples, we illustrate the importance of these new constraints both in practice and for analytical properties. Moreover, this allows us to give a hierarchy of SDP outer approximations for the completely positive semidefinite cone introduced by Laurent and Piovesan.

A key generation strategy for IBFD wireless devices to increase the rate of generated secret keys over multipath fading channels is proposed. Conventionally, due to the half-duplex (HD) constraint on wireless transmissions, sensing simultaneous reciprocal channel measurements is not possible, which leads to a degraded key generation rate. However, with the advent of IBFD wireless devices, the legitimate nodes can sense the shared wireless link simultaneously at the possible cost of a self-interference (SI) channel estimation and some residual self-interference (RSI). As we demonstrate, with HD correlated observations the key rate is upper bounded by a constant, while with IBFD the key rate is only limited by the SI cancellation performance and is in general greater than that of its HD counterpart. Our analysis shows that with reasonable levels of SI cancellation, in the high SNR regime the key rate of IBFD is much higher, while in low SNRs, the HD system performs better. Finally, the key rate loss due to the overhead imposed by the SI channel estimation phase is discussed.

Our goal is to design market mechanisms in which participants' trades or wagers influence the market's behavior in a way that leads to accurate predictions, yet no single participant has too much influence over what others are able to observe. We study the possibilities and limitations of such mechanisms using tools from differential privacy. We begin by designing a private one-shot wagering mechanism in which bettors specify a belief about the likelihood of a future event and a corresponding monetary wager. Wagers are redistributed among bettors in a way that more highly rewards those with accurate predictions. We provide a class of wagering mechanisms that are guaranteed to satisfy truthfulness, budget balance on expectation, and other desirable properties while additionally guaranteeing &joint differential privacy in the bettors' reported beliefs, and analyze the trade-off between the achievable level of privacy and the sensitivity of a bettor's payment to her own report. We then ask whether it is possible to obtain privacy in dynamic prediction markets, focusing our attention on the popular cost-function framework in which securities with payments linked to future events are bought and sold by an automated market maker. We show that under general conditions, it is impossible for such a market maker to simultaneously achieve bounded worst-case loss and e-differential privacy without allowing the privacy guarantee to degrade extremely quickly as the number of trades grows, making such markets impractical in settings in which privacy is valued. We conclude by suggesting several avenues for potentially circumventing this lower bound.

J	Kim, DG				Kim, Duk Gyoo			Response time in choosing the most or least preferred option	ECONOMICS BULLETIN			English	Article								When a choice yields an uncertain future value, choosing the most preferred among many options is more demanding than excluding one, because the first task requires comparing all the options while the second task requires only finding one stochastically dominant binary relation. Even when a choice does not have any future value, choosing the most preferred one is cognitively costlier than choosing the least preferred. All else being equal, choosing the most preferred option from eight images selected at random takes more time than choosing the least preferred. Also, consistent with binary choice studies, the response time is shorter when preference orders are more distinct.

Getting NuSTAR on target: predicting mast motion	OBSERVATORY OPERATIONS: STRATEGIES, PROCESSES, AND SYSTEMS VI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Observatory Operations - Strategies, Processes, and Systems VI	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		NuSTAR; NASA small explorer; X-ray optics; extendable mast; Science Operations; Metrology; mast thermal flexing		The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) is the first focusing high energy (3-79 keV) X-ray observatory operating for four years from low Earth orbit. The X-ray detector arrays are located on the spacecraft bus with the optics modules mounted on a flexible mast of 10.14m length. The motion of the telescope optical axis on the detectors during each observation is measured by a laser metrology system and matches the pre-launch predictions of the theiinal flexing of the mast as the spacecraft enters and exits the Earths shadow each orbit. However, an additional motion of the telescope field of view was discovered during observatory commissioning that is associated with the spacecraft attitude control system and an additional flexing of the mast correlated with the Solar aspect angle for the observation. We present the methodology developed to predict where any particular target coordinate will fall on the NuSTAR detectors based on the Solar aspect angle at the scheduled time of an observation. This may be applicable to future observatories that employ optics deployed on extendable masts. The automation of the prediction system has greatly improved observatory operations efficiency and the reliability of observation planning.

In October 2014, NASA began support for the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO) program to coordinate the efforts of NASA astronomy archives in providing data to users through implementation of protocols agreed within the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). A major goal of the NAVO collaboration has been to step back from a piecemeal implementation of IVOA standards and define what the appropriate presence for the US and NASA astronomy archives in the VO should be. This includes evaluating what optional capabilities in the standards need to be supported, the specific versions of standards that should be used, and returning feedback to the IVOA, to support modifications as needed. We discuss a standard archive model developed by the NAVO for data archive presence in the virtual observatory built upon a consistent framework of standards defined by the IVOA. Our standard model provides for discovery of resources through the VO registries, access to observation and object data, downloads of image and spectral data and general access to archival datasets. It defines specific protocol versions, minimum capabilities, and all dependencies. The model will evolve as the capabilities of the virtual observatory and needs of the community change.

The cryogenic mission operated from 2003 to 2009. The observing proposal review process has evolved from large, week-long, in-person meetings during the cryogenic mission to the introduction of panel telecon reviews in the warm mission. Further compression of the schedule and budget for the proposal solicitation and selection process led to additional changes in 2014. Large proposals are still reviewed at an in-person meeting but smaller proposals are no longer discussed by a topical science panel. This hybrid process, involving an in-person committee for the larger proposals and strictly external reviewers for the smaller proposals, has been successfully implemented through two observing cycles. While people like the idea of not having to travel to a review it is still the consensus opinion, in our discussions with the community, that the in-person review panel discussions provide the most satisfying result. We continue to use in-person reviews for awarding greater than 90% of the observing time.	[Storrie-Lombardi, Lisa J.; Silbermann, Nancy A.; Rebull, L.

We specify tasks using a fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL) that allows both finite- and infinite-horizon properties to be specified, including tasks such as surveillance, periodic motion, repeated assembly, and environmental monitoring. Our method directly encodes an LTL formula as mixed-integer linear constraints on the system variables, avoiding the computationally expensive process of creating a finite abstraction. Our approach is efficient; for common tasks our formulation uses significantly fewer binary variables than related approaches and gives the tightest possible convex relaxation. We apply our method on piecewise affine systems and certain classes of differentially flat systems. In numerical experiments, we solve temporal logicmotion planning tasks for high-dimensional (10+ continuous state) systems.

Coupled with the scaling down of flash technology, the popularity of flash memory motivates the search for methods to increase flash reliability and lifetime. Erasures are the dominant cause of flash cell wear, but reducing them is challenging because flash is a write-once medium-memory cells must be erased prior to writing. An approach that has recently received considerable attention relies on write-once memory (WOM) codes, designed to accommodate additional writes on write-once media. However, the techniques proposed for reusing flash pages with WOM codes are limited in their scope. Many focus on the coding theory alone, while others suggest FTL designs that are application specific, or not applicable due to their complexity, overheads, or specific constraints of MLC flash. This work is the first that addresses all aspects of page reuse within an end-to-end implementation of a general-purpose FTL on MLC flash. We use our hardware implementation to directly measure the short and long-term effects of page reuse on SSD durability, I/O performance and energy consumption, and show that FTL design must explicitly take them into account.

The reason is fundamental and is a consequence of the quantum-mandated umbilical relationship between induced emission (gain) and spontaneous emission (noise) exacerbated by the modal concentration of optical energy in the high loss III-V material. We demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a new design paradigm which results in over three orders of magnitude reduction in the spectral linewidth of the SCL compared to commercial lasers now deployed. The key difference is a radical (some 99% in our case) transfer of stored optical energy from the III-V material to nearly transparent silicon which is an integral part of the laser resonator. This laser should constitute a serious candidate to take over the role of the Distributed Feedback (DFB) SCL as the light source for future coherent optical networks.

Over a three-year mission span, NISAR will collect on the order of 24 Terabits of raw radar data per day. Developing a plan to collect the data necessary for these three primary science disciplines and their sub-disciplines has been challenging in terms of overlapping geographic regions of interest, temporal requirements, competing modes of the radar instrument, and data-volume resources. One of the chief tools in building a plan of observations against these requirements has been a software tool developed at JPL, the Compressed Large-scale Scheduler Planner (CLASP). CLASP intersects the temporo-geometric visibilities of a spaceborne instrument with campaigns of temporospatial maps of scientific interest, in an iterative squeaky-wheel optimization loop. While the overarching strategy for science observations has evolved through the formulation phases of this mission, so has the use of CLASP. We'll show how this problem space and tool has evolved over time, as well as some of the current parameter estimates for NISAR and its overall mission plan.

To meet demanding coverage, sampling, and accuracy requirements, the system was designed to achieve over 240 km swath at fine resolution, and using full polarimetry where needed. To address the broad range of disciplines and scientific study areas of the mission, a dual-frequency system was conceived, at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve these observational characteristics, a reflector-feed system is considered, whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive ("SweepSAR") capability at both L-band and S-band. The instrument leverages the expanding capabilities of on-board digital processing to enable real-time calibration and digital beamforming. This paper describes the mission characteristics, current status of the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (L-SAR) portion of the instrument, and the technology development efforts in the United States that are reducing risk on the key radar technologies needed to ensure proper SweepSAR operations.

Due to the relatively large a priori uncertainties of the spacecraft ephemeris with respect to the Pluto system, optical navigation has played a critical role in decreasing the body-relative errors and enabling a successful flyby. Key functions of the New Horizons optical navigation process include extensive image planning and processing, stellar and planetary modeling, attitude determination, and star and planetary body centroiding. This paper presents how these functions enabled the successful navigation of New Horizons' flyby of the Pluto system.

This is a major issue in modeling the gravitational field of asteroids and comets with significant non-spherical shapes, as certain regions in the close proximity of the surface of such objects fall well within the Brillouin sphere. We implement a so called "interior" spherical harmonics expansion to model the surface proximity gravitational field of the asteroid 433 Eros. This model is shown to be able to accurately represent the gravitational field of an object in the close proximity of its surface. However, estimating the coefficients of such model is challenging. This work studies the feasibility of estimating the coefficients of an interior gravity field via orbit determination. The paper presents the expected level of the estimation precision and characterizes the effect of the size of the field radius on the estimation performance.

In March of 2015, NASA selected the Robotic Boulder Capture Option(1) as the baseline for the ARRM. This option will capture a multi-ton boulder, (typically 2-4 meters in size) from the surface of a large (greater than similar to 100 m diameter) Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) and return it to cis-lunar space for subsequent human exploration during the ARCM. Further human and robotic missions to the asteroidal material would also be facilitated by its return to cis lunar space. In addition, prior to departing the asteroid, the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) will perform a demonstration of the Enhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT) planetary defense technique.(2) This paper will discuss the proximity operations which have been broken into three phases: Approach and Characterization, Boulder Capture, and Planetary Defense Demonstration. Each of these phases has been analyzed for the ARRM reference target, 2008 EV5, and a detailed baseline operations concept has been developed.

Its mission is to rendezvous with and observe the two largest bodies in the main asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres. It has completed over a year's worth of direct observations of Vesta from early 2011 through late 2012. In the spring of 2015, the Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around the asteroid Ceres for the start of what is expected to be more than a year of science operations. The science data collected from this encounter consist of infrared (IR) images and spectra, visible images through a number of color filters, gamma ray detections and measurements of the Ceres gravity field. These data will be collected during several science phases: an Approach phase (1500000-4860 km from Ceres), a Survey orbit (4860 km radius), a High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) (1940 km radius) and a Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) (855 km radius).

Ground-based geolocation is typically assumed to be too risky, slow, and/or expensive to be considered anything but "Plan B", or an ancillary upgrade. However, with the ever-growing processing capabilities, current available ground software packages have made it possible to perform image orthorectification using only the image data (seeded with relatively course GN&C information), leveraging various feature recognition algorithms as an operationally-viable solution. Such algorithms have been developed of necessity for certain particular mission classes (e.g. small bodies and hosted payloads), and also have become commercially available for Earth applications. In this paper we evaluate the performance available from representative algorithms, and consider the implied system architecture trades of potentially foregoing the traditional high-performance GN&C solution altogether, in favor of currently-available ground processing. This can then become a mission-enabling strategy for low-cost Earth remote sensing missions such as NASA's Earth Ventures class.

Current methodologies for attaining these levels of stability are approaching the limit of what is possible with the use of isolation, intensive and risky structural dynamic tailoring, exquisite broad-band Attitude Control System (ACS) sensors and actuators, and ultra-precise fast steering mirrors commanded to compensate for pointing errors through feedback of camera measurements. This paper explores the benefits of using Strain Actuated Solar Arrays (SASA) - currently under Research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne - in new ACS architectures for applications requiring very tight precision pointing of a SC and on-board instrumentation. A strain actuated solar array has the following characteristics: (1) Strain actuation and sensing is distributed throughout the SA panels to obtain control authority and observability over the strain state of the SA enabling SA jitter control. (2) Large motion (up to 10 degrees or relative motion) strain based mechanisms are used in between SA panels and in between the SC and the solar array enables SC slewing and limited momentum management. (3) The mechanical (i.e., stiffness and configuration) and inertia/mass properties of the SA have been designed to optimize its ability to control its vibrations and the vibration and attitude of the host SC. This paper discusses ACS architectures that use the above SASA system while avoiding the use of the Reaction Wheel Actuator (RWA) during key science observation periods. The RWA being the dominant source of pointing jitter and wave front jitter in a telescope based observatory; hence, not flying RWAs amounts to not flying the main source of jitter! At least two architectures based on the SASA system are studied - one is an earth orbiter, the other is assumed to be in an L2 orbit. Simulation results for one of these cases are discussed along with what developments are needed going forward to enable the use of this technology.

It is also re pointed as a side effect of mobility. Within a "sun-safe" focal range, the Chem Cam can tolerate the sun passively passing through its field of view at Mars rotation rate. It can also tolerate up to three minutes of repointing with the sun remaining within its field of view. In the "sun-unsafe" focal range used for Chem Cam observations, the sun must never be allowed to enter the ChemCam field of view. Since this applies even in the event of a system fault, ChemCam observations are only allowed in directions guaranteed to be "sun-free" for several sols of Mars rotation and orbital motion. The ChemCam is protected by flight software enforcement of sun safety constraints and by models of these constraints implemented within ground tools used in tactical operations.

The Wide Field Instrument (WFI) offers Hubble quality imaging over a 0.28 square degree field of view and will gather NIR statistical data on exoplanets through gravitational microlensing. An on-board coronagraph will for the first time perform direct imaging and spectroscopic analysis of exoplanets with properties analogous to those within our own solar system, including cold Jupiters, mini Neptunes and potentially super Earths. The Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will be required to operate with low signal flux for long integration times, demanding all noise sources are kept to a minimum. The Electron Multiplication (EM)-CCD has been baselined for both the imaging and spectrograph cameras due its ability to operate with sub-electron effective read noise values with appropriate multiplication gain setting. The presence of other noise sources, however, such as thermal dark signal and Clock Induced Charge (CIC), need to be characterized and mitigated. In addition, operation within a space environment will subject the device to radiation damage that will degrade the Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) of the device throughout the mission lifetime. Irradiation at the nominal instrument operating temperature has the potential to provide the best estimate of performance degradation that will be experienced in-flight, since the final population of silicon defects has been shown to be dependent upon the temperature at which the sensor is irradiated. Here we present initial findings from pre- and post- cryogenic irradiation testing of the e2v CCD201-20 BI EMCCD sensor, baselined for the WFIRST coronagraph instrument. The motivation for irradiation at cryogenic temperatures is discussed with reference to previous investigations of a similar nature. The results are presented in context with those from a previous room temperature irradiation investigation that was performed on a CCD201-20 operated under the same conditions. A key conclusion is that the measured performance degradation for a given proton fluence is seen to measurably differ for the cryogenic case compared to the room temperature equivalent for the conditions of this study.

This project is a balloon-borne UV multi-object spectrograph, which has been designed to detect faint emission from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around low redshift galaxies. One major change from FIREBall-1 has been the use of a delta-doped Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD). EMCCDs can be used in photon-counting (PC) mode to achieve extremely low readout noise (i 1e(-)). Our testing initially focused on reducing clock-induced-charge (CIC) through wave shaping and well depth optimisation with the CCD Controller for Counting Photons (CCCP) from Nuvu. This optimisation also includes methods for reducing dark current, via cooling and substrate voltage adjustment. We present result of laboratory noise measurements including dark current. Furthermore, we will briefly present some initial results from our first set of on-sky observations using a delta-doped EMCCD on the 200 inch telescope at Palomar using the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (PCWI).

NEOCam will survey the sky in search of asteroids and comets, particularly those close to the Earth's orbit. The NEOCam infrared telescope will have two infrared (IR) channels; one covering 4 to 5 microns, and one covering 6-10 microns. Both IR cameras will use multiple 2Kx2K pixel format HAWAII-2RG arrays with different cutoff wavelength HgCdTe detectors from Teledyne Imaging Sensors. Past development work by the University of Rochester with Teledyne Imaging Sensors and JPL (McMurtry et al. 2013, Dorn et al. 2016) focused upon bringing the 10 micron HgCdTe detector technology up to NASA TRL 6+. This work extends that development program to push the format from 1Kx1K to the larger 2Kx2K pixel array. We present results on the first 2Kx2K candidate 10 micron cutoff HgCdTe arrays, where we measured the dark current, read noise, and total noise.

With a design contrast expected to be better than 1e-9 after post processing, this instrument will directly image gas giants as far in as Jupiter's orbit. Direct imaging places high demand on optical detectors, not only in noise performance, but also in the need to be resistant to traps. Since the typical scene flux is measured in milli-electrons per second, the signal collected in each practicable frame will be at most a few electrons. At such extremely small signal levels, traps and their effects on the image become extremely important. To investigate their impact on the WFIRST coronagraph mission science yield, we have constructed a detailed model of the coronagraph sensor performance in the presence of traps. Built in Matlab, this model incorporates the expected and measured trap capture and emission times and cross-sections, as well as occurrence densities after exposure to irradiation in the WFIRST space environment. The model also includes the detector architecture and operation as applicable to trapping phenomena. We describe the model, the results, and implications on sensing performance.

The impact of deforestation on the hydrological cycle in Amazonia as observed from remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							REGIONAL CLIMATE; WATER-BALANCE; DRY SEASON; PRECIPITATION; BASIN; MODIS; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; VEGETATION; COVER; MODEL	Given widespread Amazonian deforestation, numerous studies have focused on how the regional hydrological cycle - in terms of precipitation (P) recycling from evapotranspiration (ET) - is impacted by deforestation. Nevertheless, climate macroscale and mesoscale models have given contradictory results on changes in ET and P with deforestation. To date, these results have not been evaluated with observations, so in this work, we assessed a decade of patterns in ET and P over deforested and forest areas using remote sensing (MODIS and TRMM, 2000-2012). We found a relative increase in ET and P in deforested areas, though there was a positive ET and P correlation over southern/deforested, and negative in northern/forested Amazonia. Although the absolute ET and P values are lower in deforested areas in comparison to border areas, we observed a positive change in ET and P in the last 10 years at the deforested areas. The increase in ET was larger within the deforested areas; meanwhile, P increased more from inside forest areas to the borders, which agrees with the ET and P correlation patterns. Our results help to inform the debate between the macroscale and mesoscale models, as deforestation impacts small-scale circulation patterns, turbulence, and moisture fluxes and convergence, and expand our understanding of the processes involved.

CVFA has been shown to be effective in multiple clinical studies. The technology is rapid (<5 minutes per eye), easy (use of touchscreen), accurate (spatial resolution <1 degree), non-invasive, and comprehensive. The system automatically characterizes visual field defects in real time to generate new diagnostic insight. The visual performance assessment system is readily adaptable to traditional clinical and non-clinical settings (e.g., in forward operating bases in the theatre). It is capable of rapidly assessing conditions affecting the visual performance of warfighters in the field, allowing for triage and timely application of therapeutic countermeasures. The enabling technologies are a low-cost tablet computer and Internet connection. Ceeable is deploying the technology on a global basis to patients who will benefit from monitoring changes in visual function.

Stereo Vision-based Obstacle Avoidance for Micro Air Vehicles using an Egocylindrical Image Space Representation	MICRO- AND NANOTECHNOLOGY SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND APPLICATIONS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Micro- and Nanotechnology Sensors, Systems, and Applications VIII	APR 17-21, 2016	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Micro air vehicles; obstacle avoidance; vision; egocylinder	NAVIGATION	Micro air vehicles which operate autonomously at low altitude in cluttered environments require a method for on-board obstacle avoidance for safe operation. Previous methods deploy either purely reactive approaches, mapping low-level visual features directly to actuator inputs to maneuver the vehicle around the obstacle, or deliberative methods that use on-board 3-D sensors to create a 3-D, voxel-based world model, which is then used to generate collision free 3-D trajectories. In this paper, we use forward-looking stereo vision with a large horizontal and vertical field of view and project range from stereo into a novel robot-centered, cylindrical, inverse range map we call an egocylinder. With this implementation we reduce the complexity of our world representation from a 3D map to a 2.5D image-space representation, which supports very efficient motion planning and collision checking, and allows to implement configuration space expansion as an image processing function directly on the egocylinder. Deploying a fast reactive motion planner directly on the configuration space expanded egocylinder image, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach experimentally in an indoor environment.

The main focus here is on the proposed sensor switching method which allows seamless switching between integration of pure inertial cues, the use of inertial-optical flow based velocity estimates, and the use of visual-inertial based position estimates for the control of an inherently unstable aerial vehicle. The switching mechanism automatically detects if a state estimator part is faulty and reduces the sensory input to the remaining, healthy, information streams. In addition, a re-initialization sequence is run for the faulty segment until the full system is recovered. With the additional capability of each segment for self-calibration, the system is both self-calibrating and self-healing. The full framework has been integrated on an embedded platform on-board a real 500g small aerial vehicle and run at 30Hz camera stream and 1kHz inertial readings for live demonstration.

Having a limited medical support from mission control center on space exploration missions, crew members need a personal health-tracking tool to predict and assess his/her health risks if no preventive measures are taken. This paper refines a concept employing technologies from Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) for systems, namely real-time health monitoring and condition-based health maintenance with predictive diagnostics capabilities. Mapping particular PHM-based solutions to some Human Health and Performance (HH&P) technology candidates, namely by NASA designation, the Autonomous Medical Decision technology and the Integrated Biomedical Informatics technology, this conceptual paper emphasize key points that make the concept different from that of both current conventional medicine and telemedicine including space medicine. The primary benefit of the technologies development for the HH&P domain is the ability to successfully achieve affordable human space missions to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond. Space missions on the International Space Station (ISS) program directly contribute to the knowledge base and advancements in the HH&P domain, thanks to continued operations on the ISS, a unique human-tended test platform and the only test bed within the space environment. The concept is to be validated on the ISS, the only "test bed" on which to prepare for future manned exploration missions. The paper authors believe that early self-diagnostic coupled with autonomous identification of proper preventive responses on negative trends are critical in order to keep astronauts healthy.

This paper introduces the major issues for active and passive imaging including background masking, specular responses, and thermal equalization. Secondly, the paper discusses the prospects of radar imaging, and tradeoffs between system parameters such as transmit power, receiver sensitivity and phase noise, and how these parameters affect corresponding physical behavior including aperture size, resolution, penetration, and stand-off distance.

Ideal detectors for such a surveyor do not yet exist. As a demonstration of one technique for approaching the ultra-low NEPs required by this surveyor, we present the design of an array of 96 350 pm KIDs that utilize phonon recycling to boost responsivity. Our KID array is fabricated with TiN deposited on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, which is a 2 pm thick layer of silicon bonded to a thicker silicon wafer by a thin oxide layer. The thick silicon is etched away underneath the absorbers so that the inductors are suspended on just the 2 pm membrane. The intent is that quasiparticle recombination phonons are trapped in the thin membrane, thereby increasing their likelihood of being re-absorbed by the KID to break additional Cooper pairs and boost responsivity. We also present a Monte-Carlo simulation that predicts the amount of signal boost expected from phonon recycling given flexible detector geometries and illumination strategies. For our initial array geometry, the simulation predicts a small but likely measurable 50% boost in responsivity.

Low-volume aluminum and aluminum/titanium nitride bilayer lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors for far-infrared astronomy	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy VIII	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		kinetic inductance detectors; far infrared	BOLOMETER CAMERA; FACILITY; ARRAY; SZ	We present the design and characterization of low-volume, lumped-element aluminum kinetic inductance detectors for sensitive far-infrared astronomy observations. The lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors are comprised of meandered inductors that serve as radiation absorbers in parallel with interdigitated capacitors, forming high quality factor resonators. Low inductor volumes lead to low noise equivalent powers by raising quasiparticles densities, and hence responsivities, with respect to larger volumes. Low volumes are achieved with thin (20 nm), narrow (150 nm) inductors. The interdigitated capacitor architecture is designed to mitigate two-level system noise by lowering electric fields in the silicon substrate. Resonance frequencies are in the range of 190 to 500 MHz, with measured internal quality factors in excess of 1 x 10(5). In a prior incarnation, a titanium nitride layer on top of the aluminum served as a protective layer, but complicated the superconducting properties. These results were reported previously. In the current incarnation, the aluminum layer is left bare with no titanium nitride over-layer. The results for these bare aluminum devices include a yield of 88%, frequency responsivity of 109 W-1, and noise equivalent power of 1 x 10(-17) W Hz-1/2 for a 350 pm array. There is no evidence for 1/f noise down to at least 200 mHz. The sensitivity is currently limited by white noise, very likely from stray light in the testbed; for this detector design, sensitivities limited by generation-recombination noise in a lower-background environment should be several orders of magnitude lower.

Its focal plane consists of modularized tiles of antenna-coupled transition edge sensors (TESs), similar to those used in BICEP2 and the Keck Array. The increased per-receiver optical throughput compared to BICEP2/Keck Array, due to both its faster f/1.7 optics and the larger aperture, more than doubles the combined mapping speed of the BICEP/Keck program. The BICEP3 receiver was recently upgraded to a full complement of 20 tiles of detectors (2560 TESs) and is now beginning its second year of observation (and first science season) at the South Pole. We report on its current performance and observing plans. Given its high per-receiver throughput while maintaining the advantages of a compact design, BICEP3-class receivers are ideally suited as building blocks for a 3rd-generation CMB experiment, consisting of multiple receivers spanning 35 GHz to 270 GHz with total detector count in the tens of thousands. We present plans for such an array, the new "BICEP Array" that will replace the Keck Array at the South Pole, including design optimization, frequency coverage, and deployment/observing strategies.

A primary science goal of SPIDER is to measure the large-scale B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in search of the cosmic-inflation, gravitational-wave signature. 280 GHz channels aid this science goal by constraining the level of B-mode contamination from galactic dust emission. We present the focal plane unit design, which consists of a 16x16 array of conical, corrugated feedhorns coupled to a monolithic detector array fabricated on a 150 mm diameter silicon wafer. Detector arrays are capable of polarimetric sensing via waveguide probe-coupling to a multiplexed array of transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers. The SPIDER receiver has three focal plane units at 280 GHz, which in total contains 765 spatial pixels and 1,530 polarization sensitive bolometers. By fabrication and measurement of single feedhorns, we demonstrate 14.7 degrees FHWM Gaussian-shaped beams with <1% ellipticity in a 30% fractional bandwidth centered at 280 GHz. We present electromagnetic simulations of the detection circuit, which show 94% band-averaged, single-polarization coupling efficiency, 3% reflection and 3% radiative loss. Lastly, we demonstrate a low thermal conductance bolometer, which is well-described by a simple TES model and exhibits an electrical noise equivalent power (NEP) = 2.6 x 10(-17) W/root Hz, consistent with the phonon noise prediction.

Results of laboratory tests with prototype detectors and spectrometers are discussed. TIME-Pilot is a new mm-wavelength grating spectrometer array under development that will study the Epoch of Reionization (the period of time when the first stars and galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium) by mapping the fluctuations of the redshifted 157.7 mu m emission line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]) from redshift z similar to 5.2 to 8.5. As a tracer of star formation, the [CII] power spectrum can provide information on the sources driving reionization and complements 21 cm data (which traces neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium). Intensity mapping provides a measure of the mean [CII] intensity without the need to resolve and detect faint sources individually. We plan to target a 1 degree by 0.35 arcminute field on the sky and a spectral range of 199-305 GHz, producing a spatial-spectral slab which is 140 Mpc by 0.9 Mpc on-end and 1230 Mpc in the redshift direction. With careful removal of intermediate-redshift CO sources, we anticipate a detection of the halo-halo clustering term in the [CII] power spectrum consistent with current models for star formation history in 240 hours on the JCMT. TIME-Pilot will use two stacks of 16 parallel-plate waveguide spectrometers (one stack per polarization) with a resolving power R similar to 100 and a spectral range of 183 to 326 GHz. The range is divided into 60 spectral channels, of which 16 at the band edges on each spectrometer serve as atmospheric monitors. The diffraction gratings are curved to produce a compact instrument, each focusing the diffracted light onto an output arc sampled by the 60 bolometers. The bolometers are built in buttable dies of 8 (low freqeuency) or 12 (high frequency) spectral channels by 8 spatial channels and are mated to the spectrometer stacks. Each detector consists of a gold micro-mesh absorber and a titanium transition edge sensor (TES). The detectors (1920 total) are designed to operate from a 250 mK base temperature in an existing cryostat with a photon-noise-dominated NEP of similar to 2 * 10(-17) WHz(-1/2). A set of flexible superconducting cables connect the detectors to a time-domain multiplexing SQUID readout system.	[Hunacek, Jonathon; Bock, James; Bradford, C.

These modular arrays are composed of horn-coupled, polarization-sensitive MKIDs, and each pixel has four detectors: two polarizations in two spectral bands between 125 and 280 GHz. A horn is used to feed each array element, and a planar orthomode transducer, composed of two waveguide probe pairs, separates the incoming light into two linear polarizations. Diplexers composed of resonant-stub band-pass filters separate the radiation into 125 to 170 GHz and 190 to 280 GHz pass bands. The millimeter-wave power is ultimately coupled to a hybrid co-planar waveguide microwave kinetic inductance detector using a novel, broadband circuit developed by our collaboration. Electromagnetic simulations show the expected absorption efficiency of the detector is approximately 90%. Array fabrication will begin in the summer of 2016.

It is the latest in the BICEP/Keck Array series of CMB experiments located at the South Pole, which has provided the most stringent constraints on inflation to date. For the 2016 observing season, BICEP3 was outfitted with a full suite of 2400 optically coupled detectors operating at 95 GHz. In these proceedings we report on the far field beam performance using calibration data taken during the 2015-2016 summer deployment season in situ with a thermal chopped source. We generate high-fidelity per-detector beam maps, show the array-averaged beam profile, and characterize the differential beam response between co-located, orthogonally polarized detectors which contributes to the leading instrumental systematic in pair differencing experiments. We find that the levels of differential pointing, beamwidth, and ellipticity are similar to or lower than those measured for BICEP2 and Keck Array. The magnitude and distribution of BICEP3's differential beam mismatch - and the level to which temperature-to-polarization leakage may be marginalized over or subtracted in analysis - will inform the design of next-generation CMB experiments with many thousands of detectors.

Three cryogenic MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuit) amplifiers manufactured in InP 35-nm technology are combined in a block with waveguide probes and gain equalizers to cover the 80-116 GHz band. These are followed by a sideband-separating mixer that has two 17 GHZ wide outputs, for upper and lower sidebands. Each receiver has a feed horn followed by a circular-to-linear polarizer and orthomode transducer. The two polarizations are amplified by the cryogenic MMICs, and the outputs downconverted in sideband separating mixers, resulting in four 1-18 GHz channels that can be simultaneously correlated. The first receiver was tested in the lab, and on-sky tests conducted at CARMA. Measured noise temperatures were in the range 40-70 K, with a sideband rejection of about 15 dB.

The detectors are horn-coupled, and each array element contains two single-polarization LEKIDs, which are made from thin-film aluminum and optimized for a single spectral band centered on 150 GHz. We are developing two array architectures, one based on 160 micron thick silicon wafers and the other based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with a 30 micron thick device layer. The 20-element test arrays (40 LEKIDs) are characterized with both a linearly-polarized electronic millimeter wave source and a thermal source. We present initial measurements including the noise spectra, noise-equivalent temperature, and responsivity. We discuss future testing and further design optimizations to be implemented.

The KAPPa instrument is a terahertz heterodyne receiver using a Superconducting-Insulating-Superconducting (SIS) mixers. To improve performance, SIS mixers require a magnetic field to suppress Josephson noise. The KAPPa test receiver can house a tunable electromagnet used to optimize the applied magnetic field. The receiver is also capable of accommodating a permanent magnet that applies a fixed field. Our permanent magnet design uses off-the-shelf neodymium permanent magnets and then reshapes the magnetic field using machined steel concentrators. These concentrators allow the use of an unmachined permanent magnet in the back of the detector block while two small posts provide the required magnetic field across the SIS junction in the detector cavity. The KAPPa test receiver is uniquely suited to compare the permanent magnet and electromagnet receiver performance. The current work includes our design of a 'U' shaped permanent magnet, the testing and calibration procedure for the permanent magnet, and the overall results of the performance comparison between the electromagnet and the permanent magnet counterpart.

SuperSpec: Development Towards a Full-Scale Filter Bank	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy VIII	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Kinetic Inductance Detectors; Millimeter-wave; TiN; Noise Equivalent Power; SuperSpec; Spectrometer; Filter-Bank; Critical Temperature		SuperSpec is a new spectrometer-on-a-chip technology for submm/mm-wave spectroscopy. SuperSpec stands out from other direct-detection submm spectrometer technologies in that the detectors are coupled to a series of resonant filters along a single microwave feedline instead of using dispersive optics. SuperSpec makes use of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to detect radiation in this filter bank. The small profile of this design makes SuperSpec a natural choice to produce a multi-object spectrometer for tomographic mapping or galaxy redshift surveys. We have recently fabricated a device that is a 50 channel subset of a full 280 channel filter bank, which would cover the 190- 310 GHz range at R = 275. Analysis of the data from this device informs us of the potential design modifications to enable a high-yield background-limited SuperSpec spectrometer. The results indicate that this subset filter bank can scale up to a full filter bank with only a few collisions in readout space and less than 20% variation in responsivity for the detectors. Additionally, the characterization of this and other prototype devices suggests that the noise performance is limited by generation-recombination noise. Finally, we find that the detectors are sufficiently sensitive for ground-based spectroscopy at R = 100, appropriate for tomographic mapping experiments. Further modifications are required to reach the background limit for R = 400, ideal for spectroscopy of individual galaxies.

This paper focuses on leveraging the Executable System Engineering Method (ESEM) [1] [2], which automates requirements verification (e.g. power and mass budget margins and duration analysis of operational modes) using executable SysML [3] models. The particular value proposition is to integrate requirements, and executable behavior and performance models for certain types of system level analysis. The models are created with modeling patterns that involve structural, behavioral and parametric diagrams, and are managed by an open source Model Based Engineering Environment (named OpenMBEE [4]). This paper demonstrates how the ESEM is applied in conjunction with OpenMBEE to create key engineering products (e.g. operational concept document) for the Alignment and Phasing System (APS) within the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project [5], which is under development by the TMT International Observatory (TIO) [5].

Optical error budgeting using linearized ray-trace models	MODELING, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOR ASTRONOMY VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Modeling, Systems Engineering, and Project Management for Astronomy VII	JUN 26-28, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Wavefront error; linearized ray-trace; wavefront control		The Root-Sum-Squared, or "RSS" wavefront error model is a simple, scalar tool, commonly used for space telescope error budgeting. At the same time, much more detailed models, combining ray-trace and Fourier optics with optical alignments and wavefront controls, can provide accurate, high-resolution simulations for detailed system and subsystem design. This paper makes a connection between the two modeling approaches by deriving RSS model coefficients from ray-trace models, including the effects of wavefront controls, for computing system performance from component error statistics. It is shown that, properly constructed, the simple RSS error budget is a covariance analysis, and can be as accurate as high-resolution wavefront models for statistical wavefront error prediction. A notional segmented-aperture space telescope is used to illustrate this error modeling process.

The extreme accuracy required for both probes can only be achieved by observing from space in order to limit all observational biases in the measurements of the tracer galaxies. Weak Lensing requires an extremely high precision measurement of galaxy shapes realised with the Visual Imager (VIS) as well as photometric redshift measurements using near-infrared photometry provided by the Near Infrared Spectrometer Photometer (NISP). Galaxy Clustering requires accurate redshifts (Delta z/(z+1)< 0.1%) of galaxies to be obtained by the NISP Spectrometer. Performance requirements on spacecraft, telescope assembly, scientific instruments and the ground data-processing have been carefully budgeted to meet the demanding top level science requirements. As part of the mission development, the verification of scientific performances needs mission-level end-to-end analyses in which the Euclid systems are modeled from as-designed to final as-built flight configurations. We present the plan to carry out end-to-end analysis coordinated by the ESA project team with the collaboration of the Euclid Consortium. The plan includes the definition of key performance parameters and their process of verification, the input and output identification and the management of applicable mission configurations in the parameter database.

High contrast imaging (HCI) instruments equipped with coronagraphs are built to meet these challenges, providing a way of spatially suppressing and separating stellar flux from that of a planet. Another way of separating stellar flux can be achieved by high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS), exploiting the fact that spectral features are different between a star and a planet. Observing exoplanets with HCI+HRS will achieve a higher contrast than the spatial or the spectroscopic method alone, improving the sensitivity to planet detection and enabling the study of the physical and chemical processes. Here, we simulate the performance of a HCI+HRS instrument (i.e., the upgrade Keck NIRSPEC and the fiber injection unit) to study its potential in detecting and characterizing currently known directly imaged planets. The simulation considers the spectral information content of an exoplanet, telescope and instrument specifications and realistic noise sources. The result of the simulation helps to set system requirement and informs designs at system-level.

We present our detailed investigation results on the adequacy of such a limited number of finite subband filters in achieving broadband dark hole contrast with a shaped pupil coronagraph (SPC). The study is based on diffraction propagation modeling with realistic WFIRST optics, where each subband's image plane electric field is estimated from pairwise pupil plane deformable mirror (DM) probing and image plane intensity averaging of the resulting fields of multiple (subband) wavelengths. Multiple subband choices and probing and control strategies are explored, including standard subband probing; mixed wavelength and/or weighted Jacobian matrix; subband probing with intensity subtraction; and extended subband probing with intensity subtraction. Overall, the investigation shows that the achievable contrast with a limited number of finite subbands is about 2 similar to 2.5x worse than the designed contrast for the current SPC. The result suggests that future shaped pupil designs should be optimized for slightly broader bandwidths than the intended science bandpasses if limited subbands are used for wavefront sensing via probing.

However, it is unclear how models of gene networks that use delays should be modified when considering time-dependent changes in temperature. This is important, as delay is often used in models of genetic oscillators that can be entrained by periodic fluctuations in temperature. Here, we analytically derive the time dependence of delay distributions in response to time-varying temperature changes. We find that the resulting time-varying delay is nonlinearly dependent on parameters of the time-varying temperature such as amplitude and frequency; therefore, applying an Arrhenius scaling may result in erroneous conclusions. We use these results to examine a model of a synthetic gene oscillator with temperature compensation. We show that temperature entrainment follows from the same mechanism that results in temperature compensation. Under a common Arrhenius scaling alone, the frequency of the oscillator is sensitive to changes in the mean temperature but robust to changes in the frequency of a periodically time-varying temperature. When a mechanism for temperature compensation is included in the model, however, we show that the oscillator is entrained by periodically varying temperature even when maintaining insensitivity to the mean temperature.

Here we show that the cost of optical surfaces within large aperture telescope/instrument systems can exceed $100M/reflection when expressed in terms of the aperture increase needed to over come internal absorption loss. We recommend a program in innovative optical design to minimize the number of surfaces by considering multiple functions for mirrors. An example is given using the Rowland circle imaging spectrometer systems for UV space science. With few exceptions, current space telescope architectures are based on systems optimized for ground-based astronomy. Both HST and JWST are classical "Cassegrain" telescopes derived from the ground-based tradition to co-locate the massive primary mirror and the instruments at the same end of the metrology structure. This requirement derives from the dual need to minimize observatory dome size & cost in the presence of the Earth's 1-g gravitational field. Space telescopes, however function in the zero gravity of space and the 1-g constraint is relieved to the advantage of astronomers. Here we suggest that a prime focus large aperture telescope system in space may have potentially have higher transmittance, better pointing, improved thermal and structural control, less internal polarization and broader wavelength coverage than Cassegrain telescopes. An example is given showing how UV astronomy telescopes use single optical elements for multiple functions and therefore have a minimum number of reflections.	[Breckinridge, J.

We describe image formation in-terms of interferometry and use the Fresnel polarization equations to show how light, upon propagation through an optical system become partially polarized. We make the observation that orthogonally polarized light does not interfere to form an intensity image. We show how the two polarization aberrations (diattenuation & and retardance) distort the system PSF, decrease transmittance, and increase unwanted background above that predicted using scalar models. We show that in the presence of small geometric aberrations, polarization aberrations reduce coronagraph contrast and increase inner working angle (IWA) to limit the scientific yield of telescopes and instruments designed to detect & characterize exoplanets. The results we show here do not include a PSF for pointing and control, but are for the complex optical system only, and show the limit in the presence of zero pointing error and perfect alignment. We apply the polarization aberration theory (PolAbT) described earlier (Breckinridge, Lam & Chipman, 2015) to the fore-optics of the system designed for AFTA-WFIRST-CGI to obtain a performance estimate. Analysis of the open-literature design using PolAbT leads us to estimate that the WFIRST-CGI if built to the current design will give a contrast (3 lambda / D) in the 10-'regime at the occulting mask. Not the 10-9 contrast (3 lambda / D)calculated by the project54. An accurate number for the contrast and inner working angle (IWA) awaits the opportunity to use POLARIS-M or other polarization code correctly, to map the complex wavefront through the end-to-end WFIRST CGI telescope-coronagraph system. These new values will change the exoplanet yield calculation to reduce the number of exoplanets WFIRST-CGI will observe. We remind the reader: 1. Polarizers are operators, not filters in the same sense as colored filters, 2. Adaptive optics does not correct polarization aberrations, 3. Calculations of both diattenuation and retardance are needed to model real-world telescope/coronagraph systems. 4. The form birefringence of the highly reflecting mirrors needs to be determined.

The maturing of high contrast imaging and starlight suppression techniques for future NASA exoplanet characterization missions	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Exoplanets; coronagraph; starshade; high contrast; starlight suppression	PUPIL LYOT CORONAGRAPHS; EARTH-LIKE PLANETS; PIAA CORONAGRAPHY; STARSHADE; REQUIREMENTS; DESIGNS	Over 3000 exoplanets and hundreds of exoplanetary systems have been detected to date and we are now rapidly moving toward an era where the focus is shifting from detection to direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of these new worlds and their atmospheres. NASA is currently studying several exoplanet characterization mission concepts for the 2020 Decadal Survey ranging from probe class to flagships. Detailed and comprehensive exoplanet characterization, particularly of exo-Earths, leading to assessment of habitability, or indeed detection of life, will require significant advances beyond the current state-of-the-art in high contrast imaging and starlight suppression techniques which utilize specially shaped precision optical elements to block the light from the parent star while controlling scattering and diffraction thus revealing and enabling spectroscopic study of the orbiting exoplanets in reflected light. In this paper we describe the two primary high contrast starlight suppression techniques currently being pursued by NASA: 1) coronagraphs (including several design variations) and 2) free-flying starshades. These techniques are rapidly moving from the technology development phase to the design and engineering phase and we discuss the prospects and projected performance for future exoplanet characterization missions utilizing these techniques coupled with large aperture telescopes in space.

The latest results from DICE (Detector Interferometric Calibration Experiment)	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		exoplanets; astrometry; space telescope; centroid; calibration; micro -pixel accuracy; interferometry; metrology; data processing		Theia is an astrometric mission proposed to ESA in 2014 for which one of the scientific objectives is detecting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby solar-type stars. This objective requires the capability to measure stellar centroids at the precision of 1 x 10-5 pixel. Current state-of-the-art methods for centroid estimation have reached a precision of about 3 x 10-5 pixel at two times Nyquist sampling, this was shown at the JPL by the VESTA experiment. A metrology system was used to calibrate intra and inter pixel quantum efficiency variations in order to correct pixelation errors. The Theia consortium is operating a testbed in vacuum in order to achieve 1 x 10-5 pixel precision for the centroid estimation. The goal is to provide a proof of concept for the precision requirement of the Theia spacecraft. The testbed consists of two main sub-systems. The first one produces pseudo stars: a blackbody source is fed into a large core fiber and lights-up a pinhole mask in the object plane, which is imaged by a mirror on the CCD. The second sub-system is the metrology, it projects young fringes on the CCD. The fringes are created by two single mode fibers facing the CCD and fixed on the mirror. In this paper we present the latest experiments conducted and the results obtained after a series of upgrades on the testbed was completed. The calibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy estimated at 4 x 10-4 pixel. After including the pixel position information, an astrometric accuracy of 6 x 10-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more than 5 pixels. In the static mode (small jitter motion of less than 1 x 10-3 pixel), a photon noise limited precision of 3 x 10-5 pixel was reached.

JOST is complementary to existing testbeds for JWST (e.g. the Ball Aerospace Testbed Telescope TBT) given its compact scale and flexibility, ease of use, and colocation at the JWST Science & Operations Center. The design of JOST reproduces the physics of JWST's three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) using three custom aspheric lenses. It provides similar quality image as JWST (80% Strehl ratio) over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module, but at 633 nm. An Iris AO segmented mirror stands for the segmented primary mirror of JWST. Actuators allow us to control (1) the 18 segments of the segmented mirror in piston, tip, tilt and (2) the second lens, which stands for the secondary mirror, in tip, tilt and x, y, z positions. We present the full linear control alignment infrastructure developed for JOST, with an emphasis on multi-field wavefront sensing and control. Our implementation of the Wavefront Sensing (WFS) algorithms using phase diversity is experimentally tested. The wavefront control (WFC) algorithms, which rely on a linear model for optical aberrations induced by small misalignments of the three lenses, are tested and validated on simulations.

Modelling Effects of Common Molecular Contaminants on the Euclid Infrared Detectors	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		Euclid; mercury cadmium telluride detectors; infrared focal planes; IR detector arrays; contamination	OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; ZNS	Cleanliness specifications for infrared detector arrays are usually so stringent that effects are neglibile. However, the specifications determine only the level of particulates and areal density of molecular layer on the surface, but the chemical composition of these contaminants are not specified. Here, we use a model to assess the impact on system quantum efficiency from possible contaminants that could accidentally transfer or cryopump to the detector during instrument or spacecraft testing and on orbit operation. Contaminant layers thin enough to meet typical specifications, < 0.5 mu gram/cm(2), have a negligible effect on the net quantum efficiency of the detector, provided that the contaminant does not react with the detector surface, Performance impacts from these contaminant plating onto the surface become important for thicknesses 5 - 50 mu gram/cm(2). Importantly, detectable change in the "ripple" of the anti reflection coating occurs at these coverages and can enhance the system quantum efficiency. This is a factor 10 less coverage for which loss from molecular absorption lines is important. Thus, should contamination be suspected during instrument test or flight, detailed modelling of the layer on the detector and response to very well known calibrations sources would be useful to determine the impact on detector performance.

A dynamic Zernike wavefront sensor (WFS) with four phase shifts, for reducing error due to spurious light and eliminating other asynchronous noise, has been proposed for use in adaptive optics. Here, we propose adapting this method for co-phasing the primary mirror of a segmented space telescope. In order to extend the dynamic range of the WFS, which has a maximum range of +/ A/2, a phase contrast plate with multiple steps, both positive and negative, has been developed such that errors as large as +/ 10A can be sensed. The manufacturing tolerances have been incorporated into simulations, which demonstrate that performance impacts are minimal. We show that the addition of this small optical plate along with a high precision linear translation stage at the prime focus of a telescope and pupil viewing capability can provide extremely accurate segment phasing with a simple white-light fringe fitting algorithm and a closed-loop controller. The original focal-plane geometry of a centro-symmetric phase shifting element is replaced with a much less constrained shape, such as a slot. Also, a dedicated pupil imager is not strictly required; an existing pupil sampler such as a Shack-Hartmann (SH) WFS can be used just as effectively, allowing simultaneous detection of wavefront errors using both intensity and spot positions on the SH-WFS. This could lead to an efficient synergy between Zernike and SH-WFS, enabling segment phasing in conjunction with high-dynamic range sensing.

Over the 108-day period of the round-the-clock test program, the full complement of ISIM flight instruments, structure, harness radiator, and electronics were put through a comprehensive program of thermal, optical, electrical, and operational tests.

However, the increased complexity of their aperture geometry, due to their central obstruction, support structures and segment gaps, makes high-contrast imaging very challenging. The High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) was designed to study and develop solutions for such telescope pupils using wavefront control and starlight suppression. The testbed design has the flexibility to enable studies with increasing complexity for telescope aperture geometries starting with off-axis telescopes, then on-axis telescopes with central obstruction and support structures (e.g. the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope [WFIRST]), up to on-axis segmented telescopes e.g. including various concepts for a Large UV, Optical, IR telescope (LUVOIR), such as the High Definition Space Telescope (HDST). We completed optical alignment in the summer of 2014 and a first deformable mirror was successfully integrated in the testbed, with a total wavefront error of 13nm RMS over a 18mm diameter circular pupil in open loop. HiCAT will also be provided with a segmented mirror conjugated with a shaped pupil representing the HDST configuration, to directly study wavefront control in the presence of segment gaps, central obstruction and spider. We recently applied a focal plane wavefront control method combined with a classical Lyot coronagraph on HiCAT, and we found limitations on contrast performance due to vibration effect. In this communication, we analyze this instability and study its impact on the performance of wavefront control algorithms. We present our Speckle Nulling code to control and correct for wavefront errors both in simulation mode and on testbed mode. This routine is first tested in simulation mode without instability to validate our code. We then add simulated vibrations to study the degradation of contrast performance in the presence of these effects.

Improving these techniques, several space and ground based instruments are currently developed using two deformable mirrors to correct for both phase and amplitude errors. However, as wavefront control techniques improve, more complex telescope pupil geometries (support structures, segmentation) will soon be a limiting factor for these next generation coronagraphic instruments. The technique presented in this proceeding, the Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities method, is taking advantage of the fact that most future coronagraphic instruments will include two deformable mirrors, and is proposing to find the shapes and actuator movements to correct for the effect introduced by these complex pupil geometries. For any coronagraph previously designed for continuous apertures, this technique allow to obtain similar performance in contrast with a complex aperture (with segmented and secondary mirror support structures), with high throughput and flexibility to adapt to changing pupil geometry (e.g. in case of segment failure or maintenance of the segments). We here present the results of the parametric analysis realized on the WFIRST pupil for which we obtained high contrast levels with several deformable mirror setups (size, separation between them), coronagraphs (Vortex charge 2, vortex charge 4, APLC) and spectral bandwidths. However, because contrast levels and separation are not the only metrics to maximize the scientific return of an instrument, we also included in this study the influence of these deformable mirror shapes on the throughput of the instrument and sensitivity to pointing jitters. Finally, we present results obtained on another potential space based telescope segmented aperture. The main result of this proceeding is that we now obtain comparable performance than the coronagraphs previously designed for WFIRST. First result from the parametric analysis strongly suggest that the 2 deformable mirror set up (size and distance between them) have a important impact on the performance in contrast and throughput of the final instrument.

The High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been testing both coronagraph types and demonstrated their abilities to achieve high contrast. Focal plane wavefront correction is used to estimate and mitigate aberrations. As the most time-consuming part of correction during a space mission, the acquisition of probed images for electric field estimation needs to be as short as possible. We present results from the HCIT of narrowband, low-signal wavefront estimation tests using a shaped pupil Lyot coronagraph (SPLC) designed for the WFIRST CGI. In the low-flux regime, the Kalman filter and iterated extended Kalman filter provide faster correction, better achievable contrast, and more accurate estimates than batch process estimation.

FIRSPEX opens up a relatively unexplored spectral and spatial parameter space that will produce an enormously significant scientific legacy by focusing on the properties of the multi-phase ISM, the assembly of molecular clouds in our Galaxy and the onset of star formation; topics which are fundamental to our understanding of galaxy evolution. The mission uses a heterodyne instrument and a similar to 1.2 m primary antenna to scan large areas of the sky in a number of discreet spectroscopic channels from L2. The FIRSPEX bands centered at [CI] 809 GHz, [NII] 1460 GHz, [CII] 1900 GHz and [OI] 4700 GHz have been carefully selected to target key atomic and ionic fine structure transitions difficult or impossible to access from the ground but fundamental to the study of the multi-phase ISM in the Universe. The need for state-of-the-art sensitivity dictates the use of superconducting mixers configured either as tunnel junctions or hot electron bolometers. This technology requires cooling to low temperatures, approaching 4K, in order to operate. The receivers will operate in double sideband configuration providing a total of 7 pixels on the sky. FIRSPEX will operate from L2 in both survey and pointed mode enabling velocity resolved spectroscopy of large areas of sky as well as targeted observations.	[Rigopoulou, D.; Tan, B.

The LOWFS/C uses the rejected stellar light from coronagraph to sense and suppress the telescope pointing drift and jitter as well as the low order wavefront errors due to changes in thermal loading on the telescope and the rest of the observatory. In this paper we will present an overview of the low order wavefront sensing and control subsystem for the WFIRST Coronagraph and describe the WFIRST Coronagraph LOWFS function, its design, and modeled performance. We will present experimental results on a dedicated LOWFS/C testbed that show that the LOWFS/C subsystem not only can sense pointing errors better than 0.2 mas but has also experimentally demonstrated closed loop pointing error suppression with residuals better than 0.4 mas rms per axis for the vast majority of observatory reaction wheel speeds.

Measurements of high-contrast starshade performance in the field	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		exoplanets; starshade; diffraction; occulter; field test		The external starshade is a method for the direct detection and spectral characterization of terrestrial planets around other stars, a key goal identified in ASTRO2010. In an effort to validate the starlight-suppression performance of the starshade, we have measured contrast better than 1x10(-9) using 60 cm starshades at points just beyond the starshade tips. These measurements were made over a 50% spectral bandpass, using an incoherent light source (a white LED), and in challenging outdoor test environments. Our experimental setup is designed to provide starshade to telescope separation and telescope aperture size that are scaled as closely as possible to the flight system. The measurements confirm not only the overall starlight-suppression capability of the starshade concept but also the robustness of the setup to optical disturbances such as atmospheric effects at the test site. The spectral coverage is limited only by the optics and detectors in our test setup, not by the starshade itself. Here we describe our latest results as well as detailed comparisons of the measured results to model predictions. Plans and status of the next phase of ground testing are also discussed.

A direct comparison of exoEarth yields for starshades and coronagraphs	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE		telescopes; methods:numerical; planetary systems	MISSION	The scale and design of a future mission capable of directly imaging extrasolar planets will be influenced by the detectable number (yield) of potentially Earth-like planets. Currently, coronagraphs and starshades are being considered as instruments for such a mission. We will use a novel code to estimate and compare the yields for starshade- and coronagraph-based missions. We will show yield scaling relationships for each instrument and discuss the impact of astrophysical and instrumental noise on yields. Although the absolute yields are dependent on several yet-unknown parameters, we will present several limiting cases allowing us to bound the yield comparison.

Challenges remain, however, in the technology readiness for the proposed mission. One is the discrepancies between the achieved contrasts on the testbeds and their corresponding model predictions. A series of testbed diagnoses and modeling activities were planned and carried out on the SPC testbed in order to close the gap. A very useful tool we developed was a derived "measured" testbed wavefront control Jacobian matrix that could be compared with the model-predicted "control" version that was used to generate the high contrast dark hole region in the image plane. The difference between these two is an estimate of the error in the control Jacobian. When the control matrix, which includes both amplitude and phase, was modified to reproduce the error, the simulated performance closely matched the SPC testbed behavior in both contrast floor and contrast convergence speed. This is a step closer toward model validation for high contrast coronagraphs. Further Jacobian analysis and modeling provided clues to the possible sources for the mismatch: DM misregistration and testbed optical wavefront error (WFE) and the deformable mirror (DM) setting for correcting this WFE. These analyses suggested that a high contrast coronagraph has a tight tolerance in the accuracy of its control Jacobian. Modifications to both testbed control model as well as prediction model are being implemented, and future works are discussed.

We are now building on those innovations to carry out a survey of Lyot coronagraph performance for large, segmented telescope apertures. These apertures are of the same kind under consideration for NASA's Large UV/Optical/IR (LUVOIR) observatory concept. To map the multi-dimensional design parameter space, we have developed a software toolkit to manage large sets of mask optimization programs and execute them on a computing cluster. Here we summarize a preliminary survey of 500 APLC solutions for 4 reference hexagonal telescope apertures. Several promising designs produce annular, 10(-10) contrast dark zones down to inner working angle 4 lambda(0)/D over a 15% bandpass, while delivering a half-max PSF core throughput of 18%. We also report our progress on devising solutions to the challenges of Lyot stop alignment/fabrication tolerance that arise in this contrast regime.

J	Vidick, T				Vidick, Thomas			THREE-PLAYER ENTANGLED XOR GAMES ARE NP-HARD TO APPROXIMATE	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						PCP theorem; XOR games; entangled games; Bell inequalities	PARALLEL REPETITION THEOREM; NONLOCAL STRATEGIES; INTERACTIVE PROOFS	We show that for any epsilon > 0 the problem of finding a factor (2-epsilon) approximation to the entangled value of a three-player XOR game is NP-hard. Equivalently, the problem of approximating the largest possible quantum violation of a tripartite Bell correlation inequality to within any multiplicative constant is NP-hard. These results are the first constant-factor hardness of approximation results for entangled games or quantum violations of Bell inequalities shown under the sole assumption that P not equal NP. They can be thought of as an extension of Hastad's optimal hardness of approximation results for MAX-E3-LIN2 [J. ACM, 48 (2001), pp. 798-859] to the entangled-player setting. The key technical component of our work is a soundness analysis of a plane-vs-point low-degree test against entangled players. This extends and simplifies the analysis of the multilinearity test by Ito and Vidick [Proceedings of the 53rd FOCS, IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, 2012, pp. 243-252]. Our results demonstrate the possibility of efficient reductions between entangled-player games and our techniques may lead to further hardness of approximation results.

Here a Carrier-to-Noise Ratio is derived which is similar to other optical imaging CNR definitions. The CNR value is compared to the quality of experimentally captured images recovered using the Phase Gradient Autofocus technique both with and without the presence of atmospheric turbulence. A minimum return signal CNR for the PGA to work is observed.

In this paper, we describe a cost-effective chirp linearization approach implemented on our Inverse synthetic Aperture LADAR (ISAL) imaging testbed. Our approach uses a COTS PZT for external cavity laser frequency tuning and a common self-heterodyne fiber interferometer as a frequency monitor, with a two-step hardware and software chirp linearization procedure to achieve high quality chirp. First, the nominal triangle waveform input to PZT drive is modified through an iterative process prior to ISAL imaging acquisition. Several waveforms with chirp rates between 1 and 4THz/s have been acquired with residual chirp rate error similar to +/-2% in usable region. This process generally needs to be done only once for a typical PZT that has excellent repeatability but poor linearity. The modified waveform is then used during ISAL imaging acquisition without active control while the imperfection in transmitted frequency is monitored. The received imaging data is resampled digitally based on frequency error calculated from the frequency monitor data, effectively reduce chirp nonlinearity to similar to+/-0.2% in chirp rate error. The measured system impulse response from return signal shows near designed range resolution of a few mm, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.

Model Based Mission Assurance: NASA's Assurance Future	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM 2016 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium	JAN 25-28, 2016	Tucson, AZ	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Amer Soc Qual Control Elect Div, IEEE, Ints Environm Sci & Technol, Inst Ind Engineers, SAE Int, SOLE, Soc Reliabil Engineers, Syst Safety Soc, American Society of Quality Control Reliabil Div		Assurance; Model Based Systems Engineering		Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is seeing increased application in planning and design of NASA's missions. This suggests the question: what will be the corresponding practice of Model Based Mission Assurance (MBMA)? Contemporaneously, NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evaluating a new objectives-based approach to standards to ensure that the Safety and Mission Assurance disciplines and programs are addressing the challenges of NASA's changing missions, acquisition and engineering practices, and technology. MBSE is a prominent example of a changing engineering practice. We use NASA's objectives-based strategy for Reliability and Maintainability as a means to examine how MBSE will affect assurance. We surveyed MBSE literature to look specifically for these affects, and find a variety of them discussed (some are anticipated, some are reported from applications to date). Predominantly these apply to the early stages of design, although there are also extrapolations of how MBSE practices will have benefits for testing phases. As the effort to develop MBMA continues, it will need to clearly and unambiguously establish the roles of uncertainty and risk in the system model. This will enable a variety of uncertainty-based analyses to be performed much more rapidly than ever before and has the promise to increase the integration of CRM (Continuous Risk Management) and PRA (Probabilistic Risk Analyses) even more fully into the project development life cycle. Various views and viewpoints will be required for assurance disciplines, and an over-arching viewpoint will then be able to more completely characterize the state of the project/program as well as (possibly) enabling the safety case approach for overall risk awareness and communication.

Characterizing and Managing System Risks with Selective Redundancy during Early Mission Formulation	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM 2016 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium	JAN 25-28, 2016	Tucson, AZ	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Amer Soc Qual Control Elect Div, IEEE, Ints Environm Sci & Technol, Inst Ind Engineers, SAE Int, SOLE, Soc Reliabil Engineers, Syst Safety Soc, American Society of Quality Control Reliabil Div		ALARP; decision traps; elicitation; RIDM		NASA payload medium-risk projects encounter an architectural need to identify and manage risks associated with selective redundancy. An innovative technique has been developed and implemented on two JPL instruments to help managers make risk-informed decisions during early mission formulation, when design details are often sparse. The process relies on an elicitation approach intended to balance the potential benefits of redundancy against the adverse reliability impacts of additional complexity, potential deviations from heritage practices, and the risk significance/likelihood of a single string failure. Experts in hardware, software, parts, and reliability are asked to rate the likelihood of a system failure due to six broad reliability factors. Those ratings are averaged. Then the experts are asked to rate the likelihood of failure of the same system if it were to be made redundant. While the ratings are subjective, the technique described strives to unify and normalize the ratings between experts and systems. The ratio between the averaged redundant and single-string ratings is called the "improvement factor" and is used to rank redundant systems' ability to lower technical performance risk. By presenting items with the greatest improvement factors on the NASA 5x5 risk matrix, managers can more easily visualize the risk reduction provided by redundancy. The process has been well received at JPL (nominated for a NASA Systems Engineering Excellence Award, as a "unique and immensely useful exercise in quantifying the benefit of redundancy"). It is currently in-use on several Earth science missions, and will be incorporated into the formulation phase of future missions.	[Tseng, D. S.; Everline, C. J.; Plourde, K.

J	Sementa, L; Andreussi, O; Goddard, WA; Fortunelli, A				Sementa, Luca; Andreussi, Oliviero; Goddard, William A., III; Fortunelli, Alessandro			Catalytic activity of Pt-38 in the oxygen reduction reaction from first-principles simulations	CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; FUEL-CELL CATHODE; IN-SITU; CLUSTERS; NANOPARTICLES; WATER; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; DISSOCIATION	The activity of truncated octahedral Pt-38 clusters as a catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is investigated via first-principles simulations. Three catalytic steps: O-2 dissociation (O-2ads -> 2O(ads)), O hydration (O-ads + H2Oads -> 2OH(ads)), and H2O formation (OHads + H-ads -> H2Oads) are considered, in which all reactant species are co-adsorbed on the Pt-38 cluster according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The minimum structures and saddle points for these different steps are then calculated at the density-functional theory (DFT) level using a gradient-corrected exchange-correlation (xc-) functional and taking into account the effect of the solvent via a self-consistent continuum solvation model. Moreover, first-principles molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in which the H2O solvent is explicitly described are performed to explore dynamic phenomena such as fast hydrogen transfer via meta-stable hydronium-type configurations and their possible role in ORR reaction paths. By comparing the present findings with previous results on the Pt(111) surface, it is shown that in such a nanometer-size cluster the rate-determining-step (rds) corresponds to H2O formation, at variance with the extended surface in which O hydration was rate-determining, and that the overall reaction barrier is actually increased with respect to the extended system. This is in agreement with and rationalizes experimental results showing a decrease of ORR catalytic activity in the nanometer-size cluster range.

Using the Zeiss SL-30 slit lamp - a standard ophthalmic scope widely used by clinicians, we have demonstrated an optical readout distance of 12 cm from a micromachined TOP sensor implanted in an ex-vivo rabbit eye. We show that we have achieved this readout distance by (1) redesigning the sensing area of the IOP sensor and its fabrication steps to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio; and (2) incorporating a novel robust detection algorithm, which includes a much-improved opto-mechanical model, that allows us to remove the background noise and instantaneously map the sensor's optical signal to the corresponding IOP value. A significant increase in readout distance accomplished using a well established ophthalmic clinical scope makes our IOP system a more clinically viable choice.

In addition to dose enhancement through increased attenuation of ionizing radiation relative to biological tissue, scintillating nanoparticles can transfer energy to coupled photosensitizers to amplify production of reactive oxygen species, as well as provide UV-visible emission for optical imaging. Lanthanum fluoride is a transparent material that is easily prepared as nanocrystals, and which can provide radioluminescence at a number of wavelengths through simple substitution of lanthanum ions with other luminescent lanthanides. We have prepared lanthanum fluoride nanoparticles doped with cerium, terbium, or both, that have good spectral overlap with chlorin e6 or Rose Bengal photosensitizer molecules. We have also developed a strategy for stable conjugation of the photosensitizers to the nanoparticle surface, allowing for high energy transfer efficiencies on a per molecule basis. Additionally, we have succeeded in making our conjugates colloidally stable under physiological conditions. Here we present our latest results, using nanoparticles and nanoparticle-photosensitizer conjugates to demonstrate radiation dose enhancement in B16 melanoma cells. The effects of nanoparticle treatment prior to 250 kVp x-ray irradiation were investigated through clonogenic survival assays and cell cycle analysis. Using a custom apparatus, we have also observed scintillation of the nanoparticles and conjugates under the same conditions that the cell samples are irradiated.

The most well-known method for generating arbitrary complex amplitude fields is to display an off-axis computer-generated hologram (CGH) on a spatial light modulator (SLM). However, in this method, a desired complex amplitude field is obtained with first order diffraction light. This critically lowers the light utilization efficiency. On the other hand, in the SCM, the desired complex field is provided with zeroth order diffraction light. For this reason, our technology can generate spatial modes with large light utilization efficiency in addition to high accuracy. In this study, first, a numerical simulation was performed to verify that the SCM is applicable for spatial mode generation. Next, we made a comparison from two view points of the coupling efficiency and the light utilization between our technology and the technology using an off-axis amplitude hologram as a representative complex amplitude generation method. The simulation results showed that our technology can achieve considerably high light utilization efficiency while maintaining the enough coupling efficiency comparable to the technology using an off-axis amplitude hologram. Finally, we performed an experiment on spatial modes generation using the SCM. Experimental results showed that our technology has the great potential to realize the spatial mode generation with high accuracy.

Characterization of a prototype for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Mu2e experiment	NUOVO CIMENTO C-COLLOQUIA AND COMMUNICATIONS IN PHYSICS			English	Article								The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab searches the neutrinoless conversion of the muon into electron in the field of an Aluminum nucleus. The observation of this process would be a proof of the Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV). In case of no observation, the upper limit will be set to R-mu e < 6x10(-17) @ 90% CL, improving by a factor of 4 the previous best determination. The Mu2e detector apparatus consists of a straw tubes tracker that will measure the electrons momentum, and an electromagnetic calorimeter that provides a tracking-independent measurement of the electron energy, time and position. In this paper, we describe the baseline project of the EMC and present results in terms of performances and R&D.

Robot perception systems for applications in urban environments need to function effectively in the presence of such materials; however, both passive and active 3-D perception systems have difficulties with them. In this paper, we develop an approach using a stereo pair of polarization cameras to improve passive 3-D perception of specular surfaces. We use a commercial stereo camera pair with rotatable polarization filters in front, of each lens to capture images with multiple orientations of the polarization filter. From these images, we estimate the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and the angle of polarization (AOP) at each pixel in at least one camera. The AOP constrains the corresponding surface normal in the scene to lie in the plane of the observed angle of polarization. We embody this constraint, an energy functional for a regufarization-based stereo vision algorithm. This paper describes the theory of polarization needed for this approach, describes the new stereo vision algorithm, presents results on synthetic and real images to evaluate performance.

An autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) capable of navigating stealthily at night in offroad and on-road terrain could significantly increase the safety and success rate of such resupply missions for warfighters. Passive night-time perception of terrain and obstacle features is a vital requirement for such missions. As part of the ONR 30 Autonomy Team, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a passive, low-cost night-time perception system under the ONR Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism Applied Research program. Using a stereo pair of forward looking LWIR uncooled microbolometer cameras, the perception system generates disparity maps using a local window-based stereo correlator to achieve real-time performance while maintaining low power consumption. To overcome the lower signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of LWIR thermal imaging technologies, a series of pre-filters were applied to the input images to increase the image contrast and stereo correlator enhancements were applied to increase the disparity density. To overcome false positives generated by mixed pixels, noisy disparities from repeated textures, and uncertainty in far range measurements, a series of consistency, multi-resolution, and temporal based post-filters were employed to improve the fidelity of the output range measurements. The stereo processing leverages multi-core processors and runs under the Robot Operating System (ROS). The night-time passive perception system was tested and evaluated on fully autonomous testbed ground vehicles at SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. This paper describes the challenges, techniques, and experimental results of developing a passive, low-cost perception system for night-time autonomous navigation.

We propose a new framework for frequency control and congestion management. We formulate an optimization problem that rebalances power, restores the nominal frequency, restores inter-area flows and maintains line flows below their limits in a way that minimizes the control cost. The cost can be squared deviations from the reference generations, minimizing the disruption from the last optimal dispatch. Our control thus maintains system security without interfering with the market operation. By deriving a primal-dual algorithm to solve this optimization, we design a completely decentralized primary frequency control without the need for explicit communication among the participating agents, and a distributed unified control which integrates primary and secondary frequency control and congestion management. Simulations show that the unified control not only achieves all the desired control goals in system equilibrium, but also improves the transient compared to traditional control schemes.

Los Angeles megacity: a high-resolution land-atmosphere modelling system for urban CO2 emissions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							FOSSIL-FUEL CO2; ERROR CHARACTERIZATION; TRANSPORT MODELS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CANOPY MODEL; HEAT-ISLAND; SCALE; INVERSIONS; SURFACE; LAYER	Megacities are major sources of anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions. The spatial extents of these large urban systems cover areas of 10 000 km(2) or more with complex topography and changing landscapes. We present a high-resolution land-atmosphere modelling system for urban CO2 emissions over the Los Angeles (LA) megacity area. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)Chem model was coupled to a very high-resolution FFCO2 emission product, Hestia-LA, to simulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations across the LA megacity at spatial resolutions as fine as similar to 1 km. We evaluated multiple WRF configurations, selecting one that minimized errors in wind speed, wind direction, and boundary layer height as evaluated by its performance against meteorological data collected during the CalNex-LA campaign (May-June 2010). Our results show no significant difference between moderate-resolution (4 km) and high-resolution (1.3 km) simulations when evaluated against surface meteorological data, but the highresolution configurations better resolved planetary boundary layer heights and vertical gradients in the horizontal mean winds. We coupled our WRF configuration with the Vul-can 2.2 (10 km resolution) and Hestia-LA (1.3 km resolution) fossil fuel CO2 emission products to evaluate the impact of the spatial resolution of the CO2 emission products and the meteorological transport model on the representation of spatiotemporal variability in simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that high spatial resolution in the fossil fuel CO2 emissions is more important than in the atmospheric model to capture CO2 concentration variability across the LA megacity. Finally, we present a novel approach that employs simultaneous correlations of the simulated atmospheric CO2 fields to qualitatively evaluate the greenhouse gas measurement network over the LA megacity. Spatial correlations in the atmospheric CO2 fields reflect the coverage of individual measurement sites when a statistically significant number of sites observe emissions from a specific source or location. We conclude that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the LA megacity are composed of multiple fine-scale plumes rather than a single homogenous urban dome. Furthermore, we conclude that FFCO2 emissions monitoring in the LA megacity requires FFCO2 emissions modelling with similar to 1 km resolution because coarser-resolution emissions modelling tends to overestimate the observational constraints on the emissions estimates.

J	Granados-Munoz, MJ; Leblanc, T				Granados-Munoz, Maria Jose; Leblanc, Thierry			Tropospheric ozone seasonal and long-term variability as seen by lidar and surface measurements at the JPL-Table Mountain Facility, California	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MARINE BOUNDARY-LAYER; STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; NORTH-AMERICA; AIR-QUALITY; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; INCREASING OZONE; ASIAN EMISSIONS; MIXING RATIOS; WATER-VAPOR	A combined surface and tropospheric ozone climatology and interannual variability study was performed for the first time using co-located ozone photometer measurements (2013-2015) and tropospheric ozone differential absorption lidar measurements (2000-2015) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Table Mountain Facility (TMF; elev. 2285 m), in California. The surface time series were investigated both in terms of seasonal and diurnal variability. The observed surface ozone is typical of high-elevation remote sites, with small amplitude of the seasonal and diurnal cycles, and high ozone values, compared to neighboring lower altitude stations representative of urban boundary layer conditions. The ozone mixing ratio ranges from 45 ppbv in the winter morning hours to 65 ppbv in the spring and summer afternoon hours. At the time of the lidar measurements (early night), the seasonal cycle observed at the surface is similar to that observed by lidar between 3.5 and 9 km. Above 9 km, the local tropopause height variation with time and season impacts significantly the ozone lidar observations. The frequent tropopause folds found in the vicinity of TMF (27% of the time, mostly in winter and spring) produce a dual-peak vertical structure in ozone within the fold layer, characterized by higher-than-average values in the bottom half of the fold (12-14 km), and lower-than-averaged values in the top half of the fold (14-18 km). This structure is consistent with the expected origin of the air parcels within the fold, i.e., mid-latitude stratospheric air folding down below the upper tropospheric sub-tropical air. The influence of the tropopause folds extends down to 5 km, increasing the ozone content in the troposphere. No significant signature of interannual variability could be observed on the 2000-2015 de-seasonalized lidar time series, with only a statistically non-significant positive anomaly during the years 2003-2007. Our trend analysis reveals however an overall statistically significant positive trend of 0.3 ppbv year(-1) (0.6 %) in the free troposphere (7-10 km) for the period 2000-2015. A classification of the air parcels sampled by lidar was made at 1 km intervals between 5 and 14 km altitude, using 12-day backward trajectories (HYSPLIT, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model). Our classification revealed the influence of the Pacific Ocean, with air parcels of low ozone content (43-60 ppbv below 9 km), and significant influence of the stratosphere leading to ozone values of 57-83 ppbv down to 8-9 km. In summer, enhanced ozone values (76 ppbv at 9 km) were found in air parcels originating from Central America, probably due to the enhanced thunderstorm activity during the North American Monsoon. Influence from Asia was observed throughout the year, with more frequent episodes during spring, associated with ozone values from 53 to 63 ppbv at 9 km.

Handling such an emergency requires a graceful power capping solution that minimizes the performance loss. In this paper, we study power capping in a multi-tenant data center where the operator supplies power to multiple tenants that manage their own servers. Unlike owner-operated data centers, the operator lacks control over tenants' servers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel market mechanism based on supply function bidding, called COOP, to financially incentivize and coordinate tenants' power reduction for minimizing total performance loss (quantified in performance cost) while satisfying multiple power capping constraints. We build a prototype to show that COOP is efficient in terms of minimizing the total performance cost, even compared to the ideal but infeasible case that assumes the operator has full control over tenants' servers. We also demonstrate that COOP is "win-win", increasing the operator's profit (through oversubscription) and reducing tenants' cost (through financial compensation for their power reduction during emergencies).

Increasingly, a broad range of science and user communities have come to depend on the quasi-global precipitation analyses that intercalibrate and merge these individual PMW precipitation data streams. At present, the constellation of precipitation-relevant conical and cross-track scanning multichannel PMW instruments depends on many satellites past their design life and in continued operation by the responsible agencies. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Water Strategy and subsequent discussions in Coordinating Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) and Committee on Earth Observing Systems (CEOS) have raised the issue of how a robust future precipitation constellation should be constructed. We discuss how retrievals are impacted by sensor resolution and channel diversity, the observation interval, and the use of a quasi-operational satellite precipitation radar for calibration. Specifically: 1) Sensor footprints larger than about 5-10 km start to introduce significant amounts of non-linearity in the retrievals, the so-called beam-filling problem. 2) Channel diversity has been shown to be necessary for covering the range of precipitation rates and types (liquid vs. solid). As well, diverse polarization at a given frequency is also important. 3) An observation interval less than three hours for every time around the day barely accommodates the required revist times for cloud-scale precipitating systems. 4) The precipitation radars on the precessing TRMM and GPM Core Observatory satellites have demonstrated the utility of routine calibration for precipitation estimates across all the PMW sensors (and in the case of GPM this is done for most of the Earth's climate zones). Such considerations are critical to the discussion on how to shift to a new, more diverse generation of precipitation-relevant sensors while preserving the characteristics that provide (and support continued innovation of) quality PMW retrievals and value-added products that many users find attractive.

The retrieval of this information is best achieved with a range of receiver channels across the submillimeter wave range. Advancement of low noise Indium Phosphide (InP) MMIC amplifier technology enabled us to develop miniature submillimeter-wave receivers for a CubeSat scale instrument that achieves 6 km spatial resolution. The heritage of InP MMICs includes continuous operation for four years in the PLANCK Low Frequency Instrument and providing world-record sensitivity with high reliability in several airborne instruments. We have developed a set of InP MMICs for receivers at 240, 310, 380 and 670 GHz with significantly lower noise than previously reported. The noise temperature is NT=450 K at 240 GHz, NT=550K at 310 GHz and NT=650 K at 380 GHz. The 670 GHz LNAs provide a NT of 2400 K. These channels are complemented by the previously-developed and airborne-proven 183 and 118 GHz MMIC receivers that were tested to TRL 6.

In particular, subgrid models based on deconvolution will be discussed. An interesting connection between the tensor diffusivity model, a particular version of a deconvolution model, and Lagrangian particle methods for the vorticity transport equation and for the scalar convection-diffusion equation will be explored. In addition, the possibility of using super-resolution, i.e. recovering fine-scale information knowing only coarse-scale information, in LES will be investigated.

Here we describe our progress towards a nanophotonic quantum memory based on a rare-earth (Neodymium) doped yttrium orthosilicate (YSO) photonic crystal resonator. The Purcell-enhanced coupling of the 883 run transitions of Neodymium (Nd3+) ions to the nano-resonator results in increased optical depth, which could in principle facilitate highly efficient photon storage via cavity impedance matching. The atomic frequency comb (AFC) memory protocol can be implemented in the Nd:YSO nanoresonator by efficient optical pumping into the long-lived Zeeman state. Coherent optical signals can be stored and retrieved from the AFC memory. We currently measure a storage efficiency on par with a bulk crystal Nd:YSO memory that is millimeters long. Our results will enable multiplexed on-chip quantum storage and thus quantum repeater devices using rare-earth-ions.

Differential column measurements using compact solar-tracking spectrometers	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PORTABLE FTIR SPECTROMETERS; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; INSTRUMENTAL LINE-SHAPE; LOS-ANGELES; CARBON-MONOXIDE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; 4 CORNERS; METHANE; CO2; VERIFICATION	We demonstrate the use of compact solar-tracking Fourier transform spectrometers (Bruker EM27/SUN) for differential measurements of the column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CH4 and CO2 within urban areas. Using Allan variance analysis, we show that the differential column measurement has a precision of 0.01% for X-CO2 and X-CH4 with an optimum integration time of 10 min, corresponding to Allan deviations of 0.04 ppm and 0.2 ppb, respectively. The sensor system is very stable over time and after relocation across the continent. We report tests of the differential column measurement, and its sensitivity to emission sources, by measuring the downwind-minus-upwind column difference Delta X-CH4 across dairy farms in the Chino area, California, and using the data to verify emissions reported in the literature. Ratios of spatial column differences Delta X-CH4/Delta X-CO2 were observed across Pasadena within the Los Angeles basin, indicating values consistent with regional emission ratios from the literature. Our precise, rapid measurements allow us to determine significant short-term variations (5-10 min) of X-CO2 and X-CH4 and to show that they represent atmospheric phenomena. Overall, this study helps establish a range of new applications for compact solar-viewing Fourier transform spectrometers. By accurately measuring the small differences in integrated column amounts across local and regional sources, we directly observe the mass loading of the atmosphere due to the influence of emissions in the intervening locale. The inference of the source strength is much more direct than in-version modeling using only surface concentrations and less subject to errors associated with small-scale transport phenomena.

The goal of the current work is to explore the validity and the limitations of the constant non-unity Lewis number approach in the description of molecular mixing in laminar and turbulent flames. To carry out this analysis, three test cases have been selected, including a lean, highly unstable, premixed hydrogen/air flame, a lean turbulent premixed n-heptane/air flame, and a laminar ethylene/air coflow diffusion flame. For the hydrogen flame, both a laminar and a turbulent configuration have been considered. The three flames are characterised by Lewis numbers which are less than unity, greater than unity, and close to unity, respectively. For each flame, mixture-averaged transport simulations are carried out and used as reference data. The current analysis suggests that, for numerous combustion configurations, the constant non-unity Lewis number approximation leads to small errors when the set of Lewis numbers is chosen properly. For the selected test cases and our numerical framework, the reduction of computational cost is found to be minimal.

J	Shaner, MR; Atwater, HA; Lewis, NS; McFarland, EW				Shaner, Matthew R.; Atwater, Harry A.; Lewis, Nathan S.; McFarland, Eric W.			A comparative technoeconomic analysis of renewable hydrogen production using solar energy	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							WATER; DEVICE; PHOTOANODES; SIMULATION; EXPERIENCE; PHOTOLYSIS; EFFICIENCY; CONVERSION; REDUCTION; SYSTEMS	A technoeconomic analysis of photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photovoltaic- electrolytic (PV-E) solar-hydrogen production of 10 000 kg H-2 day(-1) (3.65 kilotons per year) was performed to assess the economics of each technology, and to provide a basis for comparison between these technologies as well as within the broader energy landscape. Two PEC systems, differentiated primarily by the extent of solar concentration (unconcentrated and 10 x concentrated) and two PV-E systems, differentiated by the degree of grid connectivity (unconnected and grid supplemented), were analyzed. In each case, a basecase system that used established designs and materials was compared to prospective systems that might be envisioned and developed in the future with the goal of achieving substantially lower overall system costs. With identical overall plant efficiencies of 9.8%, the unconcentrated PEC and non-grid connected PV-E system base-case capital expenses for the rated capacity of 3.65 kilotons H2 per year were $205 MM ($293 per m(2) of solar collection area (m(S)(-2)), $14.7 W-H2,P(-1)) and $260 MM ($371 m(S)(-2), $18.8 W-H2,P(-1)), respectively. The untaxed, plant-gate levelized costs for the hydrogen product (LCH) were $11.4 kg(-1) and $12.1 kg(-1) for the base-case PEC and PV-E systems, respectively. The 10 x concentrated PEC base-case system capital cost was $160 MM ($428 mS(-2), $11.5 W-H2,P(-1)) and for an efficiency of 20% the LCH was $9.2 kg(-1). Likewise, the grid supplemented base-case PV-E system capital cost was $66 MM ($441 m(S)(-2), $11.5 W-H2,P(-1)), and with solar-to-hydrogen and grid electrolysis system efficiencies of 9.8% and 61%, respectively, the LCH was $6.1 kg(-1). As a benchmark, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) based grid-connected electrolysis system was analyzed. Assuming a system efficiency of 61% and a grid electricity cost of $0.07 kWh(-1), the LCH was $5.5 kg(-1). A sensitivity analysis indicated that, relative to the base-case, increases in the system efficiency could effect the greatest cost reductions for all systems, due to the areal dependencies of many of the components. The balance-of-systems (BoS) costs were the largest factor in differentiating the PEC and PV-E systems. No single or combination of technical advancements based on currently demonstrated technology can provide sufficient cost reductions to allow solar hydrogen to directly compete on a levelized cost basis with hydrogen produced from fossil energy. Specifically, a cost of CO2 greater than similar to$800 (ton CO2)(-1) was estimated to be necessary for base-case PEC hydrogen to reach price parity with hydrogen derived from steam reforming of methane priced at $12 GJ(-1) ($1.39 (kg H-2)(-1)). A comparison with low CO2 and CO2-neutral energy sources indicated that base-case PEC hydrogen is not currently cost-competitive with electrolysis using electricity supplied by nuclear power or from fossil-fuels in conjunction with carbon capture and storage. Solar electricity production and storage using either batteries or PEC hydrogen technologies are currently an order of magnitude greater in cost than electricity prices with no clear advantage to either battery or hydrogen storage as of yet. Significant advances in PEC technology performance and system cost reductions are necessary to enable cost-effective PEC-derived solar hydrogen for use in scalable grid-storage applications as well as for use as a chemical feedstock precursor to CO2-neutral high energy-density transportation fuels. Hence such applications are an opportunity for foundational research to contribute to the development of disruptive approaches to solar fuels generation systems that can offer higher performance at much lower cost than is provided by current embodiments of solar fuels generators. Efforts to directly reduce CO2 photoelectrochemically or electrochemically could potentially produce products with higher value than hydrogen, but many, as yet unmet, challenges include catalytic efficiency and selectivity, and CO2 mass transport rates and feedstock cost. Major breakthroughs are required to obtain viable economic costs for solar hydrogen production, but the barriers to achieve cost-competitiveness with existing large-scale thermochemical processes for CO2 reduction are even greater.

The goal is to align the images in the multi sensor suite by correlating multiple key features in the images. Due to the wavelength differences, the object appears very differently in the sensor images even the sensors focus on the same object In order to perform accurate correlation of the same object in the multi-band images, we perform image processing on the images so that the features of the object become similar to each other. Fourier domain band pass filters are used to enhance the images. Mexican Hat and Gaussian Derivative Wavelets are used to further enhance the features of the object. A Python based QT graphical user interface has been implemented to carry out the process. We show reliable results of the cross-correlation of the objects in multiple band videos.

Quantifying and monitoring convection intensity from mm-wave sounder observations	REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING OF THE ATMOSPHERE, OCEANS, AND INTERACTIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of the Atmosphere, Oceans, and Interactions VI	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing	millimeter radiometer; convection; weather forecasting; climate modeling	PRECIPITATION; PARAMETERIZATION; MODEL	Few systematic attempts to interpret the measurements of mm-wave radiometers over clouds and precipitation have been made to date because the scattering signatures of hydrometeors at these frequencies are very difficult to model. The few algorithms that have been developed try to retrieve surface precipitation, to which the observations are partially correlated but not directly sensitive. In fact, over deep clouds, mm-wave radiometers are most sensitive to the scattering from solid hydrometeors within the upper levels of the cloud. In addition, mm-wave radiometers have a definite advantage over the lower-frequency window-channel radiometers in that they have finer resolution and can therefore explicitly resolve deep convection. Preliminary analyses (in particular of NOAA's MHS brightness temperatures, as well as Megha-Tropiques's SAPHIR observations) indicate that the measurements are indeed very sensitive to the depth and intensity of convection. The challenge is to derive a robust approach to make quantitative estimates of the convection, for example the height and depth of the condensed water, directly from the mm-wave observations, as a function of horizontal location. To avoid having to rely on a specific set of microphysical assumptions, this analysis exploits the substantial amount of nearly simultaneous coincident observations by mm-wave radiometers and orbiting atmospheric profiling radars in order to enforce unbiased consistency between the calculated brightness temperatures and the radar and radiometer observations.

The resonator is isolated from and mechanically coupled to the surrounding fluid using a sealed enclosure. The pressure applied to the enclosure induces a compressive stress to the resonator and reduces its resonance frequency. In principle the mechanism allows for achieving large resonance frequency shifts close to 100% of the resonance frequency. A high-pressure sensor based on the mechanism was designed for down-hole pressure monitoring in oil wells. The sensor is potentially remotely-readable via the transmission of an electromagnetic signal down a waveguide formed by the pipes in the oil well. The details of the pressure sensor design and verification by FE analysis and initial test results of a preliminary prototype are presented in this paper.

One of these applications, Sub Critical Water Extraction (SCWE), is a process where water and an environmental powder sample (sieved soil, drill cuttings, etc.) are heated in a sealed chamber to temperatures greater than 200 degrees Celsius by allowing the pressure to increase, but without reaching the critical point of water. At these temperatures, the ability of water to extract organics from solid particulate increases drastically. This paper describes the modeling and experimentation on the use of an acoustic resonant chamber which is part of an amino acid detection instrument called Astrobionibbler [Noell et al. 2014, 2015]. In this instrument we use acoustics to excite a fluid- solid fines mixture in different frequency/amplitude regimes to accomplish a variety of sample processing tasks. Driving the acoustic resonant chamber at lower frequencies can create circulation patterns in the fluid and mixes the liquid and fines, while driving the chamber at higher frequencies one can agitate the fluid and powder and create a suspension. If one then drives the chamber at high amplitude at resonance heating of the slurry occurs. In the mixing and agitating cell the particle levitation force depends on the relative densities and compressibility's of the particulate and fluid and on the kinetic and potential energy densities associated with the velocity and pressure fields [Glynne-Jones, Boltryk and Hill 2012] in the cell. When heating, the piezoelectric transducer and chamber is driven at high power in resonance where the solid/fines region is modelled as an acoustic transmission line with a large loss component. In this regime, heat is pumped into the solution/fines mixture and rapidly heats the sample. We have modeled the piezoelectric transducer/chamber/ sample using Mason's equivalent circuit. In order to assess the validity of the model we have built and tested a variety of chambers. This paper describes the experimental results which are in general agreement with theory within the limitations of the modeling.

This study utilizes high-fidelity finite element analysis with SIERRA/PRESTO codes to estimate wave propagation effects due to large-amplitude suddenly-applied pyroshock loads in the MMRTG. A high fidelity model of the TE module bar was created with similar to 30 million degrees-of-freedom (DOF). First, a quasi-static preload was applied on top of the TE module bar, then transient tri-axial displacement inputs were simultaneously applied on the preloaded module. The applied displacement inputs were derived from measured acceleration signals during MMRTG shock qualification tests performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An explicit finite element solver in the SIERRA/PRESTO computational environment, along with a 3000 processor parallel super-computing framework at NASA-AMES, was used for the simulation. The simulation results were investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The predicted shock wave propagation results provide detailed structural responses throughout the TE module bar, and key insights into the dynamic response (i.e., loads, displacements, accelerations) of critical internal spring/piston compression systems, TE materials, and internal component interfaces in the MMRTG TE module bar. They also provide confidence on the viability of this high-fidelity modeling scheme to accurately predict shock wave propagation patterns within complex structures. This analytic approach is envisioned for modeling shock sensitive hardware susceptible to intense shock environments positioned near shock separation devices in modern space vehicles and systems.

A study of the electromagnetic bias for GNSS-R ocean altimetry using the choppy wave model	WAVES IN RANDOM AND COMPLEX MEDIA			English	Article							REFLECTOMETRY; SCATTERING	Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) altimetry involves measuring reflections of Global Positioning System transmissions from the Earth's surface (a bistatic radar configuration.) These reflected signals carry information about the Earth's surface, including the sea surface height. The electromagnetic (EM) bias is a significant error source when measuring sea surface height with GNSS-R due to the non-symmetric properties of sea waves. Although previous studies of the EM bias have been conducted for traditional backscatter altimetry, information on the EM bias in the bistatic configurations important for GNSS-R is limited. Of particular interest is the influence of the bistatic geometry on the EM bias. This paper presents a study of the EM bias in GNSS-R altimetry. The study employs a Monte Carlo procedure with numerical nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a physical optics method for EM scattering from the sea surface to produce a deterministic set of sea surface profiles and the corresponding GNSS-R waveforms. In this initial study, choppy wave model is used for nonlinear surface description in order to improve further the computational efficiency and one-dimension surface analysis is chosen for the simple computations. The influence of the bistatic configuration on the EM bias properties has analyzed, and it is shown that the EM bias varies approximately as a cosine function of the incident angle and that short wave effects make important contributions.

Our work is motivated by the fact that when small parts of networks incur emergencies according to a heavy-tailed distribution, the structure of the network under resource constraints results in the entire system behaving in a heavy-tailed manner. To address this, metrics other than average-case need to be used. We achieve robust location strategies by including risk metrics that account for tail behavior and not average performance alone. Because of the exponentially large solution space for locating K ambulances in N locations on the network, our approach is based on an efficient algorithm that allows for optimizing based on these risk metrics. We show that optimizing based on risk measures can account for spatio-temporal patterns and prevent the extent of delay cascades that are typically seen in heavy-tailed arrival distributions. From our computational results based on data from a large Asian city, we show that planning with some robustness metrics as targets leads to solutions that perform well in heavy-tailed demand scenarios.

Characterization of anthropogenic methane plumes with the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES): a retrieval method and error analysis	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							LOS-ANGELES; QUANTIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; RESOLUTION; MODEL; CH4	We introduce a retrieval algorithm to estimate lower tropospheric methane (CH4) concentrations from the surface to 1 km with uncertainty estimates using Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) airborne radiance measurements. After resampling, retrievals have a spatial resolution of 6 x 6 m(2). The total error from a single retrieval is approximately 20 %, with the uncertainties determined primarily by noise and spectral interferences from air temperature, surface emissivity, and atmospheric water vapor. We demonstrate retrievals for a HyTES flight line over storage tanks near Kern River Oil Field (KROF), Kern County, California, and find an extended plume structure in the set of observations with elevated methane concentrations (3.0 +/- 0.6 to 6.0 +/- 1.2 ppm), well above mean concentrations (1.8 +/- 0.4 ppm) observed for this scene. With typically a 20% estimated uncertainty, plume enhancements with more than 1 ppm are distinguishable from the background values with its uncertainty. HyTES retrievals are consistent with simultaneous airborne and ground-based in situ CH4 mole fraction measurements within the reported accuracy of approximately 0.2 ppm (or similar to 8 %), due to retrieval interferences related to air temperature, emissivity, and H2O.

In this study, we present a new technique to estimate tropospheric turbulence strength (namely, scintillation index) by analyzing RO amplitude fluctuations in impact parameter domain. GPS RO observations from the COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) satellites enabled us to calculate global maps of scintillation measures, revealing the seasonal, latitudinal, and longitudinal characteristics of the turbulent troposphere. Such information are both difficult and expensive to obtain especially over the oceans. To verify our approach, simulation experiments using the multiple phase screen (MPS) method were conducted. The results show that scintillation indices inferred from the MPS simulations are in good agreement with scintillation measures estimated from COSMIC observations.

These models require prior estimates of CO2 fluxes at relatively high temporal resolutions (e.g., 3-hourly) because of the high frequency of atmospheric mixing and wind heterogeneity. However, land surface model CO2 fluxes are often provided at monthly time steps, typically because the land surface modeling community focuses more on time steps associated with plant phenology (e.g., seasonal) than on sub-daily phenomena. Here, we describe a new dataset created from 15 global land surface models and 4 ensemble products in the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), temporally downscaled from monthly to 3-hourly output. We provide 3-hourly output for each individual model over 7 years (2004-2010), as well as an ensemble mean, a weighted ensemble mean, and the multi-model standard deviation. Output is provided in three different spatial resolutions for user preferences: 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, 2.0 degrees x 2.5 degrees, and 4.0 degrees x 5.0 degrees (latitude x longitude).

For standoff security screening, a 340 GHz imaging radar now achieves an 8.3 Hz frame, and it has been tested using power-efficient MMIC-based active multiplier sources into its front end. That system evolved from a 680 GHz security radar platform, which has also been modified to operate in a Doppler mode for probing the dynamics of blowing sand and sensing small-amplitude target vibrations. Meanwhile, 95 and 183 GHz radars based on similar RF architectures are currently being developed to probe cometary jets in space and, using a differential absorption technique, humidity inside upper-tropospheric clouds.

In the familiarization phase, participants viewed a visual stream of natural scenes consisting of four triplets (i.e., three images that always appeared in the same order). In the subsequent target detection task, participants were required to detect target items embedded in a stream of 12 images or 12 words representing each natural scene. In the final 2AFC familiarity test, participants observed two test sequences (statistically related triplets vs. unrelated foils) and decided whether the first or second sequence was more familiar based on the familiarization phase. In both test phases, we included the same (forward) and reverse (backward) order of scenes as presented during the familiarization phase to examine whether the expression of VSL was based on temporal order of scenes or scene chunks. The results of the target detection task showed a learning effect for both temporal order in the forward condition and chunks in the backward condition, irrespective of whether stimuli were images or words; in contrast, we did not observe a learning effect in the backward condition for scene images in the familiarity test. Our findings are compatible with a learning mechanism that has both implicit and explicit components based on temporal order information and scene chunks.

A recently-developed incoherent scattering model now allows prediction of InSAR phase bias arising from the radar wave undergoing an (if neglecting radar time-gating) unending succession of subsurface specular reflections ("multi-bounce"), which is crucial for more comprehensively understanding interferometric observations (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial) of many low-loss layered structures. Our paper's results are as follows. First, for increasing subsurface wave attenuation the phase bias approaches zero (backscattering top interface) or the thickness of the subsurface slab (backscatter-free top interface). Second, increasing dielectric contrast between the central and outer two layers elevates (reduces) phase bias for a top interface weakly (strongly) backscattering power relative to the bottom interface. We conclude that subsurface scatter-enhanced phase bias should become significant primarily for geological structures characterized by a weakly-backscattering (i.e., very smooth) top interface and low-attenuating subsurface, which are attributes that may reasonably be used to describe the EM scattering properties of many manifestations of ice, snow, dry soil, and hyper-arid sand or regolith-mantled bedrock structures.

Specifically, we examine scenarios involving subsurface layers exhibiting electrical response given by deviated anisotropic tensors exhibiting low loss and high inter-layer dielectric contrast (i.e., strong subsurface wave guidance), as well as predominantly cross-pol specular interface scatter (XSIS)-based subsurface backscatter. We hypothesize that this scenario can occur within myriad layered geophysical structures containing media hosting a distribution of sub-wavelength, non-spherical inclusions with mean non-vertical orientation. Guidance-enhanced, XSIS-based backscatter we predict can dominate cross-pol InSAR observations (particularly at lower frequencies such as P-band) concerning these types of structures, leading (in the limit of stronger wave guidance) to rapid, inverse-quadratic degradation of correlation versus InSAR spatial baseline, as well as high and linearly divergent phase bias. Modeling the dominant cross pot backscatter mechanisms adds another tool for Polarimetric InSAR (PoIInSAR) data interpretation and inversion concerning sea ice and other complex layered geophysical structures which can contain media possessing effective anisotropic dielectric response.

We solve the mildly non-parallel linear parabolized stability problem for such high speed turbulent jets to model the coherent wavepackets in the flow. The base flow for the analysis is the mean flow field from a large-eddy simulation database of a cold Mach 0.9 fully turbulent jet issuing from a nozzle with six serrations, a benchmark case in the literature.

High-temperature turn-on behavior of an nBn infrared detector	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS XLII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	42 Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications XLII	APR 18-21, 2016	Baltimore, MA	SPIE		infrared detector; nBn; MWIR		High-temperature characteristics of a mid-wavelength infrared detector based on the Maimon-Wicks InAsSb/AlAsSb nBn design indicates that the quantum efficiency does not degrade when the operating temperature increases to above room temperature. However, it was also found that the turn-on bias becomes larger at higher temperatures. This counter-intuitive behavior was originally attributed to the change in the band alignment between the absorber and top contact layers due to Fermi level temperature dependence. Recent analysis shows that this is more likely due to temperature-dependent band bending effects. Dark current mechanism is analyzed based on minority carrier lifetime measurements. The difference between the responsivity and absorption quantum efficiencies is clarified.

Precipitation profiling capabilities are currently limited to a few instruments deployed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which cannot provide the temporal resolution necessary to observe the evolution of short time-scale weather phenomena and improve numerical weather prediction models. A constellation of cloud- and precipitation-profiling instruments in LEO would provide this essential capability, but the cost and timeframe of typical satellite platforms and instruments constitute a possibly prohibitive challenge. A new radar instrument architecture that is compatible with low-cost satellite platforms, such as CubeSats and SmallSats, has been designed at JPL. Its small size, moderate mass and low power requirement enable constellation missions, which will vastly expand our ability to observe weather systems and their dynamics and thermodynamics at sub-diurnal time scales down to the temporal resolutions required to observe developing convection. In turn, this expanded observational ability can revolutionize weather now-casting and medium-range forecasting, and enable crucial model improvements to improve climate predictions.

The impact of hydrometeors on the microphysical parameterization in the WRF modelling system over Southern Peninsular India	REMOTE SENSING OF THE ATMOSPHERE, CLOUDS, AND PRECIPITATION VI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere, Clouds, and Precipitation VI	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing	Indian monsoon; hydrometeors; microphysics; Purdue-Lin scheme; WRF	SIZE; COORDINATE; CONVECTION	This study examines the influence of Purdue-Lin microphysical parameterization scheme (Lin et al., 1983) on quantitative precipitation for pre-monsoon/monsoon conditions over southern peninsular India in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. An ideal microphysical scheme has to describe the formation, growth of cloud droplets and ice crystals and fall out as precipitation. Microphysics schemes can be broadly categorized into two types: bin and bulk particle size distribution (Morrison, 2010). Bulk schemes predict one or more bulk quantities and assume some functional form for the particle size distribution. For better parameterization, proper interpretation of these hydrometeors (Cloud Droplets, Raindrops, Ice Crystals and Aggregates, Rimed Ice Particles, Graupel, Hail) and non-hydrometeors (Aerosols vs. Condensation Nuclei vs. Cloud Condensation Nuclei vs. Ice Nuclei) is very important. The Purdue-Lin scheme is a commonly used microphysics scheme in WRF model utilizing the "bulk" particle size distribution, meaning that a particle size distribution is assumed. The intercept parameter (N-0) is, in fact, turns out to be independent of the density. However, in situ observations suggest (Haddad et al., 1996, 1997) that the mass weighted mean diameter is correlated with water content per unit volume (q), leading to the fact that N-0 depends on it. Here, in order to analyze the correlation of droplet size distribution with the convection, we have carried out simulations by implementing a consistent methodology to enforce a correlation between N-0 and q in the Purdue-Lin microphysics scheme in WRF model. The effect of particles in Indian Summer Monsoon has been examined using frequency distribution of rainfall at surface, daily rainfall over the domain and convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. The simulations are conducted by analyzing the maximum rainfall days in the pre-monsoon/monsoon seasons using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) accumulated rainfall data for 24 hours.

The ASIC uses an intrinsically low-power architecture along with design techniques and a process that together result in unprecedentedly low power consumption. The design is flexible in that it can support telescopes with almost any number of antennas N.

Here we report on a new reagent, a methylated free radical activated glycan sequencing reagent (Me-FRAGS), which combines a free radical precursor with a methylated pyridine moiety that can be coupled to the reducing terminus of glycans. The collisional activation of Me-FRAGS-derivatized glycans generates a nascent free radical that concurrently induces abundant glycosidic bond and cross-ring cleavage without the need for subsequent activation. The product ions resulting from glycan rearrangement, including internal residue loss and multiple external residue losses, are precluded. Glycan structures can be easily assembled and visualized using a radical driven glycan deconstruction diagram (R-DECON diagram). The presence and location of N-acetylated saccharide units and branch sites can be identified from the characteristic dissociation patterns observed only at these locations. The mechanisms of dissociation are investigated and discussed. This Me-FRAGS based mass spectrometric approach creates a new blueprint for glycan structure analysis.

Imaging motility by traditional light microscopy is limited by focus depth, requiring cells to be constrained in z. Holographic microscopy offers an instantaneous 3D snapshot of a large sample volume, and is therefore ideal in principle for quantifying unconstrained bacterial motility. However, resolving and tracking individual cells is difficult due to the low amplitude and phase contrast of the cells; the index of refraction of typical bacteria differs from that of water only at the second decimal place. In this work we present a combination of optical and samplehandling approaches to facilitating bacterial tracking by holographic phase imaging. The first is the design of the microscope, which is an off-axis design with the optics along a common path, which minimizes alignment issues while providing all of the advantages of off-axis holography. Second, we use anti-reflective coated etalon glass in the design of sample chambers, which reduce internal reflections. Improvement seen with the antireflective coating is seen primarily in phase imaging, and its quantification is presented here. Finally, dyes may be used to increase phase contrast according to the Kramers-Kronig relations. Results using three test strains are presented, illustrating the different types of bacterial motility characterized by an enteric organism (Escherichia coli), an environmental organism (Bacillus subtilis), and a marine organism (Vibrio alginolyticus). Data processing steps to increase the quality of the phase images and facilitate tracking are also discussed.

However, a major drawback of a piezoelectric bimorph is its brittle nature in harsh environments, precipitating short life-times as well as output power degradation. The emphasis in this work is to design robust, highly efficient piezoelectric harvesters that are capable of generating electrical power in the milliwatt range. Various harvesters were modeled, designed and prototyped, and the flextensional actuator based harvester, where the metal cantilever is mounted and coupled between two flextensional actuators, was found to be a viable alternative to the cantilever type piezoelectric harvesters. Preliminary tests show that these devices equipped with 5x5x36 mm two piezoelectric PZT stacks can produce greater than 50 mW of power under air flow induced vibrations.

On the design of optimal compliant walls for turbulence control	JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE			English	Article						Wall turbulence; flow control; compliant surfaces	BOUNDARY-LAYER; RESOLVENT ANALYSIS; DRAG REDUCTION; CHANNEL FLOW; SURFACE; STABILITY; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	This paper employs the resolvent framework to consider the design of compliant walls for turbulent skin friction reduction. Specifically, the effects of simple spring-damper walls are contrasted with the effects of more complex walls incorporating tension, stiffness and anisotropy. In addition, varying mass ratios are tested to provide insight into differences between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic applications. Despite the differing physical responses, all the walls tested exhibit some important common features. First, the effect of the walls (positive or negative) is the greatest at conditions close to resonance, with sharp transitions in performance across the resonant frequency or phase speed. Second, compliant walls are predicted to have a more pronounced effect on slower moving structures because such structures generally have larger wall-pressure signatures. Third, two-dimensional (spanwise constant) structures are particularly susceptible to further amplification. These features are consistent with many previous experiments and simulations, suggesting that mitigating the rise of such two-dimensional structures is essential to designing performance-improving walls. For instance, it is shown that further amplification of such large-scale two-dimensional structures explains why the optimal anisotropic walls identified in previous direct numerical simulations only led to drag reduction in very small domains.

A new monomer, M2, was prepared by capping (E)-3'-(2-(2,5-dibromothiophen-3-yl)vinyl)4,4 ''- bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2':5',2 ''-terthiophene, M1, with two heptanoyl groups, and then coupled with 5,5'-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2'-bithiophene via microwave-assisted Stille polymerization to produce a series of polythiophene derivatives with terthiophene-vinylene conjugated side chains, TTV-PTs. Copolymer P2 shows a down-shifted HOMO energy level, enhanced solubility, and red-shifted absorption, as compared with P1; however, the bulky side chains significantly disrupt the coplanarity of thiophene rings in the polymer backbone and the ability to self-assemble into an ordered structure. The GIXRD measurements reveal that the original crystallinity of P1 can be recovered by simply inserting a few 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units into the polythiophene main chain in P2 through a random copolymerization route to yield a terpolymer, P3, which possesses excellent crystallinity, thereby causing a three-fold increment in hole mobility. Furthermore, the P1/PC61BM, P2/PC61BM, and P3/PC61BM solar devices exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 3.89%, 1.52%, and 4.17%, respectively, under AM1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm(-2).

Of the two mission options that have been considered, one involves the capture of an entire near-Earth asteroid in the 10-m class by a robotic spacecraft. The spacecraft would first make contact with the asteroid through a deformable membrane, before securing it inside a large flexible bagging mechanism. In this paper we describe the development and implementation of a model designed for simulation of the capture process, which includes a low-complexity representation of the interaction dynamics.

The SysML provides the means to model requirements, functions, structure and behavior of a system. Integrating a multi body physics simulation with this language creates a seamless way to combine system level questions with the detailed design. The integration allows for the import and export of the simulation models as well as the definition of metrics on the simulation. The system model can be used to express the requirements, the tests that verify the satisfaction and the implementation of the system according to these requirements. Having all the different aspects in one central model reduces the thread of inconsistencies through reuse and linking of model elements. The SysML model allows for an easier creation of large models and the integration with other disciplines is already prepared.

Given kinematic constraints and targets such as desired positions and orientations in Cartesian space, we find locally optimal joint velocities toward the targets at every time step by formulating the problem into a constrained optimization with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints in terms of the joint velocities. The solution is integrated to obtain the joint displacements at the next time step, and this process is repeated until reaching the targets or converging to a certain configuration. Our formulation based on relative Tacobian is particularly useful in handling constraints on relative motions, which arises in many practical problems such as dual-arm manipulation and self-collision avoidance, in a concise manner. A brief overview of our software implementation and its applications to manipulation and mobility planning of a simulated multi limbed robot are also presented.

Characterization of a bipolar near-infrared laser desorption/ionization aerosol mass spectrometer	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC; PARTICLE-BEAM COLLIMATION; LENS-NOZZLE SYSTEM; ORGANIC NITROGEN; AMINO-ACIDS; MARINE AEROSOLS; NUMERICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS; BROWN CARBON; TRANSFORMATION	A novel method of soft ionization aerosol mass spectrometry ( AMS), bipolar near-infrared laser desorption/ ionization AMS ( BP- NIR- LDI- AMS), has been developed for the on- line, real- time analysis of organic aerosols. Use of a single NIR laser pulse to desorb/ ionize aerosols deposited onto an aluminum probe results in minimal analyte fragmentation to produce exclusively intact pseudomolecular ions at [ M- H] for acidic organic analytes and [ M+H] + for basic organic analytes. Incorporation of a bipolar mass spectrometer with the NIR- LDI source enables simultaneous detection of acidic and basic species in organic particles. Limits of detection ( total particulate mass sampled) for amino acids common to the organic fraction of atmospheric aerosols ranged from 69.1 pg for ornithine to 197 pg for serine on the positive channel, and from 17.0 pg for glycine to 100 pg for ornithine on the negative channel. From studies of the laser energy dependence of the NIR- LDI mechanism, it was found that [ M- H] formation for oleic acid proceeds through simultaneous action of two 1064 nm photons, suggesting a surface-assisted process rather than direct photoionization, for which photon energy is insufficient. For acidic aerosol species, sensitivity was found to increase as a function of analyte acidity, while for basic species, [ M+H] + ion signals were detected only in the presence of a labile proton source, with the intensity of the ion signals scaling with the acidity of the proton source. The sensitivity of BP- NIR- LDI- AMS to the amino acids was rationalized in terms of their acidic/basic character, as measured by isoelectric point ( pI), with the cationic sensitivity scaling proportionally with pI and the anionic sensitivity scaling inversely with pI.

In this paper, such variations of inkjet 3D printed parts are systematically investigated by analyzing parameters of the whole process, i.e. storage of the material, printing, testing, and storage of finished parts. The goal is to both understand the process and determine the parameters that lead to the best mechanical properties and the most accurate geometric properties. Using models based on this understanding, we can design and optimize parts, and fabricate and test them successfully, thus closing the loop. Since AM materials change rapidly and this process will have to be repeated, it is shown how to create a cost and time efficient experimental design with the one-factor-at-a-time and design of experiments methods, yielding high statistical accuracies for both main and interaction effects. The results show that the number of intersections between layers and nozzles along the load-direction has the strongest impact on the mechanical properties followed by the UV exposure time, which is investigated by part spacing, the position on the printing table and the expiry date of the material. Minor effects are found for the storage time and the surface roughness is not affected by any factor. Nozzle blockage, which leads to a smaller flow-rate of printing material, significantly affected the width and waviness of the printed product. Furthermore, the machine's warm-up time is found to be an important factor.

The method we developed is termed GRIP-seq for genome-wide regulatory element immunoprecipitation and combines features of chromosome conformation capture, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and paired-end next-generation sequencing with molecular steps that enrich for active cis-regulatory elements associated with basal transcriptional machinery. The first GRIP-seq database, available to the community, comes from S. purpuratus 24 hpf embryos and takes advantage of the extremely well-characterized cis-regulatory elements in this system for validation. In addition, using the GRIP-seq database, we identify and experimentally validate a novel, intronic cis-regulatory element at the onecut locus. We find GRIP-seq signal sensitively identifies active cis-regulatory elements with a high signal-to-noise ratio for both distal and intronic elements. This promising GRIP-seq protocol has the potential to address a rate-limiting step in resolving comprehensive, predictive network models in all systems.

Analysis of collocated AIRS and MODIS data: a global investigation of correlations between clouds and atmosphere in 2004-2012	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							BOUNDARY-LAYER; PART II; VARIABILITY; PRODUCTS; PACIFIC; STRATOCUMULUS; AIRS/AMSU/HSB; TEMPERATURE; TRANSITIONS; PARAMETERS	We used collocated observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) to investigate correlations between cloud parameters and atmospheric stability. We focus on low clouds and specifically investigate the cloud parameters cloud cover and cloud optical thickness from MODIS. The selected atmospheric parameters from AIRS are maximum relative humidity (MRH), lower tropospheric stability (LTS), and water vapour gradient (QTS). The correlations were tested for temporal and regional variation on a global scale and over a time frame of 10 years. Cloud cover and MRH show weak correlations and strong variations on both the temporal and spatial scales. However, cloud cover and lower tropospheric stability show a high correlation in areas with low maritime clouds. The correlation is relatively stable, but slightly increased for the years 2009-2012. Correlations between cloud cover and QTS show a similar behaviour, but slightly stronger variations on the spatial and temporal scales, with better correlations in the East Pacific and from 2004 to 2012. The correlations with cloud optical thickness are weaker in all three cases. A more detailed analysis of the Southeast Pacific shows the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on most parameters, but a relatively stable behaviour for the connection of cloud fraction and LTS. Based on the analysis, we suggest that relative humidity is an insufficient approach to link atmospheric properties and low cloud cover. However, we find good correlations with respect to LTS and QTS. LTS in particular indicates low temporal fluctuations, even in the case of influence by ENSO.

J	Zhang, K; Fu, R; Wang, T; Liu, YM				Zhang, Kai; Fu, Rong; Wang, Tao; Liu, Yimin			Impact of geographic variations of the convective and dehydration center on stratospheric water vapor over the Asian monsoon region	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SUMMER MONSOON; OZONE; TRANSPORT; CLIMATE; TRENDS; DISTRIBUTIONS; OSCILLATION; TROPOSPHERE; SIMULATION	The Asian monsoon region is the most prominent moisture center of water vapor in the lower stratosphere (LS) during boreal summer. Previous studies have suggested that the transport of water vapor to the Asian monsoon LS is controlled by dehydration temperatures and convection mainly over the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia. However, there is a clear geographic variation of convection associated with the seasonal and intra-seasonal variations of the Asian monsoon circulation, and the relative influence of such a geographic variation of convection vs. the variation of local dehydration temperatures on water vapor transport is still not clear. Using satellite observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and a domain-filling forward trajectory model, we show that almost half of the seasonal water vapor increase in the Asian monsoon LS are attributable to geographic variations of convection and resultant variations of the dehydration center, of which the influence is comparable to the influence of the local dehydration temperature increase. In particular, dehydration temperatures are coldest over the southeast and warmest over the northwest Asian monsoon region. Although the convective center is located over Southeast Asia, an anomalous increase of convection over the northwest Asia monsoon region increases local diabatic heating in the tropopause layer and air masses entering the LS are dehydrated at relatively warmer temperatures. Due to warmer dehydration temperatures, anomalously moist air enters the LS and moves eastward along the northern flank of the monsoon anticyclonic flow, leading to wet anomalies in the LS over the Asian monsoon region. Likewise, when convection increases over the Southeast Asia monsoon region, dry anomalies appear in the LS. On a seasonal scale, this feature is associated with the monsoon circulation, convection and diabatic heating marching towards the northwest Asia monsoon region from June to August. The march of convection leads to an increasing fraction of the air mass to be dehydrated at warmer temperatures over the northwest Asia monsoon region. Work presented here confirms the dominant role of temperatures on water vapor variations and emphasizes that further studies should take geographic variations of the dehydration center into consideration when studying water vapor variations in the LS as it is linked to changes of convection and large-scale circulation patterns.

With more than 15 years (2000 to present) of validated multispectral observations, MOPITT provides the unique capability to separate CO in the lowermost troposphere (LMT, surface to 3 km (similar to 700 hPa)) from the free-tropospheric abundance. To extend this record, a new, hyper-spectral approach is presented here that will provide CO data products exceeding the capabilities of MOPITT by combining the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR, equivalent to the MOPITT NIR) channels from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to be launched aboard the European Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5p) satellite in 2016 and the TIR channels from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. We apply the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, Multi-SEnsors (MUSES) retrieval algorithm to quantify the potential of this joint CO product. CO profiles are retrieved from a single-footprint, full-spectral-resolution CrIS transect over Africa on 27-28 August 2013 coincident with significant biomass burning. Comparisons of collocated CrIS and MOPITT CO observations for the LMT show a mean difference of 2.8 +/- 24.9 ppb, which is well within the estimated measurement uncertainty of both sensors. The estimated degrees of freedom (DOF) for CO signals from synergistic CrIS-TROPOMI retrievals are approximately 0.9 in the LMT and 1.3 above the LMT, which indicates that the LMT CO can be distinguished from the free troposphere, similar to MOPITT multispectral observations (0.8 in the LMT, and 1.1 above the LMT). In addition to increased sensitivity, the combined retrievals reduce measurement uncertainty, with similar to 15% error reduction in the LMT. With a daily global coverage and a combined spatial footprint of 14 km, the joint CrIS-TROPOMI measurements have the potential to extend and improve upon the MOPITT multispectral CO data records for the coming decade.

J	Millan, L; Lebsock, M; Livesey, N; Tanelli, S				Millan, Luis; Lebsock, Matthew; Livesey, Nathaniel; Tanelli, Simone			Differential absorption radar techniques: water vapor retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPLEX PERMITTIVITY; TROPICAL CIRRUS; 1 THZ; CLOUDS; LIDAR; PARAMETERIZATION; PRESSURE; ICE; PRECIPITATION	Two radar pulses sent at different frequencies near the 183 GHz water vapor line can be used to determine total column water vapor and water vapor profiles (within clouds or precipitation) exploiting the differential absorption on and off the line. We assess these water vapor measurements by applying a radar instrument simulator to CloudSat pixels and then running end-to-end retrieval simulations. These end-to-end retrievals enable us to fully characterize not only the expected precision but also their potential biases, allowing us to select radar tones that maximize the water vapor signal minimizing potential errors due to spectral variations in the target extinction properties. A hypothetical CloudSat-like instrument with 500m by similar to 1 km vertical and horizontal resolution and a minimum detectable signal and radar precision of -30 and 0.16 dBZ, respectively, can estimate total column water vapor with an expected precision of around 0.03 cm, with potential biases smaller than 0.26 cm most of the time, even under rainy conditions. The expected precision for water vapor profiles was found to be around 89% on average, with potential biases smaller than 77% most of the time when the profile is being retrieved close to surface but smaller than 38% above 3 km. By using either horizontal or vertical averaging, the precision will improve vastly, with the measurements still retaining a considerably high vertical and/or horizontal resolution.

Almost all differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) have an unfavorable potential gradient at the outlet (e.g., long column, Vienna type) or at the inlet (nano-radial DMA), preventing them from achieving a good transmission efficiency for the smallest nanoparticles. We developed a new high-transmission inlet for the Caltech nano-radial DMA (nRDMA) that increases the transmission efficiency to 12% for ions as small as 1.3 nm in Millikan-Fuchs mobility equivalent diameter, D-p (corresponding to 1.2 x 10(-4) m(2) V-1 s(-1) in electrical mobility). We successfully deployed the nRDMA, equipped with the new inlet, in chamber measurements, using a particle size magnifier (PSM) and as a booster a condensation particle counter (CPC). With this setup, we were able to measure size distributions of ions within a mobility range from 1.2 x 10(-4) to 5.8 x 10(-6) m(2) V-1 s(-1). The system was modeled, tested in the laboratory and used to measure negative ions at ambient concentrations in the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) 7 measurement campaign at CERN. We achieved a higher size resolution (R = 5.5 at D-p = 1.47 nm) than techniques currently used in field measurements (e.g., Neutral cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS), which has a R similar to 2 at largest sizes, and R similar to 1.8 at D-p = 1.5 nm) and maintained a good total transmission efficiency (6.3% at D-p = 1.5 nm) at moderate inlet and sheath airflows (2.5 and 30 L min(-1), respectively). In this paper, by measuring size distributions at high size resolution down to 1.3 nm, we extend the limit of the current technology. The current setup is limited to ion measurements. However, we envision that future research focused on the charging mechanisms could extend the technique to measure neutral aerosol particles as well, so that it will be possible to measure size distributions of ambient aerosols from 1 nm to 1 mu m.

Joint retrieval of aerosol and water-leaving radiance from multispectral, multiangular and polarimetric measurements over ocean	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							VECTOR RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; MARKOV-CHAIN FORMALISM; IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MISR; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; COLOR IMAGERY; SOLAR-RADIATION; BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; INVERSION ALGORITHM; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; COUPLED ATMOSPHERE	An optimization approach has been developed for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol properties and normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) from multispectral, multiangular, and polarimetric observations over ocean. The main features of the method are (1) use of a simplified bio-optical model to estimate nLw, followed by an empirical refinement within a specified range to improve its accuracy; (2) improved algorithm convergence and stability by applying constraints on the spatial smoothness of aerosol loading and Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration across neighboring image patches and spectral constraints on aerosol optical properties and nLw across relevant bands; and (3) enhanced Jacobian calculation by modeling and storing the radiative transfer (RT) in aerosol/Rayleigh mixed layer, pure Rayleigh-scattering layers, and ocean medium separately, then coupling them to calculate the field at the sensor. This approach avoids unnecessary and time-consuming recalculations of RT in unperturbed layers in Jacobian evaluations. The Markov chain method is used to model RT in the aerosol/Rayleigh mixed layer and the doubling method is used for the uniform layers of the atmosphere-ocean system. Our optimization approach has been tested using radiance and polarization measurements acquired by the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) over the AERONET USC_SeaPRISM ocean site (6 February 2013) and near the AERONET La Jolla site (14 January 2013), which, respectively, reported relatively high and low aerosol loadings. Validation of the results is achieved through comparisons to AERONET aerosol and ocean color products. For comparison, the USC_SeaPRISM retrieval is also performed by use of the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties algorithm (Dubovik et al., 2011). Uncertainties of aerosol and nLw retrievals due to random and systematic instrument errors are analyzed by truth-in/truth-out tests with three Chl a concentrations, five aerosol loadings, three different types of aerosols, and nine combinations of solar incidence and viewing geometries.

Case study of spatial and temporal variability of snow cover, grain size, albedo and radiative forcing in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountain snowpack derived from imaging spectroscopy	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							LIGHT-ABSORBING IMPURITIES; SURFACE-AREA; REFLECTANCE; ENERGY; MODEL; COLORADO; DENSITY; SYSTEM; BASIN	Quantifying the spatial distribution and temporal change in mountain snow cover, microphysical and optical properties is important to improve our understanding of the local energy balance and the related snowmelt and hydrological processes. In this paper, we analyze changes of snow cover, optical-equivalent snow grain size (radius), snow albedo and radiative forcing by light-absorbing impurities in snow and ice (LAISI) with respect to terrain elevation and aspect at multiple dates during the snowmelt period. These snow properties are derived from the NASA/JPL Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data from 2009 in California's Sierra Nevada and from 2011 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, USA. Our results show a linearly decreasing snow cover during the ablation period in May and June in the Rocky Mountains and a snowfall-driven change in snow cover in the Sierra Nevada between February and May. At the same time, the snow grain size is increasing primarily at higher elevations and north-facing slopes from 200 microns to 800 microns on average. We find that intense snowmelt renders the mean grain size almost invariant with respect to elevation and aspect. Our results confirm the inverse relationship between snow albedo and grain size, as well as between snow albedo and radiative forcing by LAISI. At both study sites, the mean snow albedo value decreases from approximately 0.7 to 0.5 during the ablation period. The mean snow grain size increased from approximately 150 to 650 microns. The mean radiative forcing increases from 20aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) up to 200aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) during the ablation period. The variability of snow albedo and grain size decreases in general with the progression of the ablation period. The spatial variability of the snow albedo and grain size decreases through the melt season while the spatial variability of radiative forcing remains constant.	[Seidel, Felix C.; Skiles, S.

While several studies have examined recent trends in GrIS mass loss, studies focusing on mass variations at sub-annual and sub-basin-wide scales are still lacking. At these scales, processes responsible for mass change are less well understood and modeled, and could potentially play an important role in future GrIS mass change. Here, we examine spatiotemporal variations in mass over the GrIS derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites for the January 2003-December 2012 period using a 'mascon' approach, with a nominal spatial resolution of 100-km, and a temporal resolution of 10 days. We compare GRACE-estimated mass variations against those simulated by the ModSle Atmosph,rique R,gionale (MAR) RCM and the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). In order to properly compare spatial and temporal variations in GrIS mass from GRACE with model outputs, we find it necessary to spatially and temporally filter model results to reproduce leakage of mass inherent in the GRACE solution. Both modeled and satellite-derived results point to a decline (of -178.9-+/--4.4 and -239.4-+/--7.7-Gt-yr(-1) respectively) in GrIS mass over the period examined, but the models appear to underestimate the rate of mass loss, especially in areas below 2000-m in elevation, where the majority of recent GrIS mass loss is occurring. On an ice-sheet-wide scale, the timing of the modeled seasonal cycle of cumulative mass (driven by summer mass loss) agrees with the GRACE-derived seasonal cycle, within limits of uncertainty from the GRACE solution. However, on sub-ice-sheet-wide scales, some areas exhibit significant differences in the timing of peaks in the annual cycle of mass change. At these scales, model biases, or processes not accounted for by models related to ice dynamics or hydrology, may lead to the observed differences. This highlights the need for further evaluation of modeled processes at regional and seasonal scales, and further study of ice sheet processes not accounted for, such as the role of subglacial hydrology in variations in glacial flow.

Geoengineering as a design problem	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article							CLIMATE; MODEL; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; BALANCE; CMIP5; CYCLE; ITCZ	Understanding the climate impacts of solar geoengineering is essential for evaluating its benefits and risks. Most previous simulations have prescribed a particular strategy and evaluated its modeled effects. Here we turn this approach around by first choosing example climate objectives and then designing a strategy to meet those objectives in climate models. There are four essential criteria for designing a strategy: (i) an explicit specification of the objectives, (ii) defining what climate forcing agents to modify so the objectives are met, (iii) a method for managing uncertainties, and (iv) independent verification of the strategy in an evaluation model. We demonstrate this design perspective through two multi-objective examples. First, changes in Arctic temperature and the position of tropical precipitation due to CO2 increases are offset by adjusting high-latitude insolation in each hemisphere independently. Second, three different latitude-dependent patterns of insolation are modified to offset CO2-induced changes in global mean temperature, interhemispheric temperature asymmetry, and the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient. In both examples, the 'design' and 'evaluation' models are state-of-the-art fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.

Production and electrical characterization of the reflectin A2 isoform from Doryteuthis (Loligo) pealeii	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PROTEINS; CONDUCTIVITY; IRIDESCENCE	Cephalopods have recently emerged as a source of inspiration for the development of novel functional materials. Within this context, a number of studies have explored structural proteins known as reflectins, which play a key role in cephalopod adaptive coloration in vivo and exhibit interesting properties in vitro. Herein, we report an improved high-yield strategy for the preparation and isolation of reflectins in quantities sufficient for materials applications. We first select the Doryteuthis (Loligo) pealeii reflectin A2 (RfA2) isoform as a "model" system and validate our approach for the expression and purification of this protein. We in turn fabricate RfA2-based two-terminal devices and employ both direct and alternating current measurements to demonstrate that RfA2 films conduct protons. Our findings underscore the potential of reflectins as functional materials and may allow a wider range of researchers to investigate their properties.

Temporally resolved direct delivery of second messengers into cells using nanostraws	LAB ON A CHIP			English	Article							FLUORESCENT PROTEINS; SILICON NANOWIRES; CALCIUM; ELECTROPORATION; MESSENGER; BARRIERS; CLAMP	Second messengers are biomolecules with the critical role of conveying information to intracellular targets. They are typically membrane-impermeable and only enter cells through tightly regulated transporters. Current methods for manipulating second messengers in cells require preparation of modified cell lines or significant disruptions in cell function, especially at the cell membrane. Here we demonstrate that 100 nm diameter 'nanostraws' penetrate the cell membrane to directly modulate second messenger concentrations within cells. Nanostraws are hollow vertical nanowires that provide a fluidic conduit into cells to allow time-resolved delivery of the signaling ion Ca2+ without chemical permeabilization or genetic modification, minimizing cell perturbation. By integrating the nanostraw platform into a microfluidic device, we demonstrate coordinated delivery of Ca2+ ions into hundreds of cells at the time scale of several seconds with the ability to deliver complex signal patterns, such as oscillations over time. The diffusive nature of nanostraw delivery gives the platform unique versatility, opening the possibility for time-resolved delivery of any freely diffusing molecules.

DARDAR profiles are a joint retrieval of CloudSat-CALIPSO data. Analysis is performed for 12 separate regions over land and ocean, and carried out applying MODIS AOD fields that attempt to correct for 3-D cloud adjacency effects. The 3-D cloud adjacency effects have a small impact upon our particular calculations of aerosol-cloud indirect effects. IWC profiles are averaged for three AOD bins individually for the 12 regions. The IWC average profiles are also normalized to unity at 5aEuro-km altitude in order to study changes in the shape of the average IWC profiles as AOD increases. Derivatives of the IWC average profiles, and derivatives of the IWC shape profiles, in percent change per 0.1 change in MODIS AOD units, are calculated separately for each region. Means of altitude-specific probability distribution functions, which include both ocean and land IWC shape regional derivatives, are modest, near 5aEuro-%, and positive to the 2 sigma level between 11 and 15aEuro-km altitude. Similar analyses are carried out for three AAOD and three CO bins. On average, the vertical profiles of the means of the derivatives based upon the profile shapes over land and ocean are smaller for the profiles binned according to AAOD and CO values, than for the MODIS AODs, which include both scattering and absorptive aerosol. This difference in character supports the assertion that absorptive aerosol can inhibit cloud development.

Constraints on methane emissions in North America from future geostationary remote-sensing measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; DIURNAL DYNAMICS; AURA TES; GOSAT; OZONE; CH4; POLLUTION; ERRORS; CO2; ASSIMILATION	The success of future geostationary (GEO) satellite observation missions depends on our ability to design instruments that address their key scientific objectives. In this study, an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) is performed to quantify the constraints on methane (CH4) emissions in North America obtained from shortwave infrared (SWIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and multi-spectral (SWIR+TIR) measurements in geostationary orbit and from future SWIR low-Earth orbit (LEO) measurements. An efficient stochastic algorithm is used to compute the information content of the inverted emissions at high spatial resolution (0.5A degrees aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-0.7A degrees) in a variational framework using the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model and its adjoint. Our results show that at sub-weekly timescales, SWIR measurements in GEO orbit can constrain about twice as many independent flux patterns than in LEO orbit, with a degree of freedom for signal (DOF) for the inversion of 266 and 115, respectively. Comparisons between TIR GEO and SWIR LEO configurations reveal that poor boundary layer sensitivities for the TIR measurements cannot be compensated for by the high spatiotemporal sampling of a GEO orbit. The benefit of a multi-spectral instrument compared to current SWIR products in a GEO context is shown for sub-weekly timescale constraints, with an increase in the DOF of about 50aEuro-% for a 3-day inversion. Our results further suggest that both the SWIR and multi-spectral measurements on GEO orbits could almost fully resolve CH4 fluxes at a spatial resolution of at least 100aEuro-kmaEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-100aEuro-km over source hotspots (emissions > aEuro-4aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-10(5)aEuro-kgaEuro-day(-1)). The sensitivity of the optimized emission scaling factors to typical errors in boundary and initial conditions can reach 30 and 50aEuro-% for the SWIR GEO or SWIR LEO configurations, respectively, while it is smaller than 5aEuro-% in the case of a multi-spectral GEO system. Overall, our results demonstrate that multi-spectral measurements from a geostationary satellite platform would address the need for higher spatiotemporal constraints on CH4 emissions while greatly mitigating the impact of inherent uncertainties in source inversion methods on the inferred fluxes.

Here we focus on quantifying the influence of regional emissions on the summertime O-3 enhancements over the Middle East, using updated reactive nitrogen (NOx) emissions. We then use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem model with these updated NOx emissions to show that the global total contribution of lightning NOx on middle free tropospheric O-3 over the Middle East is about 2 times larger than that from global anthropogenic sources. The summertime middle free tropospheric O-3 enhancement is primarily due to Asian NOx emissions, with approximately equivalent contributions from Asian anthropogenic activities and lightning. In the Middle Eastern lower free troposphere, lightning NOx from Europe and North America and anthropogenic NOx from Middle Eastern local emissions are the primary sources of O-3. This work highlights the critical role of lightning NOx on northern midlatitude free tropospheric O-3 and the important effect of the Asian summer monsoon on the export of Asian pollutants.

Climatology of the aerosol optical depth by components from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and chemistry transport models	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SINGLE-SCATTERING ALBEDO; AIR-QUALITY; SATELLITE; EMISSIONS; RETRIEVALS; THICKNESS; PRODUCTS; SIMULATION; SYSTEM; IMPACT	The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Joint Aerosol (JOINT_AS) Level 3 product has provided a global, descriptive summary of MISR Level 2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol type information for each month over 16+aEuro-years since March 2000. Using Version 1 of JOINT_AS, which is based on the operational (Version 22) MISR Level 2 aerosol product, this study analyzes, for the first time, characteristics of observed and simulated distributions of AOD for three broad classes of aerosols: spherical nonabsorbing, spherical absorbing, and nonspherical - near or downwind of their major source regions. The statistical moments (means, standard deviations, and skewnesses) and distributions of AOD by components derived from the JOINT_AS are compared with results from two chemistry transport models (CTMs), the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) and SPectral RadIatioN-TrAnSport (SPRINTARS). Overall, the AOD distributions retrieved from MISR and modeled by GOCART and SPRINTARS agree with each other in a qualitative sense. Marginal distributions of AOD for each aerosol type in both MISR and models show considerable high positive skewness, which indicates the importance of including extreme AOD events when comparing satellite retrievals with models. The MISR JOINT_AS product will greatly facilitate comparisons between satellite observations and model simulations of aerosols by type.

Measurements from Sondeur Atmosph,rique du Profil d'Humidit, Intertropicale par Radiom,trie (SAPHIR) onboard the low inclination Megha-Tropiques satellite with frequent daily revisits provide a valuable dataset for investigating the diurnal and spatial variation of tropospheric relative humidity in the tropical region. In this study, we first transformed SAPHIR observations into layer-averaged relative humidity, then partitioned the data based on local observation time into 24 bins with a grid resolution of one degree. Afterwards, we fitted Fourier series to the binned data. Finally, the mean, amplitude, and diurnal peak time of relative humidity in tropical regions were calculated for each grid point using either the measurements or Fourier series. The results were separately investigated for different SAPHIR channels as well as for relative humidity with respect to both liquid and ice phases. The results showed that the wet and dry regions are, respectively, associated with convective and subsidence regions which is consistent with the previous studies. The mean tropospheric humidity values reported in this study are generally 10 to 15aEuro-% higher than those reported using infrared observations which is because of strict cloud screening for infrared measurements. The results showed a large inhomogeneity in diurnal variation of tropospheric relative humidity in tropical region. The diurnal amplitude was larger over land than over ocean and the oceanic amplitude was larger over convective regions than over subsidence regions. The results showed that the diurnal amplitude is less than 10aEuro-% in middle and upper troposphere, but it is up to 30aEuro-% in lower troposphere over land. Although the peak of RH generally occurs over night or in early morning, there are several regions where the diurnal peak occurs at other times of the day. The early morning peak time is because of a peak in convective activities in early morning. Additionally, a double peak was observed in tropospheric humidity over some regions which is consistent with double peak in precipitation.

During and in support of this campaign, five lidar ground-based stations (Athens, Barcelona, Bucharest, A parts per thousand vora, and Granada) performed 72aEuro-h of continuous lidar measurements and collocated and coincident sun-photometer measurements. Therefore it was possible to retrieve volume concentration profiles with the Lidar Radiometer Inversion Code (LIRIC). Results indicated the presence of a mineral dust plume affecting the western Mediterranean region (mainly the Granada station), whereas a different aerosol plume was observed over the Balkans area. LIRIC profiles showed a predominance of coarse spheroid particles above Granada, as expected for mineral dust, and an aerosol plume composed mainly of fine and coarse spherical particles above Athens and Bucharest. Due to the exceptional characteristics of the ChArMEx database, the analysis of the microphysical properties profiles' temporal evolution was also possible. An in-depth analysis was performed mainly at the Granada station because of the availability of continuous lidar measurements and frequent AERONET inversion retrievals. The analysis at Granada was of special interest since the station was affected by mineral dust during the complete analyzed period. LIRIC was found to be a very useful tool for performing continuous monitoring of mineral dust, allowing for the analysis of the dynamics of the dust event in the vertical and temporal coordinates. Results obtained here illustrate the importance of having collocated and simultaneous advanced lidar and sun-photometer measurements in order to characterize the aerosol microphysical properties in both the vertical and temporal coordinates at a regional scale. In addition, this study revealed that the use of the depolarization information as input in LIRIC in the stations of Bucharest, A parts per thousand vora, and Granada was crucial for the characterization of the aerosol types and their distribution in the vertical column, whereas in stations lacking depolarization lidar channels, ancillary information was needed. Results obtained were also used for the validation of different mineral dust models. In general, the models better forecast the vertical distribution of the mineral dust than the column-integrated mass concentration, which was underestimated in most of the cases.

Measuring the Solar Magnetic Field with STEREO A Radio Transmissions: Faraday Rotation Observations using the 100m Green Bank Telescope	GROUND-BASED SOLAR OBSERVATIONS IN THE SPACE INSTRUMENTATION ERA	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	Coimbra Solar Physics Meeting on Ground-based Solar Observations in the Space Instrumentation Era	OCT 05-09, 2015	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL	SCOSTEP, Variabil Sun & Its Terrestrial Impact, European Space Agcy, Fundacio Ciencia & Tecnologia, Univ Coimbra Reitoria, Univ Coimbra, Dept Matemat, Observat Paris	Univ Coimbra			The SIEREO mission spacecraft recently passed through superior conjunction, providing an opportunity to probe the solar corona using radio transmissions. Strong magnetic field and dense plasma environment induce Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized fraction of the spacecraft radio carrier signal. Variations in the Faraday rotation signify changes in magnetic field components and plasma parameters, and thus can be used to gain understanding processes of the quiescent sun as well as active outbursts including coronal mass ejections. Our 2015 observing campaign resulted in a series of measurements over several months with the 100m Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to investigate the coronal Faraday rotation at various radial distances. These observations reveal notable fluctuations in the Faraday rotation of the signal in the deep corona, and should yield unique insights into coronal magnetohydrodynamics down to a 1.5 solar radius line-of-sight solar elongation.

Though these extremes of thermal conductivity make anisotropic materials attractive for diverse applications such as thermal management and thermal insulation, the microscopic physics of heat conduction in these materials remain poorly understood.

The laser heterostmctures consist of two GaInAsSb quantum well stages in series separated by GaSb/AlSb/InAs tunnel junction and InAs/AlSb electron injectors. Single-mode emission is generated using second order lateral Bragg grating etched alongside narrow ridge waveguides. The lasers were fabricated into 2-mm-long devices, solder-mounted epi-up on copper submounts, and operate at room temperature. With an anti-reflection coating at the emission facet, the lasers exhibit a typical current threshold of 110 mA at 20 degrees C and emit more than 14 mW of output power. The Bragg wavelength temperature tuning rate was 0.29 nm/degrees C.

He also had a lifelong interest in astronomy, and in the later portion of his remarkable and long career devoted himself to astronomical research, pioneering the study of molecules in interstellar space and the development of infrared spectroscopy, first from the ground and then from airborne facilities. His interest in high angular resolution, as well as high spectral resolution observations, led to development of the first infrared spatial interferometer employing coherent signal processing techniques. In this short review I will only touch on some of Townes' many scientific contributions, concentrating on astronomy, and will also give some personal thoughts about how he inspired students in their research, helping to make the "Townes Group" at the University of California, Berkeley, an ideal environment in which to start a career in research.

High spatial resolution imaging of methane and other trace gases with the airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES)	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MATCHED-FILTER DETECTION; ANIMAL-WASTE LAGOONS; RETRIEVAL; WATER; SPECTROSCOPY; INFORMATION	Currently large uncertainties exist associated with the attribution and quantification of fugitive emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases such as methane across large regions and key economic sectors. In this study, data from the airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) have been used to develop robust and reliable techniques for the detection and wide-area mapping of emission plumes of methane and other atmospheric trace gas species over challenging and diverse environmental conditions with high spatial resolution that permits direct attribution to sources. HyTES is a pushbroom imaging spectrometer with high spectral resolution (256 bands from 7.5 to 12 mu m), wide swath (1-2 km), and high spatial resolution (similar to 2m at 1 km altitude) that incorporates new thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing technologies. In this study we introduce a hybrid clutter matched filter (CMF) and plume dilation algorithm applied to HyTES observations to efficiently detect and characterize the spatial structures of individual plumes of CH4, H2S, NH3, NO2, and SO2 emitters. The sensitivity and field of regard of HyTES allows rapid and frequent airborne surveys of large areas including facilities not readily accessible from the surface. The HyTES CMF algorithm produces plume intensity images of methane and other gases from strong emission sources. The combination of high spatial resolution and multi-species imaging capability provides source attribution in complex environments. The CMF-based detection of strong emission sources over large areas is a fast and powerful tool needed to focus on more computationally intensive retrieval algorithms to quantify emissions with error estimates, and is useful for expediting mitigation efforts and addressing critical science questions.

Such demonstrations will "pave the way" for operational use of optical communications on future robotic/potential Human missions. Hence, the Deep Space Network architecture will need to evolve. Preliminary attempts to model the anticipated future mission set and simulate how well it loads onto assumed architectures with combinations of RF and optical apertures have been evaluated. This paper discusses the results of preliminary loading simulations for hybrid RF-optical network architectures and highlights key mission and ground infrastructure considerations that emerge.

In this paper, we discuss concepts and algorithms for uplink signal acquisition, tracking, and parameter estimation using a photon-counting camera. Statistical models of detector output data and signal processing algorithms are presented, incorporating realistic effects such as Earth background and detector/readout blocking. Analysis and simulation results are validated against measured laboratory data using state-of-the-art commercial photon-counting detector arrays, demonstrating sub-microradian tracking errors under channel conditions representative of deep space optical links.

A large area (200 mu m diameter) free space coupled avalanche photodiode (APD) detector was used to receive video and a bit patterns at 50 Mb/s. We report on a recent experiment that used an adaptive optics system at OCTL to correct for atmospherically-induced refractive index fluctuations so that the downlink from the ISS could be coupled into a single mode fiber receiver. Stable fiber coupled power was achieved over an entire pass using a self-referencing interferometer based adaptive optics system that was provided and operated by Boeing Co. and integrated to OCTL. End-to-end transmission and reconstruction of an HD video signal verified the communication performance as in the original OPALS demonstration. Coupling the signal into a single mode fiber opens the possibility for higher bandwidth and efficiency modulation schemes and serves as a pilot experiment for future implementations.

Evidence for variable grounding-zone and shear-margin basal conditions across Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica	GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; ICE-SHEET; PINE ISLAND; EAST ANTARCTICA; BED; REFLECTIVITY; RETREAT; STREAMS; WIDESPREAD; STABILITY	Definitive interpretation of ice-sheet basal conditions from radar-sounding data beneath outlet-glacier grounding zones and shear margins can be problematic due to poorly constrained and spatially variable englacial attenuation rates and losses from propagation through a rough ice surface. To correct for spatially variable attenuation rates, we developed a novel radar analysis approach that provided improved empirical attenuation correction by fitting linearly variable attenuation rates along radar-sounding profiles from the ice-sheet interior to the grounding zone. We also corrected for ice-surface propagation losses by using surface echo amplitude distributions to constrain the loss of coherent power for surface reflections and two-way propagation through a rough ice surface. By applying this approach to airborne radar-sounding observations of the Thwaites Glacier catchment in West Antarctica, we produced relative reflectivity profiles, which show grounding-zone basal conditions varying across the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Additionally, these techniques provided improved characterization of basal conditions across shear margins, showing that-contrary to previous interpretations-the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier corresponded to a change in basal conditions consistent with a transition from frozen to thawed bed.

It is time to also make the datasets on which they are tested more realistic to reflect the conditions in the homes of real people. Today algorithms are tested on data gathered in the lab or at best in a few places, and almost always by the people that designed the algorithm. In this paper, we present the first RGB-D dataset from the crowdsourced data collection project Kinect@Home and perform an initial analysis of it. The dataset contains 54 recordings with a total of approximately 45 min of RGB-D video. We present a comparison of two different pose estimation methods, the Kinfu algorithm and a key point-based method, to show how this dataset can be used even though it is lacking ground truth. In addition, the analysis highlights the different characteristics and error modes of the two methods and shows how challenging data from the real world is.

Design, Control, and Experimentation of Internally-Actuated Rovers for the Exploration of Low-Gravity Planetary Bodies	FIELD AND SERVICE ROBOTICS: RESULTS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE	Springer Tracts in Advanced Robotics		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Field and Service Robotics (FSR)	JUN 23-26, 2015	Toronto, CANADA	Clearpath Robot, Univ Toronto, Inst Aerosp Studies, Fac Appl Sci & Engn				In this paper we discuss the design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity (micro-g to milli-g) planetary bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or small moons. The actuation of the rover relies on spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged in one sealed enclosure and enables the platform to be minimalistic, thereby reducing its cost. By controlling the flywheels' spin rates, the rover is capable of achieving large surface coverage by attitude-controlled hops, fine mobility by tumbling, and coarse instrument pointing by changing orientation relative to the ground. We discuss the dynamics of such rovers, their control, and key design features (e.g., flywheel design and orientation, geometry of external spikes, and system engineering aspects). The theoretical analysis is validated on a first-of-a-kind 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) microgravity test bed, which consists of a 3 DoF gimbal attached to an actively controlled gantry crane.

The WACMOS-ET project - Part 2: Evaluation of global terrestrial evaporation data sets	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							AMAZONIAN RAIN-FOREST; LAND-SURFACE EVAPORATION; WATER-RESOURCES; SOIL-MOISTURE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION ALGORITHM; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; ENERGY-BALANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTERCEPTION; MODEL	The WAter Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy - EvapoTranspiration (WACMOS-ET) project aims to advance the development of land evaporation estimates on global and regional scales. Its main objective is the derivation, validation, and intercomparison of a group of existing evaporation retrieval algorithms driven by a common forcing data set. Three commonly used process-based evaporation methodologies are evaluated: the Penman-Monteith algorithm behind the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL). The resulting global spatiotemporal variability of evaporation, the closure of regional water budgets, and the discrete estimation of land evaporation components or sources (i.e. transpiration, interception loss, and direct soil evaporation) are investigated using river discharge data, independent global evaporation data sets and results from previous studies. In a companion article (Part 1), Michel et al. (2016) inspect the performance of these three models at local scales using measurements from eddy-covariance towers and include in the assessment the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. In agreement with Part 1, our results indicate that the Priestley and Taylor products (PT-JPL and GLEAM) perform best overall for most ecosystems and climate regimes. While all three evaporation products adequately represent the expected average geographical patterns and seasonality, there is a tendency in PM-MOD to underestimate the flux in the tropics and subtropics. Overall, results from GLEAM and PT-JPL appear more realistic when compared to surface water balances from 837 globally distributed catchments and to separate evaporation estimates from ERA-Interim and the model tree ensemble (MTE). Nonetheless, all products show large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components. This observed inter-product variability, even when common forcing is used, suggests that caution is necessary in applying a single data set for large-scale studies in isolation. A general finding that different models perform better under different conditions highlights the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific composites of models. Nevertheless, the generation of a multi-product ensemble, with weighting based on validation analyses and uncertainty assessments, is proposed as the best way forward in our long-term goal to develop a robust observational benchmark data set of continental evaporation.

A 520-620-GHz Schottky Receiver Front-End for Planetary Science and Remote Sensing With 1070 K-1500 K DSB Noise Temperature at Room Temperature	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TERAHERTZ SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th International Symposium on Space Terahertz Technology (ISSTT)	MAR 16-18, 2015	Smithsonian Astrophys Observ, Cambridge, MA	Harvard Coll Observ	Smithsonian Astrophys Observ	Beamlead; JUpiter ICy Moon Explorer; membrane; receiver noise temperature; Schottky; sub-harmonic mixer; submillimeter wave instrument; Y factor; 600 GHz	MIXER	A state-of-the-art 520-620-GHz receiver front end working at room temperature was designed, built, and measured. The receiver front-end features a GaAs-Schottky diode-based subharmonic mixer and a 260-307-GHz doubler, both fabricated with the new LERMA-LPN Schottky process on a 4-mu m-thick GaAs membrane suspended in a waveguide with metal beamleads. Small-area mesas and optimized transmission lines with low dielectric loading are used. At 295 K ambient temperature, an average of 1284 K DSB receiver noise temperature was measured over the 520-620-GHz frequency range, including the 3.5-8.5-GHz IF chain loss. A record 1130 K minimum DSB receiver noise temperature at 557 GHz was measured. At 134 K ambient temperature, an average DSB receiver noise temperature of 685 K from 538 to 600 GHz was measured when correcting for the cryostat window loss. A minimum DSB receiver noise of 585 K was measured at an RF center frequency of 540 GHz. The 520-620-GHz receiver presented in this article allows an increase in the sensitivity of the JUpiter ICy Moons Explrorer-SWI instrument of about a factor of two compared with requirements. It will allow study of the Jovian system with particular emphasis on the chemistry, meteorology, structure, and atmospheric coupling processes of Jupiter and its icy satellites, thereby providing important data for the exploration of their habitable zones.

J	Dondl, PW; Bhattacharya, K				Dondl, Patrick W.; Bhattacharya, Kaushik			Effective behavior of an interface propagating through a periodic elastic medium	INTERFACES AND FREE BOUNDARIES			English	Article						Fractional Laplacian; interfaces; heterogeneous media; effective properties; homogenization; periodic media; free boundary problems; pinning	DISLOCATION DYNAMICS; WIGGLY ENERGIES; PHASE; EQUATIONS; KINETICS; SYSTEMS; FRONT	We consider a moving interface that is coupled to an elliptic equation in a heterogeneous medium. The problem is motivated by the study of displacive solid-solid phase transformations. We argue that a nearly flat interface is given by the graph of the function g which evolves according to the equation g(t)(x) = -(-Delta)(1/2)g(x) + phi(x, g(x)) + F where -(-Delta)(1/2)g describes the elasticity of the interface, phi(x, g(x)) the heterogeneity of the media and F the external force driving the interface. This equation also arises in the study of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domain walls, dislocations, fracture, peeling of adhesive tape and various other physical phenomena. We show in the periodic setting that such interfaces exhibit a stick-slip behavior associated with pinning and depinning. Specifically, there is a critical force F-star below which the interface is trapped, and beyond which the interface propagates with a well-described effective velocity that depends on F. We present numerical evidence that the effective velocity ranges from v similar to (-log vertical bar F - F-star vertical bar(-1) to (F - F-star)(beta) for some 0 < beta <= 1 for F close to F-star depending on phi. We obtain beta = 1/2 for the case of non-degenerate smooth obstacles. We further present numerical evidence that F-star can depend on direction and sense of propagation.

Cometary Science with the James Webb Space Telescope	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						comets: general; methods: observational	C/2012 S1 ISON; HALLEY MONITORING PROGRAM; NARROW-BAND PHOTOMETRY; WATER ICE; 2060 CHIRON; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; DUST ENVIRONMENT; DEEP IMPACT; INNER COMA; PREPERIHELION	The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as the largest space-based astronomical observatory with near-and mid-infrared instrumentation, will elucidate many mysterious aspects of comets. We summarize four cometary science themes especially suited for this telescope and its instrumentation: the drivers of cometary activity, comet nucleus heterogeneity, water ice in comae and on surfaces, and activity in faint comets and main belt asteroids. With JWST, we can expect the most distant detections of gas, especially CO2, in what we now consider to be only moderately bright comets. For nearby comets, coma dust properties can be simultaneously studied with their driving gases, measured simultaneously with the same instrument or contemporaneously with another. Studies of water ice and gas in the distant Solar System will help us test our understanding of cometary interiors, and coma evolution. The question of cometary activity in main belt comets will be further explored with the possibility of a direct detection of coma gas. We explore the technical approaches to these science cases and provide simple tools for estimating comet dust and gas brightness. Finally, we consider the effects of the observatory's non-sidereal tracking limits and provide a list of potential comet targets during the first five years of the mission.	[Kelley, Michael S.

We present results of investigations into the observability of NEOs given the nominal observing requirements of JWST on elongation (85 degrees-135 degrees) and non-sidereal rates (<30 mas s(-1)). We find that approximately 75% of NEOs can be observed in a given year. However, observers will need to wait for appropriate observing windows. We find that JWST can easily execute photometric observations of meter-sized NEOs that will enhance our understanding of the small NEO population.

Evaluation of UTLS carbon monoxide simulations in GMI and GEOS-Chem chemical transport models using Aura MLS observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TROPOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; ACCURATE SIMULATION; FIRE EMISSIONS; CLIMATE MODEL; WATER-VAPOR; EOS MLS; INTEX-B; CO	This study evaluates the distribution and variation of carbon monoxide (CO) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) during 2004-2012 as simulated by two chemical transport models, using the latest version of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations. The simulated spatial distributions, temporal variations and vertical transport of CO in the UTLS region are compared with those observed by MLS. We also investigate the impact of surface emissions and deep convection on CO concentrations in the UTLS over different regions, using both model simulations and MLS observations. Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) and GEOS-Chem simulations of UTLS CO both show similar spatial distributions to observations. The global mean CO values simulated by both models agree with MLS observations at 215 and 147aEuro-hPa, but are significantly underestimated by more than 40aEuro-% at 100aEuro-hPa. In addition, the models underestimate the peak CO values by up to 70aEuro-% at 100aEuro-hPa, 60aEuro-% at 147aEuro-hPa and 40aEuro-% at 215aEuro-hPa, with GEOS-Chem generally simulating more CO at 100aEuro-hPa and less CO at 215aEuro-hPa than GMI. The seasonal distributions of CO simulated by both models are in better agreement with MLS in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) than in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), with disagreements between model and observations over enhanced CO regions such as southern Africa. The simulated vertical transport of CO shows better agreement with MLS in the tropics and the SH subtropics than the NH subtropics. We also examine regional variations in the relationships among surface CO emission, convection and UTLS CO concentrations. The two models exhibit emission-convection-CO relationships similar to those observed by MLS over the tropics and some regions with enhanced UTLS CO.

Integration of nitrogen dynamics into the Noah-MP land surface model v1.1 for climate and environmental predictions	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							MISSISSIPPI RIVER; CARBON FLUXES; RESOLUTION; EXCHANGE; IMPACTS; BALANCE; EXPORT; COST	Climate and terrestrial biosphere models consider nitrogen an important factor in limiting plant carbon uptake, while operational environmental models view nitrogen as the leading pollutant causing eutrophication in water bodies. The community Noah land surface model with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) is unique in that it is the next-generation land surface model for the Weather Research and Forecasting meteorological model and for the operational weather/climate models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. In this study, we add a capability to Noah-MP to simulate nitrogen dynamics by coupling the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) plant model and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) soil nitrogen dynamics. This model development incorporates FUN's state-of-the-art concept of carbon cost theory and SWAT's strength in representing the impacts of agricultural management on the nitrogen cycle. Parameterizations for direct root and mycorrhizal-associated nitrogen uptake, leaf retranslocation, and symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation are employed from FUN, while parameterizations for nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, immobilization, volatilization, atmospheric deposition, and leaching are based on SWAT. The coupled model is then evaluated at the Kellogg Biological Station - a Long Term Ecological Research site within the US Corn Belt. Results show that the model performs well in capturing the major nitrogen state/flux variables (e.g., soil nitrate and nitrate leaching). Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen dynamics improves the modeling of net primary productivity and evapotranspiration. The model improvement is expected to advance the capability of Noah-MP to simultaneously predict weather and water quality in fully coupled Earth system models.

A global scale mechanistic model of photosynthetic capacity (LUNA V1.0)	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							TEMPERATURE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; BIOCHEMICALLY BASED MODEL; EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; LEAF NITROGEN; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; SEASONAL PATTERN; TRAIT VARIATION	Although plant photosynthetic capacity as determined by the maximum carboxylation rate (i.e., V-c,V-max25) and the maximum electron transport rate (i. e., J(max25)) at a reference temperature (generally 25 degrees C) is known to vary considerably in space and time in response to environmental conditions, it is typically parameterized in Earth system models (ESMs) with tabulated values associated with plant functional types. In this study, we have developed a mechanistic model of leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation (LUNA) to predict photosynthetic capacity at the global scale under different environmental conditions. We adopt an optimality hypothesis to nitrogen allocation among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation and respiration. The LUNA model is able to reasonably capture the measured spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthetic capacity as it explains similar to 55% of the global variation in observed values of V-c,V-max25 and similar to 65% of the variation in the observed values of J(max25). Model simulations with LUNA under current and future climate conditions demonstrate that modeled values of V-c,V-max25 are most affected in high-latitude regions under future climates. ESMs that relate the values of V-c,V-max25 or J(max25) to plant functional types only are likely to substantially overestimate future global photosynthesis.	[Ali, A. A.; Xu, C.; Muss, J.

J	Adhikari, S; Ivins, ER; Larour, E				Adhikari, Surendra; Ivins, Erik R.; Larour, Eric			ISSM-SESAWv1.0: mesh-based computation of gravitationally consistent sea-level and geodetic signatures caused by cryosphere and climate driven mass change	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							GLACIAL-ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; TIME-VARIABLE GRAVITY; GREENLAND ICE-SHEET; RECONCILED ESTIMATE; EXPERIMENT GRACE; WEST ANTARCTICA; SOLID-EARTH; MODEL; RISE; PREDICTIONS	A classical Green's function approach for computing gravitationally consistent sea-level variations associated with mass redistribution on the earth's surface employed in contemporary sea-level models naturally suits the spectral methods for numerical evaluation. The capability of these methods to resolve high wave number features such as small glaciers is limited by the need for large numbers of pixels and high-degree (associated Legendre) series truncation. Incorporating a spectral model into (components of) earth system models that generally operate on a mesh system also requires repetitive forward and inverse transforms. In order to overcome these limitations, we present a method that functions efficiently on an unstructured mesh, thus capturing the physics operating at kilometer scale yet capable of simulating geophysical observables that are inherently of global scale with minimal computational cost. The goal of the current version of this model is to provide high-resolution solidearth, gravitational, sea-level and rotational responses for earth system models operating in the domain of the earth's outer fluid envelope on timescales less than about 1 century when viscous effects can largely be ignored over most of the globe. The model has numerous important geophysical applications. For example, we compute time-varying computations of global geodetic and sea-level signatures associated with recent ice-sheet changes that are derived from space gravimetry observations. We also demonstrate the capability of our model to simultaneously resolve kilometer-scale sources of the earth's time-varying surface mass transport, derived from high-resolution modeling of polar ice sheets, and predict the corresponding local and global geodetic signatures.

An 11-year global gridded aerosol optical thickness reanalysis (v1.0) for atmospheric and climate sciences	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; BIOMASS BURNING PARTICLES; MARINE BOUNDARY-LAYER; MINERAL DUST AEROSOL; AIR-POLLUTION MODEL; DATA-ASSIMILATION; MARITIME CONTINENT; TRANSPORT MODEL; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; CLOUD CONTAMINATION	While stand alone satellite and model aerosol products see wide utilization, there is a significant need in numerous atmospheric and climate applications for a fused product on a regular grid. Aerosol data assimilation is an operational reality at numerous centers, and like meteorological reanalyses, aerosol reanalyses will see significant use in the near future. Here we present a standardized 2003-2013 global 1 x 1 degrees and 6-hourly modal aerosol optical thickness (AOT) reanalysis product. This data set can be applied to basic and applied Earth system science studies of significant aerosol events, aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction, and electro-optical propagation and sensor performance, among other uses. This paper describes the science of how to develop and score an aerosol reanalysis product. This reanalysis utilizes a modified Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) at its core and assimilates quality controlled retrievals of AOT from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) on Terra. The aerosol source functions, including dust and smoke, were regionally tuned to obtain the best match between the model fine-and coarse-mode AOTs and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOTs. Other model processes, including deposition, were tuned to minimize the AOT difference between the model and satellite AOT. Aerosol wet deposition in the tropics is driven with satellite-retrieved precipitation, rather than the model field. The final reanalyzed fine-and coarse-mode AOT at 550 nm is shown to have good agreement with AERONET observations, with global mean root mean square error around 0.1 for both fine-and coarse-mode AOTs. This paper includes a discussion of issues particular to aerosol reanalyses that make them distinct from standard meteorological reanalyses, considerations for extending such a reanalysis outside of the NASA A-Train era, and examples of how the aerosol reanalysis can be applied or fused with other model or remote sensing products. Finally, the reanalysis is evaluated in comparison with other available studies of aerosol trends, and the implications of this comparison are discussed.

Comprehensive mapping of O-GlcNAc modification sites using a chemically cleavable tag	MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article							LINKED N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE; MODIFIED PROTEINS; IDENTIFICATION; GLYCOSYLATION; GLCNACYLATION; ISOFORMS; REPEAT; DOMAIN	The post-translational modification of serine or threonine residues of proteins with a single N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharide (O-GlcNAcylation) is essential for cell survival and function. However, relatively few O-GlcNAc modification sites have been mapped due to the difficulty of enriching and detecting O-GlcNAcylated peptides from complex samples. Here we describe an improved approach to quantitatively label and enrich O-GlcNAcylated proteins for site identification. Chemoenzymatic labelling followed by copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) installs a new mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible linker designed for facile purification of O-GlcNAcylated proteins from cell lysates. The linker also allows subsequent quantitative release of O-GlcNAcylated proteins for downstream MS analysis. We validate the approach by unambiguously identifying several establishedO-GlcNAc sites on the proteins a-crystallin and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), as well as discovering new, previously unreported sites on OGT. Notably, these novel sites on OGT lie in key functional domains of the protein, underscoring how this site identification method may reveal important biological insights into protein activity and regulation.

Validation of sensor for postoperative positioning with intraocular gas	CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						postoperative positioning; intraocular gas; vitrectomy; retinal detachment; macular hole; pneumatic retinopexy	MACULAR HOLE SURGERY; FACE-DOWN; VITRECTOMY	Purpose: Surgical repair of retinal attachment or macular hole frequently requires intraocular gas. This necessitates specific postoperative positioning to improve outcomes and avoid complications. However, patients struggle with correct positioning. We have developed a novel sensor to detect the position of the gas bubble in the eye and provide feedback to patients in real time. In this paper, we determine the specificity and sensitivity of our sensor in vitro using a model eye. Methods: We assessed the reliability of our sensor to detect when a gas bubble has deviated off a model retinal break in a model eye. Various bubble sizes representing the intraocular kinetics of sulfur hexafluoride gas and varying degrees of deviation from the correct position were tested using the sensor attached to a mannequin head with a model eye. Results: We recorded 36 data points. The sensor acted appropriately in 33 (91.7%) of them. The sensor triggered the alarm every time the bubble deviated off the break (n=15, sensitivity=100%). However, it triggered the alarm (falsely) 3/21 times when the bubble was correctly positioned over the retinal break (specificity=86%). Conclusion: Our device shows excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (86%) in detecting whether intraocular gas is tamponading a retinal break in a model eye.

Magnesite deposits are of three types: (1) Massive or crystalline, (2) Cryptocrystalline and (3) Sedimentary. Cryptocrystalline and sedimentary type magnesite deposits are widespread all over Turkey although the massive type deposits are seemingly absent. In this study, we examined the sedimentary magnesite deposits of Hirsizdere, located in the province of Denizli, SW Turkey. The deposits formed as five beds within an ultramafic environment. The thickness of the magnesite beds can reach up to 4 meters and may be traced up to 3 km from west to east. The deposit comprises half a million tons of magnesite with some associated dolomite.

Two-dimensional SSH can be reconstructed using mapping techniques; however, the spatial resolution is quite coarse even when data from several altimeters are analyzed. A new satellite mission based on radar interferometry is scheduled to be launched in 2020. This mission, called Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), will measure SSH at high resolution along a wide swath, thus providing two-dimensional images of the ocean surface topography. This new capability will provide a large amount of data even though they are contaminated with instrument noise and geophysical errors. This paper presents a tool that simulates synthetic observations of SSH from the future SWOT mission using SSH from any ocean general circulation model (OGCM). SWOT-like data have been generated from a high-resolution model and analyzed to investigate the sampling and accuracy characteristics of the future SWOT data. This tool will help explore new ideas and methods for optimizing the retrieval of information from future SWOT missions.

J	Zaron, ED; DeCarvalho, R				Zaron, Edward D.; DeCarvalho, Robert			Identification and Reduction of Retracker-Related Noise in Altimeter-Derived Sea Surface Height Measurements	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							STATE BIAS; WAVE-FORMS; JASON-1; TOPEX; PERFORMANCE	Data from the Jason-2 calibration/validation mission phase have been analyzed to identify the correlation between sea surface height (SSH) and significant wave height (SWH) errors. A cross-spectral analysis indicates that the SSH and SWH errors are nearly white and significantly correlated at scales from 12 to 100 km, consistent with the hypothesized error source, the waveform retracker. Because of the scale separation between the SWH signal and noise, it is possible to correct the SSH data by removing the SSH noise correlated with the SWH noise. Such a correction has been implemented using the empirical correlation found during the Jason-2 calibration orbit phase and applied to independent data from other phases of the Jason-1 mission. The efficacy of the correction varies geographically, but variance reductions between 1.6 and 2.2 cm 2 have been obtained, corresponding to reductions of 20%-27% in the noise floor of along-track spectra. The corrections are obtained from and applied to conventional, 1 Hz, altimetry data and lead to improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio for identification of high-frequency narrowband processes-for example, internal tides-from these data.

J	Bobbitt, B; Lapointe, S; Blanquart, G				Bobbitt, Brock; Lapointe, Simon; Blanquart, Guillaume			Vorticity transformation in high Karlovitz number premixed flames	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; SUBGRID-STRESS MODEL; DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION; ISOTROPIC TURBULENCE; STRAIN-RATE; COMBUSTION; VELOCITY; STATISTICS; ALIGNMENT	To better understand the two-way coupling between turbulence and chemistry, the changes in turbulence characteristics through a premixed flame are investigated. Specifically, this study focuses on vorticity, omega, which is characteristic of the smallest length and time scales of turbulence, analyzing its behavior within and across high Karlovitz number (Ka) premixed flames. This is accomplished through a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of premixed n-heptane/air flames, modeled with a 35-species finite-rate chemical mechanism, whose conditions span a wide range of unburnt Karlovitz numbers and flame density ratios. The behavior of the terms in the enstrophy, omega(2) = omega . omega, transport equation is analyzed, and a scaling is proposed for each term. The resulting normalized enstrophy transport equation involves only a small set of parameters. Specifically, the theoretical analysis and DNS results support that, at high Karlovitz number, enstrophy transport obtains a balance of the viscous dissipation and production/vortex stretching terms. It is shown that, as a result, vorticity scales in the same manner as in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence within and across the flame, namely, scaling with the inverse of the Kolmogorov time scale, tau(eta). As tau(eta) is a function only of the viscosity and dissipation rate, this work supports the validity of Kolmogorov's first similarity hypothesis in premixed turbulent flames for sufficiently high Ka numbers. Results are unaffected by the transport model, chemical model, turbulent Reynolds number, and finally the physical configuration. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

The underlying verification procedure is based on a systematic search of potentially faulty system behaviors, which can be computationally expensive for larger problem sizes. In this paper we consider if it is possible to significantly reduce the runtime requirements of a verification with cloud computing techniques. We explore the use of large numbers of CPU-cores, that each perform small, fast, independent, and randomly different searches to achieve the same problem coverage as a much slower stand-alone run on a single CPU. We present empirical results to demonstrate what is achievable.

Several case studies based on individual trajectories from the Arctic winter 2009/2010 were conducted, with the trajectories chosen such that the first processing of the air mass by PSCs in this winter occurred on the trajectory. Transitions of PSC composition classes were observed to be highly dependent on the temperature history. In cases of a gradual temperature decrease, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and super-cooled ternary solution (STS) mixture clouds were observed. In cases of rapid temperature decrease, STS clouds were first observed, followed by NAT/STS mixture clouds. When temperatures dropped below the frost point, ice clouds formed and then transformed into NAT/STS mixture clouds when temperature increased above the frost point. The threshold temperature for rapid chlorine activation on PSCs is approximately 4aEuro-K below the NAT existence temperature, T-NAT. Furthermore, simulations of the ATLAS chemistry and transport box model along the trajectories were used to corroborate the measurements and show good agreement with the observations. Rapid chlorine activation was observed when an air mass encountered PSCs. Usually, chlorine activation was limited by the amount of available ClONO2. Where ClONO2 was not the limiting factor, a large dependence on temperature was evident.

Global HCFC-22 measurements with MIPAS: retrieval, validation, global distribution and its evolution over 2005-2012	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SEASONAL CYCLES; CHLORINE; GASES; AIR; STRATOSPHERE; TEMPERATURE; CIRCULATION; RESOLUTION; TRENDS; OZONE	We report on HCFC-22 data acquired by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) in the reduced spectral resolution nominal observation mode. The data cover the period from January 2005 to April 2012 and the altitude range from the upper troposphere (above cloud top altitude) to about 50 km. The profile retrieval was performed by constrained nonlinear least squares fitting of modelled spectra to the measured limb spectral radiances. The spectral nu(4)-band at 816.5 +/- 13 cm(-1) was used for the retrieval. A Tikhonov-type smoothing constraint was applied to stabilise the retrieval. In the lower stratosphere, we find a global volume mixing ratio of HCFC-22 of about 185 pptv in January 2005. The rate of linear growth in the lower latitudes lower stratosphere was about 6 to 7aEuro-pptvaEuro-year(-1) in the period 2005-2012. The profiles obtained were compared with ACE-FTS satellite data v3.5, as well as with MkIV balloon profiles and cryosampler balloon measurements. Between 13 and 22 km, average agreement within -3 to +5 pptv (MIPAS - ACE) with ACE-FTS v3.5 profiles is demonstrated. Agreement with MkIV solar occultation balloon-borne measurements is within 10-20 pptv below 30 km and worse above, while in situ cryosampler balloon measurements are systematically lower over their full altitude range by 15-50 pptv below 24 km and less than 10 pptv above 28 km. MIPAS HCFC-22 time series below 10 km altitude are shown to agree mostly well to corresponding time series of near-surface abundances from the NOAA/ESRL and AGAGE networks, although a more pronounced seasonal cycle is obvious in the satellite data. This is attributed to tropopause altitude fluctuations and subsidence of polar winter stratospheric air into the troposphere. A parametric model consisting of constant, linear, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and several sine and cosine terms with different periods has been fitted to the temporal variation of stratospheric HCFC-22 for all 10A degrees-latitude/1-to-2-km-altitude bins. The relative linear variation was always positive, with relative increases of 40-70 % decade(-1) in the tropics and global lower stratosphere, and up to 120 % decade(-1) in the upper stratosphere of the northern polar region and the southern extratropical hemisphere. Asian HCFC-22 emissions have become the major source of global upper tropospheric HCFC-22. In the upper troposphere, monsoon air, rich in HCFC-22, is instantaneously mixed into the tropics. In the middle stratosphere, between 20 and 30 km, the observed trend is inconsistent with the trend at the surface (corrected for the age of stratospheric air), hinting at circulation changes. There exists a stronger positive trend in HCFC-22 in the Southern Hemisphere and a more muted positive trend in the Northern Hemisphere, implying a potential change in the stratospheric circulation over the observation period.

Formal synthesis entails construction of game strategies for a discrete transition system such that the system under the strategy satisfies a specification, given for instance in linear temporal logic (LTL). The general problem of automated synthesis for distributed discrete transition systems suffers from state-space explosion because the combined state-space has size exponential in the number of subsystems. Motivated by multi-robot motion planning problems, we focus on distributed systems whose interaction is nearly decoupled, allowing the overall specification to be decomposed into specifications for individual subsystems and a specification about the joint system. We treat specifically reactive synthesis for the GR(1) fragment of LTL. Each robot is subject to a GR(1) formula, and a safety formula describes constraints on their interaction. We propose an approach wherein we synthesize strategies independently for each subsystem; then we patch the separate controllers around interaction regions such that the specification about the joint system is satisfied.

Solar fuel photoanodes prepared by inkjet printing of copper vanadates	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SCANNING ELECTROCHEMICAL MICROSCOPY; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; IZALCO VOLCANO; COMBINATORIAL APPROACH; VANADIUM SUBLIMATE; WATER OXIDATION; METAL-OXIDES; EL-SALVADOR; THIN-FILMS; CATALYSTS	Widespread deployment of solar fuel generators requires the development of efficient and scalable functional materials, especially for photoelectrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction. Metal oxides comprise the most promising class of photoanode materials, but no known material meets the demanding photoelectrochemical requirements. Copper vanadates have recently been identified as a promising class of photoanode materials with several phases exhibiting an indirect band gap near 2 eV and stable photoelectrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction in a pH 9.2 electrolyte. By employing combinatorial inkjet printing of metal precursors and applying both calcination and rapid thermal processing, we characterize the phase behaviour of the entire CuO-V2O5 composition space for different thermal treatments via automated analysis of approximately 100 000 Raman spectra acquired using a novel Raman imaging technique. These results enable the establishment of structure-property relationships for optical absorption and photoelectrochemical properties, revealing that highly active photoelectrocatalysts containing alpha-Cu2V2O7 or alpha-CuV2O6 can be prepared using scalable solution processing techniques. An additional discovery results from the formation of an off-stoichiometric beta-Cu2V2O7 material that exhibits high photoelectroactivity in the presence of a ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple with excellent stability in a pH 13 electrolyte, demonstrating that copper vanadates may be viable photoanodes in strong alkaline electrolytes.

Toward consistency between trends in bottom-up CO2 emissions and top-down atmospheric measurements in the Los Angeles megacity	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							FOSSIL-FUEL CO2; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; AIR-POLLUTANT TRANSPORT; CARBON-DIOXIDE; COASTAL ENVIRONMENT; ISOTOPIC ABUNDANCES; URBAN ATMOSPHERE; (CO2)-C-14; QUANTIFICATION; DISCRIMINATION	Large urban emissions of greenhouse gases result in large atmospheric enhancements relative to background that are easily measured. Using CO2 mole fractions and delta C-14 and delta C-13 values of CO2 in the Los Angeles megacity observed in inland Pasadena (2006-2013) and coastal Palos Verdes peninsula (autumn 2009-2013), we have determined time series for CO2 contributions from fossil fuel combustion (C-ff) for both sites and broken those down into contributions from petroleum and/or gasoline and natural gas burning for Pasadena. We find a 10 % reduction in Pasadena C-ff during the Great Recession of 2008-2010, which is consistent with the bottom-up inventory determined by the California Air Resources Board. The isotopic variations and total atmospheric CO2 from our observations are used to infer seasonality of natural gas and petroleum combustion. The trend of CO2 contributions to the atmosphere from natural gas combustion is out of phase with the seasonal cycle of total natural gas combustion seasonal patterns in bottom-up inventories but is consistent with the seasonality of natural gas usage by the area's electricity generating power plants. For petroleum, the inferred seasonality of CO2 contributions from burning petroleum is delayed by several months relative to usage indicated by statewide gasoline taxes. Using the high-resolution Hestia-LA data product to compare C-ff from parts of the basin sampled by winds at different times of year, we find that variations in observed fossil fuel CO2 reflect seasonal variations in wind direction. The seasonality of the local CO2 excess from fossil fuel combustion along the coast, on Palos Verdes peninsula, is higher in autumn and winter than spring and summer, almost completely out of phase with that from Pasadena, also because of the annual variations of winds in the region. Variations in fossil fuel CO2 signals are consistent with sampling the bottom-up Hestia-LA fossil CO2 emissions product for sub-city source regions in the LA megacity domain when wind directions are considered.

Direct measurements of OH and other product yields from the HO(2)aEuro- +aEuro-CH3C(O)O-2 reaction	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							GAS-PHASE REACTIONS; HIGHLY INSTRUMENTED REACTOR; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; PHOTOCHEMICAL DATA; CH3C(O)O-2+HO2 REACTION; ISOPRENE OXIDATION; HO2; RADICALS; MECHANISM; KINETICS	The reaction CH3C(O)O(2)aEuro-+aEuro-HO2 -> aEuro parts per thousand CH3C(O)OOHaEuro-+aEuro-O-2 (Reaction R5a), CH3C(O)OHaEuro-+aEuro-O-3 (Reaction R5b), CH(3)aEuro-+aEuro-CO(2)aEuro-+aEuro-OHaEuro-+aEuro-O-2 (Reaction R5c) was studied in a series of experiments conducted at 1000aEuro-mbar and (293aEuro-+/- aEuro-2)aEuro-K in the HIRAC simulation chamber. For the first time, products, (CH3C(O)OOH, CH3C(O)OH, O-3 and OH) from all three branching pathways of the reaction have been detected directly and simultaneously. Measurements of radical precursors (CH3OH, CH3CHO), HO2 and some secondary products HCHO and HCOOH further constrained the system. Fitting a comprehensive model to the experimental data, obtained over a range of conditions, determined the branching ratios alpha((R5a))aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-0.37aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.10, alpha((R5b)) = aEuro-0.12aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.04 and alpha((R5c)) = aEuro-0.51aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.12 (errors at 2 sigma level). Improved measurement/model agreement was achieved using k((R5)) = (2.4aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.4)aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-10(-11)aEuro-cm(3)aEuro-molecule(-1)aEuro-s(-1), which is within the large uncertainty of the current IUPAC and JPL recommended rate coefficients for the title reaction. The rate coefficient and branching ratios are in good agreement with a recent study performed by Gro<remove> et al. (2014b); taken together, these two studies show that the rate of OH regeneration through Reaction (R5) is more rapid than previously thought. GEOS-Chem has been used to assess the implications of the revised rate coefficients and branching ratios; the modelling shows an enhancement of up to 5 % in OH concentrations in tropical rainforest areas and increases of up to 10 % at altitudes of 6-8 km above the equator, compared to calculations based on the IUPAC recommended rate coefficient and yield. The enhanced rate of acetylperoxy consumption significantly reduces PAN in remote regions (up to 30 %) with commensurate reductions in background NOx.	[Winiberg, Frank A.

Evaluating 3D printing to solve the sample-to-device interface for LRS and POC diagnostics: example of an interlock meter-mix device for metering and lysing clinical urine samples	LAB ON A CHIP			English	Article							POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; CHLAMYDIA-TRACHOMATIS; NUCLEIC-ACIDS; PURIFICATION; DROPLETS; CHANNELS	This paper evaluates the potential of 3D printing, a semi-automated additive prototyping technology, as a means to design and prototype a sample-to-device interface, amenable to diagnostics in limited-resource settings, where speed, accuracy and user-friendly design are critical components. As a test case, we built and validated an interlock meter-mix device for accurately metering and lysing human urine samples for use in downstream nucleic acid amplification. Two plungers and a multivalve generated and controlled fluid flow through the device and demonstrate the utility of 3D printing to create leak-free seals. Device operation consists of three simple steps that must be performed sequentially, eliminating manual pipetting and vortexing to provide rapid (5 to 10 s) and accurate metering and mixing. Bretherton's prediction was applied, using the bond number to guide a design that prevents potentially biohazardous samples from leaking from the device. We employed multi-material 3D printing technology, which allows composites with rigid and elastomeric properties to be printed as a single part. To validate the meter-mix device with a clinically relevant sample, we used urine spiked with inactivated Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A downstream nucleic acid amplification by quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed there was no statistically significant difference between samples metered and mixed using the standard protocol and those prepared with the meter-mix device, showing the 3D-printed device could accurately meter, mix and dispense a human urine sample without loss of nucleic acids. Although there are some limitations to 3D printing capabilities (e.g. dimension limitations related to support material used in the printing process), the advantages of customizability, modularity and rapid prototyping illustrate the utility of 3D printing for developing sample-to-device interfaces for diagnostics.

We adapt the standard conceptualization of consumer choice theory to a situation where the consumer is aware of, and has preferences over, the information revealed by her choices. The main message of the paper is that little can be inferred about consumers' preferences once we introduce the possibility that the consumer has concerns about privacy. This holds even when consumers' privacy preferences are assumed to be monotonic and separable. This motivates the consideration of stronger assumptions and, to that end, we introduce an additive model for privacy preferences that has testable implications.

Previously, we identified tri-potent progenitor cells in the adult (2-4 month-old) murine pancreas that were capable of self-renewal and differentiation into duct, acinar, and endocrine cells in vitro. These progenitor cells were named pancreatic colony-forming units (PCFUs). However, because PCFUs are a minor population in the pancreas (similar to 1%) they are difficult to study. To enrich PCFUs, strategies using cell-surface marker analyses and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were developed. We found that CD133(highC)D71(low) cells, but not other cell populations, enriched PCFUs by up to 30 fold compared to the unsorted cells. CD133(highC)D71(low) cells generated primary, secondary, and subsequent colonieswhen serially re-plated in Matrigel-containing cultures, suggesting self-renewal abilities. In the presence of a laminin hydrogel, CD133(highC)D71(low) cells gave rise to colonies that contained duct, acinar, and Insulin(+) Glucagon(+) double-hormonal endocrine cells. Colonies from the laminin hydrogel culture were implanted into diabetic mice, and five-weeks later duct, acinar, and Insulin(+) Glucagon(-) cells were detected in the grafts, demonstrating tri-lineage differentiation potential of CD133(highC)D71(low) cells. These CD133(highC)D71(low) cells will enable future studies of putative adult pancreas stem cells in vivo. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Standard analysis for determining formation and growth rates requires that the time-dependent formation rate and growth rate of the particles are spatially invariant; air parcel advection means that the observed temporal evolution of the particle size distribution at a fixed measurement location may not represent the true evolution if there are spatial variations in the formation and growth rates. Here we present a zero-dimensional aerosol box model coupled with one-dimensional atmospheric flow to describe the impact of advection on the evolution of simulated new particle formation events. Wind speed, particle formation rates and growth rates are input parameters that can vary as a function of time and location, using wind speed to connect location to time. The output simulates measurements at a fixed location; formation and growth rates of the particle mode can then be calculated from the simulated observations at a stationary point for different scenarios and be compared with the 'true' input parameters. Hence, we can investigate how spatial variations in the formation and growth rates of new particles would appear in observations of particle number size distributions at a fixed measurement site. We show that the particle size distribution and growth rate at a fixed location is dependent on the formation and growth parameters upwind, even if local conditions do not vary. We also show that different input parameters used may result in very similar simulated measurements. Erroneous interpretation of observations in terms of particle formation and growth rates, and the time span and areal extent of new particle formation, is possible if the spatial effects are not accounted for.

UTLS water vapour from SCIAMACHY limb measurements V3.01 (2002-2012)	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							LOWER STRATOSPHERE UTLS; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS; VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL; MIPAS; PROFILES; TRENDS; INSTRUMENT; HYGROMETER	The SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) aboard the Envisat satellite provided measurements from August 2002 until April 2012. SCIAMACHY measured the scattered or direct sunlight using different observation geometries. The limb viewing geometry allows the retrieval of water vapour at about 10-25 km height from the near-infrared spectral range (1353-1410 nm). These data cover the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), a region in the atmosphere which is of special interest for a variety of dynamical and chemical processes as well as for the radiative forcing. Here, the latest data version of water vapour (V3.01) from SCIAMACHY limb measurements is presented and validated by comparisons with data sets from other satellite and in situ measurements. Considering retrieval tests and the results of these comparisons, the V3.01 data are reliable from about 11 to 23 km and the best results are found in the middle of the profiles between about 14 and 20 km. Above 20 km in the extra tropics V3.01 is drier than all other data sets. Additionally, for altitudes above about 19 km, the vertical resolution of the retrieved profile is not sufficient to resolve signals with a short vertical structure like the tape recorder. Below 14 km, SCIAMACHY water vapour V3.01 is wetter than most col-located data sets, but the high variability of water vapour in the troposphere complicates the comparison. For 14-20 km height, the expected errors from the retrieval and simulations and the mean differences to collocated data sets are usually smaller than 10% when the resolution of the SCIAMACHY data is taken into account. In general, the temporal changes agree well with collocated data sets except for the Northern Hemisphere extratropical stratosphere, where larger differences are observed. This indicates a possible drift in V3.01 most probably caused by the incomplete treatment of volcanic aerosols in the retrieval. In all other regions a good temporal stability is shown. In the tropical stratosphere an increase in water vapour is found between 2002 and 2012, which is in agreement with other satellite data sets for overlapping time periods.

Improved retrieval of gas abundances from near-infrared solar FTIR spectra measured at the Karlsruhe TCCON station	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							COLUMN OBSERVING NETWORK; HIGH-RESOLUTION; CO2; CALIBRATION; FTS; SPECTROMETERS; SURFACE; SITES	We present a modified retrieval strategy for solar absorption spectra recorded by the Karlsruhe Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which is operational within the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). In typical TCCON stations, the 3800-11 000 cm(-1) spectral region is measured on a single extended Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) detector. The Karlsruhe setup instead splits the spectrum across an Indium Antimonide (InSb) and InGaAs detector through the use of a dichroic beam splitter. This permits measurements further into the mid-infrared (MIR) that are of scientific interest, but are not considered TCCON measurements. This optical setup induces, however, larger variations in the continuum level of the solar spectra than the typical TCCON setup. Here we investigate the appropriate treatment of continuum-level variations in the retrieval strategy using the spectra recorded in Karlsruhe. The broad spectral windows used by TCCON require special attention with respect to residual curvature in the spectral fits. To accommodate the unique setup of Karlsruhe, higher-order discrete Legendre polynomial basis functions have been enabled in the TCCON retrieval code to fit the continuum. This improves spectral fits and air-mass dependencies for affected spectral windows. After fitting the continuum curvature, the Karlsruhe greenhouse gas records are in good agreement with other European TCCON data sets.

For the MIPAS full-resolution period (2002-2004) these are V5H_CH4_21 and V5H_N2O_21 and for the reduced-resolution period (2005-2012) these are V5R_CH4_224, V5R_CH4_225, V5R_N2O_224 and V5R_N2O_225. Here, we compare CH4 profiles to those measured by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on board of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE-FTS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIA-MACHY), to the Global Cooperative Air Sampling Network (GCASN) surface data. We find the MIPAS CH4 profiles below 25 km to be typically higher of the order of 0.1 ppmv for both measurement periods. N2O profiles are compared to those measured by ACE-FTS, the Microwave Limb Sounder on board of the Aura satellite (Aura-MLS) and the Sub-millimetre Radiometer on board of the Odin satellite (Odin-SMR) as well as to the Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species Group (HATS) surface data. The mixing ratios of the satellite instruments agree well with each other for the full-resolution period. For the reduced-resolution period, MIPAS produces similar values as Odin-SMR, but higher values than ACE-FTS and HATS. Below 27 km, the MIPAS profiles show higher mixing ratios than Aura-MLS, and lower values between 27 and 41 km. Cross-comparisons between the two MIPAS measurement periods show that they generally agree quite well, but, especially for CH4, the reduced-resolution period seems to produce slightly higher mixing ratios than the full-resolution data.

Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) cloud screening algorithms: validation against collocated MODIS and CALIOP data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; CO2 RETRIEVAL; A-TRAIN; AEROSOL; GASES; SATELLITE; AIRCRAFT; MISSION; CIRRUS; BIAS	The objective of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission is to retrieve the column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction (X-CO2) from satellite measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared. These estimates can be biased by clouds and aerosols, i.e., contamination, within the instrument's field of view. Screening of the most contaminated soundings minimizes unnecessary calls to the computationally expensive Level 2 (L2) X-CO2 retrieval algorithm. Hence, robust cloud screening methods have been an important focus of the OCO-2 algorithm development team. Two distinct, computationally inexpensive cloud screening algorithms have been developed for this application. The A-Band Preprocessor (ABP) retrieves the surface pressure using measurements in the 0.76 mu m O-2 A band, neglecting scattering by clouds and aerosols, which introduce photon path-length differences that can cause large deviations between the expected and retrieved surface pressure. The Iterative Maximum A Posteriori (IMAP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) Preprocessor (IDP) retrieves independent estimates of the CO2 and H2O column abundances using observations taken at 1.61 mu m (weak CO2 band) and 2.06 mu m (strong CO2 band), while neglecting atmospheric scattering. The CO2 and H2O column abundances retrieved in these two spectral regions differ significantly in the presence of cloud and scattering aerosols. The combination of these two algorithms, which are sensitive to different features in the spectra, provides the basis for cloud screening of the OCO-2 data set. To validate the OCO-2 cloud screening approach, collocated measurements from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), aboard the Aqua platform, were compared to results from the two OCO-2 cloud screening algorithms. With tuning of algorithmic threshold parameters that allows for processing of similar or equal to 20-25% of all OCO-2 soundings, agreement between the OCO-2 and MODIS cloud screening methods is found to be similar or equal to 85% over four 16-day orbit repeat cycles in both the winter (December) and spring (April-May) for OCO-2 nadir-land, glint-land and glint-water observations. No major, systematic, spatial or temporal dependencies were found, although slight differences in the seasonal data sets do exist and validation is more problematic with increasing solar zenith angle and when surfaces are covered in snow and ice and have complex topography. To further analyze the performance of the cloud screening algorithms, an initial comparison of OCO-2 observations was made to collocated measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). These comparisons highlight the strength of the OCO-2 cloud screening algorithms in identifying high, thin clouds but suggest some difficulty in identifying some clouds near the surface, even when the optical thicknesses are greater than 1.

J	Olsen, KS; Toon, GC; Boone, CD; Strong, K				Olsen, Kevin S.; Toon, Geoffrey C.; Boone, Chris D.; Strong, Kimberly			New temperature and pressure retrieval algorithm for high-resolution infrared solar occultation spectroscopy: analysis and validation against ACE-FTS and COSMIC	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; RADIO OCCULTATION; WATER-VAPOR; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; 1ST DETECTION; UPPER LIMITS; MARS; METHANE; CHEMISTRY	Motivated by the initial selection of a high-resolution solar occultation Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) to fly to Mars on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, we have been developing algorithms for retrieving volume mixing ratio vertical profiles of trace gases, the primary component of which is a new algorithm and software for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and pressure from the spectra. In contrast to Earth-observing instruments, which can rely on accurate meteorological models, a priori information, and spacecraft position, Mars retrievals require a method with minimal reliance on such data. The temperature and pressure retrieval algorithms developed for this work were evaluated using Earth-observing spectra from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) FTS, a solar occultation instrument in orbit since 2003, and the basis for the instrument selected for a Mars mission. ACE-FTS makes multiple measurements during an occultation, separated in altitude by 1.5-5 km, and we analyse 10 CO2 vibration-rotation bands at each altitude, each with a different usable altitude range. We describe the algorithms and present results of their application and their comparison to the ACE-FTS data products. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) provides vertical profiles of temperature up to 40 km with high vertical resolution. Using six satellites and GPS radio occultation, COSMIC's data product has excellent temporal and spatial coverage, allowing us to find coincident measurements with ACE with very tight criteria: less than 1.5 h and 150 km. We present an intercomparison of temperature profiles retrieved from ACE-FTS using our algorithm, that of the ACE Science Team (v3.5), and from COSMIC. When our retrievals are compared to ACE-FTS v3.5, we find mean differences between -5 and +2K and that our retrieved profiles have no seasonal or zonal biases but do have a warm bias in the stratosphere and a cold bias in the mesosphere. When compared to COSMIC, we do not observe a warm/cool bias and mean differences are between -4 and +1 K. COSMIC comparisons are restricted to below 40 km, where our retrievals have the best agreement with ACE-FTS v3.5. When comparing ACE-FTS v3.5 to COSMIC we observe a cold bias in COSMIC of 0.5 K, and mean differences are between -0.9 and +0.6 K.

The combined use of the regularization and LIRIC methods reveals the night-to-day evolution of the vertical structure of the mineral dust microphysical properties and offers complementary information to that from column-integrated variables retrieved from passive remote sensing. Additionally, lidar depolarization profiles and LIRIC retrieved volume concentration are compared with aircraft in situ measurements. This study presents for the first time a comparison of the total volume concentration retrieved with LIRIC with independent in situ measurements, obtaining agreement within the estimated uncertainties for both methods and quite good agreement for the vertical distribution of the aerosol layers. Regarding the depolarization, the first published data set of the CAS-POL for polarization ratios is presented here and qualitatively compared with the lidar technique.In this work we present an analysis of aerosol microphysical properties during a mineral dust event taking advantage of the combination of different state-of-the-art retrieval techniques applied to active and passive remote sensing measurements and the evaluation of some of those techniques using independent data acquired from in situ aircraft measurements. Data were collected in a field campaign performed during a mineral dust outbreak at the Granada, Spain, experimental site (37.16 degrees N, 3.61 degrees W, 680ma.s.l.) on 27 June 2011. Column-integrated properties are provided by sun-and star-photometry, which allows for a continuous evaluation of the mineral dust optical properties during both day and nighttime. Both the linear estimation and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) inversion algorithms are applied for the retrieval of the column-integrated microphysical particle properties. In addition, vertically resolved microphysical properties are obtained from a multi-wavelength Raman lidar system included in EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network), by using both LIRIC (Lidar Radiometer Inversion Code) algorithm during daytime and an algorithm applied to the Raman measurements based on the regularization technique during nighttime.

Revisiting benzene cluster cations for the chemical ionization of dimethyl sulfide and select volatile organic compounds	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							REACTION-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; AMBIENT AIR; PTR-MS; ATMOSPHERIC-PRESSURE; WATER; AEROSOL; PHOTOIONIZATION; SESQUITERPENES; SPECTROSCOPY; MOLECULES	Benzene cluster cations were revisited as a sensitive and selective reagent ion for the chemical ionization of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and a select group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Laboratory characterization was performed using both a new set of compounds (i.e., DMS, beta-caryophyllene) as well as previously studied VOCs (i.e., isoprene, alpha-pinene). Using a field deployable chemical-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CI-ToFMS), benzene cluster cations demonstrated high sensitivity (>1 ncps ppt(-1))to DMS, isoprene, and alpha-pinene standards. Parallel measurements conducted using a chemical-ionization quadrupole mass spectrometer, with a much weaker electric field, demonstrated that ion-molecule reactions likely proceed through a combination of ligand-switching and direct charge transfer mechanisms. Laboratory tests suggest that benzene cluster cations may be suitable for the selective ionization of sesquiterpenes, where minimal fragmentation (<25 %) was observed for the detection of beta-caryophyllene, a bicyclic sesquiterpene. The in-field stability of benzene cluster cations using CI-ToFMS was examined in the marine boundary layer during the High Wind Gas Exchange Study (HiWinGS). The use of benzene cluster cation chemistry for the selective detection of DMS was validated against an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer, where measurements from the two instruments were highly correlated (R-2 > 0.95, 10 s averages) over a wide range of sampling conditions.

J	Nelson, RR; O'Dell, CW; Taylor, TE; Mandrake, L; Smyth, M				Nelson, Robert R.; O'Dell, Christopher W.; Taylor, Thomas E.; Mandrake, Lukas; Smyth, Mike			The potential of clear-sky carbon dioxide satellite retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CO2; GLOBAL CO2; COLUMN; GOSAT; SPACE; SUNLIGHT; AEROSOL; CH4; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION	Since the launch of the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) in 2009, retrieval algorithms designed to infer the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (X-CO2) from hyperspectral near-infrared observations of reflected sunlight have been greatly improved. They now generally include the scattering effects of clouds and aerosols, as early work found that absorption-only retrievals, which neglected these effects, often incurred unacceptably large errors, even for scenes with optically thin cloud or aerosol layers. However, these "full-physics" retrievals tend to be computationally expensive and may incur biases from trying to deduce the properties of clouds and aerosols when there are none present. Additionally, algorithms are now available that can quickly and effectively identify and remove most scenes in which cloud or aerosol scattering plays a significant role. In this work, we test the hypothesis that non-scattering, or "clear-sky", retrievals may perform as well as full-physics retrievals for sufficiently clear scenes. Clear-sky retrievals could potentially avoid errors and biases brought about by trying to infer properties of clouds and aerosols when none are present. Clear-sky retrievals are also desirable because they are orders of magnitude faster than full-physics retrievals. Here we use a simplified version of the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) X-CO2 retrieval algorithm that does not include the scattering and absorption effects of clouds or aerosols. It was found that for simulated Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) measurements, the clear-sky retrieval had errors comparable to those of the full-physics retrieval. For real GOSAT data, the clear-sky retrieval had errors 0-20% larger than the full-physics retrieval over land and errors roughly 20-35% larger over ocean, depending on filtration level. In general, the clear-sky retrieval had X-CO2 root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of less than 2.0 ppm, relative to Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements and a suite of CO2 models, when adequately filtered through the use of a custom genetic algorithm filtering system. These results imply that non-scattering X-CO2 retrievals are potentially more useful than previous literature suggests, as the filtering methods we employ are able to remove measurements in which scattering can cause significant errors. Additionally, the computational benefits of non-scattering retrievals means they may be useful for certain applications that require large amounts of data but have less stringent error requirements.

J	Colosimo, SF; Natraj, V; Sander, SP; Stutz, J				Colosimo, Santo Fedele; Natraj, Vijay; Sander, Stanley P.; Stutz, Jochen			A sensitivity study on the retrieval of aerosol vertical profiles using the oxygen A-band	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC AEROSOL; SPECTRAL-RESOLUTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SCATTERING ATMOSPHERE; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; EXTINCTION; ABSORPTION; O-2; SCIAMACHY; OCEAN	Atmospheric absorption in the O-2 A-band (12 950-13 200 cm(-1)) offers a unique opportunity to retrieve aerosol extinction profiles from space-borne measurements due to the large dynamic range of optical thickness in that spectral region. Absorptions in strong O-2 lines are saturated; therefore, any radiance measured in these lines originates from scattering in the upper part of the atmosphere. Outside of O-2 lines, or in weak lines, the atmospheric column absorption is small, and light penetrates to lower atmospheric layers, allowing for the quantification of aerosols and other scatterers near the surface. While the principle of aerosol profile retrieval using O-2 A-band absorption from space is well-known, a thorough quantification of the information content, i.e., the amount of vertical profile information that can be obtained, and the dependence of the information content on the spectral resolution of the measurements, has not been thoroughly conducted. Here, we use the linearized vector radiative transfer model VLIDORT to perform spectrally resolved simulations of atmospheric radiation in the O-2 A-band for four different aerosol extinction profile scenarios: urban (urban-rural areas), highly polluted (megacity areas with large aerosol extinction), elevated layer (identifying elevated plumes, for example for biomass burning) and low extinction (representative of small aerosol extinction, such as vegetated, marine and arctic areas). The high-resolution radiances emerging from the top of the atmosphere measurements are degraded to different spectral resolutions, simulating spectrometers with different resolving powers. We use optimal estimation theory to quantify the information content in the aerosol profile retrieval with respect to different aerosol parameters and instrument spectral resolutions. The simulations show that better spectral resolution generally leads to an increase in the total amount of information that can be retrieved, with the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) varying between 0.34-2.01 at low resolution (5 cm(-1)) to 3.43-5.38 at high resolution (0.05 cm(-1)) among all the different cases. A particularly strong improvement was found in the retrieval of tropospheric aerosol extinction profiles in the lowest 5 km of the atmosphere. At high spectral resolutions (0.05 cm(-1)), 1.18-1.48 and 1.31-1.96 DoF can be obtained in the lower (0-2 km) and middle (2-5 km) troposphere, respectively, for the different cases. Consequently, a separation of lower and mid tropospheric aerosols is possible, implying the feasibility of identification of elevated biomass burning aerosol plumes (elevated layer scenario). We find that a higher single scattering albedo (SSA) allows for the retrieval of more aerosol information. However, the dependence on SSA is weaker at higher spectral resolutions. The vegetation (surface albedo 0.3), marine (surface albedo 0.05) and arctic (surface albedo 0.9) cases show that the dependence of DoF on the surface albedo decreases with higher resolution. At low resolution (5 cm(-1)), the DoF are 1.19 for the marine case, 0.73 for the vegetation case and 0.34 for the arctic case, but increase considerably at 0.05 cm(-1) resolution to 3.84 (marine) and 3.43 (both vegetation and arctic), showing an improvement of a factor of 10 for the arctic case. Vegetation and arctic case also show the same DoF at higher resolution, showing that an increase of albedo beyond a certain value, i.e., 0.3 in our case, does not lead to a larger information content. The simulations also reveal a moderate dependence of information content on the integration time of the measurements, i.e., the noise of the spectra. However, our results indicate that a larger increase in DoF is obtained by an increase in spectral resolution despite lower signal-to-noise ratios.

An atomic layer deposition process using trimethylaluminum and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride has been developed for the deposition of AlF3 at substrate temperatures between 100 and 200 degrees C. This low temperature process has resulted in thin films with UV-optical properties that have been characterized by ellipsometric and reflection/transmission measurements at wavelengths down to 200 nm. The optical loss for 93 nm thick films deposited at 100 degrees C was measured to be less than 0.2% from visible wavelengths down to 200 nm, and additional microstructural characterization demonstrates that the films are amorphous with moderate tensile stress of 42-105MPa as deposited on silicon substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows no signature of residual aluminum oxide components making these films good candidates for a variety of applications at even shorter UV wavelengths.

We used mixed layer observations from the SEAC(4)RS aircraft campaign over the Southeast US to test the ability of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at different grid resolutions (0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees, 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees, 4 degrees x 5 degrees) to simulate this chemistry under high-isoprene, variable-NOx conditions. Observations of isoprene and NOx over the Southeast US show a negative correlation, reflecting the spatial segregation of emissions; this negative correlation is captured in the model at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees resolution but not at coarser resolutions. As a result, less isoprene oxidation takes place by the high-NOx pathway in the model at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees resolution (54%) than at coarser resolution (59%). The cumulative probability distribution functions (CDFs) of NOx, isoprene, and ozone concentrations show little difference across model resolutions and good agreement with observations, while formaldehyde is overestimated at coarse resolution because excessive isoprene oxidation takes place by the high-NOx pathway with high formaldehyde yield. The good agreement of simulated and observed concentration variances implies that smaller-scale non-linearities (urban and power plant plumes) are not important on the regional scale. Correlations of simulated vs. observed concentrations do not improve with grid resolution because finer modes of variability are intrinsically more difficult to capture. Higher model resolution leads to decreased conversion of NOx to organic nitrates and increased conversion to nitric acid, with total reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy) changing little across model resolutions. Model concentrations in the lower free troposphere are also insensitive to grid resolution. The overall low sensitivity of modeled concentrations to grid resolution implies that coarse resolution is adequate when modeling continental boundary layer chemistry for global applications.

J	Zak, M				Zak, Michail			Games of entangled agents	COGENT MATHEMATICS			English	Article						randomness; stability; attractors		The paper extends the mathematical formalism of quantum physics to include games of intelligent agents that communicate due to entanglement. The novelty of the approach is based upon a human factor-based behavioral model of an intelligent agent. The model is quantum inspired: it is represented by a modified Madelung equation in which the gradient of quantum potential is replaced by a specially chosen information force. It consists of motor dynamics simulating actual behavior of the agent, and mental dynamics representing evolution of the corresponding knowledge base and incorporating this knowledge in the form of information flows into the motor dynamics. Due to feedback from mental dynamics, the motor dynamics attains quantum-like properties: its trajectory splits into a family of different trajectories, and each of those trajectories can be chosen with the probability prescribed by the mental dynamics; each agent is entangled (in a quantum way) to other agents and makes calculated predictions for future actions; human factor is associated with violation of the second law of thermodynamics: the system can move from disorder to order without external help, and that represents intrinsic intelligence. All of these departures actually extend and complement the classical methods making them especially successful in analysis of communications of agents represented by new mathematical formalism, and in particular, in agent-based economics with a human factor.

Tools from computer science, such as model checking and logic synthesis, combined with design patterns from feedback control theory provide new approaches to solving these problems. A major shift is the move from "design then verify" to "specify then synthesize" approaches to controller design that allow simultaneous synthesis of high-performance, robust control laws and correct-by-construction decision-making logic.

Various types of masks could be employed to suppress the host starlight to about 10-9 level contrast over a broad spectrum to enable the coronagraph mission objectives. Such masks for high-contrast internal coronagraphic imaging require various fabrication technologies to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron scale island features, ultralow reflectivity regions, uniformity, wave front quality, and achromaticity. We present the approaches employed at JPL to produce pupil plane and image plane coronagraph masks by combining electron beam, deep reactive ion etching, and black silicon technologies with illustrative examples of each, highlighting milestone accomplishments from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed at JPL and from the High Contrast Imaging Lab at Princeton University.

Each architecture relies on newly developed mask components to function in the presence of the AFTA aperture, and so both must be matured to a high technology readiness level in advance of the mission. A series of milestones were set to track the development of the technologies required for the instrument; we report on completion of WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph milestone 2-a narrowband 10-8 contrast test with static aberrations for the shaped pupil-and the plans for the upcoming broadband coronagraph milestone 5.

J	Kern, B				Kern, Brian			Impact of WFIRST-AFTA line-of-sight jitter distributions on phase-induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph science yield	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						coronagraph; exoplanets; wavefront control		A framework for evaluating the science yield of a coronagraph in the presence of a variety of line-of-sight jitter environments is described and the use of a tip-tilt threshold for improving science yield is proposed. The current expectations of the WFIRST-AFTA mission are used for specific distributions of line-of-sight jitter, including the current expectations for tip-tilt correction using a low-order wavefront sensor/control. The effect of the residual tip-tilt on the phase-induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph (PIAACMC) architecture is considered, because the performance of the PIAACMC architecture is expected to be dominated by tip-tilt sensitivity, implying that this treatment has a large impact on the final science yield. The most important outcomes of this study are that the rms residual tip-tilt expected after correction is 0.6 mas rms/axis and that by eliminating some science frames during analysis through a tip-tilt threshold, the number of planets observable increases by similar to 25% for the 550-nm imaging channel. The number of known radial velocity planets expected to be observed ranges from 29 to 78 at 550 nm and from 9 to 12 at 890 nm.

The mask has many small features (similar to micron lateral scales) and was fabricated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Microdevices Laboratory, then characterized using a scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, and optical interferometric microscope. The measured fabrication errors were then fed to a wavefront control model which predicts the contrast performance of a full coronagraph. The expected coronagraphic performance using this mask is consistent with observing similar to 15 planetary targets with WFIRST-AFTA in a reasonable time (<1 day/target).

The telescope, however, is not ideal, given its obscured aperture. Only recently have coronagraph designs been thoroughly investigated that can efficiently work with this configuration. Three coronagraph designs, the hybrid Lyot, shaped pupil, and phase-induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph have been selected for further development by the Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset project. Real-world testbed demonstrations of these have just begun, so for now, the most reliable means of evaluating their potential performance comes from numerical modeling incorporating diffraction propagation, realistic system models, and simulated wavefront sensing and control. Here, we present the methods of performance evaluation and results for the current coronagraph designs.

It produces starlight suppression over the full 360-deg annular region and thus is particularly suitable to improve the discovery space around WFIRST-AFTA targets. Since being selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in December 2013, the coronagraph technology is being matured to technology readiness level 5 by September 2016. We present the progress of HLC key component fabrication and testbed demonstrations with the WFIRST-AFTA pupil. For the first time, a circular HLC occulter mask consisting of metal and dielectric layers is fabricated and characterized. Wavefront control using two deformable mirrors is successfully demonstrated in a vacuum testbed with narrowband light (<1-nm bandwidth at 516 nm) to obtain repeatable convergence below 8 x 10(-9) mean contrast in the 360-deg dark hole with a working angle between 3 lambda/D and 9 lambda/D with arbitrary polarization. We detail the hardware and software used in the testbed, the results, and the associated analysis.

The LOWFS/C uses the rejected stellar light from the coronagraph to sense and suppress the telescope pointing errors as well as low-order wavefront errors (WFEs) due to changes in thermal loading of the telescope and the rest of the observatory. We will present a conceptual design of a LOWFS/C subsystem for the WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph. This LOWFS/C uses a Zernike phase contrast wavefront sensor (ZWFS) with a phase shifting disk combined with the stellar light rejecting occulting masks, a key concept to minimize the noncommon path error. We will present our analysis of the sensor performance and evaluate the performance of the line-of-sight jitter suppression loop, as well as the low-order WFE correction loop with a deformable mirror on the coronagraph. We will also report the LOWFS/C testbed design and the preliminary in-air test results, which show a very promising performance of the ZWFS.

Here we estimate the expected science yield of the CGI for known radial-velocity (RV) planets and potential circumstellar disks. The science return is estimated for three types of coronagraphs: the hybrid Lyot and shaped pupil are the currently planned designs, and the phase-induced amplitude apodizing complex mask coronagraph is the backup design. We compare the potential performance of each type for imaging as well as spectroscopy. We find that the RV targets can be imaged in sufficient numbers to produce substantial advances in the science of nearby exoplanets.

However, the requisite imaging contrast, at levels of 1 billion to one or better for the direct imaging of cool mature exoplanets in reflected visible starlight, leads to challenging new requirements on the stability and control of the optical wavefront, at levels currently beyond the reach of ground-based telescopes. We review the design, performance, and science prospects for the hybrid Lyot coronagraph (HLC) on the WFIRST-AFTA telescope. Together with a pair of deformable mirrors for active wavefront control, the HLC creates a full 360-deg high-contrast dark field of view at 10(-9) contrast levels or better, extending to within angular separations of 3 lambda(0)/D from the central star, over spectral bandwidths of 10% or more.

Lately, continuous flash suppression (CFS), a technique for suppressing visual stimuli, has been widely used to demonstrate surprisingly high-level processing of invisible stimuli. Yet, recent studies showed that CFS might actually allow low-level features of the stimulus to escape suppression and be consciously perceived. The influence of such low-level awareness on high-level processing might easily go unnoticed, as studies usually only probe the visibility of the feature of interest, and not that of lower-level features. For instance, face identity is held to be processed unconsciously since subjects who fail to judge the identity of suppressed faces still show identity priming effects. Here we challenge these results, showing that such high-level priming effects are indeed induced by faces whose identity is invisible, but critically, only when a lower-level feature, such as color or location, is visible. No evidence for identity processing was found when subjects had no conscious access to any feature of the suppressed face. These results suggest that high-level processing of an image might be enabled by-or co-occur with-conscious access to some of its low-level features, even when these features are not relevant to the processed dimension. Accordingly, they call for further investigation of lower-level awareness during CFS, and reevaluation of other unconscious high-level processing findings.

These magnetosome compartments are a model for studying the biogenesis and subcellular organization of bacterial organelles. Previous studies have suggested that discrete gene products build and assemble magnetosomes in a stepwise fashion. Here, using an inducible system, we show that the stages of magnetosome formation are highly dynamic and interconnected. During de novo formation, magnetosomes first organize into discontinuous chain fragments that are subsequently connected by the bacterial actin-like protein MamK. We also find that magnetosome membranes are not uniform in size and can grow in a biomineralization-dependent manner. In the absence of biomineralization, magnetosome membranes stall at a diameter of similar to 50 nm. Those that have initiated biomineralization then expand to significantly larger sizes and accommodate mature magnetic particles. We speculate that such a biomineralization-dependent checkpoint for membrane growth establishes the appropriate conditions within the magnetosome to ensure successful nucleation and growth of magnetic particles. IMPORTANCE Magnetotactic bacteria make magnetic nanoparticles inside membrane-bound organelles called magnetosomes; however, it is unclear how the magnetosome membrane controls the biomineralization that occurs within this bacterial organelle. We placed magnetosome formation under inducible control in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 and used electron cryo-tomography to capture magnetosomes in their near-native state as they form de novo. An inducible system provided the key evidence that magnetosome membranes grow continuously unless they have not properly initiated biomineralization. Our finding that the size of a bacterial organelle impacts its biochemical function is a fundamental advance that impacts our perception of organelle formation and can inform future attempts aimed at creating designer magnetic particles.

Simulating secondary organic aerosol in a regional air quality model using the statistical oxidation model - Part 1: Assessing the influence of constrained multi-generational ageing	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							BASIS-SET APPROACH; CHEMICAL-TRANSPORT MODEL; SMOG-CHAMBER EXPERIMENTS; PARTICULATE MATTER; VEHICLE EMISSIONS; MEXICO-CITY; PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION; MASS-SPECTROMETER; VOLATILITY; SEMIVOLATILE	Multi-generational oxidation of volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation products can significantly alter the mass, chemical composition and properties of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) compared to calculations that consider only the first few generations of oxidation reactions. However, the most commonly used state-of-the-science schemes in 3-D regional or global models that account for multi-generational oxidation (1) consider only functionalization reactions but do not consider fragmentation reactions, (2) have not been constrained to experimental data and (3) are added on top of existing parameterizations. The incomplete description of multi-generational oxidation in these models has the potential to bias source apportionment and control calculations for SOA. In this work, we used the statistical oxidation model (SOM) of Cappa and Wilson (2012), constrained by experimental laboratory chamber data, to evaluate the regional implications of multi-generational oxidation considering both functionalization and fragmentation reactions. SOM was implemented into the regional University of California at Davis / California Institute of Technology (UCD/CIT) air quality model and applied to air quality episodes in California and the eastern USA. The mass, composition and properties of SOA predicted using SOM were compared to SOA predictions generated by a traditional two-product model to fully investigate the impact of explicit and self-consistent accounting of multi-generational oxidation. Results show that SOA mass concentrations predicted by the UCD/CIT-SOM model are very similar to those predicted by a two-product model when both models use parameters that are derived from the same chamber data. Since the twoproduct model does not explicitly resolve multi-generational oxidation reactions, this finding suggests that the chamber data used to parameterize the models captures the majority of the SOA mass formation from multi-generational oxidation under the conditions tested. Consequently, the use of low and high NO x yields perturbs SOA concentrations by a factor of two and are probably a much stronger determinant in 3-D models than multi-generational oxidation. While total predicted SOA mass is similar for the SOM and two-product models, the SOM model predicts increased SOA contributions from anthropogenic (alkane, aromatic) and sesquiterpenes and decreased SOA contributions from isoprene and monoterpene relative to the two-product model calculations. The SOA predicted by SOM has a much lower volatility than that predicted by the traditional model, resulting in better qualitative agreement with volatility measurements of ambient OA. On account of its lower-volatility, the SOA mass produced by SOM does not appear to be as strongly influenced by the inclusion of oligomerization reactions, whereas the two-product model relies heavily on oligomerization to form low-volatility SOA products. Finally, an unconstrained contemporary hybrid scheme to model multi-generational oxidation within the framework of a two-product model in which ageing reactions are added on top of the existing two-product parameterization is considered. This hybrid scheme formed at least 3 times more SOA than the SOM during regional simulations as a result of excessive transformation of semi-volatile vapors into lower volatility material that strongly partitions to the particle phase. This finding suggests that these hybrid multi-generational schemes should be used with great caution in regional models.	[Jathar, S.

The identification of CTCs in peripheral blood samples has been associated with poor survival outcomes in various cancer types. As a readily accessible source of tumor tissue there is a vast potential to develop CTCs as a biomarker to advance cancer diagnosis, prognosis and the development of novel and targeted therapies. The fact that CTCs occur as extremely rare events in whole blood presents a technical challenge for characterization, requiring enrichment techniques that are both highly sensitive and sufficiently specific, The culture and expansion of CTCs is desirable as a means of yielding a population suitable for comprehensive functional characterization and drug testing. Reports of successful in vitro culture of CTCs are rare, but various approaches have been attempted and significant progress has been made. The development of protocols for reliable and efficient culture of viable CTCs will advance our biological understanding of cancer metastasis and facilitate the development of personalized therapies.

Episodic Dissolution, Precipitation, and Slip along the Heart Mountain Detachment, Wyoming	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY			English	Article							ANGLE NORMAL FAULTS; FLUID-PRESSURE; WHITE MOUNTAIN; OVERTHRUST; MECHANICS; WESTERN; ORIGIN; FLOW; FLUIDIZATION; EMPLACEMENT	The Heart Mountain allochthon is among the largest landslide masses in the rock record. The basal fault, the Heart Mountain detachment, is an archetype for the mechanical enigma of brittle fracture and subsequent frictional slip on low-angle faults, both of which appear to occur at ratios of shear stress to normal stress far below those predicted by laboratory experiments. The location of the detachment near the base of thick cratonic carbonates, rather than within subjacent shales, is particularly enigmatic for frictional slip. A broad array of potential mechanisms for failure on this rootless fault have been proposed, the majority of which invoke single-event, catastrophic emplacement of the allochthon. Here, we present field, petrographic, and geochemical evidence for multiple slip events, including crosscutting clastic dikes and multiple brecciation and veining events. Cataclasites along the fault show abundant evidence of pressure solution creep. Banded grains, which have been cited as evidence for catastrophic emplacement, are associated with stylolitic surfaces and alteration textures that suggest formation through the relatively slow processes of dissolution and chemical alteration rather than dynamic suspension in a fluid. Temperatures of formation of fault-related rocks, as revealed by clumped isotope thermometry, are low and incompatible with models of catastrophic emplacement. We propose that displacement along the gently dipping detachment was initiated near the base of the carbonates as localized patches of viscous yielding, engendered by pressure solution. This yielding, which occurred at very low ratios of shear stress to normal stress, induced local subhorizontal tractions along the base of the allochthon, raising shear stress levels (i.e., locally rotating the stress field) to the point where brittle failure and subsequent slip occurred along the detachment. Iteration of this process over geological time produced the observed multikilometer displacements. This concept does not require conditions and materials that are commonly invoked to resolve the stress paradox for low-angle faults, such as near-lithostatic fluid pressures or relative weakness of phyllosilicates in the brittle regime. Cyclic interaction of viscous creep (here by pressure solution) and brittle failure may occur under any fluid pressure conditions and within any rock type, and as such it may be an attractive mechanism for slip on "misoriented" fault planes in general.

The ALD CoOx thin film: (i) formed a heterojunction with the n-Si(100) that provided a photovoltage of 575 mV under 1 Sun of simulated solar illumination; (ii) stabilized Si photoanodes that are otherwise unstable when operated in aqueous alkaline electrolytes; and, (iii) catalyzed the oxidation of water, thereby reducing the kinetic overpotential required for the reaction and increasing the overall efficiency relative to electrodes that do not have an inherently electrocatalytic coating. The process provides a simple, effective method for enabling the use of planar n-Si(100) substrates as efficient and durable photoanodes in fully integrated, photovoltaic-biased solar fuels generators.

Effects of Long-Term Stowage on the Deployment of Bistable Tape Springs	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								In the context of strain-energy-deployed space structures, material relaxation effects play a significant role in structures that are stowed for long durations, for example, in a space vehicle prior to launch. Here, the deployment of an ultrathin carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) tape spring is studied, with the aim of understanding how long-duration stowage affects its deployment behavior. Analytical modeling and experiments show that the deployment time increases predictably with stowage time and temperature, and analytical predictions are found to compare well with experiments. For cases where stress relaxation is excessive, the structure is shown to lose its ability to deploy autonomously.

J	Marcolli, M; Tabuda, G				Marcolli, Matilde; Tabuda, Goncalo			Noncommutative numerical motives, Tannakian structures, and motivic Galois groups	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Noncommutative algebraic geometry; noncommutative motives; periodic cyclic homology; Tannakian formalism; motivic Galois groups	CYCLIC HOMOLOGY; K-THEORY; EQUIVALENCE	In this article we further the study of noncommutative numerical motives, initiated in [30, 31]. By exploring the change-of-coefficients mechanism, we start by improving some of the main results of [30]. Then, making use of the notion of Schur-finiteness, we prove that the category NNum (k)(F) of noncommutative numerical motives is (neutral) super-Tannakian. As in the commutative world, NNum (k)(F) is not Tannakian. In order to solve this problem we promote periodic cyclic homology to a well-defined symmetric monoidal functor (HP*) over bar on the category of noncommutative Chow motives. This allows us to introduce the correct noncommutative analogues C-NC and DNC of Grothendieck's standard conjectures C and D. Assuming CNC, we prove that NNum (k)(F) can be made into a Tannakian category NNum(dagger)(k)(F) by modifying its symmetry isomorphism constraints. By further assuming D-NC, we neutralize the Tannakian category Num(dagger) (k)(F) using (HP*) over bar. Via the (super-) Tannakian formalism, we then obtain well-defined noncommutative motivic Galois (super-) groups. Finally, making use of Deligne-Milne's theory of Tate triples, we construct explicit morphisms relating these noncommutative motivic Galois (super-) groups to the classical ones as suggested by Kontsevich.

Evaluating Activity for Hydrogen-Evolving Cobalt and Nickel Complexes at Elevated Pressures of Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide	ELECTROCATALYSIS			English	Article						Electrocatalysis; Hydrogen evolution; Water splitting; Solar fuels	MOLECULAR ELECTROCATALYSTS; H-2 PRODUCTION; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS; FUNCTIONAL MODELS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; LIGAND COMPLEXES; CO2 REDUCTION; WATER; EVOLUTION	Molecular cobalt and nickel complexes are among the most promising homogeneous systems for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, there has been little exploration into the effect of gaseous co-additives such as CO and H-2, which may be present in operating hydrogen-evolving or carbon-dioxide reduction systems, on the performance of these molecular electrocatalysts. In this report, we investigate the electrocatalytic activity of six cobalt and nickel complexes supported by tetraazamacrocyclic or diazadiphosphacyclooctane ligands for the reduction of p-toluenesulfonic acid to hydrogen in acetonitrile under inert atmosphere and in the presence of CO and H-2. We present an elevated-pressure electrochemical apparatus capable of reaching CO and H-2 pressures of ca. 15-520 pounds per square inch (psia) (similar to 1-35 atm), and we use this apparatus to determine binding constants for CO addition for each catalyst and study the inhibition of the electrocatalysis as a function of CO and H-2 pressure. In the case of CO, the extent of catalytic inhibition is correlated to the binding constant, with the cobalt complexes showing a greater degree of catalyst inhibition compared to the nickel complexes. In the case of H-2, no complex showed appreciable electrocatalytic inhibition even at H-2 pressures of ca. 500 psia.	[McCrory, Charles C.

Atmospheric polarimetric effects on GNSS radio occultations: the ROHP-PAZ field campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							RADAR REFLECTIVITY; WATER-CONTENT; ICE; INVERSION; SHAPE	This study describes the first experimental observations showing that hydrometeors induce polarimetric signatures in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. This evidence is relevant to the PAZ low Earth orbiter, which will test the concept and applications of polarimetric GNSS radio occultation (RO) (i.e. ROs obtained with a dual-polarization antenna). A ground field campaign was carried out in preparation for PAZ to verify the theoretical sensitivity studies on this concept (Cardellach et al., 2015). The main aim of the campaign is to identify and understand the factors that might affect the polarimetric GNSS observables. Studied for the first time, GNSS signals measured with two polarimetric antennas (H, horizontal, and V, vertical) are shown to discriminate between heavy rain events by comparing the measured phase difference between the H and V phase delays (18) in different weather scenarios. The measured phase difference indicates higher dispersion under rain conditions. When individual events are examined, significant increases in 18 occur when the radio signals cross rain cells. Moreover, the amplitude of such a signal is much higher than the theoretical prediction for precipitation; thus, other sources of polarimetric signatures have been explored and identified. Modelling of other hydrometeors, such as melting particles and ice crystals, have been proposed to explain the obtained measurements, with good agreement in more than 90% of the cases.

In this work, we identified the quorum-sensing-regulated proteome in the model organism Vibrio harveyi by bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT). BONCAT enables measurement of proteome dynamics with temporal resolution on the order of minutes. We deployed BONCAT to characterize the time-dependent transition of V. harveyi from individual-to group-behaviors. We identified 176 quorum-sensing-regulated proteins at early, intermediate, and late stages of the transition, and we mapped the temporal changes in quorum-sensing proteins controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Analysis of the identified proteins revealed 86 known and 90 new quorum-sensing-regulated proteins with diverse functions, including transcription factors, chemotaxis proteins, transport proteins, and proteins involved in iron homeostasis.

Catalysis by framework zinc in silica-based molecular sieves	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							MEERWEIN-PONNDORF-VERLEY; LEWIS-ACID SITES; BETA ZEOLITE; SN-BETA; 2,5-FURANDICARBOXYLIC ACID; TITANIUM SILICATES; DIELS-ALDER; ZINCOSILICATE; ISOMERIZATION; OXIDATION	Microporous and mesoporous zincosilicates (e.g., CIT-6, VPI-8, Zn-MFI, and Zn-MCM-41) synthesized in the presence of alkali cations contain two broad types of Zn sites: one that is a dication analog of the monocation ion-exchangeable Al-site in aluminosilicates, while the other resembles isolated Zn sites on amorphous silica. The ratio of these sites varies, depending on the synthesis conditions of the zincosilicate. Post-synthetic strategies based on ion-exchange can alter the site distribution towards either population. Furthermore, post-synthetic introduction of isolated Zn sites of the latter type is possible for materials possessing silanol nests. Both types of sites behave as Lewis acid centers in probemolecule IR spectroscopy, but have very different catalytic properties. Due to the unusually high adsorption energies of Lewis bases on such materials, Lewis acid catalysis is difficult at low temperatures and in solvents bearing Lewis basic functionality. However, at high temperatures, in hydrocarbon solvents, CIT-6 (Zn-beta) is able to selectively catalyze the Lewis-acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder cycloaddition-dehydration reactions of ethylene with methyl 5-(methoxymethyl) furan-2-carboxylate, a furan that can be derived quantitatively by partial oxidation of biomass-based 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. Additionally, zinc in silica-based molecular sieves is shown here to enable chemistries previously not accessible with framework Sn-, Ti-and Zr-based Lewis acid sites, e.g., the direct production of dimethyl terephthalate by Diels-Alder cycloaddition-dehydration reactions of ethylene and the dimethyl ester of furan-2,5-dicarboxilic acid.

The structure of the Lie algebra g of G is used to interpret the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex with coefficients in the smooth subalgebra A subset of A as noncommutative differential forms on the dynamical system. We conformally perturb the standard metric, which is associated with the unique G-invariant state on A, by means of a Weyl conformal factor given by a positive invertible element of the algebra, and consider the Hermitian structure that it induces on the complex. A Hodge decomposition theorem is proved, which allows us to relate the Euler characteristic of the complex to the index properties of a Hodge-de Rham operator for the perturbed metric. This operator, which is shown to be selfadjoint, is a key ingredient in our construction of a spectral triple on A and a twisted spectral triple on its opposite algebra. The conformal invariance of the Euler characteristic is interpreted as an indication of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem in this setting. The spectral triples encoding the conformally perturbed metrics are shown to enjoy the same spectral summability properties as the unperturbed case.

We herein report the facile syntheses of cationic ruthenium catalysts bearing bulky phosphine ligands. Simple ligand exchange using silver(I) salts of non-coordinating or weakly coordinating anions provided either PPh3 or chelating Ph2P(CH2)(n)PPh2 (n = 2 or 3) ligated cationic catalysts. The structures of these newly reported catalysts feature unique geometries caused by ligation of the bulky phosphine ligands. Their activities and selectivities in standard metathesis reactions were also investigated. These cationic ruthenium alkylidene catalysts reported here showed moderate activity and very similar stereoselectivity when compared to the second generation ruthenium dichloride catalyst in ring-closing metathesis, cross metathesis, and ring-opening metathesis polymerization assays.

Before the foundation of the Royal Society, I contend, the term had been utilized promiscuously, its modern signification conspicuously absent. Building on this insight, I examine the seemingly deliberate decision by future members of the Royal Society to avoid using the term - and the subsequent shift in their attitude c. 1660. My aim is to demonstrate that while only in England did the fixed conceptual and polemical term "experimental philosophy" become popularized and its (supposed) practice institutionalized, English natural philosophers did not view themselves as engaged in a practice that was fundamentally different than that pursued by their counterparts on the Continent.

Appl. Numer. Math., 25, 297-302) are variational linearizations of Newmark methods. When used in conjunction with penalty methods (i.e., methods that replace constraints by stiff potentials), these integrators permit coarse time-stepping of holonomically constrained mechanical systems and bypass the resolution of nonlinear systems. Although penalty methods are widely employed, an explicit link to Lagrange multiplier approaches appears to be lacking; such a link is now provided (in the context of two-scale flow convergence (Tao, M., Owhadi, H. & Marsden, J.

High Throughput Combinatorial Experimentation plus Informatics = Combinatorial Science	INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR MATERIALS DISCOVERY AND DESIGN	Springer Series in Materials Science		English	Article; Book Chapter							STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; DECOMPOSITION; DISCOVERY; SEARCH	Many present, emerging and future technologies rely upon the development high performance functional materials. For a given application, the performance of materials containing 1 or 2 elements from the periodic table have been evaluated using traditional techniques, and additional materials complexity is required to continue the development of advanced materials, for example through the incorporation of several elements into a single material. The combinatorial aspect of combining several elements yields vast composition spaces that can be effectively explored with high throughput techniques. State of the art high throughput experiments produce data which are multivariate, high-dimensional, and consist of wide ranges of spatial and temporal scales. We present an example of such data in the area of water splitting electrocatalysis and describe recent progress on 2 areas of interpreting such vast, complex datasets. We discuss a genetic programming technique for automated identification of composition-property trends, which is important for understanding the data and crucial in identifying representative compositions for further investigation. By incorporating such an algorithm in a high throughput experimental pipeline, the automated down-selection of samples can empower a highly efficient tiered screening platform. We also discuss some fundamental mathematics of composition spaces, where compositional variables are non-Euclidean due to the constant-sum constraint. We describe the native simplex space spanned by composition variables and provide illustrative examples of statistics and interpolation within this space. Through further development of machine learning algorithms and their prudent implementation in the simplex space, the data informatics community will establish methods that derive the most knowledge from high throughput materials science data.

Global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the 15 March 2013 coronal mass ejection eventInterpretation of the 30-80MeV proton flux	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						coronal mass ejection; geomagnetic storm; interplanetary shock; MHD simulation; solar energetic particles; magnetic cloud	ENERGETIC PARTICLE EVENTS; PEAK INTENSITIES; SOLAR-WIND; INTERPLANETARY SHOCKS; RADIAL DEPENDENCE; PROPAGATION; EVOLUTION; SUN; ACCELERATION; TRANSPORT	The coronal mass ejection (CME) event on 15 March 2013 is one of the few solar events in Cycle 24 that produced a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event and severe geomagnetic activity. Observations of SEP from the ACE spacecraft show a complex time-intensity SEP profile that is not easily understood with current empirical SEP models. In this study, we employ a global three-dimensional (3-D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to help interpret the observations. The simulation is based on the H3DMHD code and incorporates extrapolations of photospheric magnetic field as the inner boundary condition at a solar radial distance (r) of 2.5 solar radii. A Gaussian-shaped velocity pulse is imposed at the inner boundary as a proxy for the complex physical conditions that initiated the CME. It is found that the time-intensity profile of the high-energy (>10MeV) SEPs can be explained by the evolution of the CME-driven shock and its interaction with the heliospheric current sheet and the nonuniform solar wind. We also demonstrate in more detail that the simulated fast-mode shock Mach number at the magnetically connected shock location is well correlated (r(cc)0.7) with the concurrent 30-80MeV proton flux. A better correlation occurs when the 30-80MeV proton flux is scaled by r(-1.4)(r(cc)=0.87). When scaled by r(-2.8), the correlation for 10-30MeV proton flux improves significantly from r(cc)=0.12 to r(cc)=0.73, with 1h delay. The present study suggests that (1) sector boundary can act as an obstacle to the propagation of SEPs; (2) the background solar wind is an important factor in the variation of IP shock strength and thus plays an important role in manipulation of SEP flux; (3) at least 50% of the variance in SEP flux can be explained by the fast-mode shock Mach number. This study demonstrates that global MHD simulation, despite the limitation implied by its physics-based ideal fluid continuum assumption, can be a viable tool for SEP data analysis.

However, comparisons of the electrochemical performance of these materials have been challenging due to the different methods of attachment, catalyst loadings, and electrochemical test conditions reported in the literature. Herein, we have leveraged a conventional drop-casting method that allows for the successful adhesion of a wide range of nanoparticulate catalysts to glassy-carbon electrode surfaces. We have applied this adhesion method to prepare catalyst films from 16 crystalline metal-oxide nanoparticles with a constant loading of 0.8 mg cm(-2), and evaluated the resulting nanoparticulate films for the oxygen evolution reaction under conditions relevant to an integrated solar fuels device. In general, the activities of the adhered nanoparticulate films are similar to those of thin-film catalysts prepared by electrodeposition or sputtering, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current densities per geometric area at overpotentials of similar to 0.35-0.5 V.

Hard X-ray emission of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 as observed by NuSTAR	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual: NGC 6240; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS; STAR-FORMATION RATE; BLACK-HOLE GROWTH; XMM-NEWTON; QUASAR FEEDBACK; NGC-6240; SPECTROSCOPY; CHANDRA; MASS; GAS	We present a broadband (similar to 0.3-70 keV) spectral and temporal analysis of NuSTAR observations of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 combined with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and BeppoSAX data. NGC 6240 is a galaxy in a relatively early merger state with two distinct nuclei separated by similar to 1.''5. Previous Chandra observations resolved the two nuclei and showed that they are both active and obscured by Compton-thick material. Although they cannot be resolved by NuSTAR, we were able to clearly detect, for the first time, both the primary and the reflection continuum components thanks to the unprecedented quality of the NuSTAR data at energies >10 keV. The NuSTAR hard X-ray spectrum is dominated by the primary continuum piercing through an absorbing column density which is mildly optically thick to Compton scattering (tau similar or equal to 1.2, N-H similar to 1.5 x 10(24) cm(-2)). We detect moderately hard X-ray (>10 keV) flux variability up to 20% on short (15-20 ks) timescales. The amplitude of the variability is largest at similar to 30 keV and is likely to originate from the primary continuum of the southern nucleus. Nevertheless, the mean hard X-ray flux on longer timescales (years) is relatively constant. Moreover, the two nuclei remain Compton-thick, although we find evidence of variability in the material along the line of sight with column densities N-H <= 2 x 1023 cm(-2) over long (similar to 3-15 yr) timescales. The observed X-ray emission in the NuSTAR energy range is fully consistent with the sum of the best-fit models of the spatially resolved Chandra spectra of the two nuclei.

Precipitation climatology over India: validation with observations and reanalysis datasets and spatial trends	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Precipitation; Climatology; India; IMD; GPCC; APHRODITE; ERA-Interim; CFSR; JRA-25; MERRA; Trends; Validation	RAINFALL; PERFORMANCE; JRA-25	Changing rainfall patterns have significant effect on water resources, agriculture output in many countries, especially the country like India where the economy depends on rain-fed agriculture. Rainfall over India has large spatial as well as temporal variability. To understand the variability in rainfall, spatial-temporal analyses of rainfall have been studied by using 107 (1901-2007) years of daily gridded India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets. Further, the validation of IMD precipitation data is carried out with different observational and different reanalysis datasets during the period from 1989 to 2007. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project data shows similar features as that of IMD with high degree of comparison, whereas Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation data show similar features but with large differences, especially over northwest, west coast and western Himalayas. Spatially, large deviation is observed in the interior peninsula during the monsoon season with National Aeronautics Space Administration-Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (NASA-MERRA), pre-monsoon with Japanese 25 years Re Analysis (JRA-25), and post-monsoon with climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) reanalysis datasets. Among the reanalysis datasets, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) shows good comparison followed by CFSR, NASA-MERRA, and JRA-25. Further, for the first time, with high resolution and long-term IMD data, the spatial distribution of trends is estimated using robust regression analysis technique on the annual and seasonal rainfall data with respect to different regions of India. Significant positive and negative trends are noticed in the whole time series of data during the monsoon season. The northeast and west coast of the Indian region shows significant positive trends and negative trends over western Himalayas and north central Indian region.

Causes of WRF surface energy fluxes biases in a stratocumulus region	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Stratocumulus; Surface energy fluxes; Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model; Physics parameterization schemes; VOCALS-REx	BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; SOUTHEAST PACIFIC; CLOSURE-MODEL; PART II; PARAMETERIZATION; TURBULENCE; CUMULUS; IMPLEMENTATION; PRECIPITATION; CONVECTION	In this study, we evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting model to simulate surface energy fluxes in the southeast Pacific stratocumulus region. A total of 18 simulations is performed for the period of October to November 2008, with various combinations of boundary layer, microphysics, and cumulus schemes. Simulated surface energy fluxes are compared to those measured during VOCALS-REx. Using a process-based model evaluation, errors in surface fluxes are attributed to errors in cloud properties. Net surface flux errors are mostly traceable to errors in cloud liquid water path (LWPcld), which produce biases in downward shortwave radiation. Two mechanisms controlling LWPcld are diagnosed. One involves microphysics schemes, which control LWPcld through the production of raindrops. The second mechanism involves boundary layer and cumulus schemes, which control moisture available for cloud by regulating boundary layer height. In this study, we demonstrate that when parameterizations are appropriately chosen, the stratocumulus deck and the related surface energy fluxes are reasonably well represented. In the most realistic experiments, the net surface flux is underestimated by about 10 W m(-2). This remaining low bias is due to a systematic overestimation of the total surface cooling due to sensible and latent heat fluxes in our simulations. There does not appear to be a single physical reason for this bias. Finally, our results also suggest that inaccurate representation of boundary layer height is an important factor limiting further gains in model realism.

Information-rich spectral channels for simulated retrievals of partial column-averaged methane	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						remote sensing; information analysis; channel selection; methane cycle	ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; REFLECTED SUNLIGHT; MOLE FRACTIONS; CH4; CO2; RESOLUTION; ALGORITHM; SATELLITE; AEROSOL; SPECTROMETER	Space-based remote sensing of the column-averaged methane dry air mole fraction (XCH4) has greatly increased our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns in the global methane cycle. The potential to retrieve multiple pieces of vertical profile information would further improve the quantification of CH4 across space-time scales. We conduct information analysis for channel selection and evaluate the prospects of retrieving multiple pieces of information as well as total column CH4 from both ground-based and space-based near-infrared remote sensing spectra. We analyze the degrees of freedom of signal (DOF) in the CH4 absorption bands near 2.3m and 1.6m and select approximate to 1% of the channels that contain >95% of the information about the CH4 profile. The DOF is around 4 for fine ground-based spectra (resolution=0.01cm(-1)) and 3 for coarse space-based spectra (resolution=0.20cm(-1)) based on channel selection and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 300. The DOF varies from 2.2 to 3.2 when SNR is between 100 and 300, and spectral resolution is 0.20cm(-1). Simulated retrieval tests in clear-sky conditions using the selected channels reveal that the retrieved partial column-averaged CH4 values are not sensitive to the a priori profiles and can reflect local enhancements of CH4 in different partial air columns. Both the total and partial column-averaged retrieval errors in all tests are within 1% of the true state. These simulated tests highlight the possibility to retrieve up to three to four pieces of information about the vertical distribution of CH4 in reality.

Here we operated two laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors enriched with Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis (Accumulibacter) performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal. Reactors formed two distinct biofilms, one floccular biofilm, consisting of small, loose, microbial aggregates, and one granular biofilm, forming larger, dense, spherical aggregates. Using metagenomic and metaproteomic methods, we investigated the proteomic differences between these two biofilm communities, identifying a total of 2022 unique proteins. To understand biofilm differences, we compared protein abundances that were statistically enriched in both biofilm states. Floccular biofilms were enriched with pathogenic secretion systems suggesting a highly competitive microbial community. Comparatively, granular biofilms revealed a high-stress environment with evidence of nutrient starvation, phage predation pressure, and increased extracellular polymeric substance and cell lysis. Granular biofilms were enriched in outer membrane transport proteins to scavenge the extracellular milieu for amino acids and other metabolites, likely released through cell lysis, to supplement metabolic pathways. This study provides the first detailed proteomic comparison between Accumuli-bacter-enriched floccular and granular biofilm communities, proposes a conceptual model for the granule biofilm, and offers novel insights into granule biofilm formation and stability.

Coherent Model of L-Band Radar Scattering by Soybean Plants: Model Development, Evaluation, and Retrieval	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Analytical method; coherent model; data-cube; mutual exclusion; soil moisture retrieval; soybean	SOIL-MOISTURE RETRIEVAL; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; VEGETATION; BACKSCATTERING; CANOPY; INVERSION; SURFACES; LAYER	An improved coherent branching model for L-band radar remote sensing of soybean is proposed by taking into account the correlated scattering among scatterers. The novel feature of the analytical coherent model consists of conditional probability functions to eliminate the overlapping effects of branches in the former branching models. Backscattering coefficients are considered for a variety of scenarios over the full growth cycle for vegetation water content (VWC) and the complete drydown conditions for soil moisture. The results of the coherent model show that HH scattering has a significant difference up to 3 dB from that of the independent scattering when VWC is low, e.g., 0.2 kg/m(2). Forward model calculations are performed for the scattering from the soybean field for the full range of three axes of root-mean-square (RMS) height of bare soil, VWC, and soil moisture using the coherent model. The soybean volume scattering including the double-bounce term is combined with the back scattering of bare soil from the numerical Maxwell solutions that incorporates RMS height, soil permittivity, and correlation length, to form the forward model lookup table for the vegetated soil. The results are compared with data from 13 soybean fields collected as part of the soil moisture active passive validation experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). Time-series retrieval of soil moisture is also applied to the soybean fields by inverting the forward model lookup table. During the retrieval, the VWC is optimized with physical constraints obtained from ground measurements. The retrieval performances are significantly improved using the proposed coherent model: the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the soil moisture retrieval is decreased from 0.09 to 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) and the correlation coefficient is increased from 0.66 to 0.92.

In this paper, we assess the use of TanDEM-X data, in combination with an external digital terrain model (DTM), tomap boreal canopy heights. A comparison of the TanDEM-X canopy height model (CHM) to a validated reference lidar CHMwas performed based on two definitions of canopy height: canopy surface height (CSH) and dominant height (DH) at spatial resolutions ranging from 5 to 25 m, and at stand level. We found the TanDEM-X CHM to have a coarser resolution than the corresponding lidar CHM. This was apparent in the height validation of the TanDEM-X CHM, which had a RMSE of 2.7 m at the 5-m resolution, 1.9 mat the 25-m resolution, and 1.5m at stand level. The height differences between the InSAR and lidar surfaces varied between 1.3 and 1.5 m, but InSAR heights were below the height of dominant trees by 4.6-7.5 m. Similar discrepancies were observed for the lidar CSH relatively to DH (6.04, 8.98, and 8.05 m, respectively). The results show that the TanDEM-X interferometric heights are very close to the lidar reference height and that penetration below the DH is caused by propagation of the microwave signal between the tree apices and the main foliage surface in boreal forest. Finally, the accuracy of InSAR height estimates was not sensitive to tree density effects, but was moderately affected by local incidence angles (LIAs), gap volume, and canopy height.

Spatio-temporal variability of snow water equivalent in the extra-tropical Andes Cordillera from distributed energy balance modeling and remotely sensed snow cover	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; AIR-TEMPERATURE; MODIS; PRECIPITATION; VALIDATION; RADIATION; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; REGIONS; CLIMATE	Seasonal snow cover is the primary water source for human use and ecosystems along the extratropical Andes Cordillera. Despite its importance, relatively little research has been devoted to understanding the properties, distribution and variability of this natural resource. This research provides high-resolution (500 m), daily distributed estimates of end-of-winter and spring snow water equivalent over a 152 000 km(2) domain that includes the mountainous reaches of central Chile and Argentina. Remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area and other relevant forcings are combined with extrapolated data from meteorological stations and a simplified physically based energy balance model in order to obtain melt-season melt fluxes that are then aggregated to estimate the end-of-winter (or peak) snow water equivalent (SWE). Peak SWE estimates show an overall coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.68 and RMSE of 274 mm compared to observations at 12 automatic snow water equivalent sensors distributed across the model domain, with R-2 values between 0.32 and 0.88. Regional estimates of peak SWE accumulation show differential patterns strongly modulated by elevation, latitude and position relative to the continental divide. The spatial distribution of peak SWE shows that the 4000-5000 a.s.l. elevation band is significant for snow accumulation, despite having a smaller surface area than the 3000-4000 a.s.l. band. On average, maximum snow accumulation is observed in early September in the western Andes, and in early October on the eastern side of the continental divide. The results presented here have the potential of informing applications such as seasonal forecast model assessment and improvement, regional climate model validation, as well as evaluation of observational networks and water resource infrastructure development.

Examination of Surface Temperature Modification by Open-Top Chambers along Moisture and Latitudinal Gradients in Arctic Alaska Using Thermal Infrared Photography	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						remote sensing; thermal imagery; open-top chamber; Arctic; Alaska	SUMMER TEMPERATURE; PLANT COMMUNITY; TUNDRA PLANTS; RESPONSES; TERM; MANIPULATION; FLUXES; SOILS; MODEL	Passive warming manipulation methodologies, such as open-top chambers (OTCs), are a meaningful approach for interpretation of impacts of climate change on the Arctic tundra biome. The magnitude of OTC warming has been studied extensively, revealing an average plot-level warming of air temperature that ranges between 1 and 3 degrees C as measured by shielded resistive sensors or thermocouples. Studies have also shown that the amount of OTC warming depends in part on location climate, vegetation, and soil properties. While digital infrared thermometers have been employed in a few comparisons, most of the focus of the effectiveness of OTC warming has been on air or soil temperature rather than tissue or surface temperatures, which directly translate to metabolism. Here we used thermal infrared (TIR) photography to quantify tissue and surface temperatures and their spatial variability at a previously unavailable resolution (3-6 mm(2)). We analyzed plots at three locations that are part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX)-Arctic Observing Network (AON-ITEX) network along both moisture and latitudinal gradients spanning from the High Arctic (Barrow, AK, USA) to the Low Arctic (Toolik Lake, AK, USA). Our results show a range of OTC surface warming from 2.65 to 1.27 degrees C (31%-10%) at our three sites. The magnitude of surface warming detected by TIR imagery in this study was comparable to increases in air temperatures previously reported for these sites. However, the thermal images revealed wide ranges of surface temperatures within the OTCs, with some surfaces well above ambient unevenly distributed within the plots under sunny conditions. We note that analyzing radiometric temperature may be an alternative for future studies that examine data acquired at the same time of day from sites that are in close geographic proximity to avoid the requirement of emissivity or atmospheric correction for validation of results. We foresee future studies using TIR photography to describe species-level thermodynamics that could prove highly valuable toward a better understanding of species-specific responses to climate change in the Arctic.

Recent theoretical work has shown that streams on chaotic orbits may abruptly fan out near their apparent ends; stars in these fans are dispersed in both position and velocity and may be difficult to associate with the stream. Here we present the first evidence of such stream-fanning in the Ophiuchus stream, traced by four blue horizontal branch stars beyond the apparent end of the stream. These stars stand out from the background by their high velocities (v(los) > 230 km s(-1)) against similar to 40 other stars: their velocities are comparable to those of the stream, but would be exceptional if they were unrelated halo stars. Their positions and velocities are, however, inconsistent with simple extrapolation of the observed cold, high-density portion of the stream. These observations suggest that stream-fanning may be a real, observable effect and, therefore, that Ophiuchus may be on a chaotic orbit. They also show that the Ophiuchus stream is more extended and hence dynamically older than previously thought, easing the stellar population versus dynamical age tension.

Sea urchins are the most studied clade within this phylum, and recent work suggests there has been dramatic rewiring at the top of the skeletogenic GRN along the lineage leading to extant members of the euechinoid sea urchins. Such rewiring likely accounts for some of the observed developmental differences between the two major subclasses of sea urchins-cidaroids and euechinoids. To address effects of topmost rewiring on downstream GRN events, we cloned four downstream regulatory genes within the skeletogenic GRN and surveyed their spatiotemporal expression patterns in the cidaroid Eucidaris tribuloides. We performed phylogenetic analyses with homologs from other non-vertebrate deuterostomes and characterized their spatiotemporal expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). Our data suggest the erg-hex-tgif subcircuit, a putative GRN kernel, exhibits a mesoderm-specific expression pattern early in Eucidaris development that is directly downstream of the initial mesodermal GRN circuitry. Comparative analysis of the expression of this subcircuit in four echinoderm taxa allowed robust ancestral state reconstruction, supporting hypotheses that its ancestral function was to stabilize the mesodermal regulatory state and that it has been co-opted and deployed as a unit in mesodermal subdomains in distantly diverged echinoderms. Importantly, our study supports the notion that GRN kernels exhibit structural and functional modularity, locking down and stabilizing clade-specific, embryonic regulatory states.

While codes over several metrics have been studied, such as the Kendall tau, Ulam, and Hamming distances, no recent research has been carried out for erasures and deletions over permutations. In rank modulation, flash memory cells represent a permutation, which is induced by their relative charge levels. We explore problems that arise when some of the cells are either erased or deleted. In each case, we study how these erasures and deletions affect the information carried by the remaining cells. In particular, we study models that are symbol-invariant, where unaffected elements do not change their corresponding values from those in the original permutation, or permutation-invariant, where the remaining symbols are modified to form a new permutation with fewer elements. Our main approach in tackling these problems is to build upon the existing works of error-correcting codes and leverage them in order to construct codes in each model of deletions and erasures. The codes we develop are in certain cases asymptotically optimal, while in other cases, such as for codes in the Ulam distance, improve upon the state of the art results.

Quantifying Marine Boundary Layer Water Vapor beneath Low Clouds with Near-Infrared and Microwave Imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Boundary layer; Microwave observations; Remote sensing; Satellite observations	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; MOIST CONVECTION; AMSR-E; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; HEIGHT; RETRIEVALS; INITIATION; SYSTEM	This study investigates the synergy of collocated microwave radiometry and near-infrared imagery to estimate the marine boundary layer water vapor beneath uniform cloud fields. Microwave radiometry provides the total column water vapor, while the near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor. In combining the two datasets, we apply several flags as well as proximity tests to remove pixels with high clouds and/or intrapixel heterogeneity. Comparisons against radiosonde and ECMWF reanalysis data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. Last, it is shown that the measured AMSR-MODIS boundary layer water vapor can be analyzed using sea surface temperature and cloud-top pressure information by employing simple equations based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.

Using the framework of nonlocal games, we relate measures of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics to certain norms in the Banach and operator space categories. We survey recent results that exploit this connection to derive large violations of Bell inequalities, study the complexity of the classical and quantum values of games and their relation to Grothendieck inequalities, and quantify the nonlocality of different classes of entangled states.

Label-free detection of single nanoparticles and biological molecules using microtoroid optical resonators	LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						biosensing; frequency locking; label-free; microtoroid; single molecule	SENSITIVITY; VIRUS; SHIFT	Single-molecule detection is one of the fundamental challenges of modern biology. Such experiments often use labels that can be expensive, difficult to produce, and for small analytes, might perturb the molecular events being studied. Analyte size plays an important role in determining detectability. Here we use laser-frequency locking in the context of sensing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of microtoroid optical resonators to the extent that single nanoparticles 2.5 nm in radius, and 15.5 kDa molecules are detected in aqueous solution, thereby bringing these detectors to the size limits needed for detecting the key macromolecules of the cell. Our results, covering several orders of magnitude of particle radius (100 nm to 2 nm), agree with the 'reactive' model prediction for the frequency shift of the resonator upon particle binding. This confirms that the main contribution of the frequency shift for the resonator upon particle binding is an increase in the effective path length due to part of the evanescent field coupling into the adsorbed particle. We anticipate that our results will enable many applications, including more sensitive medical diagnostics and fundamental studies of single receptor-ligand and protein-protein interactions in real time.

Here, we present a structure-guided enzyme engineering strategy for improving catalytic properties of NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes toward native or native-like reactions using mutations to the enzyme's adenine-binding pocket, distal to the site of catalysis. Screening single-site saturation mutagenesis libraries identified mutations that increased catalytic efficiency up to 10-fold in 7 out of 10 enzymes. The enzymes improved in this study represent three different cofactor-binding folds (Rossmann, DHQS-like, and FAD/NAD binding) and utilize both NADH and NADPH. Structural and biochemical analyses show that the improved activities are accompanied by minimal changes in other properties (cooperativity, thermostability, pH optimum, uncoupling), and initial tests on two enzymes (ScADH6 and EcFucO) show improved functionality in Escherichia coli.

The use of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) has emerged as a powerful proteomics technique in that regard since it avoids many of the problems typically observed in discovery-based analyses. A prerequisite for such a targeted approach is that the protein targets are known, either as a result of previous global proteomics experiments or because a specific hypothesis is to be tested. When guidelines that have been established in the pharmaceutical industry many decades ago are taken into account, setting up an MRM assay is relatively straightforward. Typically, proteotypic peptides with favorable mass spectrometric properties are synthesized with a heavy isotope for each protein that is to be monitored. Retention times and calibration curves are determined using triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers. The use of iRT peptide standards is both recommended and fully integrated into the bioinformatics pipeline. Digested biological samples are mixed with the heavy and iRT standards and quantified. Here we present a generic protocol for the development of an MRM assay.

These resonant optical interferometers will have unprecedented sensitivity to the strains caused by passing gravitational waves. The input optics play a significant part in allowing these devices to reach such sensitivities. Residing between the pre-stabilized laser and the main interferometer, the input optics subsystem is tasked with preparing the laser beam for interferometry at the sub-attometer level while operating at continuous wave input power levels ranging from 100 mW to 150 W. These extreme operating conditions required every major component to be custom designed. These designs draw heavily on the experience and understanding gained during the operation of Initial LIGO and Enhanced LIGO. In this article, we report on how the components of the input optics were designed to meet their stringent requirements and present measurements showing how well they have lived up to their design.

Polarization Control of Morphological Pattern Orientation During Light-Mediated Synthesis of Nanostructured Se-Te Films	ACS NANO			English	Article						electrodeposition; photoelectrochemistry; photodeposition; template-free; maskless; chalcogenide	HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; NANOWIRE ARRAYS; FABRICATION	The template-free growth of well ordered, highly anisotropic lamellar structures has been demonstrated during the photoelectrodeposition of Se-Te films, wherein the orientation of the pattern can be directed by orienting the linear polarization of the incident light. This control mechanism was investigated further herein by examining the morphologies of films grown photoelectrochemically using light from two simultaneous sources that had mutually different linear polarizations. Photoelectrochemical growth with light from two nonorthogonally polarized same wavelength sources generated lamellar morphologies in which the long axes of the lamellae were oriented parallel to the intensity-weighted average polarization orientation. Simulations of light scattering at the solution film interface were consistent with this observation. Computer modeling of these growths using combined full-wave electromagnetic and Monte Carlo growth simulations successfully reproduced the experimental morphologies and quantitatively agreed with the pattern orientations observed experimentally by considering only the fundamental light-material interactions during growth. Deposition with light from two orthogonally polarized same-wavelength as well as different-wavelength sources, produced structures that consisted of two intersecting sets of orthogonally oriented lamellae in which the relative heights of the two sets could be varied by adjusting the relative source intensities. Simulations of light absorption were performed in analogous, idealized intersecting lamellar structures and revealed that the lamellae preferentially absorbed light polarized with the electric field vector along their long axes. These data sets cumulatively indicate that anisotropic light scattering and light absorption generated by the light polarization produces the anisotropic morphology and that the resultant morphology is a function of all illumination inputs despite differing polarizations.

Proteins 2013, 81, 1304-1317] are used here to predict the binding sites for known CB1-selective inverse agonists including rimonabant and its seven known derivatives. This binding pocket, which differs significantly from previously published models, is used to identify 16 novel compounds expected to be CB1 inverse agonists by exploiting potential new interactions. We show experimentally that two of these compounds exhibit inverse agonist properties including inhibition of basal and agonist-induced G-protein coupling activity, as well as an enhanced level of CB1 cell surface localization. This demonstrates the utility of using the predicted binding sites for an ensemble of CB1 receptor structures for designing new CM inverse agonists.

In order to predict the properties of these systems, we used quantum mechanics (PBE flavor of density functional theory) to predict the most stable conformations of MTO and MTO3N and their optimum packing into the most stable crystal structures. We found that MTO has the P2(1) space-group with a density of rho = 1.92 g cm(3) while MTO3N has the P21/c space-group with a density of rho = 2.10 g cm(-3). The heats of reaction (DHrxn) were computed to be 1036 kcal kg(-1) for MTO, 1412 kcal kg(-1) for MTO3N, and 1653 kcal kg(-1) for a mixture of them. These properties are comparable to those of such other useful energetic materials as RDX (rho = 1.80 g cm(-3), Delta H-rxn - 1266 kcal kg(-1)), HMX, and PETN, making MTO and MTO3N excellent candidates for environmentally friendly HEDMs. In addition, we predicted the stability of -NH2, -NO, and -NO2 groups in water solution. We also show that the ReaxFF-lg reactive FF leads to an accurate description of the structural properties of MTO and MTO3N crystals making it practical to carry out large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations practical for these systems to determine the sensitivity and performance (CJ point calculation and velocity) under shear, shock, and thermal loads.

Quantifying the origin of metallic glass formation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SUPERCOOLED LIQUID; COOLING RATE; NUCLEATION; ALLOYS; TEMPERATURE; TRANSITION; LANDSCAPE; VISCOSITY; RHEOLOGY	The waiting time to form a crystal in a unit volume of homogeneous undercooled liquid exhibits a pronounced minimum tau(star)(X) at a 'nose temperature' T-star located between the glass transition temperature T-g, and the crystal melting temperature, T-L. Turnbull argued that tau X-star should increase rapidly with the dimensionless ratio t(rg) = T-g/T-L. Angell introduced a dimensionless 'fragility parameter', m, to characterize the fall of atomic mobility with temperature above Tg. Both t(rg) and m are widely thought to play a significant role in determining tau(star)(X). Here we survey and assess reported data for T-L, T-g, t(rg), m and tau X star for a broad range of metallic glasses with widely varying tau(X)star. By analysing this database, we derive a simple empirical expression for tau(star)(X)(t(rg), m) that depends exponentially on t(rg) and m, and two fitting parameters. A statistical analysis shows that knowledge of t(rg) and m alone is therefore sufficient to predict tau(star)(X) within estimated experimental errors. Surprisingly, the liquid/crystal interfacial free energy does not appear in this expression for tau(star)(X).	[Johnson, W. L.; Demetriou, M.

Unexpected seasonality in quantity and composition of Amazon rainforest air reactivity	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; TOTAL OH REACTIVITY; ATMOSPHERIC OXIDATION; MONOTERPENE FLUXES; BOREAL FOREST; TRACE GASES; ISOPRENE; EMISSION; PHOTOOXIDATION; CAPACITY	The hydroxyl radical (OH) removes most atmospheric pollutants from air. The loss frequency of OH radicals due to the combined effect of all gas-phase OH reactive species is a measureable quantity termed total OH reactivity. Here we present total OH reactivity observations in pristine Amazon rainforest air, as a function of season, time-of-day and height (0-80 m). Total OH reactivity is low during wet (10 s(-1)) and high during dry season (62 s(-1)). Comparison to individually measured trace gases reveals strong variation in unaccounted for OH reactivity, from 5 to 15% missing in wet-season afternoons to mostly unknown (average 79%) during dry season. During dry-season afternoons isoprene, considered the dominant reagent with OH in rainforests, only accounts for similar to 20% of the total OH reactivity. Vertical profiles of OH reactivity are shaped by biogenic emissions, photochemistry and turbulent mixing. The rainforest floor was identified as a significant but poorly characterized source of OH reactivity.	[Noelscher, A. C.; Yanez-Serrano, A.

The Shine-Dalgarno sequence of riboswitch-regulated single mRNAs shows ligand-dependent accessibility bursts	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; MOLECULE; INITIATION; APTAMER; TRANSLATION; QUEUOSINE; DYNAMICS; KINETICS; BINDING; NOISE	In response to intracellular signals in Gram-negative bacteria, translational riboswitches-commonly embedded in messenger RNAs (mRNAs)-regulate gene expression through inhibition of translation initiation. It is generally thought that this regulation originates from occlusion of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence upon ligand binding; however, little direct evidence exists. Here we develop Single Molecule Kinetic Analysis of RNATransient Structure (SiM-KARTS) to investigate the ligand-dependent accessibility of the SD sequence of an mRNA hosting the 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1)-sensing riboswitch. Spike train analysis reveals that individual mRNA molecules alternate between two conformational states, distinguished by ` bursts' of probe binding associated with increased SD sequence accessibility. Addition of preQ1 decreases the lifetime of the SD's high-accessibility (bursting) state and prolongs the time between bursts. In addition, ligand-jump experiments reveal imperfect riboswitching of single mRNA molecules. Such complex ligand sensing by individual mRNA molecules rationalizes the nuanced ligand response observed during bulk mRNA translation.

But tracking these cell divisions requires multiple images to be taken of the same specimen over time which means the specimen must stay alive throughout the process.

J	Grazier, KR				Grazier, Kevin R.			Jupiter: Cosmic Jekyll and Hyde	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article							OUTER SOLAR-SYSTEM; OORT CLOUD; DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION; MASS EXTINCTION; FRIEND; ORIGIN; BODIES; COMETS; END; PLANETESIMALS	It has been widely reported that Jupiter has a profound role in shielding the terrestrial planets from comet impacts in the Solar System, and that a jovian planet is a requirement for the evolution of life on Earth. To evaluate whether jovians, in fact, shield habitable planets from impacts (a phenomenon often referred to as the Jupiter as shield concept), this study simulated the evolution of 10,000 particles in each of the jovian inter-planet gaps for the cases of full-mass and embryo planets for up to 100 My. The results of these simulations predict a number of phenomena that not only discount the Jupiter as shield concept, they also predict that in a Solar System like ours, large gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter had a different, and potentially even more important, role in the evolution of life on our planet by delivering the volatile-laden material required for the formation of life. The simulations illustrate that, although all particles occupied non-life threatening orbits at their onset of the simulations, a significant fraction of the 30,000 particles evolved into Earth-crossing orbits. A comparison of multiple runs with different planetary configurations revealed that Jupiter was responsible for the vast majority of the encounters that kicked outer planet material into the terrestrial planet region, and that Saturn assisted in the process far more than has previously been acknowledged. Jupiter also tends to fix the aphelion of planetesimals at its orbit irrespective of their initial starting zones, which has the effect of slowing their passages through the inner Solar System, and thus potentially improving the odds of accretion of cometary material by terrestrial planets. As expected, the simulations indicate that the full-mass planets perturb many objects into the deep outer Solar System, or eject them entirely; however, planetary embryos also did this with surprising efficiency. Finally, the simulations predict that Jupiter's capacity to shield or intercept Earth-bound comets originating in the outer Solar System is poor, and that the importance of jovian planets on the formation of life is not that they act as shields, but rather that they deliver life-enabling volatiles to the terrestrial planets.

On the Distribution of Indefinite Quadratic Forms in Gaussian Random Variables	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wireless communications; correlated Gaussian random vectors; multi-user diversity; weighted norms of Gaussian variables	NORMALIZED LMS ALGORITHM; SADDLEPOINT APPROXIMATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DEFINITE; DIFFERENCE; CAPACITY; CHANNELS; BEHAVIOR; SUM	In this work, we propose a unified approach to evaluating the CDF and PDF of indefinite quadratic forms in Gaussian random variables. Such a quantity appears in many applications in communications, signal processing, information theory, and adaptive filtering. For example, this quantity appears in the mean-square-error (MSE) analysis of the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) adaptive algorithm, and SINR associated with each beam in beam forming applications. The trick of the proposed approach is to replace inequalities that appear in the CDF calculation with unit step functions and to use complex integral representation of the the unit step function. Complex integration allows us then to evaluate the CDF in closed form for the zero mean case and as a single dimensional integral for the non-zero mean case. Utilizing the saddle point technique allows us to closely approximate such integrals in non zero mean case. We demonstrate how our approach can be extended to other scenarios such as the joint distribution of quadratic forms and ratios of such forms, and to characterize quadratic forms in isotropic distributed random variables. We also evaluate the outage probability in multiuser beamforming using our approach to provide an application of indefinite forms in communications.

Characterizing the Hadley Circulation Response through Regional Climate Feedbacks	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Geographic location; entity; Intertropical convergence zone; Circulation; Dynamics; Energy transport; Feedback; Hadley circulation; Mass fluxes; transport; Physical Meteorology and Climatology; Anthropogenic effects	OCEAN; SENSITIVITY; CLOUDS; AMPLIFICATION; POSITION; CYCLE; CO2	The robust weakening of the tropical atmospheric circulation in projections of anthropogenic warming is associated with substantial changes in regional and global climate. The present study focuses on understanding the response of the annual-mean Hadley circulation from a perspective of interactions between climate feedbacks and tropical circulation. Simulations from an ensemble of coupled ocean-atmosphere models are used to quantify changes in Hadley cell strength in terms of feedbacks, radiative forcing, ocean heat uptake, atmospheric eddies, and gross moist stability. Climate feedbacks are calculated for the model integrations from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5) using radiative kernels. Tropical mean circulation is found to be reduced by up to 2.6% K-1 for an abrupt quadrupling of carbon dioxide concentration. The weakening is characterized by an increase in gross moist stability, by an increase in eddy heat flux, and by positive extratropical feedbacks, such as those associated with lapse rate and sea ice response. Understanding the impact of radiative feedbacks on the large-scale circulation provides a framework for constraining uncertainty in the dynamic climate response, including the hydrological cycle.

Increasing Daily Precipitation Intensity Associated with Warmer Air Temperatures over Northern Eurasia	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Geographic location; entity; Arctic; Physical Meteorology and Climatology; Climate change; Mixed precipitation; Variability; Arctic Oscillation; Climate variability; Interdecadal variability	ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; STORM TRACKS; CLIMATE; FREQUENCY; TRENDS; ENSEMBLE; MODEL	This study uses 45 years of observational records from 517 historical surface weather stations over northern Eurasia to examine changing precipitation characteristics associated with increasing air temperatures. Results suggest that warming air temperatures over northern Eurasia have been accompanied by higher precipitation intensity but lower frequency and little change in annual precipitation total. An increase in daily precipitation intensity of around 1%-3% per each degree of air temperature increase is found for all seasons as long as a station's seasonal mean air temperature is below about 15 degrees-16 degrees C. This threshold temperature may be location dependent. At temperatures above this threshold, precipitation intensity switches to decreasing with increasing air temperature, possibly related to decreasing water vapor associated with extreme high temperatures. Furthermore, the major atmospheric circulation of the Arctic Oscillation, Scandinavian pattern, east Atlantic-western Eurasian pattern, and polar-Eurasian pattern also have significant influences on precipitation intensity in winter, spring, and summer over certain areas of northern Eurasia.

Microtopography has shown promise in the regulation of myofibroblast differentiation, a key driver of fibrotic encapsulation. However, existing studies have not systematically isolated the requisite geometric parameters for suppression of myofibroblast differentiation via microtopography, and there has not been in vivo validation of this technology to date. To address these issues, a novel lamination method was developed to afford more control over topography dimensions. Specifically, in this study we focus on fiber length and its effect on myofibroblast differentiation. Fibroblasts cultured on films with microfibers exceeding 16m in length lost the characteristic morphology associated with myofibroblast differentiation, while shorter microfibers of 6m length failed to produce this phenotype. This increase in length corresponded to a 50% decrease in fiber stiffness, which acts as a mechanical cue to influence myofibroblast differentiation. Longer microfiber films suppressed expression of myofibroblast-specific genes (SMA, Col12, and Col31) and TGF signaling components (TGF1, TR2, and Smad3). About 16m long microfiber films subcutaneously implanted in a mouse wound-healing model generated a substantially thinner fibrotic capsule and less deposition of collagen in the wound bed. Together, these results identify a critical feature length threshold for microscale topography-mediated repression of fibrotic encapsulation. This study also demonstrates a simple and powerful strategy to improve surface biocompatibility and reduce fibrotic encapsulation around implanted materials.

THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF DUSTY YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						infrared: stars; ISM: individual objects (Orion A, Orion B); stars: formation; stars: protostars; stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be	FIELD EXTINCTION MAPS; X-RAY-EMISSION; LOW-MASS STARS; CIRCUMSTELLAR DISKS; NEBULA CLUSTER; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE; LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS; SURFACE-DENSITY; UPPER SCORPIUS	We analyze the spatial distribution of dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) identified in the Spitzer Survey of the Orion Molecular clouds, augmenting these data with Chandra X-ray observations to correct for incompleteness in dense clustered regions. We also devise a scheme to correct for spatially varying incompleteness when X-ray data are not available. The local surface densities of the YSOs range from 1 pc(-2) to over 10,000 pc(-2), with protostars tending to be in higher density regions. This range of densities is similar to other surveyed molecular clouds with clusters, but broader than clouds without clusters. By identifying clusters and groups as continuous regions with surface densities >= 10 pc(-2), we find that 59% of the YSOs are in the largest cluster, the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), while 13% of the YSOs are found in a distributed population. A lower fraction of protostars in the distributed population is evidence that it is somewhat older than the groups and clusters. An examination of the structural properties of the clusters and groups shows that the peak surface densities of the clusters increase approximately linearly with the number of members. Furthermore, all clusters with more than 70 members exhibit asymmetric and/or highly elongated structures. The ONC becomes azimuthally symmetric in the inner 0.1 pc, suggesting that the cluster is only similar to 2 Myr in age. We find that the star formation efficiency (SFE) of the Orion B cloud is unusually low, and that the SFEs of individual groups and clusters are an order of magnitude higher than those of the clouds. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the young low mass stars in the Orion clouds and the Orion OB 1 association, and we determine upper limits to the fraction of disks that may be affected by UV radiation from OB stars or dynamical interactions in dense, clustered regions.

K2 DISCOVERY OF YOUNG ECLIPSING BINARIES IN UPPER SCORPIUS: DIRECT MASS AND RADIUS DETERMINATIONS FOR THE LOWEST MASS STARS AND INITIAL CHARACTERIZATION OF AN ECLIPSING BROWN DWARF BINARY	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; binaries: spectroscopic; brown dwarfs; stars: fundamental parameters; stars: low-mass; stars: pre-main sequence	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; CENTAURUS OB ASSOCIATION; LIMB-DARKENING COEFFICIENTS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; STELLAR POPULATION; TIME-VARIATION; SPACED DATA; SPOTS-A; KEPLER; PHOTOMETRY	We report the discovery of three low-mass double-lined eclipsing binaries in the pre-main sequence Upper Scorpius association, revealed by K2 photometric monitoring of the region over similar to 78 days. The orbital periods of all three systems are <5 days. We use the K2 photometry plus multiple Keck/HIRES radial velocities (RVs) and spectroscopic flux ratios to determine fundamental stellar parameters for both the primary and secondary components of each system, along with the orbital parameters. We present tentative evidence that EPIC 203868608 is a hierarchical triple system comprised of an eclipsing pair of similar to 25 M-Jup brown dwarfs with a wide M-type companion. If confirmed, it would constitute only the second double-lined eclipsing brown dwarf binary system discovered to date. The double-lined system EPIC 203710387 is composed of nearly identical M4.5-M5 stars with fundamentally determined masses and radii measured to better than 3% precision (M-1= 0.1183 +/- 0.0028M(circle dot), M-2 = 0.1076 +/- 0.0031M(circle dot) and R-1= 0.417 +/- 0.010R(circle dot), R-2 = 0.450 +/- 0.012R(circle dot)) from combination of the light curve and RV time series. These stars have the lowest masses of any stellar mass double-lined eclipsing binary to date. Comparing our derived stellar parameters with evolutionary models, we suggest an age of similar to 10-11 Myr for this system, in contrast to the canonical age of 3-5 Myr for the association. Finally, EPIC 203476597 is a compact single-lined system with a G8-K0 primary and a likely mid-K secondary whose lines are revealed in spectral ratios. Continued measurement of RVs and spectroscopic flux ratios will better constrain fundamental parameters and should elevate the objects to benchmark status. We also present revised parameters for the double-lined eclipsing binary UScoCTIO 5 (M-1= 0.3336 +/- 0.0022M(circle dot), M-2 = 0.3200 +/- 0.0022M(circle dot) and R-1 = 0.862 +/- 0.012, R-2 = 0.852 +/- 0.013R(circle dot)), which are suggestive of a system age younger than previously reported. We discuss the implications of our results on these similar to 0.1-1.5 M stars for pre-main-sequence evolutionary models.

Millimeter-wavelength observations probe large grains that trace the location of planetesimal belts. The Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems Spitzer Legacy survey of nearby young solar analogues yielded a sample of five debris disk-hosting stars with millimeter flux suitable for interferometric follow-up. We present observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy at similar to 2 '' resolution that spatially resolve the debris disks around these nearby (d similar to 50 pc) stars. Two of the five disks (HD 377, HD 8907) are spatially resolved for the first time and one (HD 104860) is resolved at millimeter wavelengths for the first time. We combine our new observations with archival SMA and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array data to enable a uniform analysis of the full five-object sample. We simultaneously model the broadband photometric data and resolved millimeter visibilities to constrain the dust temperatures and disk morphologies, and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to fit for basic structural parameters. We find that the radii and widths of the cold outer belts exhibit properties consistent with scaled-up versions of the Solar System' s Kuiper Belt. All the disks exhibit characteristic grain sizes comparable to the blowout size, and all the resolved observations of emission from large dust grains are consistent with an axisymmetric dust distribution to within the uncertainties. These results are consistent with comparable studies carried out at infrared wavelengths.	[Steele, Amy; Hughes, A.

JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							CCGA	An analytical stress model is developed for the evaluation of thermal stresses in an inhomogeneously bonded assembly of the ball-grid-array (BGA) or column grid array (CGA) type. It is shown that one can get away with employing a simpler model intended for an assembly with a homogeneous bond, if the gaps between the supports (BGA balls or CGA columns) are small, so that the ratio of the pitch p (the distance between the joint centers) to the joint widths 2l is below 5, and the product kl of the parameter k of the interfacial shearing stress and half the assembly length l in the equivalent homogeneously bonded assembly is above 2.5. This is indeed the case for actual BGA and CGA systems. This finding can be used also in other areas of engineering, such as, say, mechanical or structural, when there is an intent to simplify the calculations by replacing a model for beams on separate supports by using a model intended for a beam on a continuous elastic foundation.

We extend these to include ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are second-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a divergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains. del . B approximate to 0. We implement these in the code GIZMO, together with state-of-the-art SPH MHD. We consider a large test suite, and show that on all problems the new methods are competitive with AMR using constrained transport (CT) to ensure. del . B = 0. They correctly capture the growth/structure of the magnetorotational instability, MHD turbulence, and launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than state-of-the-art AMR. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit convergence at fixed neighbour number, sharp shock-capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, divergence errors, and diffusion. Still, 'modern' SPH can handle most test problems, at the cost of larger kernels and 'by hand' adjustment of artificial diffusion. Compared to non-moving meshes, the new methods exhibit enhanced 'grid noise' but reduced advection errors and diffusion, easily include self-gravity, and feature velocity-independent errors and superior angular momentum conservation. They converge more slowly on some problems (smooth, slow-moving flows), but more rapidly on others (involving advection/rotation). In all cases, we show divergence control beyond the Powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or all methods can converge to unphysical answers even at high resolution.

A simple phenomenological model for grain clustering in turbulence	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; hydrodynamics; instabilities; turbulence; planets and satellites: formation; protoplanetary discs	FULLY-DEVELOPED TURBULENCE; LOG-POISSON STATISTICS; MACH NUMBER RELATION; INDUCED RELATIVE VELOCITY; PLANETESIMAL FORMATION; PREFERENTIAL CONCENTRATION; ISOTHERMAL TURBULENCE; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; INERTIAL PARTICLES; HEAVY-PARTICLES	We propose a simple model for density fluctuations of aerodynamic grains, embedded in a turbulent, gravitating gas disc. The model combines a calculation for the behaviour of a group of grains encountering a single turbulent eddy, with a hierarchical approximation of the eddy statistics. This makes analytic predictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain densities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum grain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag time t(s), spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio (rho) over tilde, strength of turbulence alpha, and detailed disc properties. We test these against numerical simulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree well with the predictions, spanning t(s) Omega similar to 10(-4)-10, (rho) over tilde similar to 0-3, alpha similar to 10(-10)-10(-2). Results from 'turbulent concentration' simulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case. Vortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains hierarchically. For small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover time comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by local gas-grain drift. For large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broader range of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largest scales. The grain density distribution has a log-Poisson shape, with fluctuations for large grains up to factors greater than or similar to 1000. We provide simple analytic expressions for the predictions, and discuss implications for planetesimal formation, grain growth, and the structure of turbulence.

The experimental measurements reveal that the magnitude of the stress-induced magnetization change is dependent upon bias magnetic field.

Enhanced Productivity of a Supported Olefin Trimerization Catalyst	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						selective olefin trimerization; supported catalysis; heterogeneous catalysis; catalyst decomposition; titanium	SELECTIVE ETHYLENE TRIMERIZATION; ALPHA-OLEFINS; METAL-CATALYSTS; REGIOSELECTIVE OLIGOMERIZATION; TITANIUM CATALYSTS; CHROMIUM; 1-HEXENE; DIMERIZATION; COMPLEXES; ZIRCONIUM	Treatment of dry silica with methylaluminoxane (MAO) followed by (FI)TiCl3 (FI = (N-(S-methyl-3-(1-adamantypsalicylidene)-2'-(2 ''-methoxyphenyl)anilinato) gives a heterogeneous supported ethylene trimerization catalyst, s(FI)Ti, which exhibits productivity more than an order of magnitude higher than its homogeneous analogues. This increase in productivity is attributed to a decreased rate of catalyst decomposition, a process that is proposed to occur via comproportionation to an inactive Ti-III species; immobilization retards this process. In addition, s(FI)Ti catalyzes trimerization of alpha-olefins with high selectivity. Based on regioisomer distributions, catalysis by s(FI)Ti involves the same active species as the previously reported homogeneous systems (FI)TiR2Me/B(C6F5)(3) (R = Me, CH2SiMe3, CH2CMe3).

J	Barsi, JC; Davidson, EH				Barsi, Julius C.; Davidson, Eric H.			cis-Regulatory control of the initial neurogenic pattern of onecut gene expression in the sea urchin embryo	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						cis-Regulatory analysis; Sea urchin embryo; Recombineered BACs; Neurogenic specification	IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; SYSTEM	Specification of the ciliated band (CB) of echinoid embryos executes three spatial functions essential for postgastrular organization. These are establishment of a band about 5 cells wide which delimits and bounds other embryonic territories; definition of a neurogenic domain within this band; and generation within it of arrays of ciliary cells that bear the special long cilia from which the structure derives its name. In Strongylocentrotus purpuratus the spatial coordinates of the future ciliated band are initially and exactly determined by the disposition of a ring of cells that transcriptionally activate the onecut homeodomain regulatory gene, beginning in blastula stage, long before the appearance of the CB per se. Thus the cis-regulatory apparatus that governs onecut expression in the blastula directly reveals the genomic sequence code by which these aspects of the spatial organization of the embryo are initially determined. We screened the entire onecut locus and its flanking region for transcriptionally active cis-regulatory elements, and by means of BAC recombineered deletions identified three separated and required cis-regulatory modules that execute different functions. The operating logic of the crucial spatial control module accounting for the spectacularly precise and beautiful early onecut expression domain depends on spatial repression. Previously predicted oral ectoderm and aboral ectoderm repressors were identified by cis-regulatory mutation as the products of goosecoid and irxa genes respectively, while the pan-ectodermal activator SoxB1 supplies a transcriptional driver function.

The experimental setup, equipped with temperature diagnostics and schlieren imaging, utilizes a glow plug to initiate ignition in a flammable mixture. The hot-surface temperature at the point of ignition is measured for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.6 to 3 and chamber pressures varying from 25 to 100 kPa. The hot-surface temperature resulting in ignition is found to be weakly sensitive to equivalence ratio with a mean value of 980 K for mixtures with equivalence ratios between 0.75 and 3 at 100 kPa. Chamber pressure has a stronger influence with ignition temperature increasing to about 1140 K at 25 kPa. The experimental trends were reproduced in numerical simulations utilizing detailed chemistry of n-heptane as a surrogate for n-hexane given their similar ignition and flame propagation characteristics. The simulations further predict a two-stage ignition process resulting from an initial breakdown of the fuel with a small increase in temperature followed by a main ignition event accompanied by fuel depletion. Reaction rate analysis of the sequence of events leading to ignition conducted using a reduced order kinetic model suggests that the second-stage ignition event is caused primarily by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which occurs at temperatures above 900 K. The two-stage ignition process observed here is significantly different from that observed in previous studies due to the presence of convective and diffusive processes as well as the continuous increase in hot-surface temperature. These arguments are used to explain the insensitivity of ignition temperature to equivalence ratio, its decrease with increasing chamber pressure, and the location of the ignition kernel observed in experiments and simulations.

A decade (2003-12) of landfalling ARs impacting the North American west coast (between 32.5 degrees and 52.5 degrees N) is collected to assess the skill of five commonly used satellite-based precipitation products [T3B42, T3B42 real-time (T3B42RT), CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), PERSIANN, and PERSIANN-Cloud Classification System (CCS)] in capturing ARs' precipitation rate and pattern. AR detection was carried out using a database containing twice-daily satellite-based integrated water vapor composite observations. It was found that satellite products are more consistent over ocean than land and often significantly underestimate precipitation rate over land compared to ground observations. Incorrect detection of precipitation from IR-based methods is prevalent over snow and ice surfaces where microwave estimates often show underestimation or missing data. Bias adjustment using ground observation is found very effective to improve satellite products, but it also raises concern regarding near-real-time applicability of satellite products for ARs. The analysis using individual case studies (6-8 January and 13-14 October 2009) and an ensemble of AR events suggests that further advancement in capturing orographic precipitation and precipitation over cold and frozen surfaces is needed to more reliably quantify AR precipitation from space.

The potential for supershear earthquakes in damaged fault zones - theory and observations	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						earthquake rupture; supershear; damaged fault zone	2002 DENALI FAULT; LOW-VELOCITY ZONE; RUPTURE PROCESS; STRONG-MOTION; GROUND MOTION; TURKEY; DUZCE; KUNLUNSHAN; CALIFORNIA; ALASKA	The potential for strong ground shaking in large earthquakes partly depends on how fast the earthquake rupture propagates. It is observed that strike-slip earthquakes usually propagate at speeds slower than the Rayleigh wave speed (ye) but occasionally jump to speeds faster than the S wave speed (nu(s)), or supershear speeds. Supershear earthquakes can be more catastrophic and cause unusually large ground motions at long distances. Here we use both fully dynamic rupture simulations and high-resolution seismic observations to show that supershear earthquakes can be induced by damaged fault zones, the low-velocity layers of damaged rocks that typically exist around major faults and serve as waveguides for high-frequency energy. In contrast to supershear ruptures in homogeneous media, supershear ruptures in damaged fault zones can occur under relatively low fault stress and propagate stably at speeds within the range usually considered as unstable.

Low water contents in diamond mineral inclusions: Proto-genetic origin in a dry cratonic lithosphere	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						diamond inclusions; NAM water contents; protogenetic minerals in diamonds; cratonic lithosphere	UDACHNAYA KIMBERLITE; MANTLE XENOLITHS; SIBERIAN CRATON; OLIVINE; HYDROGEN; GARNET; DIFFUSION; OH; PERIDOTITES; HYDROXYL	The mantle is the major reservoir of Earth's water, hosted within Nominally Anhydrous Minerals (NAMs) (e.g., Bell and Rossman, 1992; Peslier et al., 2010; Peslier, 2010; Nestola and Smyth, 2015), in the form of hydrogen bonded to the silicate's structural oxygen. From whence cometh this water? Is the water in these minerals representative of the Earth's primitive upper mantle or did it come from melting events linked to crustal formation or to more recent metasomatic/re-fertilization events? During diamond formation, NAMs are encapsulated at hundreds of kilometers depth within the mantle, thereby possibly shielding and preserving their pristine water contents from re-equilibrating with fluids and melts percolating through the lithospheric mantle. Here we show that the NAMs included in diamonds from six locales on the Siberian Craton contain measurable and variable H2O concentrations from 2 to 34 parts per million by weight (ppmw) in olivine, 7 to 276 ppmw in clinopyroxene, and 11-17 ppmw in garnets. Our results suggest that if the inclusions were in equilibrium with the diamond-forming fluid, the water fugacity would have been unrealistically low. Instead, we consider the H2O contents of the inclusions, shielded by diamonds, as pristine representatives of the residual mantle prior to encapsulation, and indicative of a protogenetic origin for the inclusions. Hydrogen diffusion in the diamond does not appear to have modified these values significantly. The H2O contents of NAMs in mantle xenoliths may represent some later metasomatic event(s), and are not always representative of most of the continental lithospheric mantle. Results from the present study also support the conclusions of Peslier et al. (2010) and Novella et al. (2015) that the dry nature of the SCLM of a craton may provide stabilization of its thickened continental roots. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The largest recorded deep-focus earthquake (M-w 7.9) in the Izu-Bonin slab struck on 30 May 2015 beneath the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, isolated from prior seismicity by over 100 km in depth, and followed by only a few small aftershocks. Globally, this is the deepest (680 km centroid depth) event with Mw >= 7.8 in the seismological record. Seismicity indicates along-strike contortion of the Izu-Bonin slab, with horizontal flattening near a depth of 550 km in the Izu region and rapid steepening to near-vertical toward the south above the location of the 2015 event. This event was exceptionally well-recorded by seismic stations around the world, allowing detailed constraints to be placed on the source process. Analyses of a large global data set of P, SH and pP seismic phases using short-period back-projection, subevent directivity, and broadband finite-fault inversion indicate that the mainshock ruptured a shallowly-dipping fault plane with patchy slip that spread over a distance of similar to 40 km with a multi-stage expansion rate (similar to 5+ km/s down-dip initially, 3 km/s up-dip later). During the 17 s total rupture duration the radiated energy was similar to 3.3 x 10(16) J and the stress drop was similar to 38 MPa. The radiation efficiency is moderate (034), intermediate to that of the 1994 Bolivia and 2013 Sea of Okhotsk Mw 83 deep earthquakes, indicating that source processes of very large deep earthquakes sample a wide range of behavior from dissipative, more viscous failure to very brittle failure. The isolated occurrence of the event, much deeper than the apparently thermally-bounded distribution of Bonin-slab seismicity above 600 km depth, suggests that localized stress concentration associated with the pronounced deformation of the lzu-Bonin slab and proximity to the 660-km phase transition likely played a dominant role in generating this major earthquake.

JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; ATMOSPHERIC BRIDGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION; HYDROLOGY; SKILL; ENSO; BANGLADESH	This study asks the question of whether GCMs are ready to be operationalized for streamflow forecasting in South Asian river basins, and if so, at what temporal scales and for which water management decisions are they likely to be relevant? The authors focused on the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna basins for which there is a gridded hydrologic model calibrated for the 2002-10 period. The North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) suite of eight GCM hindcasts was applied to generate precipitation forecasts for each month of the 1982-2012 (30 year) period at up to 6 months of lead time, which were then downscaled according to the bias-corrected statistical downscaling (BCSD) procedure to daily time steps. A global retrospective forcing dataset was used for this downscaling procedure. The study clearly revealed that a regionally consistent forcing for BCSD, which is currently unavailable for the region, is one of the primary conditions to realize reasonable skill in streamflow forecasting. In terms of relative RMSE (normalized by reference flow obtained from the global retrospective forcings used in downscaling), streamflow forecast uncertainty (RMSE) was found to be 38%-50% at monthly scale and 22%-35% at seasonal (3 monthly) scale. The Ganges River (regulated) experienced higher uncertainty than the Brahmaputra River (unregulated). In terms of anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), the streamflow forecasting at seasonal (3 monthly) scale was found to have less uncertainty (>0.3) than at monthly scale (<0.25). The forecast skill in the Brahmaputra basin showed more improvement when the time horizon was aggregated from monthly to seasonal than the Ganges basin. Finally, the skill assessment for the individual seasons revealed that the flow forecasting using NMME data had less uncertainty during monsoon season (July-September) in the Brahmaputra basin and in postmonsoon season (October-December) in the Ganges basin. Overall, the study indicated that GCMs can have value for management decisions only at seasonal or annual water balance applications at best if appropriate historical forcings are used in downscaling. The take-home message of this study is that GCMs are not yet ready for prime-time operationalization for a wide variety of multiscale water management decisions for the Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins.

Here, we further characterize a newly reported interaction between a human oral obligate parasitic bacterium TM7x (cultivated member of Candidatus Saccharimonas formerly Candidate Phylum TM7), and its basibiont Actinomyces odontolyticus species (XH001), providing a model system to study epiparasitic symbiosis in the domain Bacteria. Detailed microscopic studies indicate that both partners display extensive morphological changes during symbiotic growth. XH001 cells manifested as short rods in monoculture, but displayed elongated and hyphal morphology when physically associated with TM7x. Interestingly, these dramatic morphological changes in XH001 were also induced in oxygen-depleted conditions, even in the absence of TM7x. Targeted quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that both the physical association with TM7x as well as oxygen depletion triggered up-regulation of key stress response genes in XH001, and in combination, these conditions act in an additive manner. TM7x and XH001 co-exist with relatively uniform cell morphologies under nutrient-replete conditions. However, upon nutrient depletion, TM7x-associated XH001 displayed a variety of cell morphologies, including swollen cell body, clubbed-ends, and even cell lysis, and a large portion of TM7x cells transformed from ultrasmall cocci into elongated cells. Our study demonstrates a highly dynamic interaction between epibiont TM7x and its basibiont XH001 in response to physical association or environmental cues such as oxygen level and nutritional status, as reflected by their morphological and physiological changes during symbiotic growth.

Signal decomposition and analysis via extraction of frequencies	APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS			English	Article						Blind source signal separation; Signal separation operator; Adaptive harmonic model; Instantaneous frequency; Time series analysis	INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION	Time-frequency analysis is central to signal processing, with standard adaptation to higher dimensions for imaging applications, and beyond. However, although the theory, methods, and algorithms for stationary signals are well developed, mathematical analysis of non-stationary signals is almost nonexistent. For a real-valued signal defined on the time-domain R, a classical approach to compute its instantaneous frequency (IF) is to consider the amplitude frequency modulated (AM-FM) formulation of its complex (or analytic) signal extension, via the Hilbert transform. In a popular paper by Huang et al., the so-called empirical mode decomposition (EMD) scheme is introduced to separate such a signal as a sum of finitely many intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), with a slowly oscillating signal as the remainder, so that more than one IFs of the given signal can be computed by extending each IMF to an AM-FM signal component. Based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the notion of synchrosqueezing transform (SST), introduced by Daubechies and Maes in 1996, and further developed by Daubechies, Lu, and Wu (DLW) in a 2011 paper, provides another approach to extract more than one IFs of the signal on R. Furthermore, by introducing a list of fairly restrictive conditions on the adaptive harmonic model (AHM), the DLW paper also derives a theory for estimating the signal components according to this model, by using the IFs with estimates from the SST. The objective of our present paper is to introduce another mathematical theory, along with rigorous methods and computational schemes, to achieve a more ambitious goal than the SST approach, first to extract the polynomial-like trend from the source signal, then to compute the exact number of signal components according to a less restrictive AHM model, then to obtain better estimates of the IFs and instantaneous amplitudes (IAs) of the signal components, and finally to separate the signal components from the (blind) source signal. Furthermore, our computational scheme can be realized in near-real-time, and our mathematical theory has direct extension to the multivariate setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An Engineering Application of Earthquake Early Warning: ePAD-Based Decision Framework for Elevator Control	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Performance-based earthquake engineering; Elevator control; Surrogate model; Earthquake early warning; Decision-making; Safety and reliability	GROUND-MOTION; HORIZONTAL COMPONENT; PREDICTION; PERIODS; PGV	In a medium-to-large earthquake, there are often reports of people being trapped or injured in elevators. This study investigates using an earthquake early warning (EEW) system, which provides seconds to tens of seconds warning before seismic waves arrive at a site, to help people escape from the elevators before a strong shaking arrives. However, such an application remains as a major engineering challenge due to the uncertainty of the EEW information and the short lead time available. A recent study presented an earthquake probability-based automated decision-making (ePAD) framework to address these issues. This paper focuses on studying the influence of two commonly ignored factors, uncertainty of warning and lead time, on the decision of stopping the elevators and opening the doors when an EEW message is received. Application of the ePAD framework requires using the performance-based earthquake engineering methodology for elevator damage prediction, making decision based on a cost-benefit model and reducing computational time with a surrogate model. The authors' results show that ePAD can provide rational decisions for elevator control based on EEW information under different amounts of lead time and uncertainty level of the warning.

Compact and broadband polarization beam splitter based on a silicon nitride augmented low-index guiding structure	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							BENT DIRECTIONAL COUPLER; INSULATOR WAVE-GUIDES; ULTRA-SHORT	We propose a compact polarization beam splitter (PBS) based on a silicon nitride enhanced silicon-on-insulator platform using an augmented low-index guiding (ALIG) waveguide structure. In the ALIG structure, the TM mode is mostly confined in the low-index silicon nitride, while the TE mode is confined in the high-index silicon. Since the two modes are confined in two separate layers, their properties can be controlled independently. The PBS is formed using an asymmetric multimode interference (MMI) section. The TM mode is directed to an output port by the ALIG waveguide, while the TE mode is coupled to the other output port via the multimode interferometer. Such a PBS has a very small footprint, low insertion loss, high polarization extinction ratio, and broadband response. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America	[Sun, X.; Aitchison, J.

One of the most promising sources for ground based GW detectors are binary neutron-star (BNS) coalescences. In order to use any detections for astrophysics, we must understand the capabilities of our parameter-estimation analysis. By simulating the GWs from an astrophysically motivated population of BNSs, we examine the accuracy of parameter inferences in the early advanced-detector era. We find that sky location, which is important for electromagnetic follow-up, can be determined rapidly ( similar to 5 s), but that sky areas may be hundreds of square degrees. The degeneracy between component mass and spin means there is significant uncertainty for measurements of the individual masses and spins; however, the chirp mass is well measured (typically better than 0.1%).

Energy spectra of He-3-rich solar energetic particles associated with coronal waves	15TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS CONFERENCE: "THE SCIENCE OF ED STONE: CELEBRATING HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY"	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Annual International Astrophysics Conference - The Science of Ed Stone - Celebrating his 80th Birthday	APR 04-08, 2016	Westin Cape Coral Resort, Cape Coral, FL		Westin Cape Coral Resort		ISOTOPE SPECTROMETER; EVENTS; FLARES; ACCELERATION; EARTH; CONNECTION; SPACECRAFT; STEREO; JETS; ACE	In addition to their anomalous abundances, 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) show puzzling energy spectral shapes varying from rounded forms to power laws where the later are characteristics of shock acceleration. Solar sources of these particles have been often associated with jets and narrow CMEs, which are the signatures of magnetic reconnection involving open field. Recent reports on new associations with large-scale EUV waves bring new insights on acceleration and transport of 3He-rich SEPs in the corona. We examined energy spectra for 32 3He-rich SEP events observed by ACE at Ll near solar minimum in 2007-2010 and compared the spectral shapes with solar flare signatures obtained from STEREO EUV images. We found the events with jets or brightenings tend to be associated with rounded spectra and the events with coronal waves with power laws. This suggests that coronal waves may be related to the unknown second stage mechanism commonly used to interpret spectral forms of 3He-rich SEPs.

Charge-to-mass dependence of heavy ion spectral breaks in large gradual solar energetic particle events	15TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS CONFERENCE: "THE SCIENCE OF ED STONE: CELEBRATING HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY"	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Annual International Astrophysics Conference - The Science of Ed Stone - Celebrating his 80th Birthday	APR 04-08, 2016	Westin Cape Coral Resort, Cape Coral, FL		Westin Cape Coral Resort		ADVANCED COMPOSITION EXPLORER; ISOTOPE SPECTROMETER; SHOCK ACCELERATION; SEED POPULATION; SPACECRAFT; PROTON; MODEL; ABUNDANCES; ELECTRON	We fit the,--,0.1-500 MeV/nucleon H-Fe spectra in 46 large SEP events surveyed by [1] with the double power-law Band function to obtain a normalization constant, low- and high-energy parameters-y and 7b; and break energy EB. We also calculate the low-energy power-law spectral slope y,. We find that: 1) 7, y,, and 7b are species-independent within a given SEP event, and the spectra steepen with increasing energy; 2) EB's are well ordered by Q/M ratio, and decrease systematically with decreasing Q/M, scaling as (Q/M)a with a varying between X0.2-3; 3) a is well correlated with Fe/O at X0.16-0.23 MeV/nucleon and CME speed; 4) In most events: a <1.4 and the spectra steepen significantly at higher energy with 7b-7 >3; and 5) Seven out of nine extreme SEP events (associated with faster CMEs and GLEs) are Fe-rich and have a >1.4 with flat spectra at low and high energies yielding 7b-7 <3. The species-independence of 7, y,, and 7b and the systematic Q/M dependence of EB within an event, as well as the range of values for a suggest that the formation of double power-laws in SEP events occurs primarily due to diffusive acceleration at near-Sun CME shocks and not due to scattering in the interplanetary turbulence. In most events, the Q/M-dependence of EB is consistent with the equal diffusion coefficient condition while the event-to-event variations in a are probably driven by differences in the near-shock wave intensity spectra, which are flatter than the Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum but still weaker compared to that inferred for the extreme events. The weaker turbulence allows SEPs to escape more easily, resulting in weaker Q/M-dependence of EB, (lower a values) and spectral steepening at higher energies. In extreme events, the flatter spectra at high- and low-energy and stronger Q/M-dependence of EB (larger a values) occur due to enhanced wave power, which also enables the faster CME shocks to accelerate flare suprathermals more efficiently than ambient coronal ions.

Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP)	15TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS CONFERENCE: "THE SCIENCE OF ED STONE: CELEBRATING HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY"	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Annual International Astrophysics Conference - The Science of Ed Stone - Celebrating his 80th Birthday	APR 04-08, 2016	Westin Cape Coral Resort, Cape Coral, FL		Westin Cape Coral Resort		MAGNETIC-FIELD; SOLAR-SYSTEM; BOUNDARY EXPLORER; NEUTRAL HELIUM; HE PARAMETERS; IBEX; FLOW; HELIOSPHERE; CLOUD; TEMPERATURE	Our piece of cosmic real estate, the heliosphere, is the domain of all human existence-- an astrophysical case history of the successful evolution of life in a habitable system. By exploring our global heliosphere and its myriad interactions, we develop key physical knowledge of the interstellar interactions that influence exoplanetary habitability as well as the distant history and destiny of our solar system and world. IBEX is the first mission to explore the global heliosphere and in concert with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 is discovering a fundamentally new and uncharted physical domain of the outer heliosphere. In parallel, Cassini/INCA maps the global heliosphere at energies (-5-55 keV) above those measured by IBEX. The enigmatic IBEX ribbon and the INCA belt were unanticipated discoveries demonstrating that much of what we know or think we understand about the outer heliosphere needs to be revised. This paper summarizes the next quantum leap enabled by IMAP that will open new windows on the frontier of Heliophysics at a time when the space environment is rapidly evolving. IMAP with 100 times the combined resolution and sensitivity of IBEX and INCA will discover the substructure of the IBEX ribbon and will reveal, with unprecedented resolution, global maps of our heliosphere. The remarkable synergy between IMAP, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will remain for at least the next decade as Voyager 1 pushes further into the interstellar domain and Voyager 2 moves through the heliosheath. Voyager 2 moves outward in the same region of sky covered by a portion of the IBEX ribbon. Voyager 2's plasma measurements will create singular opportunities for discovery in the context of IMAP's global measurements. IMAP, like ACE before, will be a keystone of the Heliophysics System Observatory by providing comprehensive measurements of interstellar neutral atoms and pickup ions, the solar wind distribution, composition, and magnetic field, as well as suprathermal ion, energetic particle, and cosmic ray distributions to diagnose the changing space environment and understand the fundamental origins of particle acceleration. This paper, the first citable reference for IMAP, is similar to an unpublished whitepaper that was presented to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine Committee for Solar and Space Physics. We provide the IMAP objectives and instrument straw man traced from the Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey. It is fitting that our paper is published in the volume of papers that celebrates the 80th birthday of Ed Stone.	[Schwadron, N. A.; Moebius, E.; Spence, H.

Graphene growth by molecular beam epitaxy on the commensurate substrate h-BN(0001) and on other weakly interacting substrates has previously been demonstrated. We have been able to use MBE to grow graphene on incommensurate Co3O4(111), which we find involves formation of a deformed interfacial C layer due to some C atoms forming covalent bonds to oxide O sites, followed by epitaxial graphene growth in subsequent layers. These results suggest that similar graphene growth may be achievable on other p-type spinel-structured oxides, opening the door to new electronic or spintronic applications.
