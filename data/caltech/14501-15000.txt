Martin			Ballistic limit equations for non-aluminum projectiles impacting dual-wall spacecraft systems	14TH HYPERVELOCITY IMPACT SYMPOSIUM (HVIS 2017)	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	14th Hypervelocity Impact Symposium (HVIS)	APR 24-28, 2017	Univ Kent, Canterbury Campus, Canterbury, ENGLAND		Univ Kent, Canterbury Campus	ballistic limit equation; non-aluminum projectiles; dual-wall structure; orbital debris; risk assessment		One of the primary design considerations of earth-orbiting spacecraft is the mitigation of the damage that might occur from an on-orbit MMOD impact. Traditional damage-resistant design consists of a 'bumper' that is placed a small distance away from a spacecraft component or from the wall of the element in which it is housed. The performance of such a multi-wall structural element is typically characterized by its ballistic limit equation (BLE), which defines the threshold particle size that results in a failure of the spacecraft element. BLEs are also key components of any micro-meteoroid/orbital debris (MMOD) risk assessment calculations. However, these assessments often call for BLEs to predict impact response for projectiles made of materials not used in the development of those BLEs. The question naturally arises regarding how close are the predictions of such BLEs when used in impact scenarios involving projectiles made of materials not necessarily considered in their development. In an effort to address this issue, a study was performed with the objective of assessing the validity of the NNO BLE for non-aluminum particles. Particle materials considered included steel, copper, and A1203 (i.e. particles that are made of materials that are more dense than aluminum). Comparisons are made between actual test results involving these non-aluminum projectiles and the predictions of the NNO BLE. In nearly all cases, the NNO BLE was found not to work very well in the predicting failure / no failure response of these non-aluminum projectiles. A new NNO-type BLE is then developed that can be used to more reliably predict the response of dual-wall systems under the hypervelocity impact of such "heavier" non-aluminum projectiles.

However, relatively few experiments have been conducted to determine the dependence of strength properties on gravity. In this work, we experimentally investigated three measures of strength (peak, confined flow, and unconfined flow friction angle) in Earth, Martian, Lunar, and near-zero gravity. The angles were captured in a passive Earth pressure experiment conducted on a reduced gravity flight. The results showed no dependence of the peak friction angle on gravity, a weak dependence of the confined flow friction angle on gravity, and no dependence of the unconfined flow friction angle on gravity. These results highlight the importance of understanding strength and deformation mechanisms of granular material at different levels of gravity.

To enable this computational infrastructure, we configured, for the first time, a LIGO Data Grid Tier-1 Center that can submit heterogeneous LIGO workflows using Open Science Grid facilities. In order to enable a seamless connection between the LIGO Data Grid and Blue Waters via Open Science Grid, we utilize Shifter to containerize LIGO's workflow software. This work represents the first time Open Science Grid, Shifter, and Blue Waters are unified to tackle a scientific problem and, in particular, it is the first time a framework of this nature is used in the context of large scale gravitational wave data analysis. This new framework has been used in the last several weeks of LIGO's second discovery campaign to run the most computationally demanding gravitational wave search workflows on Blue Waters, and accelerate discovery in the emergent field of gravitational wave astrophysics. We discuss the implications of this novel framework for a wider ecosystem of Higher Performance Computing users.	[Huerta, E.

We define and characterize three classes of errors - localization, scoring, and background - study how they are influenced by instance attributes and their impact on an algorithm's performance. Our technique is applied to compare the two leading methods for human pose estimation on the COCO Dataset, measure the sensitivity of pose estimation with respect to instance size, type and number of visible keypoints, clutter due to multiple instances, and the relative score of instances. The performance of algorithms, and the types of error they make, are highly dependent on all these variables, but mostly on the number of keypoints and the clutter. The analysis and software tools we propose offer a novel and insightful approach for understanding the behavior of pose estimation algorithms and an effective method for measuring their strengths and weaknesses.

Most of the current methods are trying to infer some statistical properties to describe and then regenerate a granular medium. These techniques, however, remain at the lower orders and cannot extract very complex information and, thus, they produce unrealistic models that are physically unlikely. The texture of the generated particles using these techniques are mostly different from the real sharpness of granular materials. In this paper, a new technique for direct modeling of granular materials (DGM) based on using high-order statistics is introduced that can extract more information and, finally generate very accurate models. This method, indeed, does not employ any particle descriptor and uses the existing 2D/3D images directly. The results indicate a very good agreement between the simulated and original data. The computational cost of this method is very low.

The study is motivated by an emerging trend within platforms to impose increasingly fine-grained control over the options available to platform participants. While early online platforms allowed open access, e.g., Ebay allows any seller to interact with any buyer; modern platforms often impose matches directly, e.g., Uber directly matches drivers to riders. This control is performed with the goal of achieving more efficient market outcomes. However, the results in this paper highlight that imposing matches may create new strategic incentives that lead to increased inefficiency. In particular, in the context of networked Cournot competition, we prove that open access platforms guarantee social welfare within 7/16 of the optimal; whereas controlled allocation platforms can have social welfare unboundedly worse than optimal.

Unsupervised Non-Intrusive Energy Disaggregation for Commercial Buildings	2017 ASHRAE ANNUAL CONFERENCE PAPERS	ASHRAE Annual Conference Papers		English	Proceedings Paper	ASHRAE Annual Conference	JUN 24-28, 2017	Long Beach, CA	ASHRAE				Commercial buildings alone are responsible for 36% of the total United States electricity consumption, and 30% of this electricity consumption is wasted on average. One of the greatest challenges in improving building energy efficiency lies in the ability to do simple and non-intrusive load disaggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised, non-intrusive building energy disaggregation technique using only 15-minute interval whole-building energy consumption and weather data. The proposed disaggregation technique consists of an analysis loop with three steps. Step 1 analyzes the change in energy consumption in 15-minute intervals for every 3 degrees C temperature range to identify statistically significant temperature dependent and independent the equipment turn on-off states. In step 2, a probabilistic approach is developed using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) that combines equipment state transition matrices from the equipment turn on-off states of step 1 and an emission matrix representing all possible combinations of equipment energy consumption in each state. In step 3, FHMM identifies the best possible combinations of the equipment state and consumption for every point in time using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Ultimately, specific equipment such as HVAC, plug load, and lighting, can be identified virtually without setting foot in the building. The proposed disaggregation technique is validated by comparing real-world, sub-metered building equipment energy consumption data to the whole building data. The results show that the method achieves at least 80% accuracy. Using the disaggregation technique to identify the breakdown of HVAC, lighting, and plug load, we compare the results from building population studies to identify potential areas of energy waste and generate an automated virtual energy audit report. The report provides personalized building recommendations such as improving HVAC operations, lighting, and equipment scheduling, including a measure of potential return-on-investment	[Hossain, Mohammad A.; Khalilnejad, Arash; Swanson, Rachel A.; Mousseau, Jack; Pickering, Ethan M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Pickering, Ethan M.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [French, Roger H.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Abramson, Alexis R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA	Hossain, MA (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.

While the pixel pitch of the detectors is approximate to 605 mu m, we can leverage the detector readout architecture to determine the interaction location of an individual photon to much higher spatial accuracy. The sub-pixel spatial location allows us to finely oversample the point spread function of the optics and reduces imaging artifacts due to pixelation. In this paper we demonstrate how the sub-pixel information is obtained, how the detectors were calibrated, and provide ground verification of the quantum efficiency of our Monte Carlo model of the detector response.

Thus, they pose a serious challenge in building a low cost large area detector. We are developing Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) to make all connections (both power and data) through ASICs, which will eliminate wirebonds and enable simple direct flip-chip bonding between the ASIC and a substrate electronics layer. TSVs also enable a more compact layout of the ASIC, which reduces the inactive area of the detector plane, and thus enables nearly gaplessly tilable detector arrays. We demonstrate the first successful TSV implementation on ASICs used for CZT detectors onboard the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission as part of our program to develop large area CZT imagers for wide field coded aperture imaging.

The waveguide consists of two dielectrics and a linear eigenvalue problem is obtained for the modal solution by using surface integral equations and broadband Green's functions of the reference waveguide. The modes are calculated and are independent of frequency. The broadband Green's functions of the inhomogeneous waveguide is next expressed as a summations of these modes. The convergence of modal summations is accelerated by low wavenumber extractions. The accuracy of the results are verified by comparison with results from direct method of moment (MoM) and HFSS.

It has been designed to be deployed and reconfigured easily for scientific applications. These applications include both geospace and astronomy experiments where a relatively small and sparse aperture is sufficient in size. Examples include the study of ionospheric turbulence using active and passive radar imaging, astronomical observations of galactic synchrotron emission, and localization of bright radio emissions such as those from the Sun and Jupiter. The high degree of mobility afforded by the system enables interferometric configurations that are tailored to specific experiments and can be changed in the field. RAPID can also be deployed to locations that are optimal for specific scientific objectives or that complement other existing facilities by adding baselines or serving as a separate imaging receiver array.

This approach allows in principle, to quickly analyze the performance of different near-field coupling mechanisms with arbitrary excitations. The aim is to efficiently excite a WGM into a nonlinear dielectric resonator in order to detect the weak mm-wave radiation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by up-converting the signal into the optical domain via the nonlinearity of the medium.

To simplify the proof-of-concept, we use a fixed transmitter device located above the ground, and a mobile receiver device located within a cave system, below the over-burden. By sensing and inverting the MQS field detected at the receiver, we were able to solve for positions of the mobile receiver device.

These recent works demonstrate the ability to determine the position of a mobile device in 2D space over ranges of up to many ten's of meters and in non-line-of-sight environment, due to use of MQS fields. One additional advantage of the recent theory and technique is that the solutions for range, azimuthal-direction, and orientation of the device are decoupled and can be solved in a low-latency environment.

The objective of this work is to study the benefits and challenges of including Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) capabilities into RRNs. In this context, an appealing RRN case study is presented and evaluated through simulations based on Delay/Disruption-tolerant Network (DTN) protocols and algorithms. Results show that even though the overall delivery metrics improve with ISLs, network congestion impedes a more efficient utilization of the communication resources.

Linear systems whose state vector evolves according to a Metzler matrix have many desirable properties in analysis and control with regard to scalability. This motivates the question, how close (in the Frobenius norm of coefficients) to the nearest Metzler matrix are we? Dropping the Metzler constraint, this problem has recently been studied using the theory of dissipative Hamiltonian (DH) systems, which provide a helpful characterization of the feasible set of stable matrices. This work uses the DH theory to provide a block coordinate descent algorithm consisting of a quadratic program with favourable structural properties and a semidefinite program for which recent diagonal dominance results can be used to improve tractability.

This paper seeks to provide a theoretical framework for how to design controllers that are decomposed across timescales in this way. The framework is analogous to how the network utility maximization framework uses optimization decomposition to distribute a global control problem across independent controllers, each of which solves a local problem; except our goal is to decompose a global problem temporally, extracting a timescale separation. Our results highlight that decomposition of a multi-timescale controller into a fast timescale, reactive controller and a slow timescale, predictive controller can be near-optimal in a strong sense. In particular, we exhibit such a design, named Multi-timescale Reflexive Predictive Control (MRPC), which maintains a pertimestep cost within a constant factor of the offline optimal in an adversarial setting.

In particular, we show that the controllability/observability of the system depends on two orthogonal conditions: 1) intrinsic structure of the system graph 2) algebraic coverage of buses with controllable loads/sensors. Condition 1) encodes information on graph symmetry and is shown to hold for almost all practical systems. Condition 2) captures how buses interact with each other through the network and can be verified using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. Based on this framework, the optimal placement of controllable loads and sensors in the network can be formulated as a set cover problem. We demonstrate how our results identify the critical buses in real systems by performing simulation in the IEEE 39-bus New England interconnection test system. We show that for this testbed, a single well chosen bus is capable of providing full controllability/observability.

The minimal rate required to stabilize such a system has been well studied. However, for a given fixed rate, how to quantize the states so as to optimize performance is an open question of great theoretical and practical significance. We concentrate on minimizing the control cost for first-order scalar systems. To that end, we use the Lloyd-Max algorithm and leverage properties of logarithmically-concave functions to construct the optimal quantizer that greedily minimizes the cost at every time instant. By connecting the globally optimal scheme to the problem of scalar successive refinement, we argue that its gain over the proposed greedy algorithm is negligible. This is significant since the globally optimal scheme is often computationally intractable. All the results are proven for the more general case of disturbances with logarithmically-concave distributions.

We consider two styles of platforms: open access platforms and discriminatory access platforms. In open access platforms, every firm can connect to every market, while discriminatory access platforms limit connections between firms and markets in order to improve social welfare. Our results provide tight bounds on the efficiency loss of both open access and discriminatory access platforms. For open access platforms, we show that the efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium is upper bounded by 3/2. In the case of discriminatory access platforms, we prove that, under an assumption on the linearity of cost functions, a greedy algorithm for optimizing network connections can guarantee the efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium is upper bounded by 4/3.

We further showed that such localized controllers enjoy O(1) synthesis and implementation complexity relative to the dimension of the global system, making them particularly well suited for the control of large-scale cyber-physical systems. However, the assumptions under which a system is localizable are stringent: roughly, a system is localizable if the controller has the necessary actuation, sensing and communication resources to "get out ahead" of the propagation of a disturbance and neutralize it, thus containing its effect to a localized spatiotemporal region. In this paper, we relax the assumption of exact localizability, and develop a controller synthesis methodology that is applicable to arbitrary systems that are in an appropriate sense "easy to control." We focus on the state-feedback setting and develop a simple necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability using the system level approach. We then leverage this condition, along with the introduction of virtual actuation, communication and system responses into the synthesis process, to design stabilizing controllers that have (i) O(1) synthesis and implementation complexity and (ii) guaranteed performance bounds. We end with a power-inspired example demonstrating the usefulness of these techniques, wherein we synthesize a near globally optimal controller for a system that is neither localizable nor quadratically invariant.

Here, we are interested in designing a synthetic control circuit that regulates the total cell population and the relative ratio between cell strains in a culture that contains two different cell strains. We have developed a dual feedback control strategy that uses two separate control loops to achieve the two control objectives respectively. We have implemented the strategy in a population regulation circuit where both the total population size and relative cell strain ratio can be set by reference signals. The circuit shows robustness and adaptation to perturbations in cell growth rate and changes in cell numbers. The control architecture is general and could apply to any organism for which synthetic biology tools for quorum sensing, comparison between outputs, and growth control are available.

Their key insight was that by using a sufficiently high sampling rate we can use a simple linear model for control purposes thereby trivializing controller design. In this paper, we provide a variation of model-free control for which it is possible to formally prove the existence of a sufficiently high sampling rate ensuring that controllers solving output regulation and tracking problems for the approximate linear model also solve the same problems for the true and unknown nonlinear model. This is verified experimentally on the bipedal robot AMBER-3M.

This has motivated recent development of online algorithms for solving time-varying optimal power flow problems. We have proposed a centralized quasi-Newton algorithm and have derived theoretical guarantees for its tracking performance. In this paper we show how this algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner by a network of controllable energy resources coordinated by an operator. The proposed distributed implementation now can handle general convex quadratic constraints on power injections, and only requires minimal communication between the operator and local controllers. Simulation shows that the proposed distributed implementation has good performance.

The goal is to reduce the total EV cost and station congestion due to temporary shortage in supply of available batteries. We show that the problem is reducible to the minimum weight perfect bipartite matching problem. This leads to an efficient solution based on the Hungarian algorithm. Numerical results suggest that the proposed solution provides a significant improvement over a greedy heuristic that assigns nearest stations to EVs.

Previous work has extended phase based motion magnification techniques to achieve state of the art results in vibrational and structural analysis. One limitation on the current approach is that it does not work very well in situations where substantial rigid body motion is present in the scene. The large rigid motion drowns out the tiny vibrations that are relevant for a full-field structural analysis. This work extends upon previous phase based motion algorithms in order to allow them to work even in cases with large rigid body motion present. Through a keypoint tracking and video cropping scheme rigid body motion is subtracted from video streams, while preserving the smaller motions of interest. After this preprocessing step, the new video stream can be passed into the full-field analysis scheme as usual, in order to get a full-field modal decomposition.

However, video cameras record large amounts of redundant background data causing video processing to be computationally inefficient. This work explores the use of a silicon retina imager to perform operational modal analysis. The silicon retina provides an efficient alternative to standard framebased video cameras. Modeling the biological retina, each silicon retina pixel independently and asynchronously records changes in intensity. By only recording intensity change events, all motion information is captured without recording redundant background information. This asynchronous event-based data representation allows motion to be captured on the microsecond scale, equivalent to traditional cameras operating at thousands of frames per second. With minimal data storage and processing requirements, the silicon retina shows promise for real-time vibration measurement and structural control applications. This study takes the first step toward these applications by adapting existing video frame-based modal analysis techniques to operate on event-based silicon retina measurements. Specifically, blind source separation and video motion processing techniques are used to automatically output vibration parameters from silicon retina data. The developed method is demonstrated on a cantilever beam.

For a model elliptic problem, we provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of the ratio estimator in the case where Monte Carlo, quasi-Monte Carlo, or multilevel Monte Carlo methods are used as estimators for the two prior expectations. We show that the computational complexity of the ratio estimator to achieve a given accuracy is the same as the corresponding complexity of the individual estimators for the numerator and the denominator. We also include numerical simulations, in the context of the model elliptic problem, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Satellite observations can provide information on the atmospheric state at fine spatial and temporal resolution while providing substantial coverage across the globe. For example, this capability can greatly enhance the understanding of the space-time variation of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), since ground-based measurements are limited. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) collects tens of thousands of observations of reflected sunlight daily, and the mission's retrieval algorithm processes these indirect measurements into estimates of atmospheric CO2. The retrieval is an inverse problem and consists of a physical forward model for the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere that includes absorption and scattering by gases, aerosols, and the surface. The model and other algorithm inputs introduce key sources of uncertainty into the retrieval problem. This article develops a computationally efficient surrogate model that is embedded in a simulation experiment for studying the impact of uncertain inputs on the distribution of the retrieval error.

Given an admissible target measure, we show the existence of the best approximation, with respect to this divergence, from certain sets of Gaussian measures and Gaussian mixtures. The asymptotic behavior of such best approximations is then studied in the small parameter limit where the measure concentrates; this asympotic behavior is characterized using Gamma-convergence. The theory developed is then applied to understand the frequentist consistency of Bayesian inverse problems in finite dimensions. For a fixed realization of additive observational noise, we show the asymptotic normality of the posterior measure in the small noise limit. Taking into account the randomness of the noise, we prove a Bernstein-Von Mises type result for the posterior measure.

Enhancing Tolerance to Unexpected Jumps in GR(1) Games	2017 ACM/IEEE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (ICCPS)	ACM-IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	8th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) held as part of Cyber-Physical Systems Week	APR 18-21, 2017	Pittsburgh, PA	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE Comp Soc		Linear Temporal Logic; Formal Methods; Synthesis; Robustness		When used as part of a hybrid controller, finite-memory strategies synthesizedfrom linear-time temporal logic (LTL) specifications rely on an accurate dynamics model in order to ensure correctness of trajectories. In the presence of uncertainty about the underlying model, there may exist unexpected trajectories that manifest as unexpected transitions under control of the strategy. While some disturbances can be captured by augmenting the dynamics model, such approaches may be conservative in that bisimulations may fail to exist for which strategies can be synthesized. In this paper, we consider games of the GR(1) fragment of LTL, and we characterize the tolerance of hybrid controllers to perturbations that appear as unexpected jumps (transitions) to states in the discrete strategy part of the controller. As a first step, we show robustness to certain unexpected transitions that occur in a finite manner, i.e., despite a certain number of unexpected jumps, the sequence of states obtained will still meet a stricter specification and hence the original specification. Additionally, we propose algorithms to improve robustness by increasing tolerance to additional disturbances. A robot gridworld example is presented to demonstrate the application of the developed ideas and also to perform empirical analysis.

A neural network is trained on the selected features of both the objects and background in the longwave (LW) Infrared (IR) images. Multiple iterations of training are performed until the accuracy of the segmentation reaches satisfactory level. The segmentation boundary of the LW image is used to segment the midwave (MW) and shortwave (SW) IR images. A second neural network detects the local discontinuities and refines the accuracy of the local boundaries. This article compares the neural network based segmentation method to the Wavelet-threshold and Grab-Cut methods. Test results have shown increased accuracy and robustness of this segmentation scheme for multi-spectral IR images.

Using a sequential maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach, the unknown FE model parameters, the measurement noise variances, and the input ground acceleration time histories are estimated jointly. This approach requires the computation of FE response sensitivities with respect to the unknown FE model parameters (i.e., FE parameter sensitivities) as well as the FE response sensitivities with respect to the values of the input ground acceleration at every time step (i.e., FE input sensitivities). The FE parameter and input sensitivities are computed using the direct differentiation method (DDM). The presented output-only nonlinear FE model updating method is validated using the numerically simulated seismic response of a realistic threedimensional five-story reinforced concrete building structure. The simulated building responses to a horizontal bi-directional seismic excitation is contaminated with artificial measurement noise and used to estimate the unknown FE model parameters characterizing the nonlinear material constitutive laws of the reinforced concrete, as well as the root mean square of the measurement noise at each measurement channel, and the full time history of the seismic base acceleration. The method presented in this paper provides a powerful framework for structural system and damage identification of civil structures, when the input excitations are not measured, are partially measured, or the measured input excitations are erroneous.

However, there are well-known limitations of the ABC approach to the Bayesian model selection problem, mainly due to lack of a sufficient summary statistics that work across models. In this paper, we show that formulating the standard ABC posterior distribution as the exact posterior PDF for a hierarchical state-space model class allows us to independently estimate the evidence for each alternative candidate model. We also show that the model evidence is a simple by-product of the ABC-SubSim algorithm. The validity of the proposed approach to ABC model selection is illustrated using simulated data from a three-story shear building with Masing hysteresis. (c) 2017 The Authors.

This starshade is flown between the telescope and the star, and suppresses stellar light sufficiently to allow the imaging of the faint reflected light of the planet. This paper presents a mechanical architecture for this occulter, which must stow in a 5 m-diameter launch fairing and then deploy to about a 80 m diameter structure. The optical performance of the starshade requires that the edge profile is accurate and stable. The stowage and deployment of the starshade to meet these requirements present unique challenges that are addressed in this proposed architecture. The mechanical architecture consists of a number of petals attached to a deployable perimeter truss, which is connected to central hub using tensioned spokes. The petals are furled around the stowed perimeter truss for launch. Herein is described a mechanical design solution that supports an 80 m-class starshade for flight as part of HabEx.

Masks are needed to suppress the host star light to better than 10(-8) -10(-9) level contrast over a broad bandwidth to enable the coronagraph mission objectives. Such masks for high contrast coronagraphic imaging require various fabrication technologies to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron scale island features, ultra-low reflectivity regions, uniformity, wave front quality, etc. We present the technologies employed at JPL to produce these pupil plane and image plane coronagraph masks, and lab-scale external occulter masks, highlighting accomplishments from the high contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at JPL and from the high contrast imaging lab (HCIL) at Princeton University. Inherent systematic and random errors in fabrication and their impact on coronagraph performance are discussed with model predictions and measurements.	[Balasubramanian, Kunjithapatham; Riggs, A. J.

However, for a starshade to generate a sufficiently dark shadow on the telescope, the two must be coaligned to just 1 meter laterally, even at these large separations. The principal challenge to achieving this level of control is in determining the position of the starshade with respect to the space telescope. In this paper, we present numerical simulations and laboratory results demonstrating that a Zernike wavefront sensor coupled to a WFIRST-type telescope is able to deliver the stationkeeping precision required, by measuring light outside of the science wavelengths. The sensor can determine the starshade lateral position to centimeter level in seconds of open shutter time for stars brighter than eighth magnitude, with a capture range of 10 meters. We discuss the potential for fast (ms) tip/tilt pointing control at the milli-arcsecond level by illuminating the sensor with a laser mounted on the starshade. Finally, we present early laboratory results.

The SPC provides starlight suppression in a pair of wedge-shaped regions over an 18% bandpass, and is well suited for spectroscopy of known exoplanets. To demonstrate this starlight suppression in the presence of expected on orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have recently built a dynamic testbed at JPL analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture, with both Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and SPC architectures and a Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to apply, sense, and correct dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present our best up-to-date results of the SPC mode demonstration from the testbed, in both static and dynamic conditions, along with model comparisons. HLC results will be reported separately.

The Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) is an IFS that has been built for the Subaru telescope. CHARIS has been delivered to the observatory and now sits behind the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system. CHARIS has 'high' and 'low' resolution operating modes. The high-resolution mode is used to characterize targets in J, H, and K bands at R70. The low-resolution prism is meant for discovery and spans J+H+K bands (1.15-2.37 microns) with a spectral resolution of R18. This discovery mode has already proven better than 15-sigma detections of HR8799c,d,e when combining ADI+SDI. Using SDI alone, planets c and d have been detected in a single 24 second image. The CHARIS team is optimizing instrument performance and refining ADI+SDI recombination to maximize our contrast detection limit. In addition to the new observing modes, CHARIS has demonstrated a design with high robustness to spectral crosstalk. CHARIS has completed commissioning and is open for science observations.

This results in more efficient detection and characterization of targets, and the spectral information is critical to achieving detection limits below the speckle floor of the imager. The most mature application of these techniques is at more modest contrast ratios on ground-based telescopes, achieving approximately 5-6 orders of magnitude suppression. In space, where we are attempting to detect Earth-analogs, the contrast requirements are more severe and the IFS must be incorporated into the wavefront control loop to reach le-10 detection limits required for Earth-like planet detection. We present the objectives and application of IFS imagery for both a speckle control loop and post-processing of images. Results, tested methodologies, and the future work using the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) and the Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies (PISCES) at the JPL High Contrast Imaging Testbed are presented.

Two key aspects to advancing starshade technology are the demonstration of starlight suppression to the level required for flight and validation of optical models at this high level of suppression. These technologies are addressed in current efforts underway at the Princeton Starshade Testbed. We report on results from modeling the performance of the Princeton Starshade Testbed to help achieve the milestone 10(-9) suppression. We use our optical model to examine the effects that errors in the occulting mask shape and external environmental factors have on the limiting suppression. We look at deviations from the ideal occulter shape such as over-etching during the lithography process, edge roughness of the mask, and random defects introduced during manufacturing. We also look at the effects of dust and wavefront errors in the open-to-atmosphere testbed. These results are used to set fabrication requirements on the starshade and constraints on the testbed environment. We use detailed measurements of the manufactured occulting mask to converge towards agreement between our modeled performance predictions and the suppression measured in the testbed, thereby building confidence in the validity of the optical models. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and practicalities of scaling to a larger testbed to further advance the optical aspect of starshade technology.

In order to achieve an optimal trade-off between planet light throughput and diffracted starlight suppression, we consider coronagraphs comprised of a stage of phase control implemented with deformable mirrors (or other optical elements), pupil plane apodization masks (gray scale or complex valued), and focal plane masks (either amplitude only or complex-valued, including phase only such as the vector vortex coronagraph). The optimization of these optical elements, with the goal of achieving 10 or more orders of magnitude in the suppression of on-axis (starlight) diffracted light, represents a challenging non-convex optimization problem with a nonlinear dependence on control degrees of freedom. We develop a new algorithmic approach to the design optimization problem, which we call the "Auxiliary Field Optimization" (AFO) algorithm. The central idea of the algorithm is to embed the original optimization problem, for either phase or amplitude (apodization) in various planes of the coronagraph, into a problem containing additional degrees of freedom, specifically fictitious "auxiliary" electric fields which serve as targets to inform the variation of our phase or amplitude parameters leading to good feasible designs. We present the algorithm, discuss details of its numerical implementation, and prove convergence to local minima of the objective function (here taken to be the intensity of the on-axis source in a "dark hole" region in the science focal plane). Finally, we present results showing application of the algorithm to both unobscured off-axis and obscured on-axis segmented telescope aperture designs. The application of the AFO algorithm to the coronagraph design problem has produced solutions which are capable of directly imaging planets in the habitable zone, provided end-to-end telescope system stability requirements can be met. Ongoing work includes advances of the AFO algorithm reported here to design in additional robustness to a resolved star, and other phase or amplitude aberrations to be encountered in a real segmented aperture space telescope.

We have demonstrated a new concept for speckle nulling by injecting directly imaged planet light into a single-mode fiber, linking a high-contrast adaptively-corrected coronagraph to a high-resolution spectrograph (diffraction-limited or not). The restrictions on the incident electric field that will couple into the single-mode fiber give the adaptive optics system additional degrees of freedom to suppress the speckle noise on top of destructive interference. We are able to achieve a starlight suppression gains that are an order of magnitude better than conventional techniques in broadband light with minimal planet throughput losses.

The payload will include a coronagraph instrument (CGI). The CGI designs under development use deformable mirrors (DM) to create a point spread function (PSF) with a dark region around the obscured star object. Electric field conjugation (EFC) is an iterative nonlinear optimization procedure that uses measurements of the electric field at the image to determine the DM displacements that modify the PSF to create the region of high contrast in the image. EFC requires a numerical model of the coronagraph to calculate the Jacobian of the system, which is used, along with regularization, to solve for the DM displacements for each iteration of the nonlinear optimization. Ideally, the coronagraph is aligned and calibrated, and the calibration data are used in the numerical model for calculating the Jacobian. However, calibration and alignment measurements always contain uncertainty resulting in calibration error. Therefore, the Jacobian calculated from the numerical model is not an exact representation of the physical coronagraph, and the resulting DM solution for an EFC iteration does not have the exact impact on the electric field of the coronagraph as predicted by the EFC. The result is slow convergence, and, as will be shown, the necessity of more restrictive regularization. Using Monte Carlo trials, we investigate the effect of calibration error on EFC convergence and regularization. Comparison to results from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph are also presented.

The high-contrast imaging system serves as a spatial filter to separate the light from the star and the planet while the high-resolution spectrograph acts as a spectral filter, which differentiates between features in the stellar and planetary spectra. The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) located downstream from the current W. M. Keck II adaptive optics (AO) system will contain a fiber injection unit (FIU) combining a high-contrast imaging system and a fiber feed to Kecks high resolution infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC. Resolved thermal emission from known young giant exoplanets will be injected into a single-mode fiber linked to NIRSPEC, thereby allowing the spectral characterization of their atmospheres. Moreover, the resolution of NIRSPEC (R = 37,500) is high enough to enable spin measurements and Doppler imaging of atmospheric weather phenomenon. The module will be integrated and tested at Caltech before being transferred to Keck in 2018.	[Mawet, D.; Delorme, J.

EXOSIMS has been adopted by the Exoplanet Exploration Programs Standards Definition and Evaluation Team (ExSDET) as a common mechanism for comparison of exoplanet mission concept studies. To ensure trustworthiness of the tool, we developed a validation test plan that leverages the Python-language unit-test framework, utilizes integration tests for selected module interactions, and performs end-to-end crossvalidation with other yield tools. This paper presents the test methods and results, with the physics-based tests such as photometry and integration time calculation treated in detail and the functional tests treated summarily. The test case utilized a 4m unobscured telescope with an idealized coronagraph and an exoplanet population from the IPAC radial velocity (RV) exoplanet catalog. The known RV planets were set at quadrature to allow deterministic validation of the calculation of physical parameters, such as working angle, photon counts and integration time. The observing keepout region was tested by generating plots and movies of the targets and the keepout zone over a year. Although the keepout integration test required the interpretation of a user, the test revealed problems in the L2 halo orbit and the parameterization of keepout applied to some solar system bodies, which the development team was able to address. The validation testing of EXOSIMS was performed iteratively with the developers of EXOSIMS and resulted in a more robust, stable, and trustworthy tool that the exoplanet community can use to simulate exoplanet direct-detection missions from probe class, to WFIRST, up to large mission concepts such as HabEx and LUVOIR.

We reduce the whole STIS coronagraphic archive at the most commonly observed positions (Wedge A0.6 and A1.0) with new post-processing methods, and present our results here. We are able to recover all of the 32 previously reported circumstellar disks, and obtain better contrast close to the star. For some of the disks, our results are limited by the over subtraction of the methods, and therefore the major regions of the disks can be recovered except the faintest regions.

The CGI operating modes are the hybrid Lyot coronagraph for planet detection and inner debris disk imaging, a shaped pupil coronagraph for planet characterization, and another shaped pupil for outer disk imaging. Early CGI designs focused on overcoming the diffraction of the large pupil obscurations. Now that those designs have been proven to work in the lab, the design emphasis has been on achieving higher throughput and lower sensitivities to jitter and polarization aberrations. Here we present those improvements and the integration of science yield modeling into the spectrographic shaped pupil design process.	[Riggs, A. J.

To achieve this goal, coronagraphic instruments have favored integral field spectrographs (IFS) as the science cameras to disperse the entire search area at once and obtain spectra at each location, since the planet position is not known a priori. These spectrographs are useful against confusion from speckles and background objects, and can also help in the speckle subtraction and wavefront control stages of the coronagraphic observation. We present a software package, the Coronagraph and Rapid Imaging Spectrograph in Python (crispy) to simulate the IFS of the WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). The software propagates input science cubes using spatially and spectrally resolved coronagraphic focal plane cubes, transforms them into IFS detector maps and ultimately reconstructs the spatio-spectral input scene as a 3D datacube. Simulated IFS cubes can be used to test data extraction techniques, refine sensitivity analyses and carry out design trade studies of the flight CGI-IFS instrument. crispy is a publicly available Python package and can be adapted to other IFS designs.

Since being selected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in December 2013, the coronagraph technology is being matured to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by 2018. To demonstrate starlight suppression in presence of expecting on-orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have built a dynamic testbed in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2016. This testbed, named as Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed, is designed analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture: It has both HLC and Shape Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) architectures, and also has the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to sense and correct the dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present upto-date progress of HLC mode demonstration in the OMC testbed. SPC results will be reported separately. We inject the flight-like Line of Sight (LoS) and Wavefront Error (WFE) perturbation to the OMC testbed and demonstrate wavefront control using two deformable mirrors while the LOWFS/C is correcting those perturbation in our vacuum testbed. As a result, we obtain repeatable convergence below 5 x 10(-9) mean contrast with 10% broadband light centered at 550 nm in the 360 degrees dark hole with working angle between 3 lambda/D and 9 lambda/D. We present the key hardware and software used in the testbed, the performance results and their comparison to model expectations.

With smaller telescopes, the targets tend to be brighter and closer to the Solar System, and their putative planetary systems span angles that require starshades with radii of 10-30 m at distances of 10s of Mm. With larger apertures, the light-collecting power enables studies of more numerous, fainter systems, requiring larger, more distant starshades with radii >50 m at distances of 100s of Mm. Characterization using infrared wavelengths requires even larger starshades. A mitigating approach is to observe planets between the petals, where one can observe regions closer to the star but with reduced throughput and increased instrument scatter. We compare the starshade shape requirements, including petal shape, petal positioning, and other key terms, for the WFIRST 26m starshade and the HABEX 72 m starshade concepts, over a range of working angles and telescope sizes. We also compare starshades having rippled and smooth edges and show that their performance is nearly identical.

The LOWFS/C uses a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) with the phase shifting disk combined with the starlight rejecting occulting mask. For wavefront error corrections, WFIRST LOWFS/C uses a fast steering mirror (FSM) for line-of-sight (LoS) correction, a focusing mirror for focus drift correction, and one of the two deformable mirrors (DM) for other low order wavefront error (WFE) correction. As a part of technology development and demonstration for WFIRST Coronagraph, a dedicated Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed has been built and commissioned. With its configuration similar to the WFIRST flight coronagraph instrument the OMC testbed consists of two coronagraph modes, Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) and Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC), a low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS), and an optical telescope assembly (OTA) simulator which can generate realistic LoS drift and jitter as well as low order wavefront error that would be induced by the WFIRST telescope's vibration and thermal changes. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of WFIRST LOWFS/C, describe the OMC testbed, and present the testbed results of LOWFS sensor performance. We will also present our recent results from the dynamic coronagraph tests in which we have demonstrated of using LOWFS/C to maintain the coronagraph contrast with the presence of WFIRST-like line-of-sight and low order wavefront disturbances.

In addition to the diffracted and scattered light for the on-axis star, a multi-star system features additional starlight leakage from the off-axis star that must also be controlled. A basic option is for additional starshades to block the off axis stars. An interesting option takes the form of hybrid operation of a starshade in conjunction with an internal starlight suppression. Two hybrid scenarios are considered. One such scenario includes the coronagraph instrument blocking the on-axis star, with the starshade blocking off-axis starlight. Another scenario uses the wavefront control system in the coronagraph instrument and using a recent Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC) technique can remove the off-axis stars leakage to enable a region of high-contrast around the on-axis star blocked by the starshade. We present simulation results relevant for the WFIRST telescope.

The dust grains coalesce into structures reminiscent of early solar system formation; their composition has been predicted through simulations and some edge-on observations but better data is required to validate them. Scattered light from these dust grains presents challenges to exoplanet imaging missions: resolution of their stellar environment is hindered by exozodiacal emissions and therefore sets the size and scope of these imaging missions. Understanding the composition of this interplanetary dust in our solar system requires an imaging mission from a vantage point above the ecliptic plane. The high surface brightness of the zodiacal light requires only a small aperture with moderate sensitivity; therefore a 3cm camera is enough to meet the science goals of the mission at an orbital height of 0.1AU above the ecliptic. A 6U CubeSat is the target mass for this mission which will be a secondary payload detaching from an existing interplanetary mission. Planetary flybys are utilized to produce most of the plane change Delta v; deep space corrective maneuvers are implemented to optimize each planetary flyby. We developed an algorithm which determines the minimum Delta v required to place the CubeSat on a transfer orbit to a planet's sphere of influence and maximizes the resultant orbital height with respect to the ecliptic plane. The satellite could reach an orbital height of 0.22 AU with an Earth gravity assist in late 2024 by boarding the Europa Clipper mission.

Currently at Princeton and JPL, two control schemes are being employed: electric field conjugation (EFC) and stroke minimization. Both of them are based on a linearized state transition model and both have achieved great success over the past decade. In this paper, we develop a general framework for the control system and improve upon the robustness of wavefront controllers from the perspective of stochastic optimization. We start by analyzing the model uncertainty and reformulating the wavefront control as a stochastic optimization problem. Then, we apply this idea to a recently proposed linear constraint wavefront controller and develop a robust version. According to the numerical simulations, the robust linear controller reveals the potential for creating more uniform dark holes. In experiment, the robust linear controller achieves at least as good performance as Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and stroke minimization.	[Sun, He; Kasdin, N.

We have developed an automated data architecture to process and index all data related to the survey uniformly. An automated and flexible data processing framework, which we term the GPIES Data Cruncher, combines multiple data reduction pipelines together to intelligently process all spectroscopic, polarimetric, and calibration data taken with GPIES. With no human intervention, fully reduced and calibrated data products are available less than an hour after the data are taken to expedite follow-up on potential objects of interest. The Data Cruncher can run on a supercomputer to reprocess all GPIES data in a single day as improvements are made to our data reduction pipelines. A backend MySQL database indexes all files, which are synced to the cloud, and a front-end web server allows for easy browsing of all files associated with GPIES. To help observers, quicklook displays show reduced data as they are processed in real-time, and chatbots on Slack post observing information as well as reduced data products. Together, the GPIES automated data processing architecture reduces our workload, provides real-time data reduction, optimizes our observing strategy, and maintains a homogeneously reduced dataset to study planet occurrence and instrument performance.

Future mission concepts under study by the 2020 decadal survey, e.g., HabEx and LUVOIR, have the potential of achieving this goal. We investigate the baseline requirements for detecting four molecular species, H2O, O-2, CH4, and CO2. These molecules are highly relevant to habitability and life activity on Earth and other planets. Through numerical simulations, we find the minimum requirement for spectral resolution (R) and starlight suppression level (C) for a given exposure time. We consider scenarios in which different molecules are detected. For example, R = 6400 (400) and C = 5 x 10(-10) (2 x 10(-9)) are required for HabEx (LUVOIR) to detect O-2 and H2O for an exposure time of 400 hours for an Earth analog around a solar-type star at a distance of 5 pc. The full results are given in Table 2. The impact of exo-zodiacal contamination and thermal background is also discussed.

Agreement between model prediction and testbed result at better than a factor of 2 has been consistently achieved in raw contrast (contrast floor, chromaticity, and convergence), and with that comes good agreement in contrast sensitivity to wavefront perturbations and mask lateral shear.

Acyclicity for Groups and Vector Spaces	SOUTHEAST ASIAN BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Acyclic matching property; Linear matching property; Torsion-free groups	MATCHINGS	A matching in an Abelian group G is a bijection f from a subset A to a subset B in G such that a + f(a) is not an element of. A, for all a. A. This notion was introduced by Fan and Losonczy who used matchings in Z(n) as a tool for studying an old problem of Wakeford concerning canonical forms for symmetric tensors. The notion of acyclic matching property was provided by Losonczy and it was proved that torsion-free groups admit this property. In this paper, we introduce a duality of acyclic matching as a tool for classification of some Abelian groups; moreover, we study matchings for vector spaces and give a connection between matchings in groups and vector spaces. Our tools mix additive number theory, combinatorics and algebra.

This paper seeks to investigate the suitability of several different open and closed loop control techniques for application to the problem of end effector position control with minimal vibration for a low stiffness space based manipulator. Simulations of a representative planar problem with two flexible links are used to measure performance and sensitivity to parameter variation of: model predictive control, command shaping, and command shaping with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback. An experimental testbed is then used to validate simulation results for the recommended command shaped controller.

NON-RECIPROCITY IN STRUCTURES WITH NONLINEAR INTERNAL HIERARCHY AND ASYMMETRY	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2017, VOL 8	Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences / Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE 2017)	AUG 06-09, 2017	Cleveland, OH	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div		Non-reciprocity; periodic structures; nonlinear wave propagation; resonance capture	MECHANICAL OSCILLATORS; IRREVERSIBLE-PROCESSES; WAVES	Acoustic reciprocity is a property of linear, time invariant systems in which the locations of the source of a forcing and the received signal can be interchanged with no change in the measured response. This work investigates the breaking of acoustic reciprocity using a hierarchical structure consisting of internally-scaled masses coupled with cubically nonlinear springs. Using both direct results and variable transformations of numerical simulations, energy transmission is shown to occur in the direction of decreasing scale but not vice versa, constituting the breaking of acoustic reciprocity locally. When a linear spring connects the smallest scale of such a structure to the largest scale of another identical structure, an asymmetrical lattice is formed. Because of the scale mixing and transient resonance capture that occurs within each unit cell, it is demonstrated through further numerical experiments that energy transmission occurs primarily in the direction associated with the nonlinear coupling from the large to the small scale, thus signifying the breaking of reciprocity globally. This nonlinear hierarchical structure exhibits strong amplitude-dependency in which reciprocity breaking is associated with specific ranges of excitation amplitudes for both impulse and harmonic forcing.

These transients are similar to transients in fluid filledpipelines observed during water hammer events. In this paper, the effect of an air gap in the syringe and a converging section are studied experimentally and numerically in a model system which consists of a fluid-filled metal tube that is impulsively loaded with a projectile to simulate the action of the autoinjector mechanism operation. The air between the buffer and the water results in a complex interaction between the projectile and the buffer. Also, there are tension waves inside the tube due to the presence of a free surface, and this causes distributed cavitation which, in turn, gives rise to steepening of the pressure waves. The converging section can amplify the pressure waves if the wave front is sharp. Pressures as high as 50 MPa have been measured at the apex of the cone with impact velocities of 5.5 m/s.

Performing these tasks while using minimal mass/volume systems and with low energy consumption is another set of requirements imposed on such technologies. A deep drill, called Auto-Gopher II, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Corp. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary-hammer drill that combines formation breaking by hammering using an ultrasonic actuator and cuttings removal by rotating a fluted auger bit. The hammering mechanism is based on the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to transform high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher and then integrated into a rotary hammer device to develop the Auto-Gopher-I. The lessons learned from these developments are being integrated into the development of the Auto-Gopher-II, an autonomous deep wireline drill with integrated cuttings and sample management and drive electronics. Subsystems of the wireline drill are being developed in parallel at JPL and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. This paper presents the development efforts of the piezoelectric actuator, cuttings removal and retention flutes and drive electronics.

The dynamics of such a process is well modeled by a two-body decay, resulting in a monoenergetic electron with an energy slightly below the muon rest mass (104.967 MeV). The calorimeter of this experiment plays an important role to provide excellent particle identification capabilities and an online trigger filter while aiding the track reconstruction capabilities. The baseline calorimeter configuration consists of two disks each made with similar to 700 undoped CsI crystals read out by two large area UV-extended Silicon Photomultipliers. These crystals match the requirements for stability of response, high resolution and radiation hardness. In this paper we present the final calorimeter design.

Precision Timing with shower maximum detectors based on pixelated micro-channel plates	17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CALORIMETRY IN PARTICLE PHYSICS (CALOR2016)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Calorimetry in Particle Physics (CALOR)	MAY 15-20, 2016	Daegu, SOUTH KOREA					Future calorimeters and shower maximum detectors at high luminosity colliders need to be highly radiation resistant and very fast. One exciting option for such a detector is a calorimeter composed of a secondary emitter as the active element. In this report we outline the study and development of a secondary emission calorimeter prototype using micro-channel plates (MCP) as the active element, which directly amplify the electromagnetic shower signal. We demonstrate the feasibility of using a bare MCP within an inexpensive and robust housing without the need for any photo cathode, which is a key requirement for high radiation tolerance. Test beam measurements of the prototype were performed with 120 GeV primary protons and secondary beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility, demonstrating basic calorimetric measurements and precision timing capabilities. Using multiple pixel readout on the MCP, we demonstrate a transverse spatial resolution of 0.8 mm, and time resolution better than 40 ps for electromagnetic showers.

The high luminosities expected at the HL-LHC will be accompanied by a factor of 5 to 10 more pileup compared with LHC conditions in 2015, causing general confusion for particle identification and event reconstruction. Precision timing allows to extend calorimetric measurements into such a high density environment by subtracting the energy deposits from pileup interactions. Calorimeters employing silicon as the active component have recently become a popular choice for the HL-LHC and future collider experiments which face very high radiation environments. We present studies of basic calorimetric and precision timing measurements using a prototype composed of tungsten absorber and silicon sensor as the active medium. We show that for the bulk of electromagnetic showers induced by electrons in the range of 20 GeV to 30 GeV, we can achieve time resolutions better than 25 ps per single pad sensor.

We discuss how timing information with a precision of a few tens of pico seconds and below can significantly improve the reconstruction of the physics events under challenging high pileup conditions to be faced at the High-Luminosity LHC or a future hadron collider. The particular challenge in measuring the time of arrival of a high energy photon lies in the stochastic component of the distance of initial conversion and the size of the electromagnetic shower. We present studies and measurements from test beams for calorimeter based timing measurements to explore the ultimate timing precision achievable for high energy photons of 10 GeV and above. We focus on techniques to measure the timing with a high precision in association with the energy of the photon. We present test-beam studies and results on the timing performance and characterization of the time resolution of LYSO-based calorimeters. We demonstrate time resolution of 30 ps is achievable for a particular design.

A crucial issue is radiation damage. We report an investigation on gamma-ray induced radiation damage in crystal scintillators of large size, including BaF2, BGO, CeF3, pure CsI, LSO/LYSO/LFS and PWO with an integrated dose up to 340 Mrad at a dose rate up to 1 Mrad/h. Optical and scintillation properties of these crystal samples were measured before and after irradiations. The result shows that pure CsI crystals have good radiation hardness below 100 krad. BaF2, BGO and LYSO crystals show good radiation hardness beyond 1 Mrad. In terms of light output degradation LSO/LYSO/LFS is clearly the best among all scintillation crystals.	[Yang, F.; Zhang, L.

This paper reports an investigation on proton induced radiation damage in various crystal scintillators. Large size BGO, LFS and PWO crystals of 18 to 22 cm long were irradiated by 800 MeV protons up to 3x10(15) p/cm(2) at the WNR facility of LANSCE with longitudinal transmittance measured in situ. LYSO plates of 14x14x1.5 mm(3) were irradiated by 24 GeV protons up to 8.2x10(15) p/cm(2) at the IRRAD facility of CERN. Degradations in both transmittance and light output are reported.

Thin crystal plates are used as the sensitive medium to reduce the light path length and thus the radiation damage effects and the calorimeter cost. A design of such a calorimeter uses tungsten as absorber, LYSO crystals as active medium, and liquid scintillator filled quartz capillaries as WLS to transport scintillating light to photodetectors. Initial calorimeter design and performance of prototype modules are presented. Possible optimizations are discussed.

Prior approaches have mainly been either purely reactive, mapping low-level visual features directly to headings, or deliberative methods that use onboard 3-D sensors to create a 3-D, voxel-based world model, then generate 3-D trajectories and check them for potential collisions with the world model. Onboard 3-D sensor suites have had limited fields of view. We use forward-looking stereo vision and lateral structure from motion to give a very wide horizontal and vertical field of regard. We fuse depth maps from these sources in a novel robot-centered, cylindrical, inverse range map we call an egocylinder. Configuration space expansion directly on the egocylinder gives a very compact representation of visible freespace. This supports very efficient motion planning and collision-checking with better performance guarantees than standard reactive methods. We show the feasibility of this approach experimentally in a challenging outdoor environment.

By strategically exploiting turbulence-induced "gravity fluctuations," our technique enables a new experimental approach for testing surface interactions of robotic systems in micro-to milli-gravity environments. This strategy is used to evaluate the performance of internally-actuated hopping rovers designed for controlled surface mobility on small Solar System bodies. In experiments, these rovers demonstrated a range of maneuvers on various surfaces, including both rigid and granular. Results are compared with analytical predictions and numerical simulations, yielding new insights into the dynamics and control of hopping rovers.

A Forward-Adjoint Operator Pair Based on the Elastic Wave Equation for Use in Transcranial Photoacoustic Computed Tomography	SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES			English	Article						photoacoustic computed tomography; transcranial imaging; image reconstruction; elastic wave equation	PERFECTLY MATCHED LAYER; IMPULSIVE POINT-SOURCE; FINITE-DIFFERENCE; HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA; FDTD SOLUTION; PROPAGATION; SKULL; ABSORPTION; ULTRASOUND; CONFIGURATION	Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging imaging modality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to form images of the photoacoustically induced initial pressure distribution within tissue. The PACT reconstruction problem corresponds to an inverse source problem in which the initial pressure distribution is recovered from measurements of the radiated wavefield. A major challenge in transcranial PACT brain imaging is compensation for aberrations in the measured data due to the presence of the skull. Ultrasonic waves undergo absorption, scattering, and longitudinal-to-shear wave mode conversion as they propagate through the skull. To properly account for these effects, a wave-equation-based inversion method should be employed that can model the heterogeneous elastic properties of the skull. In this work, a forward model based on a finite-difference time-domain discretization of the three-dimensional elastic wave equation is established and a procedure for computing the corresponding adjoint of the forward operator is presented. Massively parallel implementations of these operators employing multiple graphics processing units are also developed. The developed numerical framework is validated and investigated in computer-simulation and experimental phantom studies whose designs are motivated by transcranial PACT applications.

The HydroCube satellites would operate at sun-synchronous 3-day repeat polar orbits with a spatial resolution of about 1-3 Km. The mission goals would be to improve the estimation of terrestrial water storage and weather forecasts. Root-zone soil moisture and snow water storage in land are critical parameters of the water cycle. The HydroCube Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) concept utilizes passive receivers to detect the reflection of strong existing P-band radio signals from geostationary Mobile Use Objective System (MUOS) communication satellites. The SWE remote sensing measurement principle using the P-band SoOp is based on the propagation delay (or phase change) of radio signals through the snowpack. The time delay of the reflected signal due to the snowpack with respect to snow-free conditions is directly proportional to the snowpack SWE. To address the ionospheric delay at P-band frequencies, the signals from both MUOS bands (360-380 MHz and 250-270 MHz) would be used. We have conducted an analysis to trade off the spatial resolution for a space-based sensor and measurement accuracy. Through modeling analysis, we find that the dual-band MUOS signals would allow estimation of soil moisture and surface roughness together. From the two MUOS frequencies at 260 MHz and 370 MHz, we can retrieve the soil moisture from the reflectivity ratio scaled by wavenumbers using the two P-band frequencies for MUOS. A modeling analysis using layered stratified model has been completed to determine the sensitivity requirements of HydroCube measurements. For mission concept demonstration, a field campaign has been conducted at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado since February 2016. The data acquired has provided support to the HydroCube concept.

Such an approach, called triangle queries, was proposed in [1], where it was shown that, for a fixed query budget, it outperforms clustering based on edge queries (i.e, comparing pairs of objects). In [1] the clustering algorithm for triangle and edge queries was identical and each triangle query response was treated as 3 separate edge query responses. In this paper we directly exploit the triangle structure of the responses by embedding them into a 3-way tensor. Since there are 5 possible responses to each triangle query, it is a priori not clear how best to embed them into the tensor. We give sufficient conditions on non-trivial embedding such that the resulting tensor has a rank equal to the underlying number of clusters (akin to what happens with the rank of the adjacency matrix). We then use an alternating least squares tensor decomposition algorithm to cluster a noisy and partially observed tensor and show, through extensive numerical simulations, that it significantly outperforms methods that make use only of the adjacency matrix.

Techniques to achieve high performance in spite of the coarse quantizers have recently been advanced. In the context of array processing and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation also, one bit quantizers have been studied in the past, although not as extensively. This paper shows that sparse arrays such as nested and coprime arrays are more robust to the deleterious effects of one-bit quantization, compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs); in fact, sparse arrays with one-bit quantizers are often found to be as good as ULAs with unquantized data. Nested and coprime arrays without quanitzers are known to be able to resolve more DOAs than the number of sensors, when sources are uncorrelated. It will be demonstrated that this continues to be true even with one-bit quantization.	[Liu, Chun-Lin; Vaidyanathan, P.

P-L}, what is the minimum number of samples of x(n) required to find the period? For the special case where the samples of x(n) are constrained to be contiguous in time, this problem has recently been solved. More generally, when the samples are allowed to be non-contiguous, the problem is quite difficult. This paper provides the answer for the restricted situation where P is an element of {P-1, P-2}. With P-1 < P-2, the necessary and sufficient number of (possibly noncontiguous) samples for period estimation turns out to be (a) P-1, if P-1 is not a divisor of P-2, and (b) P-2 otherwise. While the proof is quite involved even in this restricted case, it is likely to form the basis for addressing the more general situation where P is an element of {P-1, P-2, ... P-L}.

One of these concepts is the uncertainty principle, which studies the concentration of a signal on a graph and its graph Fourier basis (GFB). An eigenvector of a graph is the most localized signal in the GFB by definition, whereas it may not be localized in the vertex domain. However, if the eigenvector itself is sparse, then it is concentrated in both domains simultaneously. In this regard, this paper studies the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of 1, 2, and 3-sparse eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. The provided conditions are purely algebraic and only use the adjacency information of the graph. Examples of both cIassical and real-world graphs with sparse eigenvectors are also presented.

This problem arises in applications where measuring the phase, and making high-frequency measurements, are either too costly or altogether infeasible. The problem is especially challenging because it combines the difficult problems of phase retrieval and classical super-resolution. Recently, the authors in [ 1] demonstrated that by making three phaseless low-frequency measurements, obtained by appropriately "masking" the signal, one can uniquely and robustly identify the phase using convex programming and obtain the same super-resolution performance reported in [2]. However, the masks proposed in [1] are very specific and in many applications cannot be directly implemented. In this paper, we broadly extend the class of masks that can be used to recover the phase and show how their effect can be emulated in coherent diffraction imaging using multiple illuminations, as well as in direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation using multiple sources to excite the environment. We provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the method and approach.

We consider two variants of decoders based on the regularized least squares followed by hard-thresholding: the case where the convex relaxation is from {-1,1}(n) to R-n and the box constrained case where the relaxation is to [-1,1](n). For both cases, we derive an exact expression of the bit error probability when n and m grow simultaneously large at a fixed ratio. For the box constrained case, we show that there exists a critical value of the SNR, above which the optimal regularizer is zero. On the other side, the regularization can further improve the performance of the box relaxation at low to moderate SNR regimes. We also prove that the optimal regularizer in the bit error rate sense for the unboxed case is nothing but the MMSE detector.

An efficient way to accomplish this is to make use of fast embedding techniques involving Fourier transform e. g. circulant matrices. While binary embedding has been studied extensively, theoretical results on fast binary embedding are rather limited. In this work, we build upon the recent literature to obtain significantly better dependencies on the problem parameters. A set of N points in R-n can be properly embedded into the Hamming cube {+/- 1}(k) with delta distortion, by using k similar to delta(-3) log N samples which is optimal in the number of points N and compares well with the optimal distortion dependency delta(-2). Our optimal embedding result applies in the regime log N less than or similar to n(1/3). Furthermore, if the looser condition log N less than or similar to root n holds, we show that all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the points can be optimally embedded. We believe the proposed techniques can be useful to obtain improved guarantees for other nonlinear embedding problems.

This work defines and derives recovery of these characteristics, in a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous medium. Recovery is based on a novel tomography approach. Multi-view (multi-angular) and multi-spectral data are linked to the underlying microphysics using 3D radiative transfer, accounting for multiple-scattering. Despite the nonlinearity of the tomography model, inversion is enabled using a few approximations that we describe. As a case study, we focus on passive remote sensing of the atmosphere, where scatterer retrieval can benefit modeling and forecasting of weather, climate and pollution.

In this paper, we study non-linear tensor factorization methods based on deep variational autoencoders. Our approach is well-suited for settings where the relationship between the latent representation to be learned and the raw data representation is highly complex. We apply our approach to a large dataset of facial expressions of movie-watching audiences (over 16 million faces). Our experiments show that compared to conventional linear factorization methods, our method achieves better reconstruction of the data, and further discovers interpretable latent factors.

For example, if two Mechanical Turkers happen to click on the same pixel location when annotating a part in a given image-an event that is very unlikely to occur by random chance-, it is a strong indication that the location is correct. A similar type of confidence can be obtained if a single Turker happened to agree with a computer vision estimate. We thus incrementally collect a variable number of worker annotations per image based on online estimates of confidence. This is done using a sequential estimation of risk over a probabilistic model that combines worker skill, image difficulty, and an incrementally trained computer vision model. We develop specialized models and algorithms for binary annotation, part keypoint annotation, and sets of bounding box annotations. We show that our method can reduce annotation time by a factor of 4-11 for binary filtering of websearch results, 2-4 for annotation of boxes of pedestrians in images, while in many cases also reducing annotation error. We will make an end-to-end version of our system publicly available.

When photons are few and far in between, the concept of 'image' breaks down and it is best to consider directly the flow of photons. Computer vision in this regime, which we call 'scotopic', is radically different from the classical image-based paradigm in that visual computations (classification, control, search) have to take place while the stream of photons is captured and decisions may be taken as soon as enough information is available. The scotopic regime is important for biomedical imaging, security, astronomy and many other fields. Here we develop a framework that allows a machine to classify objects with as few photons as possible, while maintaining the error rate below an acceptable threshold. A dynamic and asymptotically optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is a key feature of this framework. We propose and study an algorithm to optimize the tradeoff of a convolutional network directly from lowlight images and evaluate on simulated images from standard datasets. Surprisingly, scotopic systems can achieve comparable classification performance as traditional vision systems while using less than 0.1% of the photons in a conventional image. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithms work even when the illuminance of the environment is unknown and varying. Last, we outline a spiking neural network coupled with photon-counting sensors as a power-efficient hardware realization of scotopic algorithms.

Using the input-output dynamic data recorded during an earthquake event, batch and recursive Bayesian estimation methods are employed to update a mechanics-based nonlinear FE model of the structure of interest (building, bridge, dam, etc.). Unknown parameters of the nonlinear FE model characterizing material constitutive models, inertia, geometric, and/or constraint properties of the structure can be estimated using limited response data recorded through accelerometers or heterogeneous sensor arrays. The updated nonlinear FE model can be used to identify the damage in the structure following a damage-inducing event. This framework, therefore, can provide an advanced tool for post-disaster damage identification and structural health monitoring. The batch estimation method is based on a maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) approach, where the time history of the input and output measurements are used as a single batch of data for estimating the FE model parameters. This method results in a nonlinear optimization problem that can be solved using gradient-based and non-gradient-based optimization algorithms. In contrast, the recursive Bayesian estimation method processes the information from the measured data recursively, and updates the estimation of the FE model parameters progressively over the time history of the event. The recursive Bayesian estimation method results in a nonlinear Kalman filtering approach. The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are employed as recursive Bayesian estimation methods herein. For those estimation methods that require the computation of structural FE response sensitivities (total partial derivatives) with respect to the unknown FE model parameters, the direct differentiation method (DDM) is used. Response data numerically simulated from a nonlinear FE model (with unknown material model parameters) of a five-story two-by-one bay reinforced concrete frame building subjected to bi-directional horizontal seismic excitation are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed framework.

FILTER BASED METHODS FOR STATISTICAL LINEAR INVERSE PROBLEMS	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Kalman filter; 3DVAR; statistical inverse problems; artificial dynamics	HILBERT SCALES; REGULARIZATION; RATES	Ill-posed inverse problems are ubiquitous in applications. Understanding of algorithms for their solution has been greatly enhanced by a deep understanding of the linear inverse problem. In the applied communities ensemble-based filtering methods have recently been used to solve inverse problems by introducing an artificial dynamical system. This opens up the possibility of using a range of other filtering methods, such as 3DVAR and Kalman based methods, to solve inverse problems, again by introducing an artificial dynamical system. The aim of this paper is to analyze such methods in the context of the linear inverse problem. Statistical linear inverse problems are studied in the sense that the observational noise is assumed to be derived via realization of a Gaussian random variable. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of filter based methods for these inverse problems. Rigorous convergence rates are established for 3DVAR and for the Kalman filters, including minimax rates in some instances. Blowup of 3DVAR and a variant of its basic form is also presented, and optimality of the Kalman filter is discussed. These analyses reveal a close connection between (iterated) regularization schemes in deterministic inverse problems and filter based methods in data assimilation.

In an asymptotic scaling limit the system exhibits a purely magnetic confinement, based on the spectral properties of the Landau Hamiltonian. Using an averaging technique we derive an associated effective description via an averaged model of nonlinear Schrodinger type. In a special case this also yields a derivation of the LLL equation.

In order to form clathrate hydrates, water molecules are removed from the aqueous solution. This fact causes great impact on solutes concentration, including available nutrients in solution so habitability is directly affected. Both, thermodynamical history recorded in the experiments and visual features following of the system help to understand the truly effect of salting-out on geology and its expression on Europa's surface in application to space exploration.

These methods can preserve structural properties of the input matrix, such as positive-semidefiniteness, and they can produce approximations with a user-specified rank. The algorithms are simple, accurate, numerically stable, and provably correct. Moreover, each method is accompanied by an informative error bound that allows users to select parameters a priori to achieve a given approximation quality. These claims are supported by numerical experiments with real and synthetic data.

In this study, we use the scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) technique to study the surface photovoltage dynamics in doped silicon samples. We observe that the optical excitation of lightly doped n-type and p-type silicon as well as heavily doped n-type silicon increases the electron density on the surface. In contrast, the optical excitation of heavily doped p-type silicon increases the hole density on the surface. Furthermore, we show that the rise and the decay timescales of these events strongly depend on the doping concentration.

It extends a subset of the Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 for robotic applications. Hierarchical abstractions fundamental to BPMN allow the mission to be naturally decomposed into interdependent parallel sequences of BPMN elements. M2PEM adapts these elements in a role based framework which uses collaborative control modalities as an atomic building block. Designed missions are able to consider situational data, external stimuli, and direct user interaction. Missions are directly executable using a resource manager and a ROS-based execution engine.

It uses a reference frame based on longitudinal spacing along the route and lateral orthogonal offsets to plan for route clearance and traversal around previously unknown obstacles. By defining desired positions in terms of offsets from the route, the spatial and temporal components can be decoupled. The spatial components are planned using a two-step planner for fast real-time planning. The spatially defined paths are passed to a speed adaptation algorithm for temporal considerations including inter-vehicle collision avoidance. The approach balances real-time obstacle avoidance, spatial structure of the formation, and inter-vehicle safety considerations.

Additive Effects on Li parallel to CFx and Li parallel to CFx-MnO2 Primary Cells at Low Temperature	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTE; CATHODE; LI/CFX; 15-CROWN-5; SYSTEMS	The effect of additives and electrolyte composition was investigated for Li parallel to CFx and Li parallel to CFx-MnO2 cells operated at low (ca. -40 degrees C) temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel measurements indicated that the anode is far more resistive than the cathode at low temperatures. Adding a small amount of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) to a propylene carbonate (PC) + 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) + tetrahydrofuran (THF) ternary blend was found to have a beneficial effect on the anode of a cell when using 0.5 M LiClO4 as the electrolyte salt. Although the cathode impedance did increase with the addition of FEC, the overall cell impedance dropped dramatically, particularly at -40 degrees C. Capacity at low temperature was not significantly improved with FEC addition, however, indicating that static (i.e. EIS) measurements may not be the best tool to understand the cell under dynamic (discharge) conditions. 15-crown-5 (as an additive) proved to have severe negative effects on specific capacity.

In the case of continuous functions, a similar expansion is given based on the values of the functions at arbitrary points on the real line. In the process, we give new proofs for the localization of certain kernels, as well as for some very classical estimates such as the Markov-Bernstein inequality.	[Mhaskar, H.

The solution that we propose uses a method to construct an imaging system in space in which the nonlinear optical properties of a cloud of micron-sized particles, shaped into a specific surface by electromagnetic means, and allows one to form a very large and lightweight aperture of an optical system, hence reducing overall mass and cost. Recent work at JPL has investigated the feasibility of a granular imaging system, concluding that such a system could be built and controlled in orbit. We conducted experiments and simulation of the optical response of a granular lens. In all cases, the optical response, measured by the Modulation Transfer Function, of hexagonal reflectors was closely comparable to that of a conventional spherical mirror. We conducted some further analyses by evaluating the sensitivity to fill factor and grain shape, and found a marked sensitivity to fill factor but no sensitivity to grain shape. We have also found that at fill factors as low as 30%, the reflection from a granular lens is still excellent. Furthermore, we replaced the monolithic primary mirror in an existing integrated model of an optical system (WFIRST Coronagraph) with a granular lens, and found that the granular lens that can be useful for exoplanet detection provides excellent contrast levels. We will present our testbed and simulation results in this paper.

We show that, in contrast to the forwards Markov chain, the dynamics of the backwards chain explicitly involve the stationary distribution of the model, and from this we derive a functional equation that the stationary distribution must satisfy. We use this functional equation to derive differential equations for the stationary distribution of Bak-Sneppen models in which all but one or all but two of the fitnesses are replaced at each step, subject to certain conditions on the relative locations of the replaced species. This gives a unified way of deriving Schlemm's expressions for the stationary distributions of the isotropic four-species model, the isotropic five-species model, and the anisotropic three-species model.

It has worst-case running time n(1/2) m(1/2) s(2) poly(log(n), log(m), R, r, 1/delta), with n and s the dimension and row-sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, m the number of constraints, delta the accuracy of the solution, and R, r upper bounds on the size of the optimal primal and dual solutions, respectively. This gives a square-root unconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in n and m. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved (in terms of n and m) giving a O(O-1/2 + m(1/2)) quantum lower bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant s, R, r and d. The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs sampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on a classical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need for solving an inner linear program which may be of independent interest.	[Brandao, Fernando G. S.

We model granular materials using a viscoplastic constitutive law that produces a Drucker-Prager-like yield condition in the limit of vanishing flow. A friction law for non-steady flows, incorporating rate-dependence and dilation, is derived and implemented within the constitutive law. We compare our SPH simulations with experimental data, demonstrating that they can capture both steady and non-steady dynamic flow behavior, notably including transient column collapse profiles. This technique may therefore be attractive for modeling the time-dependent evolution of natural and industrial flows.

The majority of the Selenichnites found in this study contain only one lunate cast and some are distinguished by linear ridges that project behind a single lunate cast. A detailed investigation of the morphology and orientation of these Selenichnitesattributable to xiphosurans, relatives of modern horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus)yields an understanding of xiphosuran digging behavior. Statistical analysis of 96 lunate casts from two populations of Selenichnites separated by several hundred thousand years shows, with 99% confidence, that the prosomas (heads) of the younger population are smaller. Further study of the wealth of Selenichnites at Joggins will be useful to determine which factors control xiphosuran body-size changes and the timescale on which those changes can be seen manifest in a population. The smallest known Selenichnites (7mm wide) is also reported.

VEM will provide a global map of surface composition as well as redox state of the surface, providing a comprehensive picture of surface-atmosphere interaction on Venus. In addition, continuous observation of the thermal emission of the Venus will provide tight constraints on current day volcanic activity. These capabilities are complemented by measurements of atmospheric water vapor abundance as well as cloud microphysics and dynamic. Atmospheric data will allow for the accurate correction of atmospheric interference on the surface measurements and represent highly valuable science on their own. A mission combining VEM with a high-resolution radar mapper such as the NASA VOX or the ESA EnVision mission proposals in a low circular orbit will provide key insights in the divergent evolution of Venus.

To this end, a multi- band reflectometer will be sent to orbit the Moon. This instrument consists of an optical receiver aligned with four lasers, each of which emits sequentially at a different wavelength in the near- infrared between 1 mu m and 2 mu m. The receiver measures the laser light reflected from the lunar surface; continuum/absorption band ratios are then analyzed to quantify water ice in the illuminated spot. Here, we present the current state of the optical receiver design. To optimize the optical signal-to-noise ratio, we have designed the receiver so as to maximize the laser signal collected, while minimizing the stray light reaching the detector from solar-illuminated areas of the lunar surface outside the field-of-view, taking into account the complex lunar topography. Characterization plans are also discussed. This highly mass- and volume-constrained mission will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first CubeSats performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit.

While ensemble-based quantum memories have been routinely realized, implementing single rare-earth ion qubit remains an outstanding challenge due to its weak photoluminescence. Here we demonstrate a nanophotonic platform consisting of yttrium vanadate (YVO) photonic crystal nanobeam resonators coupled to a spectrally dilute ensemble of Nd ions. The cavity acts as a memory when prepared with spectral hole burning, meanwhile it permits addressing of single ions when high-resolution spectroscopy is employed. For quantum memory, atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol was implemented in a 50 ppm Nd:YVO nanocavity cooled to 480 mk. The high-fidelity quantum storage of time-bin qubits is demonstrated with a 80% efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The small mode volume of the cavity results in a peak atomic spectral density of <10 ions per homogeneous linewidth, suitable for probing single ions when detuned from the center of the inhomogeneous distribution. The high-cooperativity coupling of a single ion yields a strong signature (20%) in the cavity reflection spectrum, which could be detected by our efficient SNSPD. We estimate a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 10 for addressing a single Nd ion with its 879.7nm transition. This, combines with the AFC memory, constitutes a promising platform for preparation, storage and detection of rare-earth qubits on the same ship.

Arcus: The X-ray Grating Spectrometer Explorer	UV, X-RAY, AND GAMMA-RAY SPACE INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY XX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV, X-Ray, and Gamma-Ray Space Instrumentation for Astronomy XX	AUG 06-08, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Gratings; X-rays: spectroscopy; Instrumentation	SILICON PORE OPTICS; INTERSTELLAR DUST; SPECTROSCOPY; ABSORPTION; CHANDRA; DESIGN	Arcus, a Medium Explorer (MIDEX) mission, was selected by NASA for a Phase A study in August 2017. The observatory provides high-resolution soft X-ray spectroscopy in the 12-50 angstrom bandpass with unprecedented sensitivity: effective areas of >450 cm(2) and spectral resolution >2500. The Arcus key science goals are (1) to measure the effects of structure formation imprinted upon the hot baryons that are predicted to lie in extended halos around galaxies, groups, and clusters, (2) to trace the propagation of outflowing mass, energy, and momentum from the vicinity of the black hole to extragalactic scales as a measure of their feedback and (3) to explore how stars, circumstellar disks and exoplanet atmospheres form and evolve. Arcus relies upon the same 12m focal length grazing-incidence silicon pore X-ray optics (SPO) that ESA has developed for the Athena mission; the focal length is achieved on orbit via an extendable optical bench. The focused X-rays from these optics are diffracted by high-efficiency Critical-Angle Transmission (CAT) gratings, and the results are imaged with flight-proven CCD detectors and electronics. The power and telemetry requirements on the spacecraft are modest. Mission operations are straightforward, as most observations will be long (similar to 100 ksec), uninterrupted, and pre-planned, although there will be capabilities to observe sources such as tidal disruption events or supernovae with a similar to 3 day turnaround. Following the 2nd year of operation, Arcus will transition to a proposal-driven guest observatory facility.	[Smith, R. K.; Allured, R.; Brenneman, L.; Brickhouse, N. S.; Cheimets, P.

Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs	WAVELETS AND SPARSITY XVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Wavelets and Sparsity XVII	AUG 06-09, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Multirate processing; graph signals; block-cyclic graphs; spectral approximation	FILTER BANKS	A variety of different areas consider signals that are defined over graphs. Motivated by the advancements in graph signal processing, this study first reviews some of the recent results on the extension of classical multirate signal processing to graphs. In these results, graphs are allowed to have directed edges. The possibly non-symmetric adjacency matrix A is treated as the graph operator. These results investigate the fundamental concepts for multirate processing of graph signals such as noble identities, aliasing, and perfect reconstruction (PR). It is shown that unless the graph satisfies some conditions, these concepts cannot be extended to graph signals in a simple manner. A structure called M-Block cyclic structure is shown to be sufficient to generalize the results for bipartite graphs on two-channels to M-channel filter banks. Many classical multirate ideas can be extended to graphs due to the unique eigenstructure of M-Block cyclic graphs. For example, the PR condition for filter banks on these graphs is identical to PR in classical theory, which allows the use of well-known filter bank design techniques. In order to utilize these results, the adjacency matrix of an M-Block cyclic graph should be given in the correct permutation. In the final part, this study proposes a spectral technique to identify the hidden M-Block cyclic structure from a graph with noisy edges whose adjacency matrix is given under a random permutation. Numerical simulation results show that the technique can recover the underlying M-Block structure in the presence of random addition and deletion of the edges.

I argue that, through connections to materiality, this symbol functions as a nodal point that implicates the reader of Ritter's fragment project within the same operations of constructing both symbols and ideas that inform the text. This approach entails a significant departure from the scholarship of the past decade or two, where Ritter's circle times has been understood almost exclusively as a phenomenon of acoustics and self-writing.

Charge distribution uncertainty in differential mobility analysis of aerosols	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BIPOLAR ION ENVIRONMENT; OPPOSED MIGRATION ION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; FLOW-RATE; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; PARTICLE FORMATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; BOREAL FOREST; NM PARTICLES; STATE	The inference of particle size distributions from differential mobility analyzer (DMA) data requires knowledge of the charge distribution on the particles being measured. The charge distribution produced by a bipolar aerosol charger depends on the properties of the ions produced in the charger, and on the kinetics of charge transfer from molecular ions or ion clusters to the particles. A single parameterization of a theoretically predicted charge distribution is employed in most DMA analyses regardless of the atmospheric conditions being probed. Deviations of the actual charge distribution from that assumed in the data analysis will bias the estimated particle size distribution. We examine these potential biases by modeling measurements and data inversion using charge distributions calculated for a range of atmospheric conditions. Moreover, simulations were performed using the ion-to-particle flux coefficients predicted for a range of properties of both the particles and ions. To probe the biases over the full range of particle sizes, the measurements were simulated through an atmospheric new particle formation event. The differences between the actual charge distribution and that according to the commonly used parametrization resulted in biases as large as a factor of 5 for nucleation-mode particles, and up to 80% for larger particles. Incorrect estimates of the relative permittivity of the particles or not accounting for the temperature and pressure effects for measurements at 10 km altitude produced biases in excess of 50%; threefold biases result from erroneous estimates of the ion mobility distribution. We further report on the effects of the relative permittivity of the ions, the relative concentrations of negative and positive ions, and truncation of the number of charge states considered in the inversion.

HabEx would help assess the prevalence of habitable planets in our galaxy, searching in particular for potential biosignatures in the atmospheres of planets in habitable zones. More generally, HabEx would image our neighboring solar systems and characterize the variety of planets that inhabits them. Its direct imaging capability would also enable the mission to study the structure and evolution of debris disks around nearby stars, and their dynamical interaction with planets. Additionally, it will explore a number of more general astrophysics phenomena in our solar system, galaxy, and beyond, in the UV through NIR range. The exoplanet science goals lead to a mission concept with requirements for high contrast imaging and the continuous spectral coverage. The baseline for HabEx is a 4-meter diameter off-axis telescope designed to both search for habitable planets and perform general astrophysics observations, possibly combined with a starshade. In this paper, the initial flight system design for both the telescope and the starshade are presented, focusing on the key and driving requirements and subsystems, as well as the trajectory and station keeping and formation flying technique. Furthermore, some of the initial design trades undergone are described, as well as the key challenges and enablers. Finally, some of the future design and architecture trades to be performed within the flight systems as part of the continuing effort in the HabEx study are discussed.

Typical Aluminum mirrors protected with MgF2 fall short of the requirements below 120nm. New and improved coatings are sought to protect aluminum from oxidizing readily in normal environment causing severe absorption and reduction of reflectance in the deep UV. Choice of materials and the process of applying coatings present challenges. Here we present the progress achieved to date with experimental investigations of coatings at JPL and at GSFC and discuss the path forward to achieve high reflectance in the spectral region from 90 to 300nm without degrading performance in the visible and NIR regions taking into account durability concerns when the mirrors are exposed to normal laboratory environment as well as high humidity conditions.

The required planet/star brightness ratio of order 10-10 at visible wavelengths can be obtained by blocking stellar photons with an occulter, either externally (a starshade) or internally (a coronagraph) to the telescope system, and managing diffracted starlight, so as to directly image the exoplanet in reflected starlight. Coronagraph instruments require advancement in telescope aperture (either monolithic or segmented), aperture obscurations (obscured by secondary mirror and its support struts), and wavefront error sensitivity (e.g. line-of-sight jitter, telescope vibration, polarization). The starshade, which has never been used in a science application, benefits a mission by being decoupled from the telescope, allowing a loosening of telescope stability requirements. In doing so, it transfers the difficult technology from the telescope system to a large deployable structure (tens of meters to greater than 100 m in diameter) that must be positioned precisely at a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers from the telescope. We describe in this paper a roadmap to achieving the technological capability to search for biosignatures on an Earth-like exoplanet from a future space telescope.

With the JWST Science and Operations Center co-located at STScI, JOST was developed to provide both a platform for staff training and to test alternate wavefront sensing and control strategies for independent validation or future improvements beyond the baseline operations. The design of JOST reproduces the physics of JWSTs three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) using three custom aspheric lenses. It provides similar quality image as JWST (80% Strehl ratio) over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module, but at 633 nm. An Iris AO segmented mirror stands for the segmented primary mirror of JWST. Actuators allow us to control (1) the 18 segments of the segmented mirror in piston, tip, tilt and (2) the second lens, which stands for the secondary mirror, in tip, tilt and x, y, z positions. We present the most recent experimental results for the segmented mirror alignment. Our implementation of the Wavefront Sensing (WFS) algorithms using phase diversity is tested on simulation and experimentally. The wavefront control (WFC) algorithms, which rely on a linear model for optical aberrations induced by misalignment of the secondary lens and the segmented mirror, are tested and validated both on simulations and experimentally. After alignment, JOST achieves 23 nm RMS WFE at 633 nm (RMS = lambda/28), which after accounting for the difference in design wavelengths, is comparable to the budgeted post-alignment WFE expected for JWST. We present the performance of the full active optic control loop in presence of perturbations on the segmented mirror, and we detail the quality of the alignment correction.

The telescope is designed specifically to operate with both a high contrast coronagraph and a starshade, enabling the direct optical detection of exoplanets as close as 70 mas from their star. The telescope will be equipped with cameras for exoplanetary system imaging and with spectrometers capable of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. Gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane have spectral lines in the visible and near infrared part of the spectrum and may indicate biological activity. In addition to the study of exoplanets, HabEx enables general astrophysics with two dedicated instruments. One instrument is a camera enabling imaging on a 3 arc minute field of view in two bands stretching from the UV to the near infrared. The same instrument can also be operated as a multi-object spectrograph, with resolution of 2000. A second instrument will be a high resolution UV spectrograph operating from 120 nm with up to 60,0000 resolution. We discuss the preliminary designs of the telescope and the optical instruments for the observatory.

The LUVOIR Architecture "A" coronagraph instrument	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VIII	AUG 06-07, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		planetary systems - techniques: coronagraphy; wavefront control	WAVE-FRONT CORRECTION; HIGH-CONTRAST	In preparation for the Astro 2020 Decadal Survey NASA has commissioned the study four flagship missions spanning to a wide range of observable wavelengths: the Origins Space Telescope (OST, formerly the Far-Infrared Surveyor), Lynx (formerly the X-ray Surveyor), the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and the Habitable Exoplanet Imager (HabEx). One of the key scientific objectives of the latter two is the detection and characterization of the earth-like planets around nearby stars using the direct imaging technique (along with a broad range of investigations regarding the architecture of and atmospheric composition exoplanetary systems using this technique). As a consequence dedicated exoplanet instruments are being studied for these mission concepts. This paper discusses the design of the coronagraph instrument for the architecture "A" (15 meters aperture) of LUVOIR. The material presented in this paper is aimed at providing an overview of the LUVOIR coronagraph instrument. It is the result of four months of discussions with various community stakeholders (scientists and technologists) regarding the instrument's basic parameters followed by meticulous design work by the the GSFC Instrument Design Laboratory team. In the first section we review the main science drivers, presents the overall parameters of the instrument (general architecture and backend instrument) and delve into the details of the currently envisioned coronagraph masks along with a description of the wavefront control architecture. Throughout the manuscript we describe the trades we made during the design process. Because the vocation of this study is to provide a baseline design for the most ambitious earth-like finding instrument that could be possibly launched into the 2030's, we have designed an complex system privileged that meets the ambitious science goals out team was chartered by the LUVOIR STDT exoplanet Working Group. However in an effort to minimize technological risk we tried to maximize the number of technologies that will be matured by the WFIRST coronagraph instruments.

This indicates that an alternative to autonomous self-deployment similar to that of the James Webb Space Telescope will eventually be required. Moreover, even before this size limit is reached, there will be significant motivation to service, repair, and upgrade in-space missions of all sizes, whether to extend the life of expensive facilities or to replace outworn or obsolete onboard systems as was demonstrated so effectively by the Hubble Space Telescope program. In parallel with these challenges to future major space astronomy missions, the capabilities of in-space robotic systems and the goals for human space flight in the 2020s and 2030s offer opportunities for achieving the most exciting science goals of the early 21st Century. In this paper, we summarize the history of concepts for human operations beyond the immediate vicinity of the Earth, the importance of very large apertures for scientific discovery, and current capabilities and future developments in robot-and astronaut-enabled servicing and assembly.

Here, we present a 23-year-old man undergoing surgical evaluation with left fronto-temporal electrocorticography (ECoG) and microelectrode-array (MEA) in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). We compare action-potential (AP) and local field potentials (LFP) recorded from MEA with ECoG. Seizure onset in the mesial-temporal lobe was characterized by changes in the pattern of AP-firing without clear changes in LFP or ECoG in MTG. This suggests simultaneous analysis of neuronal activity in differing spatial scales and frequency ranges provide complementary insights into how focal and network neurophysiological activity contribute to ictal activity.

The maximum directivity of 46.1 dB agrees closely with the predictions of electromagnetic modeling, as does the increase in the directivity by more than 3 dB resulting from moving the feed by 0.7 cm closer to the reflective surface relative to the paraxial focal point.

Phase-relationships between scales in the perturbed turbulent boundary layer	JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE			English	Article						Turbulent boundary layers; very-large-scale-motions	WALL TURBULENCE; ROUGHNESS-PERTURBATION; AMPLITUDE-MODULATION; FLOWS; CHANNEL; REGION; PIPE	The phase-relationship between large-scale motions and small-scale fluctuations in a non-equilibrium turbulent boundary layer was investigated. A zero-pressure-gradient flat plate turbulent boundary layer was perturbed by a short array of two-dimensional roughness elements, both statically, and under dynamic actuation. Within the compound, dynamic perturbation, the forcing generated a synthetic very-large-scale motion (VLSM) within the flow. The flow was decomposed by phase-locking the flow measurements to the roughness forcing, and the phase-relationship between the synthetic VLSM and remaining fluctuating scales was explored by correlation techniques. The general relationship between large- and small-scale motions in the perturbed flow, without phase-locking, was also examined. The synthetic large scale cohered with smaller scales in the flow via a phase-relationship that is similar to that of natural large scales in an unperturbed flow, but with a much stronger organizing effect. Cospectral techniques were employed to describe the physical implications of the perturbation on the relative orientation of large- and small-scale structures in the flow. The correlation and cospectral techniques provide tools for designing more efficient control strategies that can indirectly control small-scale motions via the large scales.

Protein engineering to increase the potential of a therapeutic antibody Fab for long-acting delivery to the eye	MABS			English	Article						age-related macular degeneration; isomerization; deamidation; stability; solubility; protein engineering; high concentration formulation; long-acting delivery	SINGLE INTRAVITREAL INJECTION; MACULAR DEGENERATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY; INTRAOCULAR PHARMACOKINETICS; ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY; RANIBIZUMAB; COMPLEMENT; FRAGMENT; ISOMERIZATION	To date, ocular antibody therapies for the treatment of retinal diseases rely on injection of the drug into the vitreous chamber of the eye. Given the burden for patients undergoing this procedure, less frequent dosing through the use of long-acting delivery (LAD) technologies is highly desirable. These technologies usually require a highly concentrated formulation and the antibody must be stable against extended exposure to physiological conditions. Here we have increased the potential of a therapeutic antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) for LAD by using protein engineering to enhance the chemical and physical stability of the molecule. Structure-guided amino acid substitutions in a negatively charged complementarity determining region (CDR-L1) of an anti-factor D (AFD) Fab resulted in increased chemical stability and solubility. A variant of AFD (AFD.v8), which combines light chain substitutions (VL-D28S:D30E:D31S) with a substitution (VH-D61E) to stabilize a heavy chain isomerization site, retained complement factor D binding and inhibition potency and has properties suitable for LAD. This variant was amenable to high protein concentration (>250 mg/mL), low ionic strength formulation suitable for intravitreal injection. AFD.v8 had acceptable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties upon intravitreal injection in rabbits, and improved stability under both formulation and physiological conditions. Simulations of expected human PK behavior indicated greater exposure with a 25-mg dose enabled by the increased solubility of AFD.v8.

A comparative study of nanovoid growth in FCC metals	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article						Non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics; thermo-mechanical coupling; nanovoids; finite temperature	NONLINEAR HYPERELASTIC STRUCTURES; DYNAMIC RELAXATION ALGORITHM; QUASI-CONTINUUM ANALYSIS; IRREVERSIBLE-PROCESSES; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; RECIPROCAL RELATIONS; FINITE-TEMPERATURE; INFORMATION-THEORY; SIMULATION; SINGLE	Previous HotQC studies of Cu nanovoids undergoing volumetric expansion conducted by the authors have uncovered a quasistatic-to-dynamic transition at a critical strain rate of the order of 10(8) s(-1). At low strain rates nanovoid expansion takes place under essentially isothermal conditions, whereas at high strain rates it happens under essential adiabatic conditions. In this paper, we present a comparative study concerned with two different scenarios, each representing a variation on the reference case presented in [1]: (i) aluminium (Al) nanovoids undergoing volumetric expansion; and (ii) copper (Cu) nanovoids undergoing uniaxial deformation. Scenario (i) addresses material specificity by replacing Cu by Al in the reference case, whereas scenario (ii) addresses the effect of triaxiality by replacing volumetric expansion by uniaxial expansion in the reference case. We find a distinct quasistatic-to-dynamic transition in both scenarios, which suggests that the transition is indeed universal, i.e. material and strain-triaxiality independent. By contrast, the fine structure of the dislocation mechanisms that mediate void growth are strongly material and loading specific.

The IMF is a key ingredient for simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and is used to calibrate star formation relations in extra-galactic observations. Modeling the IMF directly in hydrodynamical simulations has been attempted in several previous studies, but the most important processes that control the IMF remain poorly understood. This is because predicting the IMF from direct hydrodynamical simulations involves complex physics such as turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation feedback and mechanical feedback, all of which are difficult to model and the methods used have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, a physical interpretation of the simulated IMFs requires a numerically converged solution at high resolution, which has so far not been convincingly demonstrated. Here we present a resolution study of star cluster formation aimed at producing a converged IMF. We compare a set of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations with three different implementations of the thermodynamics of the gas: 1) with an isothermal equation of state (EOS), 2) with a polytropic EOS, and 3) with a simple stellar heating feedback model. We show that in the simulations with an isothermal or polytropic EOS, the number of stars and their mass distributions depend on the numerical resolution. By contrast, the simulations that employ the simple radiative feedback module demonstrate convergence in the number of stars formed and in their IMFs.

They were initially studied for many promising reasons: resolving the measurement problem, formulating a theory of quantum mechanics and gravity, and understanding the limits of standard quantum mechanics. However, certain non-linear theories have been experimentally tested and failed. More significantly, it has been shown that, in general, deterministic non-linear theories can be used for superluminal communication. We highlight another serious issue: the distribution of measurement results predicted by non-linear quantum mechanics depends on the formulation of quantum mechanics. In other words, Born's rule cannot be uniquely extended to non-linear quantum mechanics. We present these generalizations of Born's rule, and then examine whether some exclude superluminal communication. We determine that a large class do not allow for superluminal communication, but many lack a consistent definition. Nonetheless, we find a single extension of Born's rule with a sound operational definition, and that does not exhibit superluminal communication. The non-linear time-evolution leading to a certain measurement event is driven by the state conditioned on measurements that lie within the past light cone of that event.

Despite the huge efforts made for localization using smartphone inertial sensors, its performance is still unsatisfactory in large open areas, such as halls, supermarkets, and museums, due to accumulated errors arising from the uncertainty of users' mobility and fluctuations of magnetic field. Regarding that, this paper presents iBILL, an indoor localization approach that jointly uses iBeacon and inertial sensors in large open areas. With users' real-time locations estimated by inertial sensors through an improved particle filter, we revise the algorithm of augmented particle filter to cope with fluctuations of magnetic field. When users enter vicinity of iBeacon devices clusters, their locations are accurately determined based on received signal strength of iBeacon devices, and accumulated errors can, therefore, be corrected. Proposed by Apple Inc. for developing LBS market, iBeacon is a type of Bluetooth low energy, and we characterize both the advantages and limitations of localization when it is utilized. Moreover, with the help of iBeacon devices, we also provide solutions of two localization problems that have long remained tough due to the increasingly large computational overhead and arbitrarily placed smartphones. Through extensive experiments in the library on our campus, we demonstrate that iBILL exhibits 90% errors within 3.5 m in large open areas.

Relationship between SST gradients and upwelling off Peru and Chile: model/satellite data analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE SST; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM; OCEAN; MODEL	The upwelling system off Peru/Chile is characterized by significant mesoscale to submesoscale surface variability that results from the instability of the coastal currents (due to the strong vertical and horizontal shears) and to the marked density cross-shore gradients (associated with the mean upwelling). Here we investigate to what extent upwelling intensity can be inferred from sea surface temperature (SST) derived from remote sensing. As a first step in validation, a comparison between SST observations is performed, which indicates that the 1 km gridded multi-scale ultra-high-resolution (MUR) SST data set is defining a zone of maximum SST gradients closer to shore than the low-resolution National Centers for Environmental Information 0.25 degrees resolution data set. Two model versions, at nominal resolutions of 2 km and 4 km, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model are analysed. A high-resolution version at 2 km is examined for the period 13 September 2011-23 January 2013, while a 4 km version is examined for 6 March 2011-22 April 2013. MUR shows maxima SST gradients in the range of 0.03 +/- 0.02 K km(-1) while the model showed higher gradients around 0.05 +/- 0.02 K km(-1). Based on coherence spectra, the relationship between upwelling rate (as inferred from the vertical velocity) and SST gradient is documented in the model from intraseasonal to annual timescales. It suggests that changes in SST gradient magnitudes are related to changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling off Peru and Chile. Such a relationship between SST gradients and vertical velocity would allow for the use of satellite-derived SSTs to monitor the intensity	[Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge; Torres, Hector S.; Menemenlis, Dimitris; Chin, Toshio; Armstrong, Edward M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA	Vazquez-Cuervo, J (corresponding author), M-S 300-323,3800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

These interactions are often mediated by protein interaction domains that enable proteins to recognize their interaction partners, often by binding to short peptide motifs. For example, PDZ domains, which are among the most common protein interaction domains in the human proteome, recognize specific linear peptide sequences that are often at the C-terminus of other proteins. Determining the set of peptide sequences that a protein interaction domain binds, or it's "peptide specificity," is crucial for understanding its cellular function, and predicting how mutations impact peptide specificity is important for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human diseases. Moreover, engineering novel cellular functions for synthetic biology applications, such as the biosynthesis of biofuels or drugs, requires the design of protein interaction specificity to avoid crosstalk with native metabolic and signaling pathways. The ability to accurately predict and design protein-peptide interaction specificity is therefore critical for understanding and engineering biological function. One approach that has recently been employed toward accomplishing this goal is computational protein design. This chapter provides an overview of recent methodological advances in computational protein design and highlights examples of how these advances can enable increased accuracy in predicting and designing peptide specificity.

Effect of Displacement Damage on Tantalum Oxide Resistive Memory	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							RADIATION; MEMRISTORS; TAOX	The radiation environment of space poses a challenge for electronic systems, in particular flash memory, which contains multiple radiation-sensitive parts. Resistive memory (RRAM) devices have the potential to replace flash memory, functioning as an inherently radiation resistant memory device. Several studies indicate significant radiation resistance in RRAM devices to a broad range of radiation types and doses. In this study, we focus on the effect of displacement damage on tantalum oxide-based RRAM devices, as this form of damage is likely a worst-case scenario. An Ar+ (170 keV) ion beam was used to minimize any contribution from ionization damage, maximizing the effect of displacement damage. Fluence levels were chosen to generate enough oxygen vacancies such that devices in the high resistance state (HRS) would likely switch to the low resistance state (LRS). More than half of devices tested at the highest fluence level (1.43E13 ions/cm(2)) switched from HRS to LRS. The devices were then switched for 50 set/reset cycles, after which the radiation-induced resistance shift disappeared. These results suggest that device switching may mitigate radiation damage by accelerating oxygen vacancy-interstitial recombination.

This allows three-dimensional reconstruction from a two-dimensional image. This is applicable to the tasks of fast motion capture, particle tracking etc. Sampling high resolution holograms yields a spatiotemporal tradeoff. We spatially subsample holograms to increase temporal resolution. We demonstrate this idea with two subsampling techniques, periodic and uniformly random sampling. The implementation includes an on-chip setup for periodic subsampling and a DMD (Digital Micromirror Device)-based setup for pixel-wise random subsampling. The on-chip setup enables direct increase of up to 20 in camera frame rate. Alternatively, the DMD-based setup encodes temporal information as high-speed mask patterns, and projects these masks within a single exposure (coded exposure). This way, the frame rate is improved to the level of the DMD with a temporal gain of 10. The reconstruction of sub sampled data using the aforementioned setups is achieved in two ways. We examine and compare two iterative reconstruction methods. One is an error reduction phase retrieval and the other is sparsity-based compressed sensing algorithm. Both methods show strong capability of reconstructing complex object fields. We present both simulations and real experiments. In the lab, we image and reconstruct structure and movement of static polystyrene microspheres, microscopic moving peranema, macroscopic fast moving fur and glitters.

The electromagnetic fields are calculated by numerical solutions of 3D Maxwell equations (NMM3D) using the method of Foldy Lax multiple scattering equations combined with the method of the body of revolution (BOR). Using the calculated transmission, we derive, the "tau", the optical thickness, which describes the magnitude of the transmission. Two cases are considered: the short-cylinder case and the extended-cylinder case. The case of short cylinders is that the lengths of cylinders are much smaller than the layer thickness, while the case of extended cylinders is that the lengths of the cylinders are the same as or comparable to the layer thickness. Numerical results are illustrated for vertically polarized plane waves obliquely incident on the layer of cylinders. The NMM3D results for the extended-cylinder case show large differences of transmission from the results of the other approaches, such as the effective permittivity (EP), the distorted Born approximation (DBA), and the radiative transfer equation (RTE). For the case of short cylinders, the NMM3D results are in close agreement with those of EP, DBA, and RIB.

The observed radiances are assimilated into weather forecast models and used to retrieve lower tropospheric temperature and water vapor for climate studies. There are several operational sounders today including the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on Aqua, the Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on Suomi NPP and JPSS, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on the MetOp spacecraft. The CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) is a NASA In-flight Validation of Earth Science Technologies (InVEST) program to demonstrate three new instrument technologies in an imaging sounder configuration. The first is a 2D array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The detectors are hybridized to a commercial ROIC and commercial camera electronics. The second technology is a MWIR Grating Spectrometer (MGS) designed to provide imaging spectroscopy for atmospheric sounding in a CubeSat volume. The MGS employs an immersion grating or grism, has no moving parts, and is based on heritage spectrometers including the OCO-2. The third technology is a Black Silicon infrared blackbody calibration target. The Black Silicon offers very low reflectance over a broad spectral range on a flat surface and is more robust than carbon nanotubes. JPL will also develop the mechanical, electronic and thermal subsystems for the CIRAS payload. The spacecraft will be a commercially available CubeSat. The integrated system will be a complete 6U CubeSat capable of measuring temperature and water vapor profiles with good lower tropospheric sensitivity. The low cost of CIRAS enables multiple units to be flown to improve temporal coverage or measure 3D Atmospheric Motion Vector (AMV) winds. CIRAS will launch in 2019 and is only a technology demonstration. However, what we learn will benefit future instruments that support operational weather forecasting and climate studies.

Here we study photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime of this InAsSb/InSb digital alloy. While increasing temperature from 15 K to 40 K we show a 14 meV blue shift of the photoluminescence peak energy and a decrease in lifetime.

The three categories of technologies include organic multichip modules (MCMs), ceramic leadless surface mount technology (SMT) and 3D printed waveguide structures. There are many other packaging technologies that currently exist but these three were selected in part due to their heritage in various commercial, military and space applications along with each having a relatively clear path to flight. For each of these technologies, detailed examples will be included in which hardware has been fabricated and tested for use in RF electronics for spacecraft transponders. The organic MCM example will be described in most detail and it utilizes a packaging technology by the name of CoreEZ which is a trademark of i3 Electronics. This MCM has shrunk a portion of our electronics down to 1/8th of its previous area. The CoreEZ technology has been shown to be rad hard beyond a total ionizing dose (TID) of 300kRad and the MCM which was fabricated has gone through thermal cycling and shown to have no degradation in performance. The ceramic leadless package examples include packages from high reliability manufactures by the name of KCB solutions and Barry Industries. In the case of KCB solutions, we have multiple products that will be described including a hermetic ceramic carrier which houses three microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) along with small discrete components. Finally, we will discuss the results of our search for a 3D printing process that allows us to reduce the cost and volume of our waveguide filters and diplexers for low cost small satellite applications. We have fabricated a few prototypes using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and metal coated plastics. Each of these packaging technology discussions will have a brief overview of its current and future use.

Joseph W.; Neilsen, Tim			Sun Radio Interferometer Space Experiment (SunRISE): Tracking Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Inner Heliosphere	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE			RELEASE TIMES; PERFORMANCE; ANTENNA; CORONA; EARTH	The authors present a space-based array designed to localize and track the radio emission associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun. Radio emission from CMEs is a direct tracer of the particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere and potential magnetic connections from the lower solar corona to the larger heliosphere. These questions are among those highlighted in the current Solar Decadal Servey, e.g., "Discover and characterize fundamental processes that occur both within the heliosphere and throughout the Universe." Furthermore, CME radio emission is quite strong, such that only a relatively small number of antennas is required, and a small mission would make a fundamental advancement in our scientific understanding. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art for tracking CME radio emission is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES) in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping. This type of heliophysics mission has been studied several times in the past, but had so far been found to be cost prohibitive, due to the inherent complexity of building multiple spacecraft and flying them in constellation. However, with the increased popularity and success of CubeSat concepts, accompanied by the miniaturization of subsystem components, a range of missions are now being enabled at lower cost than ever before. The paper presents the science requirements for a Small Explorer (SMEX)-class (typically < similar to$100M, including all lifecycle costs) mission concept, and walks through the major features of the SunRISE mission study. SunRISE is composed of six 6U (where 1U is defined as a 10 by 10 by 10cm form-factor) CubeSats placed in an orbit slightly above the Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) to achieve the aforementioned science goals. The spacecraft fly in a passive formation, which allows them to form an interferometer while minimizing the impact on operations complexity. The paper provides an overview of the mission and spacecraft design, as well as the concept of operations for the mission. Finally, it discusses how the SunRISE mission concept could serve as a stepping stone in demonstrating space-based interferometry and enable more complex mission concepts in the future.

An areostationary Relay Satellite is expected to be used for future communication network for the exploration of Mars. An areostationary Relay Satellite at 17,000 km above Mars surface is always in the same place in the sky on Mars, receiving data from the rovers/landers and low Mars orbiters and transmitting it to an Earth station. The areostationary satellite enables almost all time communication, except for certain durations when Mars is in between the areostationary Relay Satellite and the Earth. In this paper we define a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system between various assets such as rovers/landers on Mars surface, low Mars orbiters such as MRO, CubeSats in vicinity of Mars, and an areostationary relay satellite at 17,000 km above Mars surface. We assume data rates between 50 Kbps and 1 Mbps operating at 8.40 GHz frequency. We define the transmit power, antenna size, and data rates for the assets communicating with the areostationary relay satellite. Since the areostationary relay satellite simultaneously receives data from many users we have chosen the code division multiple access (CDMA) as a multiple access scheme, which does not require time/frequency coordination among users. Furthermore we compute the link budgets for various communication links, we define the modulation format, the PN spreading and chip rates. We provide a new theoretical analysis for multiuser interference, and simulate the performance of coded CDMA communication system. For coded system we use standard CCSDS LDPC codes proposed by NASA for space applications. Using CDMA, the communication structure of all assets on Mars operates at one single RF frequency. However the initial states of spreading PN codes assigned to users are different such that if all users communicate simultaneously with the areostationary relay satellite over a given band will have low cross correlation that reduces the multiuser interference.

The goal of the LunaH-Map mission is to map the hydrogen content of the entire South Pole of the moon, including permanently shadowed regions at high resolution. The spacecraft is a 6 U CubeSat and the main instrument is a neutron spectrometer which will be used to perform the measurements required to accomplish the primary science objective. Once LunaH-Map reaches the Moon, the spacecraft will perform a 60-day science mission, consisting of 141 science orbits during which the measurements will be taken. In the design of the LunaH-Map spacecraft, one of the main challenges is the telecommunication system as the spacecraft needs the ability to relay data during the long cruise phase and during the science phase. In addition, the telecommunication system needs to support the main navigation functions required to reach the Moon and to insert in the highly elliptical orbit required for the science phase. This paper covers the main aspects of the telecommunication design for the mission including: link and coverage analysis, waveform selection and spectral constraints, hardware selection and ground station coordination.

As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in space exploration, the communication systems currently implemented will need to be improved to support those missions. One of the bottlenecks is the antennas' size, due to the close relation between antenna gain and dimensions. Hence, a possible solution is to develop inflatable antennas which can be packaged efficiently, occupying a small amount of space, and they can provide, once deployed, large dish dimension and correspondent gain. A prototype of a 1 m inflatable antenna for X-Band has been developed in a joint effort between JPL and ASU. After initial photogrammetry tests and radiation tests, it was discovered that the design was not able to meet the required gain. As a result, a new design, based on a spherical inflatable membrane, is proposed. This new design will allow reaching a more stable inflatable surface, hence improving the electromagnetic performance. This paper will detail the principle challenges in developing this new antenna focusing on: design, EM analysis, fabrication and tests.

S	Bahrami, P; Nesmith, B; Carpenter, K			IEEE	Bahrami, Poyan; Nesmith, Bill; Carpenter, Kalind			Milli-watt Radioisotope Power to Enable Small, Long-Term Robotic "Probe" Space Exploration	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Milli-watt Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) based on Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs) could be an ideal power source for certain spacecraft that cannot use solar power due to large distances from the sun, or other environmental constraints, and where they enable or significantly enhance the ability of a mission to meet its scientific or operational goals. Various modular, compact RHU-based thermoelectric (TE) generator concepts developed or derived from current NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects satisfying this need have been investigated. These modular, compact and low mass power systems could support small, highly-mobile robotic exploration packages, and could be incorporated into different robotic package concepts, spacecraft or satellites. Current modular RPS design concepts with 40mW, 80mW and 120mW power levels use RHUs and Bi2Te3 TE converters. Skutterudites materials could be used in the future if new higher thermal energy output and higher temperature miniature heat sources were developed, for example, using technologies currently in the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) used in higher electric power output RTGs. Small (a.k.a., "mice-like") robotic packages could effectively utilize these RHU-driven power levels to accommodate crawling, climbing, monitoring, taking measurements, and communicating during long-term planetary missions aimed at gathering environmental and geologic data (i.e., over multiple decades). Waste heat from the cold side of the TE converter could also be directed toward the electronics and / or energy storage (e.g. batteries) to keep them within design temperature ranges. In addition to power generation and electronics / battery heating, the RHU / TE configuration could be designed to survive an external 500 degrees C bake out procedure for critical spacecraft sterilization, environmental certification and planetary protection. Analytical studies have been performed to optimize various design configurations for power, mass, volume and robotic mobility. Specific power (mW/kg) and volumetric specific power (mW/cm(3)) characteristics of various design configurations will be presented and key conceptual design tradeoffs will be discussed. Hot-and cold-side thermal interfaces required to meet power and mass goals and associated design sensitivities will also be discussed. RHU / TE systems must overcome critical design challenges to survive high-g loadings in some robotic applications and we will examine the mass impacts required to satisfy various dynamic loading environments up to 10,000 g's. Power can be generated for a minimum of 30 years or more using plutonium-238 dioxide heat sources (given that Pu-238 has an 87.7 year half-life) with some reduction in power as the heat source naturally degrades.

The outer solar system, in particular, poses a challenge for lower mission cost as the principal need for a robotic craft -a source of energy -is difficult to supply through conventional means (solar energy). Even as far from the Sun as Saturn, the solar energy density is only 1% of that at Earth. Not viewed typically as a power source for low-cost missions, radioisotope power systems (RPS) may well fill that role by providing power to small spacecraft in the outer solar system. And the outer solar system beckons with extremely compelling science. The rich dynamics of the atmospheres of the gas giants are continuously operating laboratories of extreme weather processes, examples of which in miniaturized scale may become more familiar here on Earth. Enceladus, a small moon of Saturn, has been seen by the Cassini mission to be a site of continuous high geologic activity, with plumes of water vapor and particles pumped hundreds of kilometers above the surface, indeed into Saturn orbit. The internal heating mechanisms of this activity beg for explanation, and more importantly, initial measurements by the Cassini spacecraft give tantalizing clues that the geo-thermal source of the heating is, in fact, maintaining a global sub-surface ocean, which in combination could provide a habitat for life. This paper will explore how existing and currently available RPS elements may make mission concepts to explore the intriguing science of Enceladus economically tractable, and at the same time provide a generic platform for other small but highly capable spacecraft to explore the outer solar system.

The 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey, Vision and Voyages, states: "Because of this ocean's potential suitability for life, Europa is one of the most important targets in all of planetary science." Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the planned Europa Mission. This exploration is intimately tied to understanding the three "ingredients" for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy. The Europa Mission would investigate these ingredients by comprehensively exploring Europa's ice shell and liquid ocean interface, surface geology and surface composition to glean insight into the inner workings of this fascinating moon. In addition, a lander mission is seen as a possible future step, but current data about the Jovian radiation environment and about potential landing site hazards and potential safe landing zones is insufficient. Therefore an additional goal of the mission would be to characterize the radiation environment near Europa and investigate scientifically compelling sites for hazards, to inform a potential future landed mission. The Europa Mission envisions sending a flight system, consisting of a spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific instruments, to execute numerous flybys of Europa while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge is that the flight system must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh at Europa. The innovative design of this multiple-flyby tour is an enabling feature of this mission: by minimizing the time spent in the radiation environment the spacecraft complexity and cost has been significantly reduced compared to previous mission concepts. The spacecraft would launch from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, on a NASA supplied launch vehicle, no earlier than 2022. The formulation and implementation of the proposed mission is led by a joint Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. In June 2015, NASA announced the selection of a highly capable suite of 10 scientific investigations to be flown on the Europa Mission. Since the announcement, the Europa Mission Team has updated the spacecraft design in order to fully accommodate this instrument suite - a significant challenge. After completing a successful System Requirements Review and Mission Definition Review in January of 2017, the project is currently transitioning from the concept development phase to the preliminary design phase of the mission. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Mission since 2015, including maturation of the spacecraft design, requirements, system analyses, and mission trajectories.

EDL trajectories with SRP enable landing larger masses on Mars than those possible using aerodynamic decelerators only. For manned missions to Mars, SRP will be a necessary technology, given the high ballistic coefficients that the entry vehicles require. Trajectories using SRP as the only means of terminal deceleration possess specific characteristics that require a tailored strategy and guidance algorithms, both of which are outlined in this paper.

After a series of aerobraking and propulsive maneuvers, the spacecraft has been in its sun-synchronous primary science orbit since September 2006 performing both scientific and Mars programmatic support roles. In addition to MRO's scientific investigations of Mars, NASA has tasked MRO to provide reconnaissance of potential landing sites for ongoing and future Mars missions. This paper covers the mission design and analysis process to characterize MRO's landing site coverage capability for all global locations, with special focus on potential sites for future missions: Gale Crater, Mawrth Vallis, and Noachis Human Exploration Zone.

S	Cheung, KM; Lee, C			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Lee, Charles			A Trilateration Scheme for Relative Positioning	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				We introduce a trilateration scheme that evaluates the 3-dimensional (3-D) relative position between a reference spacecraft and a target spacecraft using raw-range measurements from a distance baseline of known locations, which we call "anchors". The anchors can be antennas of a ground-based network (e.g., Deep Space Network (DSN) or Near Earth Network (NEN) stations), or satellites of a space-based network (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) or tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS)). We define raw-range as the range that includes all the systematic errors that occur during range measurements. A unique feature of this approach is that accurate relative position is derived from a "differencing function" of raw-range measurements of the reference spacecraft and target spacecraft, thereby eliminating most of the systematic errors, such as media effects, ephemeris errors, instrument delays, clock bias, etc. There can be an arbitrary number of target spacecraft, and relative positioning of target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft can be done simultaneously. In this paper, we first assume an idealized system in which clocks on the reference and target spacecraft are synchronized, with clocks of the anchors synchronized as well. 2 We develop a novel iterative algorithm that computes the relative position of the target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft. We illustrate the relative positioning method using the scenario of a network of three ground stations (i.e., the anchors) at Goldstone, California, USA, Madrid, Spain, and Marlargue, Argentina tracking two spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit distance. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges to sub-meter accuracy in estimating the relative position, in the presence of random errors and systematic errors in raw-range measurements, and in the presence of angular errors in estimating the pointing vectors between the anchors and the reference spacecraft. Next, we relax the requirement of perfect time synchronization between spacecraft, and show that by using an additional anchor, one can estimate and remove the clock biases between the reference and target spacecraft. We add a ground station at Kourou to the above example of three ground stations of Goldstone, Madrid, and Marlargue, and demonstrate that the updated algorithm also converges to meter-level accuracy (sub-meter in some cases) in the presence of clock biases in addition to the random errors, systematic errors, and angular errors as shown in the above case. We compare this scheme with a similar trilateration scheme for relative positioning scheme first proposed by Montenbruck in 2002.

S	Clark, I; Tanner, C			IEEE	Clark, Ian; Tanner, Christopher			A Historical Summary of the Design, Development, and Analysis of the Disk-Gap-Band Parachute	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute was originally developed in the late 1960's by Clint Eckstrom for high-altitude meteorological rocket applications. It was designed as a balance between drag and stability with a relatively simplistic design and low packing volume. Due to its demonstrated high-altitude performance and design features, the DGB was selected as a candidate for Viking precursor test programs such as the Planetary Entry Parachute Program (PEPP) and the Supersonic Planetary Entry Decelerator (SPED), in which the parachute was tested at high altitude supersonic conditions similar to those that would be experienced during an entry at Mars. The DGB was eventually selected for the Viking mission and qualified using a series of low-altitude drop tests and high-altitude balloon-launched decelerator tests (BLDT). Based on the success of the DGB on the Viking I and II missions, as well as the wealth of data generated during the PEPP, SPED, and BLDT test programs, the DGB parachute has been used on all subsequent U.S. missions to the surface of Mars with great success. Recently, an effort was undertaken to further improve the structural capability of the DGB parachutes used at Mars. An early activity was undertaken to better understand the breadth of designs, design modifications, and general evolution of the DGB canopy to better inform future designs. This paper collates historical DGB designs and structural performance. A key design shift includes the switch from low-tenacity Dacron skeletal components used in the Viking era to high-tenacity Kevlar skeletal components used in the Pathfinder era, which fundamentally changes the load sharing and energy absorption characteristics of the parachute. The paper also scrutinizes the analysis methods and flight limit load policies used throughout history. Of note is that the analysis methods have become "smarter,"transitioning from hand calculations to finite element analyses, but the use of more advanced methods have likely been eroding design conservatism leading to more aggressively designed parachute systems. Reflection upon previous DGB design and flight practices has shown that modern design practices may be driving large DGB designs outside the traditionally successful margin limits.

The magnetic circuit of the MaSMi-60 Hall thruster was modified to improve the magnetic field topology while increasing the strength of the field across the discharge channel gap. Direct thrust measurements were then taken to assess the changes to thruster efficiency, thrust, and specific impulse. The MaSMi-60's total efficiency increased by nearly 30% as a result of the improved magnetic field, resulting in a peak value of 32.1% (38.6% anode efficiency). Peak thrust and total specific impulse values of 35.8 mN and 1,440 s (1,550 s anode specific impulse) were observed. To demonstrate the thruster's enabling capabilities when paired with a smallsat-class spacecraft, three example mission trajectories to 118401 LINEAR, an icy asteroid-belt comet, were calculated. For each trajectory, the MaSMi-60' s experimentally demonstrated performance was used for the throttling table inputs. The trajectory solutions show a delivered mass fraction of between 35-49% for an initial spacecraft mass of up to 350 kg, a solar array power of up to 2.0 kW, and a total transfer time of similar to 6.5 years.

During the separation event, and subsequently during Schiaparelli's Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), the NASA-provided Electra Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) payload onboard TGO was used to record signals from the Schiaparelli Lander for post-processing on the ground to recover both tracking of the lander's carrier signal and reconstruction of the lander's 8 kb/s telemetry. In addition, ESA's Mars Express orbiter recorded the Schiaparelli signal, with ground post-processing providing independent tracking of the lander carrier signal, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India was configured to provide real-time detection of the lander carrier signal. While an anomaly in the latter stages of EDL led to loss of the lander, these critical event data sets, and in particular the telemetry reconstruction enabled by the TGO Electra recording, proved essential in enabling detailed diagnosis of the anomaly. While the loss of the lander during EDL precluded the planned surface relay operations, the preparations for that activity provide important lessons learned for future Mars relay support scenarios.

S	Gat, I; Talon, T			IEEE	Gat, Ilana; Talon, Thibaud			Lunarport: A Proposed Lunar-Resource Station to Expand Deep-Space Travel Horizons	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Deep-space travel is limited by the costly voyage to leave Earth's atmosphere and gravitational pull. The volume of propellants per unit mass of the payload required for that segment constrains the payload size and payload destination. To circumvent that limitation, this paper presents the feasibility of a refueling station using Lunar resources, called Lunarport. On Earth's moon, an unmanned station will robotically mine, produce, and store fuel and oxidizer from water ice at the poles. A first-stage-like rocket, called the Lunar Resupply Shuttle (LRS), stationed there and propelled with mined resources, will launch and dock with a passing payload-carrying rocket. That rocket will be reloaded with propellants by the LRS, after which the LRS will detach and the payload-carrying rocket will continue its journey to its desired trajectory. The LRS will wait in Lower Lunar Orbit (LLO, to avoid deterioration from Lunar regolith) until another payload-carrying rocket is launched from Earth, after which, the LRS will land back on the Moon, reload propellants, and launch again to dock with the next rocket. This paper elaborates on Lunarport, presenting proof-of-concept calculations of the increase in payload size sent to various payload destinations as well as a cost-benefit analysis. By way of example, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) enroute to Mars that refuels at Lunarport can have a payload approximately 17 metric tons (mT) heavier than one traveling straight to Mars from Earth. This increase of more than 50% [1] is just to a relatively nearby planet-Mars. Sending a payload farther offers larger benefits with Lunarport. Wear-and-tear issues the port will be subjected to are also discussed. A full analysis of Lunarport will be done during the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge sponsored by Airbus Defence and Space held from March 26-31, 2017.

The Space Solar Power Initiative at Caltech is working towards turning this idea into reality, by developing the critical technologies necessary to make this an economically feasible solution. The proposed system comprises an array of ultralight, membrane-like deployable modules with high efficiency photovoltaics and microwave transmission antennas embedded in the structure. Each module is 60 m x 60 m in size and in the final configuration, similar to 2500 of these modules form a 3 km x 3 km array in a geosynchronous orbit. As the constellation orbits the Earth, the orientation and position of each module has to be changed so as to optimize the angle made by the photovoltaic surface with respect to the sun and by the antenna surface with respect to the receiving station on Earth. We derive the optimum orientation profile for the modules and find that modules with dual-sided RF transmission can provide 1.5 times more orbit-averaged power than modules with single-sided RF transmission. To carry out the corresponding orbital maneuvers, an optimization framework using the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) equations is developed to achieve the dual goal of maximizing the power delivered, while minimizing the propellant required to carry out the desired orbital maneuvers. Results are presented for a constellation with modules in fixed relative positions and also for a constellation where the modules execute circularized periodic relative motion in the HCW frame. We show that the use of these periodic relative orbits reduces the propellant consumption from similar to 150 kg to similar to 50 kg. This drastic reduction makes the propellant mass a significantly smaller fraction of the module's dry mass (370 kg), thereby solving a major technical hurdle in the realization of space-based solar power.

Specifically, location combinations are found in which at least one location in the set has access to sunlight throughout 99% of the year 2020. Locations are identified and evaluated using a process involving two illumination simulation and analysis methods and a set-cover algorithm. Results are presented that demonstrate the trade-off between number of locations and height above surface level to achieve near-continuous access to sunlight near Shackleton Crater. Identified near-continuous solar power solutions span from three locations 25 meters above surface level to single locations 775 meters above surface level.

Missions involving multiple spacecraft are inherently more complex to design than traditional single spacecraft missions. This is particularly true for fractionated mission concepts, where spacecraft have diverse roles and distributed responsibilities, and fulfilling mission goals requires communication and collaboration. In practice, this complexity and the lack of computational models and tools limit design teams to consider small design spaces and force them to quickly fixate on a single mission design. However, design fixation at such early stages often leads to sub-optimal designs. Towards overcoming this limitation, we propose an automated approach to exploring and visualizing the trade space of multi-spacecraft mission architectures that aids users in decision making, and provides a basis for identifying solutions that are Pareto-optimal with respect to user-defined science requirements, technical and resource constraints, and mission objectives. Central to our approach is the automated synthesis and analysis of mission architecture alternatives from a set of user-provided functional requirements and mission goals, as well as a library of spacecraft components and analysis models. Design rules (synthesis knowledge) are provided in the form of model-transformation rules. Sequences of endogenous model transformations are applied in-place to produce sets of candidate solutions, thereby effectively searching the design space. The search process is guided by the specified objectives, and is implemented using evolutionary algorithms. We demonstrate our approach to architectural optimization using a simplified radio interferometry mission design as a case study. We conclude that using the proposed approach, the number and diversity of candidate mission architectures available for consideration can be significantly increased. Furthermore, the automated synthesis and evaluation of mission architectures can lead to emergent and non-intuitive solutions to be discovered.	[Herzig, Sebastian J.

ASCoT is a web-based tool that provides a suite of estimation tools to support early lifecycle NASA Flight Software analysis. ASCoT employs advanced statistical methods such as Cluster Analysis to provide an analogy based estimate of software delivered lines of code and development effort, a regression based Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) model that estimates cost (dollars), and a COCOMO II based estimate. The ASCoT algorithms are designed to primarily work with system level inputs such as mission type (earth orbiter vs. planetary vs. rover), the number of instruments, and total mission cost. This allows the user to supply a minimal number of mission-level parameters which are better understood early in the life-cycle, rather than a large number of complex inputs.

The planned Europa mission would be equipped with a suite of instruments to perform both remote and in-situ sensing, the scope of which ranges from gravity science to characterizing the surface composition, with one of the objectives being to confirm the existence of the subsurface ocean. As the selected instruments mature, the challenge has been to select and refine a spacecraft configuration that is flexible enough to accommodate these changes without degrading the scientific capability of the spacecraft. An increase in instrument volume and power have prompted the growth of spacecraft engineering subsystems, which include the solar arrays and the avionics module. These changes have the potential to cause obstructions to the instrument fields of view, stray light keep-out-zones, and thermal radiative fields of view. Many of these criteria are addressed by the implementation of a dedicated instrument platform. Payloads that are unique to the Europa mission require new approaches to instrument accommodation, such as coupling the ice penetrating radar's radiating elements to the solar array. This paper will discuss these accommodation strategies for the Europa spacecraft to generate a new baseline design.

The Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout mission, being developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is implementing a solar sail on a 6U CubeSat platform to address a specific set of key strategic knowledge gaps laid out by NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). NEA Scout's mission is to perform a close and slow encounter of a representative NEA as a robotic precursor for future human exploration. In addition to the resource limitations synonymous with small satellites, the NEA Scout flight system is further constrained by the implementation of the solar sail; for the CubeSat's expected 2.5-year mission, the solar sail is the flight system's primary attitude pointing constraint in order to achieve the trajectory needed to reach its target NEA. Due to the unique configuration challenges of fitting an 86 m(2) solar sail in the vehicle, NEA Scout's solar panels and medium gain antenna are fixed in a plane parallel to the sail. With the sail pointing constraint, the flight system cannot optimally orient the solar panels directly at the sun, subjecting them to a continuous cosine loss in generation. This may be the first deep space mission that has been designed to nominally not point at the sun - a challenge that traditional systems engineering and power models are not designed to handle optimally. To meet these challenges for NEA Scout and other similar mission concepts, JPL has created a novel flight system analysis model to rapidly simulate and iterate trajectories against spacecraft subsystem performance. Following mission design trajectory inputs, the model performs a Monte Carlo simulation of the flight system's performance. The outputs are distributions of the telecommunications downlink time (important for navigation and data sufficiency) and solar sail cruise angle (important for recharging the batteries before the next downlink). These distributions are processed and give key insight into the feasibility of the reference trajectory and likelihood of mission success.

These will be demonstrated on currently funded missions, such as INSPIRE, MarCO, and Lunar Flashlight, which will be among the first CubeSat missions to leave Earth's orbit and explore deep space, Mars, and the Moon, respectively. Other concepts may consider using these technologies to explore Venus, asteroids, Europa, Titan, and other areas of the solar system. These missions and concepts can be enabled by the development of miniaturized yet performant command and data handling, power, software, and communications systems specifically designed for deep space applications. JPL is pushing the state of the art in small subsystems to augment NASA's history of exploration. While the CubeSat/SmallSat component market has grown significantly to benefit LEO applications, only a few vendors are actively developing avionics and instrument interface electronics capable of meeting the stringent environmental, reliability, and performance requirements of deep space missions. These electronics and systems need to be specifically designed to handle harsh radiation and thermal environments as well as extended mission durations, where a CubeSat may begin its science observations after a multi-year cruise. Deep space missions also require additional technologies, such as radio transponders for interplanetary navigation. This paper first summarizes the systems-level developments of the enabling technologies of the JPL avionics bus, looking at maturing hardware and as well as future evolutions of technologies. Second, the paper discusses potential science instruments and applications that could be accommodated by these unique flight systems, either within a CubeSat or SmallSat form factor. Finally, the paper pairs technologies and instruments and showcases potential science missions enabled by this novel capability.

A simple cold gas system is proposed to fill this need. A series of tests were conducted to investigate the dust suspension and entrainment phenomena under the influence of a cold gas jet in the near vacuum conditions at Mars. This paper describes the experimental set-up and results of these tests. Data was collected for more than 400 different tests in order to evaluate the influence of mass flow rate, molecular weight of the working gas, back pressure of the ambient gas, height of the nozzle above the surface, and the nozzle design. The results of these tests are summarized and presented. The test program showed that the use of a cold gas system is an effective means of clearing dust from the surface of samples and determined which design parameters are key for system performance.

The Effects of Constrained Electric Propulsion on Gravity Tractors for Planetary Defense	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Electric propulsion may play a crucial role in the implementation of the gravity tractor planetary defense technique. Gravity tractors were devised to take advantage of the mutual gravitational force between a spacecraft flying in formation with the target celestial body to slowly alter the celestial body's trajectory. No physical contact is necessary, which bypasses issues associated with surface contact such as landing, anchoring, or spin compensation. The gravity tractor maneuver can take several forms, from the originally proposed constant thrust in-line hover to the offset halo orbit. Both can be enhanced with the collection of mass at the asteroid. The form of the gravity tractor ultimately impacts the required thrust magnitude to maintain the formation, as well as constraints on the vectoring of the thrust direction. Solar electric propulsion systems provide an efficient mechanism for tugging the spacecraft-asteroid system due to their high specific impulse. Electric propulsion systems can generate thrust continuously at high efficiency, which is an ideal property for gravity tractors that may require years of operation to achieve the desired deflection because of the very low coupling force provided by the gravitational attraction. The performance and feasibility of the deflection are predicated on having the propulsion capability to maintain the gravity tractor. This paper describes the impacts of constraining the solar electric propulsion thrust magnitude and thrust vectoring capability. It is shown that uncertainty in asteroid density and size, when combined with the enforcement of the electric propulsion constraints, can preclude the feasibility of certain gravity tractor configurations. Additionally, odd thruster configurations are shown to drive the gimbal performance and to have major impacts on eroding incident spacecraft surfaces due to plume interaction. Center of gravity movement further exacerbates issues with gimbaling and plume interaction. A tighter plume divergence angle is therefore always desired, but this paper shows that there is an optimal momentum balance between plume interaction and asteroid-plume avoidance. Several gravity tractor techniques are compared based on metrics of time efficacy, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit time, and mass efficiency, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit mass of fuel. Given the propulsion constraints, halo orbits can be infeasible for smaller asteroids unless the mass of the spacecraft is augmented with collected material through a technique called the Enhanced Gravity Tractor. Another proposed method is to alter the halo period by canting the thrusters. In-line hover gravity tractors can always be moved along the net thrust direction to conform to the given propulsion system at the expense of performance, except in the case of smaller asteroids with propulsion systems that are limited in lower throttle range or maximum gimbal angle. Alternative strategies, such as on-off pulsing the thrusters to lower the effective thrust are considered. An example is described for deflecting asteroid 2008 EV5 (341843), which currently serves as the reference asteroid for the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission.

These requirements are essential to communicating the constraints on the scope of the science investigations and clarifying how multiple instruments contribute to a given science goal. They also provide insight into how the science goals of the whole mission are affected by design choices. There is little specific guidance available on best practices for developing this science-driven flowdown. A unified Science Traceability Matrix (USTM) contains a significant amount of information that can be leveraged for that purpose, but the USTM was not designed to directly produce a complete science requirements flowdown. Thus, starting with the principles codified in a USTM, the authors propose a framework that directly maps into the requirements flowdown and supports broader systems engineering processes while retaining its meaning to the science team. This Science Traceability and Alignment Framework, or STAF, defines a set of common definitions and valid relationships to structure communication across the project. In addition, STAF populates a network of information that can be useful to support complex mission analysis activities such as fault protection. This work discusses the highest-level implementation of the STAF, the project-domain or P-STAF, which describes an approach to decomposing customer requirements into science requirements. The planned Europa Mission is used as a case study for the implementation of this framework and its potential benefits to a project.

However, they also pose a set of new environmental challenges that must be addressed in order to offer a viable alternative to ground-or space-based assets. In particular, maintaining science-quality pointing stability is a critical challenge for HAB platforms. For these missions, dynamic errors must be limited to a fraction of the observation wavelength, so as the wavelength becomes smaller, it becomes more difficult to meet the needed performance. As a result, there are very few existing pointing stabilization solutions that use visible-spectrum guide stars, despite their relatively wide distribution across the sky. This paper describes the results achieved with the STABLE (Subarcsecond Telescope And BaLloon Experiment) project whose goal is to provide the fine pointing stage for a balloonborne platform observing in the visible wavelength.

However, it is at a relatively low level of maturity compared to conventional propulsion options. Technology development efforts are currently underway to bring hybrid propulsion to a technology readiness level that would enable its infusion into potential Mars Sample Return. A new propellant combination is being considered for this design that has excellent low temperature behavior. Preliminary results of two ground test campaigns are currently underway to characterize this propellant combination. Hotfire testing is being carried out in parallel at Parabilis Space Technologies and Space Propulsion Group. In addition to the new propellant combination, several other technologies are being pursued for a potential hybrid MAV: hypergolic ignition and Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control. Both of these technologies have been applied in other rocket applications, e.g. liquid propulsion commonly uses hypergolic propellants and missiles, such as the Minuteman II, have used LITVC in the past. Hypergolic ignition, when oxidizer and fuel combust upon contact, is highly desirable for multiple starts required by the MAV concept. Therefore, testing at Penn State and Purdue is being completed in this area. An updated hybrid propulsion system design for a Mars Ascent Vehicle concept based on JPL's current understanding of potential Mars Sample Return requirements will be presented, leveraging the advances in technology development as well as updated understanding of how requirements may evolve.

The GRACE-FO mission is the result of an international cooperation to develop a concept and approach that minimizes cost and risk and maximizes the probability of success through limited changes to the original GRACE system design. The result is a system architecture in which maintenance of heritage is paramount, including heritage derived through the partnership with the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Germany. As a secondary goal, GRACE-FO will carry a Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) as a technology demonstration, which will provide laser interferometry measurements of inter-satellite range, complementary to the K/Ka-Band microwave link to demonstrate laser-ranging technology in support of future GRACE- like missions. Another secondary objective is the continuation of GRACE radio occultation measurements.

Historically, international agreements provided guidelines to prevent contamination of the Moon and other celestial bodies, as well as the Earth (e.g., sample return missions). The UN Outer Space Treaty was established in 1967 and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) maintains a planetary protection policy complying with Article IX of this treaty. By avoiding forward contamination, the integrity of scientific exploration is preserved. Planetary Protection mission requirements are levied on missions to control contamination. These requirements are dependent on the science of the mission and on the celestial bodies encountered or targeted along the way. Consequently, categories are assigned to missions, and specific implementation plans are developed to meet the planetary protection requirements. NASA missions have evolved over time with increasingly more demanding scientific objectives and more complex flight systems to achieve those objectives and, thus, planetary protection methods and processes used for implementation have become much more intricate, complicated, and challenging. Here, we will portray the evolution of planetary protection implementation at JPL in several important areas throughout the course of NASA sponsored robotic Mars lander or rover missions, starting from Mars Pathfinder through the beginning of Mars 2020. Highlighted in the discussion will be process changes in planetary protection requirements development and flow down. Development and implementation of new and improved methods used in the reduction of spacecraft bioburden will be discussed as well as approaches and challenges that come along with setting up remote laboratories to perform bioassays. The consequences and forward planning of delays on missions will be highlighted as well as lessons learned on the impact of communication and training in achieving planetary protection requirements. The evolution of methods used for the detection of microbial bioburden on spacecraft hardware will be considered. These methods use standard microbiology as well as the adaptation of advances in biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Technical approaches developed for the prevention of contamination and recontamination of hardware during Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations will be discussed.

The FM system called MONSID is designed to provide off-nominal state detection and identification capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The analysis tool can be applied to MONSID models to predict MONSID's diagnostic performance for various sensor suite configurations and model topologies. The underlying algorithms of the diagnostic resolution analysis tool are discussed. The tool is applied to a MONSID model of a robot power subsystem to illustrate how MONSID's ability to distinguish among potentially faulty components is affected by the number of sensors and their placement (injection points) in the model. The tool can be utilized for FM design early in the program by supporting sensor suite selection. In the operations phase, it can be used to reduce the amount of onboard processing required by the MONSID engine in the fault identification process.

S	Lisano, ME; Kallemeyn, PH			IEEE	Lisano, Michael E., II; Kallemeyn, Pieter H., Jr.			Energy Management Operations for the InSight Solar-powered Mission at Mars	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				NASA's InSight Discovery mission to Mars will land its Phoenix-heritage spacecraft to the near-equatorial Elysium Planitia region of Mars in November 2018 - instead of its original planned landing in September 2016 - to collect science measurements over a period longer than one Mars year. Thus, instead of arriving in mid-Mars-global-dust-storm season in 2016 as originally planned, InSight now will arrive in 2018 during the Martian season when dust storms are typically waning. However, it must be able to withstand a global dust storm near the mission's end a Mars year later, by which point dust on the solar arrays is likely to have accumulated significantly more. This paper discusses how the change in launch date has changed the energy management challenges for InSight, and how the energy management approach for surface operations has been adapted to address those challenges. It also describes how energy balance and battery life are protected over the course of the InSight landed mission, in terms of a deliberate balance between autonomous on-board fault protection and ground commanding into reduced-load configurations that still make progress versus specific, prioritized mission success criteria. It describes the project's unique statistical analysis and usage of Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) archived data on solar energy collection to develop and validate an explicit pre-launch margin policy versus energy reductions due to environment variability over multiple-sol sequences. And finally, the paper explains how this archived energy data has influenced the modification of the Phoenix-heritage autonomous fault protection, to guard against quickly-arising inclement power-generation conditions, such as rapid onset of a local dust storm or water ice cloud front.

The starshade has a particular apodizing profile that effects strong suppression of starlight within the starshade's shadow. Since starshades that would be used in space are large, typically 30 m diameter or more, performance is difficult to test on the ground at realistic scales. This paper examines the practical limits for testing starshades at smaller scales in the atmosphere and goes on to describe concepts for testing starshades using ground based telescopes and using starshades for astronomical observations.

Instead of dedicated launches of large science instruments, small science satellites could be piggybacked as secondary payloads. After deployment, the SmallSats will rendezvous. Miniature robot arms will deploy and perform docking to a second SmallSat, similar to robotic docking on the ISS or space shuttle. This docking method accommodates uncertainty in GNC while reducing risk of spacecraft collision through increased separation distance. Docking will be repeated until the cluster is completely formed, amplifying their capabilities. These clusters would be scalable in both the number and size of the cluster elements. The formation will be maintained without expending energy or fuel. This work addresses technology development areas of creating large, scalable structures in space. This assembly method allows for very small packing volumes that reduces mass and cost. Increased separation distance between cluster elements provide larger aperture per SmallSat, reducing number of total elements. It also enables scalable large structures that can be reconfigurable. Precise relative repositioning can accommodate alignment errors or thermal drift in addition to enabling variable baseline instruments. Individual cluster elements could be grossly repositioned to provide hardware reconfiguration. Applications include large, scalable RF and optical apertures, interferometry, in-space assembly, close formation flying, scanning and fixed "stare" imagers, and mother-daughter spacecraft. Four aspects addressed in this paper include the robotic arm, end effector, SmallSat bus, and rendezvous. The robotic arm is designed to meet SmallSat size (< 0.5U), weight (< kg), actuation, and power (approximate to 15 W) (SWAP) constraints. The actuators can be driven using SmallSat processing and motor drivers. Manipulator position can be held without use of power. By maintaining these constraints, the miniature robotic arm can be used as a payload of a variety of science SmallSats. Accounting for general SmallSat bus trends, capabilities, and interfaces help to provide minimal integration efforts across different platforms. The compact end effector is designed to accommodate any positioning uncertainty and relative spacecraft motion during docking. After docking, the end effector remains engaged without the use of power. Docking can be released to allow for gross hardware reconfiguration. Modularity was another important aspect of the end effector design. While the focus of this work is on docking, modularity allows for a wide range of potential applications. A representative SmallSat bus was designed using COTS components. Finally, rendezvous and relative control of two SmallSats was investigated.

The best observations then available could not provide an acceptable upper limit of the dust environment, so a process was put into place to develop multiple contingency trajectories and attitude profiles that could be implemented within the last few weeks before closest approach. One part of that process was to quickly associate the range of potential dust environments with the probabilities that the spacecraft would survive the encounter. This paper provides an overview of the New Horizons Hazard Process and describes the details of the spacecraft hazard assessment. The New Horizons hazard assessment process began with images taken of the Pluto system using the high-resolution imager. Those images were passed to a group looking for new objects. The locations of any new moons were analyzed to develop the associated stable orbits. Using those orbits, a team of dust modelers developed a range of dust environments for the system using models of how the dust particles were generated by the moons and transported throughout the system. Other key assumptions included the optical properties that defined how the dust environments would be imaged by the spacecraft sensor. These environments were then coupled to the spacecraft trajectory and attitude profiles to predict how many hits the different spacecraft surfaces would see. The number of hits and the damage criteria for those surfaces were combined to develop the overall probability of survival of the spacecraft. There were two parts to the New Horizons hazard process that were unique and provide key features for how these types of studies could be improved in the future. The first part was the timing. All of the spacecraft operations were controlled by preloaded commanded sequences that needed to be developed, reviewed, and tested well beforehand. A set of alternate command sequences and trajectories were developed in advance of the encounter to respond to possible dust hazards in the event that significant hazards were found. The limits of the available imaging from the spacecraft meant that the process of final image acquisition, downlink, analysis, and hazard assessment had to be completed within a 3-day time period so that the appropriate trajectory and sequence could be selected in time. The unknowns associated with the dust environment led to the development of over 2000 dust model/trajectory/attitude combinations that had to be evaluated and assessed. As the number of cases to be evaluated increased, the processing time became the schedule driver. The second part was the parametric dust models used. In an encounter with an unknown dust environment, the calculation of the dust spatial distribution involves a range of parameters that need to be defined by the dust modelling experts. The relative likelihood of the different dust parameter sets used in the dust model allow the generation of confidence levels to be included with the overall spacecraft damage assessment.

An orbiter would capture the OS, manipulate to a preferential orientation, transition it through the steps required to break-the-chain with Mars, stowing it in a containment vessel or an Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV) and providing redundant containment to the OS (for example by closing and sealing the lid of the EEV). In this paper, we discuss the trade-space of concepts generated for both the individual aspects of capture and manipulation of the OS, as well as concepts for the end-to-end system. Notably, we discuss concepts for OS capture, manipulation of the OS to orient it to a preferred configuration, and steps for transitioning the OS between different stages of manipulation, ultimately securing it in a containment vessel or Earth Entry Vehicle.

The OS would be in Martian orbit where a sample capture orbiter could find it and rendezvous with it. The orbiter would capture the OS, manipulate it to a preferential orientation for the samples, transition it through steps required to break-the-chain with Mars, stowing it in a containment vessel or an Earth Entry Vehicle and providing a redundant containment to the OS (e.g., by closing and sealing the lid of the EEV). In this paper, we discuss component technologies developed for in-laboratory evaluation and maturation of concepts toward the robotic capture and manipulation of an Orbital Sample. We discuss techniques for simulating 0-g dynamics of a spherical OS, including contact, in a laboratory setting. In this, we leverage a 5dof gantry system and, alternately, a 6dof KUKA robotic arm to simulate the OS motion. Both the gantry and robotic arm are mounted with a force-torque sensor that enable detection of contact and provide measurements to simulate, in hardware, the 0-g OS dynamics. We present results that demonstrate the validity of our approach and the extent to which we are able to simulate 0-g dynamics in a laboratory setting. We also discuss techniques for detecting and tracking the OS using optical sensors and LIDAR from near-capture distances. These are discussed in the context of individual sensors as well as fusion of multiple sensor readings. Results of hardware experiments with different sensors are presented. Further, we discuss an uncertainty quantification based physics modeling capability for quantitative evaluation of different concepts for OS capture and manipulation. The computational models are based on high-fidelity multibody dynamics simulations of the OS, robotic elements and their contact mechanics. We present results that demonstrate our effective use of computational simulations in a complementary manner to hardware experiments. Finally, we present a cyber-physical approach to concurrently fusing hardware elements, computational simulation elements and autonomy software to effectively and rapidly simulate end-to-end systems concepts for end-to-end orbital sample capture and manipulation system concepts.

These include: an order-of-magnitude or more increase in the area and consequent choices for accessing samples or making observations compared to past lander-based manipulator systems, the ability to deploy samplers and instruments over the extreme topography expected on ocean worlds, and accessing crevasses and vents from a safe distance. We have developed prototypes of concepts for long reach sampling and for deploying instruments and sampling systems on ocean worlds. In the paper, we describe a self-righting system to anchor and collect samples up to 20 cm below the surface and two options for sampler or instrument deployment at distances greater than 10m from a lander. The concepts and results from tests on prototypes are described in the paper.

Long range mobility at an appropriately selected site on the surface and with the requisite science instruments will address these goals. The challenges for mobility are rugged terrain, unknown and potentially soft regolith, extremely low temperature, and on Europa, possible corrosive materials and exposure to radiation. We have designed and prototyped a concept vehicle that can handle a wide range of topography and terra-mechanics conditions that we believe is needed for successful roving on ocean world bodies. The concept has been analyzed, optimized, simulated, and designed. The results from operating and testing the prototype are reported in this paper.

Development of Models for Disk-Gap-Band Parachutes Deployed Supersonically in the Wake of a Slender Body	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research and Experiments (ASPIRE) project will investigate the supersonic deployment, inflation, and aerodynamics of DiskGap- Band (DGB) parachutes in the wake of a slender body. The parachutes will be full-scale versions of the DGBs used by the Mars Science Laboratory in 2012 and planned for NASA's Mars 2020 project and will be delivered to targeted deployment conditions representative of flight at Mars by sounding rockets launched out of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. The parachutes will be tested in the wake of a slender payload whose diameter is approximately a sixth that of entry capsules used for Mars missions. Models of the deployment, inflation, and aerodynamic performance of the parachutes are necessary to design key aspects of the experiment, including: determining the expected loads and applicable margins on the parachute and payload; guiding sensor selection and placement; evaluating the vehicle trajectory for targeting, range safety, and recovery operations. In addition, knowledge of the differences in the behavior of the parachutes in the wake of slender and blunt bodies is required in order to interpret the results of the sounding rocket experiment and determine how they relate to expected performance behind blunt bodies at Mars. However, modeling the performance of a supersonic DGB in the wake of a slender body is challenging due to the scarcity of historical test data and modeling precedents. This paper describes the models of the aerodynamic performance of DGBs in supersonic slender-body wakes being developed for the ASPIRE sounding rocket test campaign. Development of these models is based on the four available flight tests of DGBs deployed in supersonic slender-body wakes as well as on data from past flight and wind-tunnel experiments of DGBs deployed in the wake of blunt bodies, on the reconstructed at-Mars DGB performance during past missions, and on computational fluid dynamics simulations. Simulations of the wakes of blunt and slender bodies in supersonic flow have been conducted in order to investigate the differences in the flowfields encountered by parachutes deployed in both wake types. The simulations have allowed the project to investigate the fundamental differences between the sounding rocket tests and the flight of a DGB during a Mars mission and to assess the limitations of the sounding rocket test architecture for evaluating flight performance at Mars.

On-orbit Measurement of ISS Vibrations during OPALS Extended Mission Operations	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Detailed understanding of the International Space Station vibration environment, particularly for the unpressurized portions of the platform, is and has been of high interest to payload developers seeking precision pointing performance due to its potential impact on on-orbit operations. The availability of such information, however, especially measured data, has been scarce, usually forcing investigators to utilize conservative bounding assumptions. During extended mission operations aboard the ISS at ELC 1, FRAM 8, the OPALS payload conducted a series of experiments aimed at improving the understanding of this key environmental parameter. The payload was repurposed for performing open-loop tracking of a ground-based laser beacon in a step-and-stare fashion so as to minimize the effects of its own gimbal on the measurement. Following significant processing of data acquired at 100Hz, the root-mean-square jitter at the OPALS mounting location is estimated to be in the 20-30 microradians range, and may even be in the low teens under certain conditions, an order of magnitude lower than previously assumed value.

S	Parness, A			IEEE	Parness, Aaron			Science Objectives and Rover Design for a Limbed Comet Rover Mission Concept	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE			DYNAMIC ALBEDO; HAYABUSA	The ability to rove the surface of Mars has revolutionized NASA missions by providing access to multiple diverse in situ measurement and sampling sites. The ability to rove on the surface of a comet could create a similar revolutionary improvement in the quality and quantity of in situ science that could be performed in comparison to touch-and-go systems or static landers. However, due to the microgravity environment, traditional wheeled rovers are infeasible as they lack the ground pressure on their wheels necessary for traction. Recent breakthroughs in limbed robots both at JPL and broadly across the world provide hope that a reliable and robust climbing rover could be a priority mission in the next decade. Similar rapid development has been occurring in anchoring end effectors that would serve as the rovers feet, preventing the rover from escaping the microscopic gravity field. When sampling the subsurface (1-3 meter depth), these same anchoring feet would also react the forces and torques that are put into the surface. A mission concept is presented that would analyze unaltered primitive materials, catalog complex organic molecules, and document any organic synthesis still occurring. In addition, the mission would quantify the heterogeneity of the comet's chemical and physical properties. A potential instrument suite is proposed that would fulfill these objectives. The science campaign of this mission was developed in partnership with JPL's Innovation Foundry.

The mission plans to extract a boulder from the asteroid's surface and use the combined mass of the spacecraft and boulder to slowly change the parent asteroid's orbit using a gravity tractor technique. ARM would then return this boulder to the Earth-Moon system for future human exploration. ARM would also mature several critical technologies needed for human missions to Mars including high power solar electric propulsion, dexterous robotics and autonomy, and support technologies for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. ARM has baselined two Microspine Tools for grasping, anchoring to, and helping extract the boulder from the asteroid. These tools must operate in the microgravity environment of the asteroid with the ability to grip and drill in microgravity. Another challenging constraint is the large uncertainty in the physical properties of the boulder. This paper describes the Microspine Tool's architecture, detailed design, and the fabrication and testing of a development unit. Three subsystems comprise the Microspine Tool: microspine gripper, anchoring drill, and the drivetrain, each of which expands the state of the art in space mechanisms.

A critical component of such a campaign would be an Orbiting Sample container (OS), which would contain the Mars samples to be returned to Earth. This paper discusses the most recent efforts by the JPL's Mars Formulation Office to mature an OS design planned for use on a potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. Similar to the "Decadal Study Architecture" [1], the current MSR architecture envisions as a three-mission campaign with each mission serving a critical role towards returning Martian rock and atmospheric samples back to Earth. An OS would be a central piece of hardware in the proposed MSR architecture due to its interfaces to all the three missions of the potential campaign. Additionally, numerous stakeholders and subsystems such as science and planetary protection impose challenging requirements on the OS's functions and capabilities. As a result, designing an OS that meets all the requirements is challenging and quite complex. The story of the OS's evolution from black box concept thru to the current-and-still-maturing baseline design is the focus of this paper. From the OS's launch off Earth aboard a Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) through to return to Earth, the design and functional requirements generated by and for each stage of the OS's mission are discussed. Then, with an understanding of what the OS would be required to do, a mapping of the main requirements to the design features of the current OS concept is explained. Many tests and analyses have been conducted to support and validate the current OS design. Results from test and analysis in the areas of aerothermal, impact dynamics, optical tracking, and radio electromagnetics are presented.

This paper details the UST software defined radio design and describes how the combination of a modular hardware architecture and in-flight reprogrammability enables a new level of flexibility and expandability for a space transponder. The UST uses common power and digital processing assemblies that can be integrated with a variety of RF modules and is capable of simultaneous, multiband operations with data rates up to 37.5 Mbps RX and 300 Mbps TX. This allows a single radio to support all the direct-to-Earth and relay communication requirements for even complex mission scenarios, reducing the total cost, mass, and power. The discussion includes a description of the current UST engineering models that have been built and tested, as well as details about the next generation capabilities supported by UST, including advanced link coding and modulation, radiometric techniques, and in-radio protocol handling. Details are also presented on RF modules and digital processing in development for radio science and astronomy purposes, including a bistatic radar receiver and broadband planetary emissions receiver. These will demonstrate the ability to integrate low-cost science instruments into the UST architecture, further expanding the versatility of the UST.

Additionally, dynamic systems offer the potential of producing generators with significantly reduced power degradation over the course of deep space missions so that more power would be available at the end of the mission, when it is needed most for both powering science instruments and transmitting the resulting data. The development of dynamic generators involves addressing technical issues not typically associated with traditional thermoelectric generators. Developing long-life, robust, and reliable dynamic conversion technology is challenging yet essential to building a suitable flight-ready generator. Considerations include working within existing hardware-handling infrastructure, where possible, so that development costs can be kept low, and integrating dynamic generators into spacecraft, which may be more complex than integration of static thermoelectric systems.

An analysis of the optimum placement of two vertically collinear reflectors suggests that placement atop a 300m deployable support structure would be sufficient to provide year round illumination to points of interest in the crater below. In order to provide the 300W/m(2) of sunlight necessary for the robots to operate, each solar reflector must unfold to over 1000m(2) of reflective surface area, have over 95% long term directional reflectivity in the visible regime, and be flat within lmm/m of deviation. Each reflector must also stow to less than 1m(3) in volume, have less than 100kg of mass, and be less than 1mm thick. Two classes of origami crease patterns have been developed that will allow a 25 mu m thick aluminized biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate solar reflector with 95% visible reflectivity, to be stowed within a cylinder lm tall, lm in diameter, with a mass of 35kg, and with up to 0.71m(3) volume to spare in the center for other components. Each class of origami crease pattern can be deployed from their perimeter by an attached inflatable thermoplastic torus that heats up during deployment to maintain flexibility and cools to maintain rigidity afterward. The remainder of the 1m(3) volume will be allocated to the inflatable deployment mechanism, electronics, and the deployable support structure. In order to maintain flatness, carbon fiber fabric tapes would run along the load bearing paths opposite of the reflective surface. Simulations of an elliptic solar reflector under lunar gravity show that a single carbon fiber fabric tape 40cm wide that spans the length of the reflector is sufficient to maintain the required flatness. Future work includes simulating the deployment of the solar reflectors with their support structure, building and testing larger scale prototypes, and performing field tests in relevant environments.

By utilizing high temperature alloys, the rover would survive on the surface of Venus for weeks if not months. The rover concept harvests wind energy using a turbine and stores it in a constant force spring. The mobility system would be guided by a mechanical computer and logic system, programed to carry out the mission. It would collect basic science data such as wind speed, temperature, and seismic events. Communicating the data back to Earth is the most challenging aspect of the system design with multiple options being explored in a trade: a simple electronic high temperature transponder, a retroreflector target or inscribing phonograph style records to be launched via a balloon to a high altitude drone capable of transmitting the data back to Earth. AREE is not only a new exciting in-situ rover concept, but also a paradigm shift to conducting in-situ science in extreme environments. Traditional extreme environment vehicles collect as many diverse data points as possible in the short period of time before system failure. AREE breaks that trend by exploring what can be done with only a few basic scientific measurements, but recorded over long periods of time. In addition to Venus, the concept can be useful in other extreme environments in the solar system including Mercury, Jupiter's radiation belts, the interiors of gas giants, the mantle of the Earth and volcanoes throughout the solar system.

SpaceCubeX: A Framework for Evaluating Hybrid Multi-Core CPU/FPGA/DSP Architectures	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The SpaceCubeX project is motivated by the need for high performance, modular, and scalable on-board processing to help scientists answer critical 21st century questions about global climate change, air quality, ocean health, and ecosystem dynamics, while adding new capabilities such as low-latency data products for extreme event warnings. These goals translate into on-board processing throughput requirements that are on the order of 100-1,000x more than those of previous Earth Science missions for standard processing, compression, storage, and downlink operations. To study possible future architectures to achieve these performance requirements, the SpaceCubeX project provides an evolvable testbed and framework that enables a focused design space exploration of candidate hybrid CPU/FPGA/DSP processing architectures. The framework includes ArchGen, an architecture generator tool populated with candidate architecture components, performance models, and IP cores, that allows an end user to specify the type, number, and connectivity of a hybrid architecture. The framework requires minimal extensions to integrate new processors, such as the anticipated High Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC), reducing time to initiate benchmarking by months. To evaluate the framework, we leverage a wide suite of high performance embedded computing benchmarks and Earth science scenarios to ensure robust architecture characterization. We report on our projects Year 1 efforts and demonstrate the capabilities across four simulation testbed models, a baseline SpaceCube 2.0 system, a dual ARM A9 processor system, a hybrid quad ARM A53 and FPGA system, and a hybrid quad ARM A53 and DSP system.

Modeling Risk Perception for Mars Rover Supervisory Control: Before and After Wheel Damage	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The perception of risk can dramatically influence the human selection of semi-autonomous system control strategies, particularly in safety-critical systems like unmanned vehicle operation. Thus, the ability to understand the components of risk perception can be extremely valuable in developing either operational strategies or decision support technologies. To this end, this paper analyzes the differences in human supervisory control of Mars Science Laboratory rover operation before and after the discovery of wheel damage. This paper identifies four operational factors sensitive to risk perception changes including rover distance traveled, utilization frequency of the autonomous driving capability (AutoNav), terrain risk weighting, and changes in high-level mission planning. A resulting Rover Risk Perception Model illustrates how these operational factors relate to increased perception of risk. Based on these results, we propose aiding risk perception mitigation strategies such that risk can be appropriately anchored. Such strategies can include a change in system design including adding technology and decision support tools, or changing the training of operators who use the system.

These five orbits were designed to be as deep in the atmosphere as Cassini could safely fly; however, recent occultation data of Saturn's atmosphere suggest that it is contracting. Given this contraction, the primary concern during these orbits has shifted from spacecraft health and safety to loss of science value. This paper explores a scenario for modifying the Cassini spacecraft's trajectory, during these final orbits, such that it dips deeper into Saturn's atmosphere. This scenario describes the method for in-situ detection of Saturn's atmospheric state, the locations and sizes of maneuvers that would reduce the final periapsis altitudes, the effects of such maneuvers on the remaining trajectory, and the risks involved. The result is that a periapsis-lowering, "pop-down" maneuver is feasible during Cassini's final orbits. Risk to the spacecraft is minimized by using the attitude control thrusters as density detectors during the first three atmospheric transits of the final five orbits. Should these transits reveal sufficiently low density and should sufficient propellant remain, then the Cassini project will consider performing the maneuver.

In this contribution, we discuss the Teledyne CHROMA HgCdTe FPA in the context of imaging spectrometer applications. The FPA was characterized in a laboratory thermal-vacuum chamber that allowed the read noise, dark current, well capacity, linearity, and crosstalk to be measured. Results are presented across a range of operating temperatures and pixel clock rates. Additionally, the outcomes of radiation testing to 100 krad TID are discussed.

The inversely twisted liquid crystal polymer (LCP) layer method was introduced to achieve broadband operation in patterned waveplate applications. The selection of the twist angle and half wave retardation wavelength, and the precise control in fabrication to achieve these values are critical for high efficiency in these type of devices. We numerically simulated the conversion efficiency of inversely twisted LCP to determine the twist angle and half wave retardation wavelength for the designated wavelength range, and experimentally fine-tuned these parameters.

Minimizing Motor Cogging and Vibration for the Thirty Meter Telescope	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) needs to maintain precise positioning of the optical elements to deliver unprecedented image quality. Any vibration from observatory sources must therefore be minimized; model-based analysis leads to maximum allowable forces from any individual source typically of order a Newton or less in the most sensitive frequency band. Careful attention throughout the design process is needed to ensure that these challenging requirements are satisfied. We focus here in particular on cogging forces from the azimuth motor drive. Each motor yields periodic tangential and vertical forces of order 100's of Newtons, with higher harmonics of the waveform potentially exciting telescope structural resonances. There are 56 drive motors, and appropriate phasing between them can ideally cancel most of the net torque or net vertical force. However, the moment created between non-collocated forces still produces image motion even if the net force cancels, and further, small errors in forcer positioning result in imperfect cancellation. We provide a general methodology for estimating total cogging forces and then present an example of the expected TMT performance impact from motor cogging placed in context with the larger challenge of demanding vibration requirement.

S	Vandermey, N; Heventhal, W; Ray, T			IEEE	Vandermey, Nancy; Heventhal, William; Ray, Trina			The Cassini Grand Finale Mission: Planning for a New Mission Environment	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Cassini F-Ring & Proximal Orbits (FRPO) is a new and unique mission; to ensure the highest priority science gets implemented, the POST (Proximal Orbit Science Team) was created to pre-allocate the time around periapse for all 22 proximal orbits. The F-ring orbits, and proximal time outside of POST, were handled similar to Cassini's Solstice Mission using the Pre-Integrated Event (PIE) process. The new and unique properties of the spacecraft's trajectory required much forethought to be flown safely while still planning for the most and best science return possible. Some ring-plane crossings (RPX) will be protected against dust impacts by turning the high gain antenna (HGA) to the dust RAM direction (HGA2RAM). If on the first proximal RPX higher than expected dust readings are seen then the Project Office may choose to require more (all) subsequent RPX to be HGA2RAM, implemented via a real-time command overlay for uplinked sequences. The pointing uncertainties will be larger than usual after the final targeted flyby; some of the process changes to address this include adding extra orbit trim maneuvers (OTMs) (fuel permitting) to resync to the reference trajectory and reduce pointing uncertainties; and movable blocks of commands to be used for some periapses where atmospheric drag may cause large timing shifts Changes made for FRPO to address perceptions that these sequences will be hard to implement include requiring early pointing designs (during integration) for certain types of observations, requiring teams to check early on that they can turn to and from their observation attitude, and that their attitude is safe, and adjusting the Implementation process to give more time for science observation designers. This paper will discuss these process changes and lessons learned so far.

Specifically, the sample caching system (SCS) is designed for coring Mars samples and acquiring regolith samples as well as handling, sealing and caching on Mars. As the potential first Martian samples that could be returned to Earth, assuring low levels of terrestrial contamination is of the utmost concern.

S	Wilcox, B			IEEE	Wilcox, Brian			An Architecture for Sustainable Human Exploration of Mars Enabled by Water from the Lunar Poles	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				This paper describes an architecture for human exploration of Mars that would be enabled by 10 metric tons (t) per day of ISRU water extracted at the lunar poles. The architecture involves a concept for a standardized "self-propelled tank" having an 85% propellant mass fraction that could hold up to 51 t of LH2/LO2 propellant. A variant of this tank would be equipped with landing legs so that, when fully-loaded, it could lift another full tank into Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), release it, and have enough propellant remaining to mate with an empty tank and to land safely back at the ISRU plant in a lunar polar crater. Two such pairs would be launched each lunar sidereal month such that the two payload tanks could mate together in LLO and depart to a carefully-selected High Earth Orbit (HEO). This orbit is such that exactly one tank would be consumed propelling one full tank to HEO and returning one empty tank from HEO to LLO, with both tanks arriving empty. Also, a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is selected where two full tanks in HEO could mate together such that one full tank arrives in LEO while the other tank has just enough propellant left to return to HEO, arriving empty. This combination of capabilities allows payloads to be launched from Earth into LEO, where they could be ferried to HEO using lunar propellant. Such payloads could be assembled together as stacks in HEO, where an array of full tanks accumulated over time from lunar ISRU could propel them on Hohmann transfers to Mars on every opportunity (every 26 months). The notional payload we envision launching to Mars every 26 months includes two 31 t Deep Space Habitats (DSHs, one for the outbound journey and one for the return journey) plus a 48 t Mars Surface Habitat with Ascent Vehicle (MSHAV). The stack departs HEO with a small burn from the array of 24 standardized propellant tanks - just enough to put it on an Oberth Maneuver trajectory, swinging by the top of the Earth's atmosphere where the main Trans-Mars Injection (TMI) burn occurs, consuming 7.8 of the 24 tanks. No tanks are jettisoned, so as to make this architecture sustainable and affordable. Upon arrival at Mars similar to 7-9 months later, another 9.2 tanks are burned to inject the stack into Low Mars Orbit (LMO). Exactly one tank is burned to de-orbit the MSHAV, reducing its velocity to zero at some point deep in the Mars atmosphere. The one tank that de-orbits the Mars entry stack is lost. After similar to 500 days on the Mars surface, the MAV launches and mates with the main stack in LMO. The returning DSH and the 23 tanks depart LMO with a burn of 4.3 tanks for Trans-Earth Injection. Upon arrival at Earth, 1.7 tanks are burned to inject into HEO, where the tanks could be shuttled back to the lunar surface for re-fueling. The DSH is mated with a single full tank at HEO that brings it to LEO to rendezvous with a crew capsule for re-entry.

A Deep Subsurface Ice Probe for Europa	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				This paper describes work on a concept for a probe that would be capable of km-scale deep subsurface ice penetration on Europa or other Ocean World. Penetrating deep into or through the ice cap over the liquid ocean is the best way to establish if life has evolved there. A central thesis of this work is that we must start by addressing the Planetary Protection constraints, and not to try to add them on at the end. Specifically, all hardware in the probe would be designed to survive heat sterilization at 500C for extended periods, as required to meet the COSPAR 1-in-10,000 probability per mission of biological contamination of the ocean. The baseline concept features a heat source containing plutonium-238 encased within a stainless Dewar so that the heat is not lost by conduction into the ice. A circular saw blade sticks out through a slot in a hemispherical turret dome at the bottom of the Dewar such that the blade cuts the ice as it spins. The turret also rotates slowly to cause the saw blade to make a hemispherical cut in the ice. The ice chips would be thrown up through the slit into the turret and would be melted by the heat source. The meltwater drains into sumps on either side of the sawblade, from which the meltwater would be pumped out to the rear of the probe. The main body of the probe contains a spool of aluminum tubing that would be dispensed from within the probe all the way back to the lander. This tubing is nominally 1-3 mm in outside dimension with integral insulated electrical wires around the center hole. This tube would pneumatically transport small (mm-scale) single-use canisters containing meltwater samples from the probe to the surface for analysis. Surface analysis allows use of instruments that can be neither miniaturized nor sterilized sufficiently to go down-hole. Dry inert gas would be used to push the canister down from the lander and back up. The dry gas would be re-compressed and re-used. During a portion of the cruise to the outer solar system, the heat source would heat the entire probe, including the coiled tubing inside as well as all the canisters and inert gas, to 500C to destroy any lingering organisms and to decompose any complex organic molecules. The paper describes analysis, design, and preliminary testing, as well as plans for building a prototype and testing it in an "ice treadmill" where a plug of ice is created inside a vertical LN2 cold jacket, pushed up by water pumped below so that the ice plug rises at the same rate that the probe penetrates the ice.

In this regime, data rate scales inversely as the 4th power of range, and the high data rate advantage of optical communications that results from a narrower transmit beam cannot be achieved. Before a received signal can be decoded, it first must be acquired from the background noise. In noise-limited optical communications, a background power dependent signal power threshold exists below which acquisition cannot occur, and data cannot be recovered. Decreasing the pulse width, corresponding to increasing the modulation bandwidth B, both increases capacity and aids acquisition. Higher modulation bandwidths than about 10 GHz require higher power in the control electronics due to the energy required to charge and discharge circuit capacitances. Higher complexity and higher power are negative attributes for space optical communications. One solution is to use a mode-locked laser, which enables very high effective peak power pulses with minimum complexity. A mode-locked laser utilizes a non-linear inter-cavity element to generate a fixed-rate train of narrow pulses. Communications requires data encoding on the fixed pulse train carrier. One method is to use a mode-locked laser with right or left circularly polarized output. Initial acquisition is aided by the narrow temporal spectrum and high peak power. Once acquired, all of the background noise outside the single data slot of the symbol can be rejected. In the noise-limited regime, capacity now is proportional to signal power over bandwidth-noise power product. The use of the mode-locked laser, versus a conventional pulse-carved continuous wave laser, allows optical communications links to be established in background noise regimes where the signal could not be acquired using conventional modulation schemes. This laser source and modulation scheme has benefits to CubeSat optical communications, and lander/rover Direct-toEarth communications. In this paper we investigate the design and performance evaluation of a coded mode-locked laser with right and left circular polarization switching. At the optical receiver a polarizing beam splitter and two photo-detectors are used to detect the data. One method for data detection is to compare the number of received photons from two photo-detectors. This comparison produces 0, or 1, or an erasure output. The erasure symbol is produced when the numbers of photons from the two detectors are equal. This method of detection produces an equivalent binary-input ternary-output discrete memoryless channel. Transition probabilities of this channel are computed based on received signal and background noise fluxes. We evaluate the performance of a very low-rate turbo code (rate 1/31) to be used over this channel. We compare this code's performance with the capacity of the underlying optical channel, and with uncoded system performance. We demonstrate that at least 10 dB coding gain can be achieved with respect to the uncoded case. Moreover, we show that the performance of this well designed code is within 1 dB of channel capacity for an information block size of 16384 bits.

Its rotary drill successfully penetrated the surface and pneumatically transferred material to the science instrument within the insulated interior of the spacecraft. Follow-on missions in the Venera and Vega program repeated that feat. These missions demonstrated that it is possible for an electric motor to function at Venus conditions and that it is possible to drill Venus surface material and pneumatically transfer captured sample under Venus conditions. Unfortunately, design details for the sampling system do not exist or cannot be located. Hence for any future Venus surface missions, the sampling technology has to be designed without any prior knowledge of materials or methods. To help advance Venus sampling technology, Honeybee Robotics in partnership with NASA JPL has been developing critical components that would make Venus sampling possible. To date, three types of motors (Switched Reluctance, Brushless DC, and Stepper), a Pulsed Injection Position Sensor (PIPS) for commutation and position control, and planetary gearboxes have been fabricated and tested at Venus Temperature and/or Venus Temperature and Pressure. This paper summarizes past work and presents the current state-of-art technology related to Venus sampling drill for the New Frontiers Venus lander proposal called In-situ Surface and Atmospheric Geochemical Explorer (VISAGE).

It is important to make sure such a mission concept would not bring any living microbes, which may possibly exist on Mars, back to Earth's environment. In order to ensure the isolation of Mars microbes from Earth's Atmosphere, a brazing sealing and sterilizing technique was proposed to break the Mars-to-Earth contamination path. Effectively, heating the brazing zone in high vacuum space and controlling the sample temperature for integrity are key challenges to the implementation of this technique. The break-the-chain procedures for container configurations, which are being considered, were simulated by multi-physics finite element models. Different heating methods including induction and resistive/radiation were evaluated. The temperature profiles of Martian samples in a proposed container structure were predicted. The results show that the sealing and sterilizing process can be controlled such that the samples temperature is maintained below the level that may cause damage, and that the brazing technique is a feasible approach to breaking the contamination path.

In order to ensure this does not happen, it would be necessary to "break the chain of contact (BTC)", where any material reaching Earth would have to be inside a container that is sealed with extremely high confidence. Therefore, it would be necessary to contain the acquired samples and destroy any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of their container while protecting the sample itself for further analysis. A novel synchronous separation, seaming, sealing and sterilization (S4) process for sample containerization and planetary protection has been conceived and demonstrated. A prototype double wall container with inner and outer shells and Earth clean interstitial space was used for this demonstration. In a potential future mission, the double wall container would be split into two halves and prepared on Earth, while the potential on-orbit execution would consist of inserting the sample into one of the halves and then mating to the other half and brazing. The use of brazing material that melts at temperatures higher than 500 degrees C would assure sterilization of the exposed areas since all carbon bonds are broken at this temperature. The process would be executed in two-steps, Step-1: the double wall container halves would be fabricated and brazed on Earth; and Step-2: the containerization and sterilization process would be executed on-orbit. To prevent potential jamming during the process of mating the two halves of the double wall container and the extraction of the brazed inner container, a cone-within-cone approach has been conceived and demonstrated. The results of this study will be described and discussed.

Compact piezoelectric resonance mass balance for sample verification and mass quantification and mixing	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 26-29, 2017	Portland, OR	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc, Fiberguide Ind, Frontiers Media		Piezoelectric; mass balance; resonance; flextensional; cantilever; ultrasonic mixing; portioning	RETURN MISSION; MODE	There is a need for sample verification and mass quantification of rock, soil and/or ice obtained by sample acquisition mechanisms on extraterrestrial bodies. For many scientific instruments information about the mass of the sample would aid in the interpretation of the data and help prevent the portioning system from overloading instrument ports. Additionally, on a potential sample return mission it is likely that a sample confirmation or mass determination requirement would be implemented before the spacecraft would be commanded to return to Earth or Lunar orbit. In an effort to meet these potential requirements, a piezoelectric resonance balance is being developed to measure a frequency change proportional to the sample mass change. In previous work(1) we developed a resonance balance which produced large non-linear frequency changes due to the addition of a large mass. In this study we have looked at a variety of resonator geometries in an effort to linearize the frequency shift with mass. In addition, we have investigated the use of oscillator/counter circuitry to track the frequency shift of the piezoelectric mass balance. In this new design the frequency shifts automatically when a mass is placed on the balance and the counter circuit calculates the frequency shift. This frequency is then converted to a mass using calibration tables determined previously. An additional feature we have implemented is the use of a high frequency thickness mode piezoelectric resonator to mix the sample and a reactant or solvent. This allows for measuring both sample and reagent prior to ingestion by the instrument. This paper will focus on the design requirements and how they are affected by the local gravity and acoustic properties of the sample. Designs which allow for easy loading and unloading of the balance will also be discussed.

We aim to give an efficient description of typical transition paths in the small temperature regime. We adopt a variational point of view and seek the best Gaussian approximation, with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence, of the non Gaussian distribution of the diffusion process. We interpret the mean of this Gaussian approximation as the "most likely path," and the covariance operator as a means to capture the typical fluctuations around this most likely path. We give an explicit expression for the Kullback Leibler divergence in terms of the mean and the covariance operator for a natural class of Gaussian approximations and show the existence of minimizers for the variational problem. Then the low temperature limit is studied via F-convergence of the associated variational problem. The limiting functional consists of two parts: The first part depends only on the mean and coincides with the F-limit of the rescaled Freidlin-Wentzell rate functional. The second part depends on both the mean and the covariance operator and is minimized if the dynamics are given by a time-inhomogenous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process found by linearization of the Langevin dynamics around the Freidlin-Wentzell minimizer.

For each condition, we produce a characterization in terms of well-founded descriptive-set-theoretic trees. Using these characterizations, we demonstrate that the sets given by these conditions are co-analytic and not Borel in the space of marked groups. We then adapt our techniques to show elementary amenable marked groups may be characterized by well-founded descriptive-set-theoretic trees, and therefore, elementary amenability is equivalent to a chain condition. Our characterization again implies the set of elementary amenable groups is co-analytic and non-Borel. As corollary, we obtain a new, non-constructive, proof of the existence of finitely generated amenable groups that are not elementary amenable.

However, there are two expected populations of high energy neutrinos: the astrophysical flux observed by IceCube (similar to 1 PeV) and the cosmogenic flux (similar to 10(17) eV or 100 PeV). Typical radio arrays employ a noise-riding trigger, which limits their minimum energy threshold based on the background noise temperature of the ice. Phased radio arrays could lower the energy threshold by combining the signals from several channels before triggering, thereby improving the signal-to-noise at the trigger level. Reducing the energy threshold would allow radio experiments to more e ffi ciently overlap with optical Cherenkov neutrino telescopes as well as for more e ffi cient searches for cosmogenic neutrinos. We discuss the proposed technique and prototypical phased arrays deployed in an anechoic chamber and at Greenland's Summit Station.

A comprehensive methodology for discovering semantic relationships among geospatial vocabularies using oceanographic data discovery as an example	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Query augmentation; semantic search; web mining; search history; click behavior; big data	BIG DATA; SIMILARITY; SEARCH	It is challenging to find relevant data for research and development purposes in the geospatial big data era. One long-standing problem in data discovery is locating, assimilating and utilizing the semantic context for a given query. Most research in the geospatial domain has approached this problem in one of two ways: building a domain-specific ontology manually or discovering automatically, semantic relationships using metadata and machine learning techniques. The former relies on rich expert knowledge but is static, costly and labor intensive, whereas the second is automatic and prone to noise. An emerging trend in information science takes advantage of large-scale user search histories, which are dynamic but subject to user-and crawler-generated noise. Leveraging the benefits of these three approaches and avoiding their weaknesses, a novel methodology is proposed to (1) discover vocabulary-based semantic relationships from user search histories and clickstreams, (2) refine the similarity calculation methods from existing ontologies and (3) integrate the results of ontology, metadata, user search history and clickstream analysis to better determine their semantic relationships. An accuracy assessment by domain experts for the similarity values indicates an 83% overall accuracy for the top 10 related terms over randomly selected sample queries. This research functions as an example for building vocabulary-based semantic relationships for different geographical domains to improve various aspects of data discovery, including the accuracy of the vocabulary relationships of commonly used search terms.

Theological investigation can help meet significant research goals in artificial intelligence by orienting the development of agent communication and moral reasoning toward a shared moral and spiritual development of human persons and intelligent agents. In particular, Josiah Royce's Loyalty-to-Loyalty initiates a moral stance within which humans and intelligent agents can develop constructive ethical frameworks and his semiotic philosophy of community can guide the development and functioning of an agent's interpretive processes and can model shared spiritual formation.

In order to achieve these efficiencies, two-dimensional doping methods are used to increase the UV sensitivity of back-illuminated Si sensors. Integrated filters are then deposited by a combination of Al evaporation and atomic layer deposition of dielectric spacer layers. At far UV wavelengths these filters require the use of non-absorbing dielectrics, and we have pursued the development of new atomic layer deposition processes for metal fluorides materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. The performance of the complete multilayer filters on Si photodiodes and CCD imaging sensors, and the design and fabrication challenges associated with this development are demonstrated. This includes the continued development of deep diffused silicon avalanche photodiodes designed to detect the fast 220 nm emission component of barium fluoride scintillation crystals, while optically rejecting a slower component at 300 nm.

However, to date, the sample thicknesses used in wavefront shaping experiments have been limited to only a few millimeters or several transport mean free paths. Here, by using a long-coherence-length laser and an optimized digital OPC system that efficiently delivers light power, we focused 532 nm light through tissue-mimicking phantoms up to 9.6 cm thick, as well as through ex vivo chicken breast tissue up to 2.5 cm thick.

The mission's primary objectives will be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. This single spacecraft solution with an L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength) radar has a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed, uses a reflector-feed system whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive ("SweepSAR") capability at both L-band and S-band. This design is in contrast to recent concepts towards large constellations of smaller radar satellites, and is driven by the science requirements for complete coverage over the 12-day repeat cycle, using repeat pass interferometry and polarimetry to measure deformation and surface properties. A single spacecraft with enough aperture, power, duty cycle, and downlink capacity was determined to be a more practical and implementable solution that multiple smaller spacecraft. The use of a single large aperture reflector for both the L- and S-band radars enables both to have comparable performance, leading to overall development and operational efficiencies.

The current software architecture used to process this data is the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), a powerful and modular platform that applies a combination of novel and legacy processing modules to many sources of SAR data. Until recently, this architecture could process most images in a reasonable amount of time; however in the case of the NISAR mission (where the daily influx as well as the size of the images themselves are significantly larger) the current architecture can take hours to process even a single image. This paper explores new efforts to use a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate one of the processing modules to achieve unprecedented runtimes with no loss in precision, potentially setting a new standard in radar processing in the world of "Big Data".

Longer wavelengths (S-Band and L-Band) are preferred because they do not decorrelate as quickly as shorter wavelengths. Rapid revisit (1-3 days) is preferred because it allows the study of these phenomena at the timescales at which they commonly occur. Global access on such timescales is also required. Vector surface deformation measurements, taken from more than one direction, are a desired feature. This paper describes the conceptual architecture of a longer wavelength, Smallsat SAR constellation of up to 12 satellites for rapid revisit surface deformation studies. The key to making such a constellation affordable is to lower launch costs, spacecraft costs, and instrument (SAR) costs. The first two objectives can be achieved using an ESPA-ring class, or Smallsat, spacecraft. The third objective requires a SAR instrument sized to fit the mass and volume constraints imposed by such a spacecraft. Current state-of-the-art in miniaturization of electronics means that the radar transmit, receive and data handling functions can easily be implemented in a compact, low mass solution. The most significant challenge in designing a SAR to fit the Smallsat paradigm is in the dimensions of the antenna. The antenna sizing problem is addressed by adopting a smaller antenna than allowed by conventional SAR design rules. The baseline antenna design is simple, requiring no electronic beam-steering or beam-forming capability. Both reflectarray and microstrip patch antenna solutions are considered. The antenna structure is dual-purpose, to limit the overall system mass, with solar panels on the backplane providing power for the radar and spacecraft. The proposed solution easily accommodates radar squint angles of +/- 30 degrees for repeat-pass interferometry measurements from multiple directions.

The resulting ionospheric distortion can be represented as attenuation and bulk delay, in addition to higher-order frequency dispersion effects. Baseline, uncorrected images are often unusable when the solar zenith angle is less than 90 degrees (day side). In this work, a radar autofocus algorithm is developed that estimates and inverts ionospheric distortion, producing a focused radargram of the ice deposit subsurface. A maximum likelihood approach is developed that incorporates simulated surface clutter returns for the current spacecraft position, based on the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) elevation model of the Martian surface. An ancillary product is a surface-only clutter simulation for each orbit, which is necessary to identify true subsurface features.

For this objective, the authors initially developed methods and obtained preliminary test results based on the use of ultrasonic pulse-echo transducers and enhanced signal-processing tool; however, the methodology needed further development in order to obtain measurements in turbulent dynamic flow conditions. To improve the reliability of measurements taken in turbulent flow conditions, an experimental system was developed using multiple transducers driven by a multiplexer, and a data acquisition module capable of operating in any flow conditions. The system consists of a simulation testbed, which allows testing the performance over a range of flow rates and water levels and to observe flow conditions and patterns, as well as measure actual water level, flow velocities, wave conditions, etc. In this paper, we present the development details that include description of the testbed for simulating the flow of condensed water, the multiple transducers arrangement, the signal processing method, and the test results of both steady state and turbulent flow.

By combining photoacoustic elastography with a stress sensor having known stress-strain behavior, QPAE can simultaneously measure strain and stress, from which Young's modulus is calculated. We first applied QPAE to quantify the Young's modulus of tissue-mimicking agar phantoms with different concentrations. The measured values fitted well with both the empirical expectations based on the agar concentrations and those measured in independent standard compression tests. We then demonstrated the feasibility of QPAE by measuring the Young's modulus of human skeletal muscle in vivo. The data showed a linear relationship between muscle stiffness and loading. The results proved that QPAE can noninvasively quantify the absolute elasticity of biological tissue, thus enabling longitudinal imaging of tissue elasticity. QPAE can be exploited for both preclinical biomechanics studies and clinical applications.

Linear-array-based photoacoustic tomography for label-free high-throughput detection and quantification of circulating melanoma tumor cell clusters	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		photoacoustic tomography; cancer metastasis; circulating tumor cell; cancer therapy	IN-VIVO; CANCER METASTASIS; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; MICROSCOPY; RESOLUTION; CAPTURE; SYSTEM	Circulating tumor cell (CTC) clusters arise from multicellular grouping in the primary tumor and elevate the metastatic potential by 23 to 50 fold compared to single CTCs. High throughout detection and quantification of CTC clusters is critical for understanding the tumor metastasis process and improving cancer therapy. In this work, we report a lineararray- based photoacoustic tomography (LA-PAT) system capable of label-free high-throughput CTC cluster detection and quantification in vivo. LA-PAT detects CTC clusters and quantifies the number of cells in them based on the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of photoacoustic signals. The feasibility of LA-PAT was first demonstrated by imaging CTC clusters ex vivo. LA-PAT detected CTC clusters in the blood-filled microtubes and computed the number of cells in the clusters. The size distribution of the CTC clusters measured by LA-PAT agreed well with that obtained by optical microscopy. We demonstrated the ability of LA-PAT to detect and quantify CTC clusters in vivo by imaging injected CTC clusters in rat tail veins. LA-PAT detected CTC clusters immediately after injection as well as when they were circulating in the rat bloodstreams. Similarly, the numbers of cells in the clusters were computed based on the CNRs of the photoacoustic signals. The data showed that larger CTC clusters disappear faster than the smaller ones. The results prove the potential of LA-PAT as a promising tool for both preclinical tumor metastasis studies and clinical cancer therapy evaluation.

Real-time photoacoustic flow cytography and photothermolysis of single circulating melanoma cells in vivo	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		Photoacoustic microscopy; flow cytography; circulating tumor cell; melanoma; laser therapy	TUMOR-CELLS; CHALLENGES	Metastasis is responsible for as many as 90% of cancer-related deaths, and the deadliest skin cancer, melanoma, has a high propensity for metastasis. Since hematogenous spread of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is cancer's main route of metastasis, detecting and destroying CTCs can impede metastasis and improve patients' prognoses. Extensive studies employing exogenous agents to detect tumor-specific biomarkers and guide therapeutics to CTCs have achieved promising results, but biosafety remains a critical concern. Taking another approach, physical detection and destruction of CTCs is a safer way to evaluate and reduce metastasis risks. Melanoma cells strongly express melanosomes, providing a striking absorption contrast with the blood background in the red to near-infrared spectrum. Exploiting this intrinsic optical absorption contrast of circulating melanoma cells, we coupled dual-wavelength photoacoustic flow cytography with a nanosecond-pulsed laser killing mechanism that specifically targets melanoma CTCs. We have successfully achieved in vivo label-free imaging of rare single CTCs and CTC clusters in mice. Further, the photoacoustic signal from a CTC immediately hardware-triggers a lethal pinpoint laser irradiation that lyses it on the spot in a thermally confined manner. Our technology can facilitate early inhibition of metastasis by clearing circulating tumor cells from vasculature.

Imaging Small-animal Whole-body Dynamics by Single-impulse Panoramic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		Single-impulse; whole-body imaging; small-animal imaging; photoacoustic computed tomography	MULTISPECTRAL OPTOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY; MICROSCOPY	Small animal whole-body imaging, providing physiological, pathological, and phenotypical insights into biological processes, is indispensable in preclinical research. With high spatiotemporal resolution and functional contrast, small animal imaging can visualize biological dynamics in vivo at whole-body scale, which can advance both fundamental biology and translational medicine. However, current non-optical imaging techniques lack either spatiotemporal resolution or functional contrasts, and pure optical imaging suffers from either shallow penetration (up to similar to 1 mm) or a poor resolution-to-depth ratio (similar to 1/ 3). Here, we present a standalone system, termed single-impulse panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography (SIP-PACT), which overcomes all the above limitations. Our technology, with unprecedented performance, is envisioned to complement existing modalities for imaging entire small animals. As an optical imaging modality, SIP-PACT captures the high molecular contrast of endogenous substances such as hemoglobin, melanin, and lipid, as well as exogenous biomarkers, at the whole animal scale with full-view fidelity. Unlike other optical imaging methods, SIP-PACT sees through similar to 5 cm of tissue in vivo, and acquires cross-sectional images with an in-plane resolution of similar to 100 mu m. Such capabilities allow us to image, for the first time, mouse wholebody dynamics in real time with clear sub-organ anatomical and functional details and without motion artifacts. SIPPACT can capture transients of whole-body oxygen saturation and pulse wave propagation in vivo without labeling. In sum, we expect widespread applications of SIP-PACT as a whole-body imaging tool for small animals in fundamental biology, pharmacology, pathology, oncology, and other areas.

QPI is often performed by optical interferometry, where two coherent beams of light are used to produce interference patterns at a detector plane. Many algorithms exist to calculate the phase of the incident light from these recorded interference patterns as well as enhance their quality by various de-noising methods. Many of these de-noising algorithms, however, corrupt the quantitative aspect of the measurement, resulting in phase contrast images. Among these phase calculation techniques and de-noising algorithms, none approach the optimization of phase measurements by theoretically addressing the various sources of error in its measurement, as well as how these errors propagate to the phase calculations. In this work, we investigate the various sources of error in the measurements required for QPI, as well as theoretically derive the influence of each source of error on the overall phase calculation for three common phase calculation techniques: the four bucket/step method, three bucket/step method, and the Carre method. The noise characteristics of each of these techniques are discussed and compared using error parameters of a readily available CCD sensor array. Additionally, experimental analysis is conducted on interferograms to investigate the influence of speckle noise on the phase measurements of the three algorithms discussed.

We observed WASP-103b during secondary eclipse using two visits of the Hubble Space Telescope with the G141 grism on Wide Field Camera 3 in spatial scan mode. We generated secondary eclipse light curves of the planet in both blended white-light and spectrally binned wavechannels from 1.1 to 1.7 mu m and corrected the light curves for flux contamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics and secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that the near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed near-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope toward the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of T-B = 2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is indistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically isothermal system, i. e., pseudo-isothermal. A solar-metallicity profile with a thermal inversion layer at 10(-2) bar fits the spectrum of WASP-103b with high confidence, as do an isothermal profile with solar metallicity and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O > 1. The data rule out a monotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with solar composition, and we rule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as unphysical for this system. The pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer just above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the upper atmosphere. Transmission spectra at optical wavelengths would allow us to better distinguish between potential atmospheric models.	[Cartier, Kimberly M.

Researchers use them to establish the extragalactic distance scale, to underpin estimates of the Hubble constant, and to study peculiar velocities induced by gravitational attractions that perturb the motions of galaxies with respect to the "Hubble flow" of universal expansion. In 2006 the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) began making available a comprehensive compilation of redshift-independent extragalactic distance estimates. A decade later, this compendium of distances (NED-D) now contains more than 100,000 individual estimates based on primary and secondary indicators, available for more than 28,000 galaxies, and compiled from over 2000 references in the refereed astronomical literature. This paper describes the methodology, content, and use of NED-D, and addresses challenges to be overcome in compiling such distances. Currently, 75 different distance indicators are in use. We include a figure that facilitates comparison of the indicators with significant numbers of estimates in terms of the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum distances spanned. Brief descriptions of the indicators, including examples of their use in the database, are given in an appendix.

The chemical compositions and temperatures of the jet and that of the fluid in the chamber are initially prescribed. The governing equations consist of the conservation equations for mass, momentum, species and energy, and are complemented by a real-gas equation of state. The fluxes of species and heat are written in the framework of fluctuation-dissipation theory and include Soret and Dufour effects. For more than two species, the full mass diffusion and thermal diffusion matrices are computed using high-pressure mixing rules which utilize as building blocks the corresponding binary diffusion coefficients. The mixture viscosity and thermal conductivity are computed using standard mixing rules and corresponding states theory. To evaluate the physical model and numerical method, LES is employed first to simulate a supercritical N-2 jet injected into N-2. Time averaged results show reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Then, DNS is conducted to study the spatial evolution of a supercritical N-2 jet injected into CO2. Time averaged results are used to compute the length of the potential core and the species diffusion characteristics. Spectral analysis is then applied on a time series data obtained at several axial locations and a dominant frequency is observed inside the potential core.

A Comparative Study of Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities in 2D and 3D in Tantalum	SHOCK COMPRESSION OF CONDENSED MATTER - 2015	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Biennial American-Physical-Society (APS) Conference on Shock Compression of Condensed Matter (SCCM)	JUN 14-19, 2015	Tampa, FL	Amer Phys Soc, DTRA, AFOSR, ONR, USF				Driving a shock wave through the interface between two materials with different densities can result in the Richtmyer-Meshkov or Rayleigh-Taylor instability and initial perturbations at the interface will grow. If the shock wave is sufficiently strong, the instability will lead to plastic flow at the interface. Material strength will reduce the amount of plastic flow and suppress growth. While such instabilities have been investigated in 2D, no studies of this phenomena have been performed in 3D on materials with strength. Initial perturbations to seed the hydrodynamic instability were coined into tantalum recovery targets. Two types of perturbations were used, two dimensional (2D) perturbations (hill and valley) and three-dimensional (3D) perturbations (egg crate pattern). The targets were subjected to dynamic loading using the Janus laser at the Jupiter Laser Facility. Shock pressures ranged from 50 GPa up to 150 GPa and were calibrated using VISAR drive targets.

We compare the modeled vertical distribution of clouds against the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosols Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) using a simulator approach. Although the overall pattern of modeled zonal cloud frequency profiles is relatively good (r=0.92 for the multi-model mean), we show two main systematic biases in the cloud frequency profiles: a positive bias above 7km (up to 10%), particularly in the tropics; and a negative bias below 3km (up to -10%), which reaches a maximum over the stratocumulus cloud regions. Using radiative heating rate profiles calculated with constraints from CloudSat, CALIPSO and other satellite observations, we show that the excess of clouds in the upper troposphere (> 7km) results in excess infrared and solar heating in the vicinity of the clouds as well as more infrared heating for the entire column below the cloud. On the other hand, the lack of clouds in the lower troposphere reduces the infrared cooling near the missing cloud levels and increases the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor below. The global radiative heating rate between 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N is too warm in the models (-0.81K/day vs. -1.01K/day). The representation of clouds in GCMs remains challenging, but reducing the cloud biases would lead to an improvement of the heating rate profiles, which in turn would help in improving other aspects of models' simulations such as the dynamics, cloud feedbacks and surface-atmosphere interactions.

Cloud Effects on Atmospheric Solar Absorption in Light of Most Recent Surface and Satellite Measurements	RADIATION PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	International Radiation Symposium (IRC/IAMAS) - Radiation Processes in the Atmosphere and Ocean	APR 16-22, 2016	Univ Auckland, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	Univ Auckland, Dept Phys, Kipp & Zonen, EKO Instruments Europe B V	Univ Auckland		RADIATION	At 36 locations worldwide, we estimate the cloud radiative effect (CREatm) on atmospheric solar absorption (ASR(atm)) by combining ground-based measurements of surface solar radiation (SSR) with collocated satellite-derived surface albedo and top-of-atmosphere net irradiance under both all-sky and clear-sky conditions. To derive continuous clear-sky SSR from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in-situ measurements of global and diffuse SSR, we make use of the Long and Ackerman (2000) algorithm that identifies clear-sky measurements and empirically fits diurnal clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. The 11-year average (2000-2010) CREatm (all-sky minus clear-sky) is overall positive at around + 11 Wm(-2) using direct measurements form ground and space, and at 4 Wm(-2) in the CERES EBAF dataset. This discrepancy arises from a potential overestimation in clear-sky absorption by the satellite product or underestimation by the combined BSRN/CERES dataset. The forcing ratio R shows that clouds enhance ASRatm most distinctly at desert-like locations that overall experience little occurrence of clouds. This relationship is captured by both the combined dataset and CERES EBAF.

Periodicity in a photonic crystal structure enables engineering of the density of states to improve spontaneous light emission according to Fermi's golden rule. Unlike planar thin films, which suffer significantly from total internal reflection, a 3D architectured structure is distributed in space with many non-flat interfaces, which facilitates a substantial enhancement in light extraction. We demonstrate the fabrication of 3D nano-architectures with octahedron geometry that utilize luminescing silicon nanocrystals as active media with an aluminum cathode and indium tin oxide anode towards the realization of a 3D light emitting device. The developed fabrication procedure allows charge to pass through the nanolattice between two contacts for electroluminescence. These initial fabrication efforts suggest that 3D nano-architected devices are realizable and can reach greater efficiencies than planar devices.

Assessing Contact Graph Routing Performance and Reliability in Distributed Satellite Constellations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER NETWORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TOLERANT NETWORKING; SYSTEMS; FAILURE; SPACE; DTN	Existing Internet protocols assume persistent end-to-end connectivity, which cannot be guaranteed in disruptive and high-latency space environments. To operate over these challenging networks, a store-carry-and-forward communication architecture called Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) has been proposed. This work provides the first examination of the performance and robustness of ContactGraph Routing (CGR) algorithm, the state-of-the-art routing scheme for space-basedDTNs. To this end, after a thorough description of CGR, two appealing satellite constellations are proposed and evaluated by means of simulations. Indeed, the DtnSim simulator is introduced as another relevant contribution of this work. Results enabled the authors to identify existing CGR weaknesses and enhancement opportunities.	[Fraire, J.

First Steps Towards Translating HZD Control of Bipedal Robots to Decentralized Control of Exoskeletons	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Exoskeletons; control design; robot control	WALKING	This paper presents preliminary results toward translating gait and control design for bipedal robots to decentralized control of an exoskeleton aimed at restoring mobility to patients with lower limb paralysis, without the need for crutches. A mathematical hybrid dynamical model of the human-exoskeleton system is developed and a library of dynamically feasible periodic walking gaits for different walking speeds is found through nonlinear constrained optimization using the full-order dynamical system. These walking gaits are stabilized using a centralized (i.e., full-state information) hybrid zero dynamics-based controller, which is then decentralized (i.e., control actions use partial state information) so as to be implementable on the exoskeleton subsystem. A control architecture is then developed so as to allow the user to actively control the exoskeleton speed through his/her upper body posture. Numerical simulations are carried out to compare the two controllers. It is found that the proposed decentralized controller not only preserves the periodic walking gaits but also inherits the robustness to perturbations present in the centralized controller. Moreover, the proposed velocity regulation scheme is able to reach a steady state and track desired walking speeds under both, centralized, and decentralized schemes.

We focus on the case of electricity markets and model the market as a game between a system operator (market maker) and generators at different nodes of the network. Generators submit quantity bids and the system operator balances demand and supply over the network subject to transmission constraints. We compare the efficiency of a networked Stackelberg equilibrium, where generators anticipate the market clearing actions of the market maker, with a networked Cournot equilibrium, where they do not. We show that networked Cournot equilibria always exists but its efficiency loss is unbounded in the worst case.

Most 3D sensors produce dense depth maps, which are subject to imperfections due to various environmental factors. Temporal fusion of depth maps is crucial to overcome those. Temporal fusion is traditionally done in 3D space with voxel data structures, but it can be approached by temporal fusion in image space, with potential benefits in reduced memory and computational cost for applications like reactive collision avoidance for micro air vehicles. In this paper, we present an efficient Gaussian Mixture Models based depth map fusion approach, introducing an online update scheme for dense representations. The environment is modeled from an ego-centric point of view, where each pixel is represented by a mixture of Gaussian inverse-depth models. Consecutive frames are related to each other by transformations obtained from visual odometry. This approach achieves better accuracy than alternative image space depth map fusion techniques at lower computational cost.

This antenna is designed for telecommunication and is compatible with the NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) at Ka-band frequencies (uplink: 34.2-34.7 GHz and downlink: 31.8-32.3 GHz). Detailed simulations, considering all aspects of the circularly-polarized mesh deployable reflector antenna including the feed, show that 42.0-dBi gain and 57% aperture efficiency is achievable at 32GHz. The mechanical deployment mechanism is thoroughly described as it is a critical component of the deployable CubeSat antenna.

The purpose is to detect the weak THz radiation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by up-converting the signal into the optical domain via the nonlinearity of the medium. Such high-sensitivity receiver has theoretically shown capabilities towards photon counting at room temperature, however, it is critical to efficiently couple the THz radiation into the resonator. Therefore, by using the Schelkunoff-Waterman method (the so called T-matrix method) we perform an analytical evaluation of two different free-space coupling techniques: a free-space Gaussian beam, and a Gaussian beam incident in a silicon lens under total internal reflection. By comparing the excited modes in the resonator, the optimal parameters for each case are given.

This on-road FFCO2 emissions dataset for LA (from Hestia version 1.0), based on actual traffic volume, provides emissions per vehicle kilometer travelled (VKT)-an important metric for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. We further identify emissions hotpots that can help state and local policy makers plan the most effective GHG reduction strategies. On-road vehicle traffic accounts for half of the FFCO2 emissions in LA, of which 41% is from arterials (intermediate road type). Arterials also have the largest C emissions intensity-FFCO2 per VKT-possibly from high traffic congestion and fleet composition. Non-interstate emissions hotspots (> 419 tC lane-km(-1)) are equally dominated by arterials and collectors (the lowest road type) in terms of FFCO2 emissions though collectors have a higher VKT. These hotspots occur in densely populated areas and developed landuse classes, largely in LA (67%) and Orange (18%) counties, and provide specific targets for emissions reduction efforts. The estimated uncertainties for interstate, arterial and collector emissions per road length are +/- 2.1, +/- 0.5 and +/- 18.0%, respectively. Our overall estimates compare reasonably well with other products, DARTE and FIVE but with substantial differences in spatial distribution. The method for developing this dataset is easily replicable in other urban landscapes, and represents a powerful tool for carbon cycle science and regional policy makers.

Each element is placed in the gap of a balanced antenna. All the elements conform a 2D rectangular array. For avoiding issues related to having out-of-focus sources when using one electrically large silicon lens, two different strategies are considered: increasing the density of elements by using a compact design and using an array of dielectric rod waveguide antennas instead of the lens. Experimental considerations are also provided for two prototypes manufactured in the 1550 nm window. Measured power level will be shown at the conference.

B	Ramesham, R			IEEE	Ramesham, Rajeshuni			THERMAL CYCLING TESTING TO FAILURE OF A CERAMIC COLUMN GRID ARRAY PACKAGE FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS	2017 PAN PACIFIC MICROELECTRONICS SYMPOSIUM (PAN PACIFIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	Pan Pacific Microelectronics Symposium (Pan Pacific)	FEB 06-09, 2017	Kauuai, HI			Ceramic column grid array; CCGA 1752 (CN version) qualification; CCGA reliability; solder-joint failures; thermal cycling	RELIABILITY; CCGA	Ceramic column grid array (CCGA) packages have been used increasingly in logic and microprocessor functions, telecommunications, flight avionics boards, payload electronics boards, engineering navigational and science cameras, electronic assemblies, and other applications, because of their inherent advantages such as high electrical interconnect density, very good thermal and electrical performance, and compatibility with standard surface-mount technology (SMT) packaging assembly processes. Because these advanced electronic packages tend to have less solder-joint strain-relief than do leaded flat-pack electronic packages, the reliability of CCGA packages in challenging thermal environments is a very important consideration for their short-and long-term use in JPL-NASA space missions. In this study, we assembled daisy chains of polyimide printed wiring boards from CCGA-interconnect packages, inspected the boards nondestructively, and then subjected them to thermal cycling to assess their reliability in thermal environments from +125 degrees C to -40 degrees C +/- 25 degrees C. The test hardware consists of a CCGA 1752 package (CN version). The package was divided into four daisy-chained sections that were electrically monitored for their continuity during thermal cycling. The CCGA 1752 package is roughly 45 mm x 45 mm with a 42-mm x 42-mm array of 80%/20% Pb/Sn columns on a 1.00-mm pitch. The resistance of the daisy-chained CCGA interconnects was continuously monitored during thermal cycling in a gaseous nitrogen environment. Electrical continuity resistance measurements as a function of thermal cycling are reported here; tests to date have shown significant change to an open circuit in daisy-chain resistance as a function of thermal cycling. The change in interconnect resistance becomes increasingly noticeable with increasing number of thermal cycles. This paper describes the experimental thermal-cycling test results of CCGA 1752 package reliability testing under an extremely wide temperature range. The first failure was observed at 1479th thermal cycle. We report the thermalcycle reliability test data for 2500 thermal cycles.

A consequence of the collar lemma is that if two closed curves A and B on a closed orientable hyperbolizable surface intersect each other, then there is an explicit lower bound for the length of A in terms of the length of B, which holds for every hyperbolic structure on the surface. In this article, we prove an analog of the classical collar lemma in the setting of Hitchin representations.

However, the high cost of the video wall might make it unavailable when needed. The PiWall is a low-cost alternative for a traditional video wall. The PiWall project was built to meet very specific requirements, and therefore it has very limited applications. The most recognizable problem on the current system is that it needs to restart every time when a change on content being displayed is needed. Developing the PiWall system will widen the scope of its applications. The path to developing an enhanced PiWall system starts by examining the existing PiWall system and understanding its current limitations. Then defining the new requirements. After that proposing the design of the system. In addition, analyzing the source code and understanding how the system works. The next step is building the current system, and then gradually adding features and improvements. At the end, it is expected to have an improved PiWall system that has a variety of useful applications.

Genetic Analysis of Histamine Signaling in Larval Zebrafish Sleep	ENEURO			English	Article						genetics; histamine; hypocretin; sleep; wake	KNOCK-OUT MICE; HISTIDINE-DECARBOXYLASE; TUBEROMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; H-3 RECEPTORS; OREXIN-A; BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERIZATION; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; THERAPEUTIC TARGET	Pharmacological studies in mammals and zebrafish suggest that histamine plays an important role in promoting arousal. However, genetic studies using rodents with disrupted histamine synthesis or signaling have revealed only subtle or no sleep/wake phenotypes. Studies of histamine function in mammalian arousal are complicated by its production in cells of the immune system and its roles in humoral and cellular immunity, which can have profound effects on sleep/wake states. To avoid this potential confound, we used genetics to explore the role of histamine in regulating sleep in zebrafish, a diurnal vertebrate in which histamine production is restricted to neurons in the brain. Similar to rodent genetic studies, we found that zebrafish that lack histamine due to mutation of histidine decarboxylase (hdc) exhibit largely normal sleep/wake behaviors. Zebrafish containing predicted null mutations in several histamine receptors also lack robust sleep/wake phenotypes, although we are unable to verify that these mutants are completely nonfunctional. Consistent with some rodent studies, we found that arousal induced by overexpression of the neuropeptide hypocretin (Hcrt) or by stimulation of hcrt- expressing neurons is not blocked in hdc or hrh1 mutants. We also found that the number of hcrt- expressing or histaminergic neurons is unaffected in animals that lack histamine or Hcrt signaling, respectively. Thus, while acute pharmacological manipulation of histamine signaling has been shown to have profound effects on zebrafish and mammalian sleep, our results suggest that chronic loss of histamine signaling due to genetic mutations has only subtle effects on sleep in zebrafish, similar to rodents.

How such diverse functions are mediated by a single hormonal system is not well understood. Different functions of oxytocin could be mediated by distinct cell groups, yet it is currently unknown whether different oxytocinergic cell types exist that specifically mediate peripheral neuroendocrine or various central neuromodulatory processes via dedicated pathways. Using the Brainbow technique to map the morphology and projections of individual oxytocinergic cells in the larval zebrafish brain, we report here the existence of two main types of oxytocinergic cells: those that innervate the pituitary and those that innervate diverse brain regions. Similar to the situation in the adult rat and the adult midshipman, but in contrast to the situation in the adult trout, these two cell types are mutually exclusive and can be distinguished based on morphological and anatomical criteria. Further, our results reveal that complex oxytocinergic innervation patterns are already established in the larval zebrafish brain.

A compact CMOS down-converter is designed which operates from 160 to 188 GHz and includes a sub-harmonically pumped I/Q resistive mixer, two IF amplifiers and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with LO buffer. A measured down-conversion gain of +2.6 dB is achieved with a total dc power consumption of 152 mW using the nominal supply of +1.2 V. The measurement results show a 3 dB IF bandwidth from 1 to 5 GHz and the VCO tuning range is from 85 to 89 GHz. The designed CMOS MMIC down-converter including the probing pads occupies a silicon area of 0.575 mm(2).	[Parveg, Dristy; Varonen, Mikko; Tikka, Tero; Halonen, Kari A.

The voltage and power outputs over 3.7 V-DC and 1 mW necessary for charging lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries were accomplished using a 3D-printed packaging platform whose physical design and mechanical properties maximized the vibration transfer and effectively combined 10 or more individual energy harvesters into a compact unified stack. The custom-designed LC-resonant EH circuit efficiently converted raw AC output into DC. Using our EH device, we have successfully charged 100-mAh LiPo battery and operated a portable 2x16 LCD display (requiring 2.8 V, 10 mA).

By applying sinusoidal loading on PPXC films at different temperatures and frequencies, the complex modulus and glass transition temperature (Tg) of the PPXC were obtained. The predicted Tg determined from the temperature-dependent density change in the MD model is consistent with the results in our measurements and previous works.

Powered by an onboard power supply, the microthruster achieves speeds of up to 5.24 cm/s (131 body-lengths/s) while consuming less than 252 nW/(Bodylength/s). It is 31% faster and similar to 10(3) times more energy-efficient than prior designs. Including the onboard Al-air battery consisting of an Al anode and an Au cathode, the microthruster measures 1400 mu m (H) x 1400 mu m (W) x 400 mu m (L) in dimension and contains a 1000 mu m-wide, 300 mu m-long cylindrical thruster channel in the center.

For the first time, we design and fabricate resonators of the same lateral dimensions but with different stacking layers, namely, Si, AlN-on-Si, and Al-on-AlN-on-Si. With both optical and electrical readout techniques, we measure the fundamental radial-extensional mode and its Q values and compare the observed and simulated energy dissipation. For the same device geometry, the results show that the bare Si device has the highest Q (11,304). Adding an AlN layer leads to a reduction in Q for the AlN-on-Si device by a factor of similar to 1.46 compared to bare Si device. Top layer metallization further compromises the Q by a factor of similar to 1.85. Modeling of the dissipation processes suggests that neither the thermoelastic damping (TED) nor the anchor loss is the limiting loss factor. A piezoelectric-specific loss mechanism known as charge redistribution loss and interface loss are both possible limiting mechanisms.

Traditional studies focused on optimizing the throughput of the system by proposing elaborate schemes able to reach the network capacity. With the shift toward distributed computing on mobile devices, performance and complexity become both critical factors that affect the efficiency of a coding strategy. Instantly decodable network coding presents itself as a new paradigm in network coding that trades off these two aspects. This paper review instantly decodable network coding schemes by identifying, categorizing, and evaluating various algorithms proposed in the literature. The first part of the manuscript investigates the conventional centralized systems, in which all decisions are carried out by a central unit, e.g., a base-station. In particular, two successful approaches known as the strict and generalized instantly decodable network are compared in terms of reliability, performance, complexity, and packet selection methodology. The second part considers the use of instantly decodable codes in a device-to-device communication network, in which devices speed up the recovery of the missing packets by exchanging network coded packets. Although the performance improvements are directly proportional to the computational complexity increases, numerous successful schemes from both the performance and complexity viewpoints are identified.

We evaluate the performance of the ROMIAC using a combination of finite element modeling and experimental validation of two nearly identical instruments using tetra-alkyl ammonium halide mass standards and sodium chloride particles. Mobility and efficiency calibrations were performed over a wide range of particle diameters and flow rates to characterize ROMIAC performance under the range of anticipated operating conditions. The ROMIAC performs as designed, though performance deviates from that predicted using simplistic models of the instrument. The underlying causes of this non-ideal behavior are found through finite element simulations that predict the performance of the ROMIAC with greater accuracy than the simplistic models. It is concluded that analytical performance models based on idealized geometries, flows, and fields should not be relied on to make accurate a priori predictions about instrumental behavior if the actual geometry or fields deviate from the ideal assumptions. However, if such deviations are accurately captured, finite element simulations have the potential to predict instrumental performance. The present prototype of the ROMIAC maintains its resolution over nearly three orders of magnitude in particle mobility, obtaining sub-20 nm particle size distributions in a compact package with relatively low flow rate operation requirements.(c) 2017 American Association for Aerosol Research	[Mui, Wilton; Mai, Huajun; Seinfeld, John H.; Flagan, Richard C.] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Downard, Andrew J.; Seinfeld, John H.; Flagan, Richard C.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA	Flagan, RC (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.; Flagan, RC (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.	flagan@caltech.edu			National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1236909]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1144469]; Jacobs Institute for Molecular Engineering for Medicine	This research was supported by National Science Foundation Grant No. CBET-1236909 and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-1144469 (W.M.), and the Jacobs Institute for Molecular Engineering for Medicine (R.C.F. and A.J.D.).		37	5	5	1	9	TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA	0278-6826	1521-7388		AEROSOL SCI TECH	Aerosol Sci.

Novel positioning sensor with real-time feedback for improved postoperative positioning: pilot study in control subjects	CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						retinal detachment; pneumatic retinopexy; intraocular gas; device; postoperative positioning; vitrectomy; macular hole	MACULAR HOLE SURGERY	Introduction: Repair of retinal detachment frequently requires use of intraocular gas. Patients are instructed to position themselves postoperatively to appose the intraocular bubble to the retinal break(s). We developed a novel wearable wireless positioning sensor, which provides real-time audiovisual feedback on the accuracy of positioning. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers wore the wireless sensor for 3 hours while instructed to maintain their head tilted toward the 2 o'clock meridian with no audiovisual feedback. Positioning accuracy was recorded. The subjects repeated the experiment for 3 hours with the audiovisual feedback enabled. Results: With no audiovisual feedback, the percentage of time greater than 10 degrees out of position varied from 8.9% to 93.9%. With audiovisual feedback enabled, these percentages ranged from 9.4% to 65%. Three subjects showed significant improvement in their time out of position (P<0.01, Fisher's exact test). Four subjects demonstrated a nonsignificant improvement, and one subject had a significant increase in time out of position with feedback (P<0.01). When pooled, all subjects demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in degrees out of position (P<0.001, Wilcoxon test) and a statistically significant improvement in total time out of position (P<0.001). Conclusion: The novel positioning sensor showed improved positioning compliance in half of the healthy volunteers during our short pilot study. Other subjects derived little benefit from the feedback. The causes for this observation are unclear. However, given the significant improvement as a group, this new technology could be beneficial to patients who struggle with postoperative positioning.

We show that for fixed k, the maximum number of edges in a K-k,K-k-free semi-algebraic bipartite graph G = (P, Q E) in R-2 with vertical bar P vertical bar = m and vertical bar Q vertical bar = n is at most O ((mn)(2/3) + m + n), and this bound is tight. In dimensions d >= 3, we show that all such semi-algebraic graphs have at most C((mn)(d/(d+1)+epsilon) + m + n) edges, where epsilon is an arbitrarily small constant and C = C(d, k, t, epsilon). This result is a far-reaching generalization of the classical Szemeredi-Trotter incidence theorem. The proof combines tools from several fields: VC-dimension and shatter functions, polynomial partitioning, and Hilbert polynomials. We also present various applications of our theorem, for example, a general point-variety incidence bound in R-d, an improved bound for a d-dimensional variant of the Erdos unit distances problem, and more.

J	Bruno, OP; Cubillos, M				Bruno, Oscar P.; Cubillos, Max			ON THE QUASI-UNCONDITIONAL STABILITY OF BDF-ADI SOLVERS FOR THE COMPRESSIBLE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS AND RELATED LINEAR PROBLEMS	SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Navier-Stokes; quasi-unconditional stability; high-order; ADI; BDF; unconditional stability	HIGHER-ORDER; SCHEME	The companion paper "Higher-order in time quasi-unconditionally stable ADI solvers for the compressible Navier Stokes equations in 2D and 3D curvilinear domains," which is referred to as Part I in what follows, introduces ADI (alternating direction implicit) solvers of higher orders of temporal accuracy (orders s = 2 to 6) for the compressible Navier Stokes equations in two-and three-dimensional space. The proposed methodology employs the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) together with a quasilinear-like formulation, high-order extrapolation for nonlinear components, and the Douglas Gunn splitting. A variety of numerical results presented in Part I demonstrate in practice the theoretical convergence rates enjoyed by these algorithms, as well as their excellent accuracy and stability properties for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. In particular, the proposed schemes enjoy a certain property of "quasi-unconditional stability": for small enough (problem dependent) fixed values of the timestep Delta t, these algorithms are stable for arbitrarily fine spatial discretizations. The present contribution presents a mathematical basis for the observed performance of these algorithms. Short of providing stability theorems for the full Navier Stokes BDF-ADI solvers, this paper puts forth a number of stability proofs for BDF-ADI schemes as well as some related unsplit BDF schemes for a variety of related linear model problems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. These include proofs of quasi-unconditional stability for unsplit BDF schemes of orders 2 <= s <= 6, and even a proof of a form of unconditional stability for two-dimensional BDF-ADI schemes of order 2 for both convection and diffusion problems. Additionally, a set of numerical tests presented in this paper for the compressible Navier Stokes equation indicate that quasi-unconditional stability carries over to the fully nonlinear context.

The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film enhanced greatly from 0.6S/cm to 736S/cm after 1.25% of p-toluenesulfonic acid solution was doped into the PEDOT:PSS dispersion. The post-treatment using dimethyl sulfoxide further improved the conductivity to 1549S/cm. We found that the electro-optical properties of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) cells fabricated by the highly conductive PEDOT:PSS films were comparable to those constructed by ITO. This work reveals that highly conductive PEDOT:PSS film is a suitable material for manufacturing ITO-free liquid crystal devices.

Makarov's principle for the Bloch unit ball	SBORNIK MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Bloch space; law of the iterated logarithm; integral means spectrum; Bergman projection	ITERATED LOGARITHM; LAW; DIMENSION	Makarov's principle relates three characteristics of Bloch functions that resemble the variance of a Gaussian: asymptotic variance, the constant in Makarov's law of iterated logarithm and the second derivative of the integral means spectrum at the origin. While these quantities need not be equal in general, we show that the universal bounds agree if we take the supremum over the Bloch unit ball. For the supremum (of either of these quantities), we give the estimate Sigma(2)(B) < min(0.9, Sigma(2)), where Sigma(2) is the analogous quantity associated to the unit ball in the L-infinity norm on the Bloch space. This improves on the upper bound in Pommerenke's estimate 0.685(2) < Sigma(2)(B) <= 1.	[Ivrii, O. V.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kayumov, I.

In parallel, there are also numerous studies pointing to the frontal alpha band asymmetry as a psychophysiological marker of depression. In this study, we explored the role of frontal alpha asymmetry as a potential factor explaining the cognitive problems accompanying depression. Twenty-six depressed and 26 control participants completed a reasoning task and underwent 5 minutes of electroencephalography recording. In line with the previous studies, depressed people showed difficulties with reasoning but we did not observe the relationship between frontal asymmetry in the alpha band and depression. However, we found that in the depressed group the frontal alpha asymmetry index was characterised by larger variance than in the control group, and it was also a strong predictor of cognitive functioning exclusively in the depressed group. Our results point to the disruption of a psychophysiological balance, reflected in changed frontal alpha asymmetry (into more left-sided frontal asymmetry in the alpha band, reflecting more right-sided cortical activity) as a possible brain correlate of cognitive disturbances present in depressive disorders.

Close Binary Progenitors and Ejected Companions of Thermonuclear Supernovae	20TH EUROPEAN WHITE DWARF WORKSHOP	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	20th European Workshop on White Dwarfs (EuroWD)	JUL 25-29, 2016	Univ Warwick, Coventry, ENGLAND	European Res Council	Univ Warwick		STAR	Hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are evolved core helium-burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes, which can be formed by common envelope ejection. Close sdB binaries with massive white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). We discovered such a progenitor candidate as well as a candidate for a surviving companion star, which escapes from the Galaxy. More candidates for both types of objects have been found by cross-matching known sdB stars with proper motion and light curve catalogues. We found 72 sdO/B candidates with high Galactic restframe velocities, 12 of them might be unbound to our Galaxy. Furthermore, we discovered the second-most compact sdB+WD binary known. However, due to the low mass of the WD companion, it is unlikely to be a SN Ia progenitor.

Engineering research and development can benefit greatly by looking into nature and finding engineering solutions by learning from animals' evolution and biological systems. Another relevant factor in the present context is highlighted by the statement of the Nobel laureate Richard Smalley: "Energy is the single most important problem facing humanity today.". This paper focuses on how the research and education in the area of Dynamic Systems can be geared towards these two considerations. In particular, recent advances in self-powered dynamic systems and bio-inspired dynamic systems are highlighted. Self-powered dynamic systems benefit by capturing wasted energy in a dynamic system and converting it into useful energy in the mode of a regenerative system, possibly in conjunction with renewable energies. Examples of solar-powered vehicles, regenerative vibration control, and energy harvesting are presented in the paper. Particularly, development of solar-powered quadrotor, octocopter, and tricopter airships are presented, a self-powered vibration control of a mass-spring system using electromagnetic actuators/generators, and piezoelectric flutter energy harvesting using bi-stable material are discussed. As examples of bio-inspired dynamic systems, flapping wing flying robots, vertical axis wind turbines inspired by fish schooling, propulsion inspired by jellyfish, and Psi Intelligent Control are given. In particular, various design and developments of bird-inspired and insect-inspired flapping wings with the piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuation mechanisms, a scaled vertical axis wind turbine farm consist of 4 turbines and the corresponding wind tunnel testing, jellyfish-inspired pulsing jet and experimenting the increase in efficiency of energy consumption, and a multi-agent/robotic based predictive control scheme inspired by Psi precognition (event or state not yet experienced). Examples of student projects and research carried out at Brunel University and the experimental rigs built (in all the mentioned areas) are discussed, as an integrated research and educational activity. For the analysis and understanding of the behavior of self-powered and bio-inspired systems, Optimal Uncertainty Quantification (OUQ) is used. OUQ establishes a unified analysis framework in obtaining optimized solutions of the dynamic systems responses, which takes into account uncertainties and incomplete information in the simulation of these systems.

One approach to achieving this capability are high-heat-flux reflux boiling systems that take advantage of high heat transfer boiling and condensation mechanisms. Advanced solar systems are also intermittent by their nature and their electrical generation is often out-of phase with electric utility power demand, and their required power system cycling reduces efficiency, performance (dispatchability), lifetime, and reliability. High temperature thermal energy storage (TES) at 300-600 degrees C enables these reflux boiling systems to simultaneously store thermal energy internally to increase the energy dispatchability of the associated solar system, as this can increase the power generation profile by several hours (up to 6-10 hours) per day. Many TES phase change materials (PCM's) exist including KNO3, NaNO3, LiBr/KBr, MgCl2/NaCl/KCl, Zn/Mg, and CuCl/NaCl, which have various operating melting points and different latent heats of fusion. Common, cost effective TES PCM's are FeCl2/NaCl/KCl mixtures, whose phase change temperature can be varied and controlled by simple composition adjustments. This paper presents and discusses unique "temperature-staged" thermal energy storage configurations using these TES materials and analysis of such systems integrated into high-heat-flux reflux boiling systems. In this specific application, the TES materials are designed to operate at staged temperatures surrounding an operating design point near 350 degrees C, while providing 18 kW of source heat transfer to operate a thermoacoustic power system during off-sun conditions (e.g., temporary cloud conditions, after sun-down). This work discusses relevant configurations, and critical thermal and entropy models of the TES configurations, which show the inherent minimization of thermal exergy during critical heat transfers within the configurations and systems envisioned.

However, fabrication of large-scale SWNT-based ICs is an enormously challenging, unsolved problem, and self-assembly is likely needed for critical steps. Over the past several years, methods have been introduced to created ordered carbon nanotube structures using DNA guided self-assembly. In this chapter, we briefly review the challenges involved in using DNA to assemble SWNT nanostructures, and then give detailed methods to assemble dense, aligned SWNT arrays. In particular, we discuss the preparation of DNA wrapped single-walled nanotubes (DNA-CNTs) using commercial carbon nanotube products that are suitable for electronics applications. Then, we discuss methods to characterize DNA-CNTs using fluid mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Finally, we give detailed procedures for assembly of DNA-CNTs into dense parallel arrays via linker induced surface assembly (LISA).

More precisely, we assume that the external potential decays suitably at infinity and the linear Schrodinger operator -+V-s admits exactly one bound state, which is ground state, for any s[0,1]. In the nonlinear setting, the ground state bifurcates into a manifold of (small) ground state solutions. We show that, if the initial condition is at the ground state manifold, bifurcated from the ground state of -+V-0, then, for any fixed s[0,1], as ?0, the solution will converge to the ground state manifold bifurcated from the ground state of -+V-s. Moreover, the limit is of the same mass to the initial condition.

Galaxy morphologies are determined visually using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the spectral energy distribution fitting code Code Investigating GALaxy Emission, we measure star formation rates, stellar masses, and 4000 (A) over circle break strengths. The latter are used to separate quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). From z similar to 1.3 to z similar to 0.2, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of cluster SFGs and quiescent galaxies decreases by factors of three and four, respectively. Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster population declines by a factor of 11, from 0.48 +/- 0.06 Gyr(-1) to 0.043 +/- 0.009 Gyr(-1). This strong overall sSFR evolution is driven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of quiescent cluster galaxies increases from 28(-19)(+8)% to 88(-4)(+5)% over z similar to 1.3 to 0.2. The majority of the growth occurs at z greater than or similar to 0.9, where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR of the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field, a small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity, suggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of quiescent galaxies above z similar to 0.9, coupled with the field-level sSFRs of cluster SFGs, suggests that higher-redshift cluster galaxies are likely being quenched quickly. Assessing those timescales will require more accurate stellar population ages and star formation histories.

We spectroscopically measured with Keck/Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) two galaxies multiply imaged by the cluster. Our analysis reveals a modest lens, with an effective Einstein radius of theta(e)(z = 2)= 12 +/- 1" enclosing 2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(13) M-circle dot. We briefly discuss the SL properties of the cluster, using two different modeling techniques (see the text for details), and make the mass models publicly available (ftp://wise-ftp.tau.ac.il/pub/adiz/MACS1319/). Independently, we identified a noteworthy, young shell galaxy (SG) system forming around two likely interacting cluster members, 20". north of the brightest cluster galaxy. SGs are rare in galaxy clusters, and indeed, a simple estimate reveals that they are only expected in roughly one in several dozen, to several hundred, massive galaxy clusters (the estimate can easily change by an order of magnitude within a reasonable range of characteristic values relevant for the calculation). Taking advantage of our lens model best-fit, mass-to-light scaling relation for cluster members, we infer that the total mass of the SG system is similar to 1.3 x 10(11) M-circle dot, with a host-to-companion mass ratio of about 10:1. Despite being rare in high density environments, the SG constitutes an example to how stars of cluster galaxies are efficiently redistributed to the intra-cluster medium. Dedicated numerical simulations for the observed shell configuration, perhaps aided by the mass model, might cast interesting light on the interaction history and properties of the two galaxies. An archival HST search in galaxy cluster images can reveal more such systems.

For each, an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) canopy height model (CHM) was produced by subtracting a LiDAR digital terrain model from the TanDEM-X DSM. These InSAR CHMs were compared to a LiDAR CHM at a resolution of 25 m and led to biases from 0.77 to 1.56 m, r(2) from 0.68 to 0.38, and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from 2.06 to 3.67 m. Two datasets acquired in similar conditions differed by 1.27m(RMSE). Differences in the interferometric baseline had the strongest effect on the DSMs (RMSE of 3.27 m between short and long baseline DSMs). The height of ambiguity therefore had a significant effect on the resulting canopy height. The effect of phenological changes on canopy height estimations was lower (RMSE of 2.30 m between leaf-on and leaf-off DSMs) and not highly significant. These results indicate that, despite variations in the acquisition conditions, a continuous TanDEM-X mosaic acquired with proper baselines could produce a reliable estimate of canopy surface elevations of evergreen closed-canopy boreal forests.

The laser beacon ( 1568 +/- 0.1 nm) was square wave modulated and sensed by a quadrant sensor on LLST. While link acquisition and tracking proceeded with the sensed signal, on-board processing extracted power incident on the quadrant sensor and telemetered it down over the optical downlink. Subsequently, post-processing of the codewords received at OCTL retrieved the power time series recorded at LLST. Analysis comparing measured and predicted mean irradiance delivered to LLST consistently agreed to within < 1 decibel (dB).

A binary polarization-shift-keyed modulation scheme using dual gain-switched diode lasers is developed and demonstrated within an end-to-end link testbed to achieve signal acquisition under extremely poor signal-to-noise conditions (-43.5 dB average signal-to-noise power ratio at a 1-MHz symbol rate) to simulate direct-to-Earth links, while simultaneously targeting a limited SWaP footprint (1.5U envelope). Additional system design and constraints for the compact laser transmitter will be discussed.

This design, optimized for operation across a wide range of illumination conditions, is focused on minimizing blinding from stray light, and providing reliable, accurate attitude information to point its narrow communication beam accurately to the future location of the ground terminal. Though our transceiver will transmit in the 1550 nm waveband and receive in the 1064 nm waveband, the system design relies heavily on reflective optical elements, extending flexibility to be modified for use at different wavebands. The design makes use of common path propagation among transmit, receive and pointing verification optical channels to maintain precise alignment among its components, and to naturally correct for element misalignment resulting from launch or thermal element perturbations. This paper presents the results of trade studies showing the evolution of the design, unique operational characteristics of the design, elements that help to maintain minimal stray light contamination, and preliminary results from development and initial testing of a functional aluminum test model.

In this paper, we discuss a downlink receiver concept capable of demodulating optical pulse-position modulated (PPM) waveforms with data rates varying from approximately 50 kbps up to 265 Mbps, using a range of PPM orders, slot widths, and code rates. The receiver operates on recorded timestamps corresponding to the times-of-arrival of photons detected by a photon-counting detector array followed by a commercial time-tagger. Algorithms are presented for slot, symbol, and frame synchronization as well as parameter estimation. Estimates of link performance are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation for an optical channel that includes optical losses, detector blocking, signal clock dynamics, and pointing-induced downlink fades. Based upon these simulation results, it is expected that link closure may be achieved with at least 3 dB of margin under a variety of relevant conditions.

A Comparison of Three Ion Sensing Circuits in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Engine	COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Circuits; Engine; Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI); Ion signal; Sensor	HCCI COMBUSTION; BOOSTED HCCI; POTASSIUM; CESIUM	The use of a spark plug ion sensor to detect combustion timing in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine is a technique that could alleviate the need for pressure transducers, a more expensive alternative. One disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty in obtaining a strong signal at lower equivalence ratios. This article addresses and compares three ion sensing circuitries, namely a voltage follower, a notch filter circuit that removes the 60-Hz wall noise, and a notch filter whose output is coupled to a custom-built "integrator" circuit. The circuit optimizations are aimed at improving signal strength and reliability. The ion signal present in the combustion chamber is experimentally investigated in a 1.9-L Volkswagen engine, modified for HCCI operation and fueled with gasoline. Experiments are conducted across different intake temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. It was found that the custom- built circuit provided the best ion signal strength and reliability.

These mineral waters discharge with a temperature between 17 and 20 degrees C, show a very alkaline pH (up to 11.8), and have: Na-Cl/Ca-OH facies; dry residuum approximate to 200 mg/L; C-total < 3.0 mg/L; and extremely low Mg2+ and silica concentrations (< 0.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). CH4 isotopic composition (-24.4 parts per thousand < delta C-13-CH4 < -14.0 parts per thousand and 285 parts per thousand < delta H-2-CH4 < -218 parts per thousand) falls in the range of typical abiotic gas. In the case of Cabeco de Vide mineral waters, the understanding of the resource will help to preserve the mineral water quality, creating public interest. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Weinberg's soft graviton theorem in 2m+ 2 dimensions is re-expressed as a Ward identity for the gravitational S-matrix. The corresponding asymptotic symmetries are identified with 2m + 2-dimensional supertranslations. An alternate derivation of these asymptotic symmetries as diffeomorphisms which preserve finite-energy boundary conditions at null infinity and act non-trivially on physical data is given. Our results differ from those of previous analyses whose stronger boundary conditions precluded supertranslations for d > 4. We find for all even d that supertranslation symmetry is spontaneously broken in the conventional vacuum and identify soft gravitons as the corresponding Goldstone bosons.

Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, with limited success, especially through use of low sulfur loadings (1-2 mg/cm(2)). Dense electrodes with high sulfur loadings are essential for high energy cells, however, such electrodes experience more serious polysulfide effects. In this paper, we describe the benefits of blending sulfur with a transition metal sulfide (here, TiS2 and MoS2) to form dense composite cathodes with enhanced conductivity. There is an improvement in both the initial capacity from sulfur utilization (similar to 800 mAh/g based on sulfur content), the coulombic efficiency (>96%) and also in cycle life upon blending with the metal sulfide. High sulfur loadings (>12 mg/cm(2) or similar to 6 mAh/cm(2) per side) were demonstrated to display high sulfur utilization in Li-S cells containing the metal sulfide blends either with or without coatings over the sulfur cathode. XRD studies were carried out to understand the redox behavior of the metal sulfide additive during charge/discharge cycling of the sulfur cathodes. DC polarization and Potentiometric Intermittent Titration Technique (PITT) measurements were made on sulfur cathodes with and without metal sulfide blends to determine the charge transfer and diffusional kinetics.

Experimental Model Validation of High Aspect Ratio Through-Hole Filling by Additive-Assisted Copper Electrodeposition	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							POLYETHYLENE-GLYCOL; WETTABILITY; DEPOSITION	A multi-element, time-dependent model developed by Childers et al. [A.S. Childers, M.T. Johnson, J. Ramirez-Rico, and K.T. Faber, J. Electrochem. Soc., 160:3093-3102, 2013] for copper infiltration of large (similar to 50-200 mu m diameter), high aspect ratio (similar to 60) through-hole channels was experimentally tested for validity. The model built on the work of Akolkar and Landau [R. Akolkar and U. Landau, J. Electrochem. Soc., 151: 702-711, 2004] for copper deposition in micro-scale integrated circuitry. Childers' model broadens the original by including the transport and adsorption of all electrolyte species - inhibitors, accelerators, and copper ions. The resultingmodel is tested experimentally with wood-derived biomorphic carbon materials. Results indicate that model predictions of premature pore choke off are in agreement with quantitative observations of copper infiltration and qualitative imaging of plated pore profiles. Low accelerator concentrations (0.002 ppm) yielded the highest quantity of copper infiltration without premature closure. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.	[Johnson, M.

J	Hou, TY; Li, Q; Zhang, P				Hou, Thomas Y.; Li, Qin; Zhang, Pengchuan			A SPARSE DECOMPOSITION OF LOW RANK SYMMETRIC POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE MATRICES	MULTISCALE MODELING & SIMULATION			English	Article						intrinsic sparse mode decomposition; principal component analysis; sparse PCA; joint diagonalization; pivoted Cholesky decomposition; matrix factorization	WANNIER FUNCTIONS; FLOWS	Suppose that A is an element of R-N x N is symmetric positive semidefinite with rank K <= N. Our goal is to decompose A into K rank-one matrices Sigma(K)(k-1) gkgT(k) where the modes {gk}(K)(k=1) are required to be as sparse as possible. In contrast to eigendecomposition, these sparse modes are not required to be orthogonal. Such a problem arises in random field parametrization where A is the covariance function and is intractable to solve in general. In this paper, we partition the indices from 1 to N into several patches and propose to quantify the sparseness of a vector by the number of patches on which it is nonzero, which is called patchwise sparseness. Our aim is to find the decomposition which minimizes the total patchwise sparseness of the decomposed modes. We propose a domain decomposition type method, called intrinsic sparse mode decomposition (ISMD), which follows the "local-modes-construction broken vertical bar patching-up" procedure. The key step in the ISMD is to construct local pieces of the intrinsic sparse modes by a joint diagonalization problem. Thereafter, a pivoted Cholesky decomposition is utilized to glue these local pieces together. Optimal sparse decomposition, consistency with different domain decomposition, and robustness to small perturbation are proved under the so-called regular-sparse assumption (see Definition 1.2). We provide simulation results to show the efficiency and robustness of the ISMD. We also compare the ISMD to other existing methods, e.g., eigendecomposition, pivoted Cholesky decomposition, and convex relaxation of sparse principal component analysis [R. LAI, J. LU, AND S.

Temporal expression of CD184(CXCR4) and CD171(L1CAM) identifies distinct early developmental stages of human retinal ganglion cells in embryonic stem cell derived retina	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						Retinal organoid; Retinal ganglion cell; Stem cell derived retina; CD184(CXCR4); CD171 (L1CAM); Retina development; RBPMS	RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; INNER LIMITING MEMBRANE; VESICLE-LIKE STRUCTURES; OPTIC-NERVE; COMPETENCE STATE; MATH5; GENE; AMACRINE; AXONS; DEATH	Human retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have anticipated value for human disease study, drug screening, and therapeutic applications; however, their full potential remains underdeveloped. To characterize RGCs in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived retinal organoids we examined RGC markers and surface antigen expression and made comparisons to human fetal retina. RGCs in both tissues exhibited CD184 and CD171 expression and distinct expression patterns of the RGC markers BRN3 and RBPMS. The retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) of retinal organoids expressed CD184, consistent with its expression in the neuroblastic layer in fetal retina. In retinal organoids CD184 expression was enhanced in RGC competent RPCs and high CD184 expression was retained on post mitotic RGC precursors; CD171 was detected on maturing RGCs. The differential expression timing of CD184 and CD171 permits identification and enrichment of RGCs from retinal organoids at differing maturation states from committed progenitors to differentiating neurons. These observations will facilitate molecular characterization of PSC-derived RGCs during differentiation, critical knowledge for establishing the veracity of these in vitro produced cells. Furthermore, observations made in the retinal organoid model closely parallel those in human fetal retina further validating use of retinal organoid to model early retinal development.

Previous work has shown that this is impossible, unless the agents and planner have sufficient information about each other and common knowledge. These results have remained largely theoretical because the required information is generally not available in practical applications. However, recent work has shown that these limitations can be overcome in simple settings, using neurometric technologies that provide noisy signals of subjects' preferences that can be used in the mechanism design problem. Here we build on this work by carrying out two new experiments designed to test the extent to which these Neurometrically Informed Mechanisms (NIMs) can be applied to more complicated and realistic environments. We find robustness to large type and action space and to the degrees of loss and risk-aversion observed in most of our sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our approach makes the comparison of the matching models with and without transfers particularly transparent. We introduce the concept of a no-trade stable matching to study the role of transfers in matching. A no-trade stable matching is one in which the availability of transfers does not affect the outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Individuals have private information about contribution costs. Individuals can each make a discrete contribution. If the number of contributors is at least equal to the threshold, a public benefit accrues to all members of the group. We experimentally implement three different communication structures prior to the decision move: (a) simultaneous exchange of binary messages, (b) larger finite numerical message space and (c) unrestricted text chat. We obtain theoretical bounds on the efficiency gains that are obtainable under these different communication structures. In an experiment with three person groups and a threshold of two, we observe significant efficiency gains only with the richest of these communication structures, where participants engage in unrestricted text chatting. In that case, the efficiency bounds implied by mechanism design theory are achieved. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Because BMGs properties are highly correlated with processing, it is necessary to test them in a relevant engineering application. In the current work, CuZr-based BMGs are developed with excellent wear performance when used as gears. It is shown that in order to optimize the wear performance of these gears, toughness should be maximized. This contrasts the conventional design strategy, where wear performance increases with increasing hardness. Finally, a new low-cost manufacturing method for casting net- shaped macroscale gears is developed.

Melting glass pellets require a furnace with temperature over 1500 degrees C for downstream glass shaping processes and hence a large amount of exergy is available but currently destroyed. Due to high temperature gradients, parasitic losses are investigated in conjunction with the optimum thermoelectric design for maximum power output and the lowest cost. Among variations of thermal paths, the fireports are identified as the best potential for lowest cost. By partially replacing the refractory wall in thickness with a thermoelectric generator, heat loss is kept at the current 9 kW/m(2). High temperature gradients across the thermoelectric generator requires a water cooling heat sink. The cost of the heat sink is included in the overall energy and cost analysis. Based on a typical thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT = 1), optimally designed thermoelectric integrated system generates 55.6 kW of electricity with efficiency of over 15% from a 500 ton/day (5.8 kg/s) scale glass production at an additional cost of $ 1-2/W. This technology can provide 1.37 billion kWh of primary energy savings annually, if it is implemented throughout the whole glass industry in U.S. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interleukin-15 promotes intestinal dysbiosis with butyrate deficiency associated with increased susceptibility to colitis	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; GUT MICROBIOTA; FECAL BUTYRATE; T-CELLS; BACTERIA; IL-15; EXPRESSION; SEQUENCES; GENE	Dysbiosis resulting in gut-microbiome alterations with reduced butyrate production are thought to disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis and promote complex immune disorders. However, whether and how dysbiosis develops before the onset of overt pathology remains poorly defined. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is upregulated in distressed tissue and its overexpression is thought to predispose susceptible individuals to and have a role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the immunological roles of IL-15 have been largely studied, its potential impact on the microbiota remains unexplored. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA-based inventories of bacterial communities in mice overexpressing IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium (villin-IL-15 transgenic (v-IL-15tg) mice) shows distinct changes in the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Although some alterations are specific to individual intestinal compartments, others are found across the ileum, cecum and feces. In particular, IL-15 overexpression restructures the composition of the microbiota with a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria that is associated with a reduction in luminal butyrate levels across all intestinal compartments. Fecal microbiota transplant experiments of wild-type and v-IL-15tg microbiota into germ-free mice further indicate that diminishing butyrate concentration observed in the intestinal lumen of v-IL-15tg mice is the result of intrinsic alterations in the microbiota induced by IL-15. This reconfiguration of the microbiota is associated with increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Altogether, this study reveals that IL-15 impacts butyrate-producing bacteria and lowers butyrate levels in the absence of overt pathology, which represent events that precede and promote intestinal inflammatory diseases.

The spacecraft launched on 18 November 2013, entered Mars orbit on 22 September 2014, and continues to acquire measurements of Mars's upper atmosphere in an effort to understand the loss of Martian volatiles to space. The navigation team is responsible for estimating and predicting the spacecraft's position and velocity, and designing and reconstructing propulsive maneuvers. After Mars orbit insertion, the team faced additional challenges unique to the mission's orbit and tracking data schedule, including the determination of the atmospheric density at each periapsis, which is necessary to keep the spacecraft within a predefined density corridor. This paper briefly describes the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, shows how it fits into previous and ongoing Mars exploration efforts, and overviews the operations of the navigation team from launch through the nominal science phase.

J	Lobbia, MA				Lobbia, Marcus A.			Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of Waverider-Derived Crew Reentry Vehicles	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							HL-20; ENVIRONMENT	The development of a multidisciplinary design optimization framework for crew reentry vehicles is presented. A waverider design methodology is used as the basis for the parametric design technique, with required modifications (e.g., leading edge blunting and integration of a cylindrical payload volume representing the crew compartment) used to allow the generation of practical reentry configurations. In addition to the shape design code, aerodynamics analysis, mass estimating, and trajectory/aeroheating analyses are linked using a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization process to maximize vehicle downrange, additional payload mass capability, and lift-to-drag ratio. Pareto fronts were generated for three different launch vehicle capabilities ranging from 12,000 to 26,000kg to orbit, and highlight the relationships between reentry vehicle payload mass, maximum lift-to-drag ratio, and downrange, as well as the fact that a medium-class or larger launch vehicle was required to meet the baseline mission payload mass requirement. Although the modifications necessary for the crew reentry vehicle mission resulted in a substantial reduction in lift-to-drag ratio relative to the idealized waveriders used in the design process, comparisons of several designs to the NASA HL-20 concept indicated that the waverider-derived design process can produce vehicles with an almost 30% improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio and the ability to carry additional payload mass on longer downrange trajectories.

Effects of differential diffusion on ignition of stoichiometric hydrogen-air by moving hot spheres	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Hot surface ignition; Differential diffusion; Minimum ignition temperature; Hydrogen-air detailed chemistry	COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURE; PARTICLES	Studying thermal ignition mechanisms is a key step for evaluating many ignition hazards. In the present work, two-dimensional simulations with detailed chemistry are used to study the effect of differential diffusion on the prediction of ignition thresholds of a stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture by moving hot spheres. Numerical experiments showed an increase of 40 K in the minimum ignition temperature required for ignition when diffusion of species at different rates is taken into account. Detailed analysis of the species profiles at the ignition location and a sensitivity study of the system to the diffusivity of H-2 and H revealed the key role played by the diffusion of H atoms in preventing ignition to take place at temperatures below 1000 K.

Experimental and numerical studies of fuel and hydrodynamic effects on piloted turbulent premixed jet flames	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Premixed turbulence; Jet flames; PIV; LES; Hydrocarbon fuels	SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE; SUBGRID-SCALE CLOSURE; DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION; BURNING VELOCITY; COMBUSTION; MODEL; PROPAGATION; TRANSPORT; METHANE; BURNER	An experimental and numerical investigation of fuel and hydrodynamic effects is performed on piloted pre-mixed jet flames. The investigation is carried out at a constant laminar flame speed, varying heat losses, jet Reynolds number, fuel molecular weight, and fuel chemical classification. Large Eddy Simulations are performed in an attempt to reproduce the behaviors observed experimentally. Simulations are compared against well-characterized boundary conditions, well-resolved two-dimensional velocity fields from particle image velocimetry, and line-of-sight CH* profiles. Experimental results indicate that small amounts of heat losses may play a significant role on the jet reactivity as the flame heights scale with the heat loss from the jet. However, differences between flames with different fuels can still be seen in the absence of heat losses and these differences are magnified at higher Reynolds numbers. Particularly, methane flames are consistently taller and ethylene flames consistently shorter while other fuels present approximately the same flame height.

Multiinstrument observations of a geomagnetic storm and its effects on the Arctic ionosphere: A case study of the 19 February 2014 storm	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article							TOTAL ELECTRON-CONTENT; SPACE WEATHER; RING CURRENT; PHASE; IRREGULARITIES; SCINTILLATIONS; TIMED/GUVI; MORPHOLOGY; LATITUDES; IMPACT	We present a multiinstrumented approach for the analysis of the Arctic ionosphere during the 19 February 2014 highly complex, multiphase geomagnetic storm, which had the largest impact on the disturbance storm-time index that year. The geomagnetic storm was the result of two powerful Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It produced a strong long lasting negative storm phase over Greenland with a dominant energy input in the polar cap. We employed global navigation satellite system (GNSS) networks, geomagnetic observatories, and a specific ionosonde station in Greenland. We complemented the approach with spaceborne measurements in order to map the state and variability of the Arctic ionosphere. In situ observations from the Canadian CASSIOPE (CAScade, Smallsat and IOnospheric Polar Explorer) satellite's ion mass spectrometer were used to derive ion flow data from the polar cap topside ionosphere during the event. Our research specifically found that (1) thermospheric O/N-2 measurements demonstrated significantly lower values over the Greenland sector than prior to the storm time. (2) An increased ion flow in the topside ionosphere was observed during the negative storm phase. (3) Negative storm phase was a direct consequence of energy input into the polar cap. (4) Polar patch formation was significantly decreased during the negative storm phase. This paper addresses the physical processes that can be responsible for this ionospheric storm development in the northern high latitudes. We conclude that ionospheric heating due to the CME's energy input caused changes in the polar atmosphere resulting in Ne upwelling, which was the major factor in high-latitude ionosphere dynamics for this storm.

Although such attributions are often regarded as gratuitous anthropomorphisms and held apart from the attributions humans make about each other's internal states, they may be the product of a general mechanism for flexibly interpreting adaptive behavior. To examine this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to compare the neural mechanisms associated with attributing emotions to humans and non-human animal behavior. Although undergoing fMRI, participants first passively observed the facial displays of human, non-human primate and domestic dogs, and subsequently judged the acceptability of emotional (e.g. 'annoyed') and facial descriptions (e.g. 'baring teeth') for the same images. For all targets, emotion attributions selectively activated regions in prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices associated with causal explanation in prior studies. These regions were similarly activated by both human and non-human targets even during the passive observation task; moreover, the degree of neural similarity was dependent on participants' self-reported beliefs in the mental capacities of non-human animals. These results encourage a non-anthropocentric view of emotion understanding, one that treats the idea that animals have emotions as no more gratuitous than the idea that humans other than ourselves do.

LigoDV-web: Providing easy, secure and universal access to a large distributed scientific data store for the LIGO scientific collaboration	ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING			English	Article								Gravitational-wave observatories around the world, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), record a large volume of gravitational-wave output data and auxiliary data about the instruments and their environments. These data are stored at the observatory sites and distributed to computing clusters for data analysis. LigoDV-web is a web-based data viewer that provides access to data recorded at the LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston and GE0600 observatories, and the 40 m prototype interferometer at Caltech. The challenge addressed by this project is to provide meaningful visualizations of small data sets to anyone in the collaboration in a fast, secure and reliable manner with minimal software, hardware and training required of the end users. LigoDV-web is implemented as a Java Enterprise Application, with Shibboleth Single Sign On for authentication and authorization, and a proprietary network protocol used for data access on the back end. Collaboration members with proper credentials can request data be displayed in any of several general formats from any Internet appliance that supports a modern browser with Javascript and minimal HTML5 support, including personal computers, smartphones, and tablets. Since its inception in 2012, 634 unique users have visited the LigoDV-web website in a total of 33, 861 sessions and generated a total of 139, 875 plots. This infrastructure has been helpful in many analyses within the collaboration including follow-up of the data surrounding the first gravitational-wave events observed by LIGO in 2015.

The effect of liquid composition on the partitioning of Ni between olivine and silicate melt	CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY			English	Article						Nickel partitioning; Olivine; Hawaii; Iceland; Ocean-island basalt	MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE; MAJOR-ELEMENT HETEROGENEITY; RECYCLED OCEANIC-CRUST; MANTLE SOURCE; ORTHO-PYROXENE; ACTIVITY-COEFFICIENTS; ABYSSAL PERIDOTITES; HIGH-PRESSURE; NICKEL; TEMPERATURE	We report the results of experiments designed to separate the effects of temperature and pressure from liquid composition on the partitioning of Ni between olivine and liquid, D-Ni(ol/liq). Experiments were performed from 1300 to 1600 degrees C and 1 atm to 3.0 GPa, using mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glass surrounded by powdered olivine in graphite-Pt double capsules at high pressure and powdered MORB in crucibles fabricated from single crystals of San Carlos olivine at one atmosphere. In these experiments, pressure and temperature were varied in such a way that we produced a series of liquids, each with an approximately constant composition (similar to 12, similar to 15, and similar to 21 wt% MgO). Previously, we used a similar approach to show that D-Ni(ol/liq) for a liquid with similar to 18 wt% MgO is a strong function of temperature. Combining the new data presented here with our previous results allows us to separate the effects of temperature from composition. We fit our data based on a Ni-Mg exchange reaction, which yields ln (D-Ni(molar)) = -Delta H-r(1)degrees(P)(Tref,)(ref)/RT + Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R - In(X-Mgo(liq)/X(Mgsi0.5)(ol)o(2)) Each subset of constant composition experiments displays roughly the same temperature dependence of D-Ni(ol/liq) (i. e., Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(Pref)/R) as previously reported for liquids with similar to 18 wt% MgO. Fitting new data presented here (15 experiments) in conjunction with our 13 previously published experiments (those with similar to 18 wt% MgO in the silicate liquid) to the above expression gives -Delta H-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = 3641 +/- 396 (K) and Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = -1.597 +/- 0.229. Adding data from the literature yields -Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = 4505 +/- 196 (K) and Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = -2.075 +/- 0.120, a set of coefficients that leads to a predictive equation for D-Ni(ol/liq) applicable to a wide range of melt compositions. We use the results of our work to model the melting of peridotite beneath lithosphere of varying thickness and show that: (1) a positive correlation between NiO in magnesian olivine phenocrysts and lithospheric thickness is expected given a temperature-dependent D-Ni(ol/liq), and (2) the magnitude of the slope for natural samples is consistent with our experimentally determined temperature dependence. Alternative processes to generate the positive correlation between NiO in magnesian olivines and lithospheric thickness, such as the melting of olivine-free pyroxenite, are possible, but they are not required to explain the observed correlation of NiO concentration in initially crystallizing olivine with lithospheric thickness.

Tidally induced variations in vertical and horizontal motion on Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, inferred from remotely sensed observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						synthetic aperture radar; glacier mechanics; ice-ocean interactions; ice shelf buttressing; ice-bed mechanics; ice rheology	RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; BASAL MECHANICS; PINE ISLAND; OCEAN TIDES; INSAR DATA; VELOCITY; FLOW; MARGINS; SHELF; BED	To better understand the influence of stress changes over floating ice shelves on grounded ice streams, we develop a Bayesian method for inferring time-dependent 3-D surface velocity fields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data. Our specific goal is to observe ocean tide-induced variability in vertical ice shelf position and horizontal ice stream flow. Thus, we consider the special case where observed surface displacement at a given location can be defined by a 3-D secular velocity vector, a family of 3-D sinusoidal functions, and a correction to the digital elevation model used to process the SAR data. Using nearly 9months of SAR data collected from multiple satellite viewing geometries with the COSMO-SkyMed 4-satellite constellation, we infer the spatiotemporal response of Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to ocean tidal forcing. Consistent with expected tidal uplift, inferred vertical motion over the ice shelf is dominated by semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. Horizontal ice flow variability, on the other hand, occurs primarily at the fortnightly spring-neap tidal period (M-sf). We propose that periodic grounding of the ice shelf is the primary mechanism for translating vertical tidal motion into horizontal flow variability, causing ice flow to accelerate first and most strongly over the ice shelf.

J	Malatesta, LC; Prancevic, JP; Avouac, JP				Malatesta, Luca C.; Prancevic, Jeffrey P.; Avouac, Jean-Philippe			Autogenic entrenchment patterns and terraces due to coupling with lateral erosion in incising alluvial channels	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						terrace; autogenic; entrenchment; fill-cut	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIAN-SHAN; NORTHWESTERN COLORADO; GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES; FLUVIAL TERRACES; WASHINGTON-STATE; DRAINAGE-BASIN; NORTH FLANK; TIEN-SHAN; RIVER	The abandonment of terraces in incising alluvial rivers can be used to infer tectonic and climatic histories. A river incising into alluvium erodes both vertically and laterally as it abandons fill-cut terraces. We argue that the input of sediment from the valley walls during entrenchment can alter the incision dynamics of a stream by promoting vertical incision over lateral erosion. Using a numerical model, we investigate how valley wall feedbacks may affect incision rates and terrace abandonment as the channel becomes progressively more entrenched in its valley. We postulate that erosion of taller valley walls delivers large pulses of sediment to the incising channel, potentially overwhelming the local sediment transport capacity. Based on field observations, we propose that these pulses of sediment can form talus piles that shield the valley wall from subsequent erosion and potentially force progressive channel narrowing. Our model shows that this positive feedback mechanism can enhance vertical incision relative to 1-D predictions that ignore lateral erosion. We find that incision is most significantly enhanced when sediment transport rates are low relative to the typical volume of material collapsed from the valley walls. The model also shows a systematic erosion of the youngest terraces when river incision slows down. The autogenic entrenchment due to lateral feedbacks with valley walls should be taken into account in the interpretation of complex-response terraces.

The calorimeter of the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Seminar on Innovative Particle and Radiation Detectors	OCT 03-06, 2016	Siena, ITALY			Calorimeters; Radiation-hard detectors		The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab looks for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) improving by 4 orders of magnitude the current experimental sensitivity for the muon to electron conversion in a muonic atom. A positive signal could not be explained in the framework of the current Standard Model of particle interactions and therefore would be a clear indication of new physics. In 3 years of data taking, Mu2e is expected to observe less than one background event mimicking the electron coming from muon conversion. Achieving such a level of background suppression requires a deep knowledge of the experimental apparatus: a straw tube tracker, measuring the electron momentum and time, a cosmic ray veto system rejecting most of cosmic ray background and a pure CsI crystal calorimeter, that will measure time of flight, energy and impact position of the converted electron. The calorimeter has to operate in a harsh radiation environment, in a 10(-4) Torr vacuum and inside a 1 T magnetic field. The results of the first qualification tests of the calorimeter components are reported together with the energy and time performances expected from the simulation and measured in beam tests of a small scale prototype.

Such capability exists at larger than 4-mm overall diameters. We report the development of a stereo imaging endoscope of 4-mm maximum diameter, called Multiangle, Rear-Viewing Endoscopic Tool (MARVEL) that uses a single-lens system with complementary multibandpass filter (CMBF) technology to achieve 3-D imaging. In addition, the system is endowed with the capability to pan from side-to-side over an angle of +/- 25 deg, which is another unique aspect of MARVEL for such a class of endoscopes. The design and construction of a single-lens, CMBF aperture camera with integrated illumination to generate 3-D images, and the actuation mechanism built into it is summarized.

We explored the extent of genomic robustness in budding yeast by genome wide dosage suppressor analysis of 53 conditional lethal mutations in cell division cycle and RNA synthesis related genes, revealing 660 suppressor interactions of which 642 are novel. This collection has several distinctive features, including high cooccurrence of mutant-suppressor pairs within protein modules, highly correlated functions between the pairs and higher diversity of functions among the co-suppressors than previously observed. Dosage suppression of essential genes encoding RNA polymerase subunits and chromosome cohesion complex suggests a surprising degree of functional plasticity of macromolecular complexes, and the existence of numerous degenerate pathways for circumventing the effects of potentially lethal mutations. These results imply that organisms and cancer are likely able to exploit the genomic robustness properties, due the persistence of cryptic gene and pathway functions, to generate variation and adapt to selective pressures.

Continuum viscoplastic simulation of a granular column collapse on large slopes: mu(I) rheology and lateral wall effects	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS; FLOW; EVOLUTION; MODEL; MASS	We simulate here dry granular flows resulting from the collapse of granular columns on an inclined channel (up to 22 degrees) and compare precisely the results with laboratory experiments. Incompressibility is assumed despite the dilatancy observed in the experiments (up to 10%). The 2-D model is based on the so-called mu(I) rheology that induces a Drucker-Prager yield stress and a variable viscosity. A nonlinear Coulomb friction term, representing the friction on the lateral walls of the channel, is added to the model. We demonstrate that this term is crucial to accurately reproduce granular collapses on slopes greater than or similar to 10 degrees, whereas it remains of little effect on the horizontal slope. Quantitative comparison between the experimental and numerical changes with time of the thickness profiles and front velocity makes it possible to strongly constrain the rheology. In particular, we show that the use of a variable or a constant viscosity does not change significantly the results provided that these viscosities are of the same order. However, only a fine tuning of the constant viscosity (eta = 1 Pa s) makes it possible to predict the slow propagation phase observed experimentally at large slopes. Finally, we observed that small-scale instabilities develop when refining the mesh (also called ill-posed behavior, characterized in the work of Barker et al. ["Well-posed and ill-posed behaviour of the mu(I)-rheology for granular flow," J. Fluid Mech. 779, 794-818 (2015)] and in the present work) associated with the mechanical model. The velocity field becomes stratified and the bands of high velocity gradient appear. These model instabilities are not avoided by using variable viscosity models such as the mu(I) rheology. However we show that the velocity range, the static-flowing transition, and the thickness profiles are almost not affected by them. Published by AIP Publishing.

J	Owhadi, H				Owhadi, Houman			Multigrid with Rough Coefficients and Multiresolution Operator Decomposition from Hierarchical Information Games	SIAM REVIEW			English	Article						multigrid; multiresolution; game theory; wavelets; information based complexity; decision theory	FINITE-ELEMENT METHODS; ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS; APPROXIMATE WAVELETS; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; HOMOGENIZATION; INTERPOLATION; BRITTLENESS; MATRIX; QUANTIFICATION; ALGORITHM	We introduce a near-linear complexity (geometric and meshless/algebraic) multigrid/multi-resolution method for PDEs with rough (L-infinity) coefficients with rigorous a priori accuracy and performance estimates. The method is discovered through a decision/game theory formulation of the problems of (1) identifying restriction and interpolation operators, (2) recovering a signal from incomplete measurements based on norm constraints on its image under a linear operator, and (3) gambling on the value of the solution of the PDE based on a hierarchy of nested measurements of its solution or source term. The resulting elementary gambles form a hierarchy of (deterministic) basis functions of H-0(1) (Omega) (gamblets) that (1) are orthogonal across subscales/subbands with respect to the scalar product induced by the energy norm of the PDE, (2) enable sparse compression of the solution space in H-0(1) (Omega), and (3) induce an orthogonal multiresolution operator decomposition. The operating diagram of the multigrid method is that of an inverted pyramid in which gamblets are computed locally (by virtue of their exponential decay) and hierarchically (from fine to coarse scales) and the PDE is decomposed into a hierarchy of independent linear systems with uniformly bounded condition numbers. The resulting algorithm is parallelizable both in space (via localization) and in bandwidth/subscale (subscales can be computed independently from each other). Although the method is deterministic, it has a natural Bayesian interpretation under the measure of probability emerging (as a mixed strategy) from the information game formulation, and multiresolution approximations form a martingale with respect to the filtration induced by the hierarchy of nested measurements.

MOTIVES	In this article we develop a broad generalization of the classical Bost-Connes system, where roots of unity are replaced by an algebraic datum consisting of an abelian group and a semi-group of endomorphisms. Examples include roots of unity, Weil restriction, algebraic numbers, Weil numbers, CM fields, germs, completion ofWeil numbers, etc. Making use of the Tannakian formalism, we categorify these algebraic data. For example, the categorification of roots of unity is given by a limit of orbit categories of Tate motives while the categorification of Weil numbers is given by Grothendieck's category of numerical motives over a finite field. To some of these algebraic data (e.g. roots of unity, algebraic numbers, Weil numbers, etc), we associate also a quantum statistical mechanical system with several remarkable properties, which generalize those of the classical Bost-Connes system. The associated partition function, low temperature Gibbs states, and Galois action on zero-temperature states are then studied in detail. For example, we show that in the particular case of the Weil numbers the partition function and the low temperature Gibbs states can be described as series of polylogarithms.

Long-distance quantum key distribution using concatenated entanglement swapping with practical resources	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						quantum key distribution; entanglement swapping; long-distance quantum communication	CRYPTOGRAPHY	We explain how to share photons between two distant parties using concatenated entanglement swapping and assess performance according to the two-photon visibility as the figure of merit. From this analysis, we readily see the key generation rate and the quantum bit error rate as figures of merit for this scheme applied to quantum key distribution (QKD). Our model accounts for practical limitations, including higher-order photon pair events, dark counts, detector inefficiency, and photon losses. Our analysis shows that compromises are needed among the runtimes for the experiment, the rate of producing photon pairs, and the choice of detector efficiency. From our quantitative results, we observe that concatenated entanglement swapping enables secure QKD over long distances but at key generation rates that are far too low to be useful for large separations. We find that the key generation rates are close to both the Takeoka-Guha-Wilde and the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bounds.

Ab initio study of the structure and stability of CaMg(CO3)(2) at high pressure	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						Dolomite; ab initio; global carbon cycle; lower mantle; high pressure	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; POST-PEROVSKITE PHASE; DOLOMITE; CARBON; ARAGONITE; CACO3; TRANSITION; MAGNESITE; MGCO3; CO2	Dolomite is one of the major mineral forms in which carbon is subducted into the Earth's mantle. End-member CaMg(CO3)(2) dolomite typically breaks down upon compression into two carbonates at 5-6 GPa in the temperature range of 800-1200 K (Shirasaka et al. 2002). However, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments have shown that dense high-pressure polymorphs of dolomite may be favored over single-cation carbonates (Santillan et al. 2003; Mao et al. 2011; Merlini et al. 2012). Here we compare calculated dolomite structures to experimentally observed phases. Using density functional theory interfaced with a genetic algorithm that predicts crystal structures (USPEX), a monoclinic phase with space group C2/c was found to have lower energy at pressures above 15 GPa than all previously reported dolomite structures. It is possible that this phase is not observed experimentally due to a large activation energy of transition from dolomite I, resulting in the observed second-order phase transition to a metastable dolomite II. Due to the complex energy landscape for candidate high-pressure dolomite structures, several structurally unique metastable polymorphs exist. We calculate the equation of state of a set of lowest-energy dolomite polymorphs with space groups P (1) over bar, P2/c, and C2/c up to 80 GPa. Our results demonstrate a need for calculations and experiments on Fe-Mn bearing high-pressure carbonate phases to extend our understanding of Earth's deep carbon cycle and test whether high-pressure poly morphs of double-cation carbonates represent the main reservoir for carbon storage within downwelling regions of Earth's mantle.

Mineralogy and chemistry of San Carlos high-alkali basalts: Analyses of alteration with application for Mars explorations	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						VSWIR spectroscopy; Mars analogs; XRD; geochemistry; alkali basalts; San Carlos	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; GALE CRATER EVIDENCE; GUSEV CRATER; ROCKS; WATER; ROVER; SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE; DIVERSITY; HISTORY	The discovery of Fe, Mg, and Al phyllosilicates on Mars using visible and short-wave infrared (VSWIR) spectroscopy from orbit indicates aqueous alteration of basaltic rocks. Analyses at Gusev Crater by the Spirit rover and Gale Crater by the Curiosity rover have discovered alkaline basaltic rocks. In this work, multiple methods VSWIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical analyses were used to study a suite of alkaline basalts from San Carlos, Arizona, which have been altered by water in an oxidative, semi-arid environment. As an analog for the weathering of alkaline basaltic rocks on Mars, a suite of rocks visually identified to have different degrees of alteration were characterized to understand the spectral, mineralogical, and chemical trends in alteration as sensed by multiple techniques. Samples with strong 1.9.mu m H2O-related absorptions in VSWIR commonly exhibited absorption bands at 1.4, 2.2, and/or 2.31 mu m, indicating the presence of clay minerals or silica as well as features at 0.5-0.9 mu m indicative of ferric iron oxides. Primary mineralogy for all samples, as determined by point analyses with the microprobe and XRD, consisted of olivine, plagioclase, nepheline, augite, and titanomagnetite. Compositional imaging and spot analyses with the microprobe revealed distinct alteration textures and phases, suggesting weathering pathways involving the oxidation of iron in olivine and primary Fe2+ oxides to form Fe3+ oxides as well as the formation of aluminum phyllosilicates and magnesium phyllosilicates from feldspars and olivines, respectively, while pyroxene remained relatively unaltered. Bivariate plots of major oxides both from bulk-chemical analysis and microprobe measurements also revealed trends in alkali and silica depletion and calcium enrichment, but there was little chemical fractionation in most of the major oxides. The strength of the 1.9 mu m H2O absorption, loss on ignition, and depletion in silica and sodium, correlated with increasing alteration. The data sets provide an analog for understanding possible weathering pathways in martian alkaline basalts and thresholds for the detection of aqueous alteration in multiple data sets.

We investigate whether the SICCI dataset is on a par with other datasets for studying sea ice cover changes in the Southern Ocean. We then examine spatiotemporal variations in sea ice derived from the SICCI dataset over the Southern Ocean, and analyse relationships of sea ice with sea surface temperature (SST). The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the SICCI dataset and the NASA Team dataset, and therefore the former can also be used for studying sea ice changes. Both sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) derived from the SICCI dataset over the Southern Ocean increased slightly from 1992 to 2008, at rates of (17.75 +/- 11.50) x 10(3) and (17.37 +/- 9.51) x 10(3) km(2) yr(-1), respectively. Antarctic sea ice has significant seasonal variations; all seasonally averaged SIE and SIA show an increase, with spring showing the largest positive changing rate. The Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and Indian Ocean have positive yearly changing rates in SIE and SIA, while the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas and western Pacific Ocean have negative yearly changing rates. However, overall sea ice over the Southern Ocean has a slight positive trend, which is the same as the sea ice change pattern derived from the NASA Team dataset. This indicates that the contributions to the change in sea ice over the whole Southern Ocean due to the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and Indian Ocean dominate over those by the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas and western Pacific Ocean. Further analysis shows that both SIE and SIA are negatively correlated with SST in the Southern Ocean or each of the 5 longitudinal sectors, and sea ice is more sensitive to SST in spring and autumn.

From orbital images examined early in the Curiosity mission, the Kimberley region had been identified as a high-priority science target based on its clear stratigraphic relationships in a layered sedimentary sequence that had been exposed by differential erosion. Observations of the stratigraphic sequence at the Kimberley made by Curiosity are consistent with deposition in a prograding, fluvio-deltaic system during the late Noachian to early Hesperian, prior to the existence of most of Mount Sharp. Geochemical and mineralogic analyses suggest that sediment deposition likely took place under cold conditions with relatively low water-to-rock ratios. Based on elevated K2O abundances throughout the Kimberley formation, an alkali feldspar protolith is likely one of several igneous sources from which the sediments were derived. After deposition, the rocks underwent multiple episodes of diagenetic alteration with different aqueous chemistries and redox conditions, as evidenced by the presence of Ca-sulfate veins, Mn-oxide fracture fills, and erosion-resistant nodules. More recently, the Kimberley has been subject to significant aeolian abrasion and removal of sediments to create modern topography that slopes away from Mount Sharp, a process that has continued to the present day.

The surface rupture extended about 120km in a NW-SE direction, west of the Cerro Prieto fault. Here we use geodetic measurements including near- to far-field GPS, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and subpixel offset measurements of radar and optical images to characterize the fault slip during the EMC event. We use dislocation inversion methods and determine an optimal nine-segment fault geometry, as well as a subfault slip distribution from the geodetic measurements. With systematic perturbation of the fault dip angles, randomly removing one geodetic data constraint, or different data combinations, we are able to explore the robustness of the inferred slip distribution along fault strike and depth. The model fitting residuals imply contributions of early postseismic deformation to the InSAR measurements as well as lateral heterogeneity in the crustal elastic structure between the Peninsular Ranges and the Salton Trough. We also find that with incorporation of near-field geodetic data and finer fault patch size, the shallow slip deficit is reduced in the EMC event by reductions in the level of smoothing. These results show that the outcomes of coseismic inversions can vary greatly depending on model parameterization and methodology.

Here we synthesize the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century coral microatoll records into a chronology of interseismic and coseismic vertical deformation. We identify at least five discrete uplift events in about 1597, 1613, 1631, 1658, and 1703 that likely correspond to large megathrust ruptures. This sequence contrasts with the following supercycle culmination, which involved only two large ruptures in 1797 and 1833. Fault slip modeling suggests that together the five cascading ruptures involved failure of the entire Mentawai segment. Interseismic deformation rates also changed after the onset of the rupture sequence, as they did after the 1797 earthquake. We model this change as an altered distribution of fault coupling, presumably triggered by the similar to 1597 rupture. We also analyze the far less continuous microatoll record between A.D. 1 and 1500. While we cannot confidently delineate the extent of any megathrust rupture during that period, all evidence suggests that individual major ruptures involve only part of the Mentawai segment, often overlap below the central Mentawai Islands, often trigger coupling changes, and occur in clusters that cumulatively cover the entire Mentawai segment at the culmination of each supercycle. It is clear that each Mentawai rupture sequence evolves uniquely in terms of the order and grouping of asperities that rupture, suggesting heterogeneities in fault frictional properties at the similar to 100km scale.

Mutations in the Non-Catalytic Subunit Dpb2 of DNA Polymerase Epsilon Affect the Nrm1 Branch of the DNA Replication Checkpoint	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; S-PHASE; CELL-CYCLE; RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE; DAMAGE RESPONSE; CATALYTIC DOMAINS; CHROMOSOMAL DNA; NUCLEAR IMPORT; PROTEIN-KINASE; RAD53 KINASE	To preserve genome integrity, the S-phase checkpoint senses damaged DNA or nucleotide depletion and when necessary, arrests replication progression and delays cell division. Previous studies, based on two pol2 mutants have suggested the involvement of DNA polymerase epsilon (Pol epsilon in sensing DNA replication accuracy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have studied the involvement of Pol epsilon in sensing proper progression of DNA replication, using a mutant in DPB2, the gene coding for a non-catalytic subunit of Pol epsilon. Under genotoxic conditions, the dpb2-103 cells progress through S phase faster than wild-type cells. Moreover, the Nrm1-dependent branch of the checkpoint, which regulates the expression of many replication checkpoint genes, is impaired in dpb2-103 cells. Finally, deletion of DDC1 in the dpb2-103 mutant is lethal supporting a model of strand-specific activation of the replication checkpoint. This lethality is suppressed by NRM1 deletion. We postulate that improper activation of the Nrm1-branch may explain inefficient replication checkpoint activation in Pol epsilon mutants.

Cassini UVIS observations of Titan ultraviolet airglow intensity dependence with solar zenith angle	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Titan; airglow; upper atmosphere; ultraviolet		The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) observed the airglow (dayglow and nightglow) of Titan over a range of solar zenith angles (SZA) from 14 to 150 degrees on five separate observations obtained between 2008 and 2012. The modeling of the solar cycle normalized UVIS observations indicates that a Chapman layer function provides a satisfactory fit to the intensity of the EUV and FUV airglow molecular emissions of the N-2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band system (LBH a1gX1 Sigma g+) the Carroll-Yoshino band system (c41 Sigma u+X1 Sigma g+) and of several atomic multiplets of nitrogen (NI, II) as a function of SZA. This result shows that the strongest contribution to the Titan dayglow occurs by processes (photoelectrons and photodissociation) involving the solar EUV flux rather than magnetospheric particle precipitation that dominates emission excitation in the nightglow.

Spectral analysis of Ahuna Mons from Dawn mission's visible-infrared spectrometer	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Ahuna Mons; spectroscopy; DAWN; VIR; Ceres; carbonates	ASTEROID 1 CERES; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; MINERALS; VESTA; WATER	Ahuna Mons is the highest mountain on Ceres. A unique complex in terms of size, shape, and morphology, Ahuna is bordered by flanks of the talus around its summit. Recent work by Ruesch et al. () based on Dawn's Framing Camera images shed light on the possible origin of Ahuna Mons. According to Ruesch et al. (2016), Ahuna Mons is formed by a volcanic process involving the ascent of cryomagma and extrusion onto the surface followed by dome development and subsequent spreading. Here we analyzed in detail the composition of Ahuna Mons, using data acquired by the visible and infrared spectrometer aboard Dawn. The spectral analysis reveals a relatively high abundance of carbonates and a nonhomogeneous variation in carbonate composition and abundance along Ahuna's flanks, associated with a lower amount of the Ceres's ubiquitous NH4-phyllosilicates over a large portion of the flanks. The grain size is coarser on the flanks than in the surrounding regions, suggesting the presence of fresher material, also compatible with a larger abundance of carbonates. Thermal variations are seen in Ahuna, supporting the evidence of different compactness of the surface regolith in specific locations. Results of the spectral analysis are consistent with a possible cryovolcanic origin which exposed fresher material that slid down on the flanks.	[Zambon, F.; Raponi, A.; Tosi, F.; De Sanctis, M.

Three-dimensional displacements of a large volcano flank movement during the May 2010 eruptions at Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Pacaya Volcano; three-dimensional (3-D) displacements; pixel offsets; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); volcano instability	SURFACE DEFORMATION; DIKE INTRUSION	Although massive flank failure is fairly common in the evolution of volcanoes, measurements of flank movement indicative of instability are rare. Here 3-D displacements from airborne radar amplitude images derived using an amplitude image pixel offset tracking technique show that the west and southwest flanks of Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala experienced large (similar to 4m), discrete landsliding that was ultimately aborted. Pixel offset tracking improved measurement recovery by nearly 50% over classic interferometric synthetic aperture radar techniques, providing unique measurements at the event. The 3-D displacement field shows that the flank moved coherently downslope along a complex failure surface involving both rotational and along-slope movement. Notably, the lack of continuous movement of the slide in the years leading up to the event emphasizes that active movement should not always be expected at volcanoes for which triggering factors (e.g., magmatic intrusions and eruptions) could precipitate sudden major flank instability.

Self-formed waterfall plunge pools in homogeneous rock	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						waterfalls; plunge pool erosion; bedrock erosion; knickpoint retreat; river incision; landscape evolution	SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; RIVER INCISION; BEDROCK; EROSION; MECHANICS; EVOLUTION; POTHOLES; VARIETY; RETREAT; ORIGIN	Waterfalls are ubiquitous, and their upstream propagation can set the pace of landscape evolution, yet no experimental studies have examined waterfall plunge pool erosion in homogeneous rock. We performed laboratory experiments, using synthetic foam as a bedrock simulant, to produce self-formed waterfall plunge pools via particle impact abrasion. Plunge pool vertical incision exceeded lateral erosion by approximately tenfold until pools deepened to the point that the supplied sediment could not be evacuated and deposition armored the pool bedrock floor. Lateral erosion of plunge pool sidewalls continued after sediment deposition, but primarily at the downstream pool wall, which might lead to undermining of the plunge pool lip, sediment evacuation, and continued vertical pool floor incision in natural streams. Undercutting of the upstream pool wall was absent, and our results suggest that vertical drilling of successive plunge pools is a more efficient waterfall retreat mechanism than the classic model of headwall undercutting and collapse in homogeneous rock.

Using GRACE to constrain precipitation amount over cold mountainous basins	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						precipitation; satellite; mountain; GRACE; GPCP; cold region	GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; PROJECT; PRODUCTS	Despite the importance for hydrology and climate-change studies, current quantitative knowledge on the amount and distribution of precipitation in mountainous and high-elevation regions is limited due to instrumental and retrieval shortcomings. Here by focusing on two large endorheic basins in High Mountain Asia, we show that satellite gravimetry (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) can be used to provide an independent estimate of monthly accumulated precipitation using mass balance equation. Results showed that the GRACE-based precipitation estimate has the highest agreement with most of the commonly used precipitation products in summer, but it deviates from them in cold months, when the other products are expected to have larger errors. It was found that most of the products capture about or less than 50% of the total precipitation estimated using GRACE in winter. Overall, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) showed better agreement with GRACE estimate than other products. Yet on average GRACE showed similar to 30% more annual precipitation than GPCP in the study basins. In basins of appropriate size with an absence of dense ground measurements, as is a typical case in cold mountainous regions, we find GRACE can be a viable alternative to constrain monthly and seasonal precipitation estimates from other remotely sensed precipitation products that show large bias.

Drifter observations of submesoscale flow kinematics in the coastal ocean	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						submesoscale; Lagrangian; kinematics	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BIGHT; GULF-OF-MEXICO; LAGRANGIAN OBSERVATIONS; CURRENT SYSTEM; PART I; MESOSCALE; SURFACE; TRANSITION; VORTICITY; MOTION	Fronts and eddies identified with aerial guidance are seeded with drifters to quantify submesoscale flow kinematics. The Lagrangian observations show mean divergence and vorticity values that can exceed 5 times the Coriolis frequency. Values are the largest observed in the field to date and represent an extreme departure from geostrophic dynamics. The study also quantifies errors and biases associated with Lagrangian observations of the underlying velocity strain tensor. The greatest error results from undersampling, even with a large number of drifters. A significant bias comes from inhomogeneous sampling of convergent regions that accumulate drifters within a few hours of deployment. The study demonstrates a Lagrangian sampling paradigm for targeted submesoscale structures over a broad range of scales and presents flow kinematic values associated with vertical velocities O(10)mh(-1) that can have profound implications on ocean biogeochemistry.

At and after the time of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake on 11 March 2011, and the Chile earthquake on 16 September 2015, the spacecraft was performing scans over the Pacific Ocean. Significant (similar to 10% relative to the ambient emission profiles) and coherent nighttime airglow perturbations were observed in the mesosphere following Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broad-band Emission Radiometry limb scans intercepting tsunami-induced atmospheric gravity waves. Simulations of emission variations are consistent with the physical characteristics of the disturbances at the locations of the corresponding SABER scans. Airglow observations and model simulations suggest that atmospheric neutral density and temperature perturbations can lead to the observed amplitude variations and multipeak structures in the emission profiles. This is the first time that airglow emission rate perturbations associated with tsunamis have been detected with space-based measurements.

D.; Pavone, Marco			Design, Control, and Experimentation of Internally-Actuated Rovers for the Exploration of Low-gravity Planetary Bodies	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article								This paper discusses the design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity (micro-g to milli-g) planetary bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or small moons. The rover is actuated by spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged in one sealed enclosure and enables the platform to be minimalistic, thereby reducing its cost. By controlling the spin rate of the flywheels, the rover can achieve large surface coverage by attitude-controlled hops, fine mobility by tumbling, and coarse instrument pointing by changing the orientation relative to the ground. We first discuss the dynamics of such rovers, their control, and key design features (e.g., flywheel shape and orientation, geometry of external spikes, and system engineering aspects). We then discuss the design and control of a first-of-a-kind test bed that enables the accurate emulation of a microgravity environment for mobility experiments, which consists of a three-degree-of-freedom gimbal attached to an actively controlled gantry crane. Finally, we present experimental results on the test bed that provide key insights for rover control and validate our theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the black hole mass of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0323+342	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						quasars: emission lines; quasars: individual: 1H 0323+342; galaxies: Seyfert-infrared: galaxies; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; RADIUS-LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIP; X-RAY; EMISSION-LINE; HOST-GALAXY; REGION; VARIABILITY; TELESCOPE; SPECTRUM; SAMPLE	Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies have been identified by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope as a rare class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei. The lowest redshift candidate among them is the source 1H 0323+342. Here we present quasi-simultaneous Gemini near-infrared and Keck optical spectroscopy for it, from which we derive a black hole mass based on both the broad Balmer and Paschen emission lines. We supplement these observations with a Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array X-ray spectrum taken about two years earlier, from which we constrain the black hole mass based on the short time-scale spectral variability. Our multiwavelength observations suggest a black hole mass of similar to 2 x 10(7) M-circle dot, which agrees well with previous estimates. We build the spectral energy distribution and show that it is dominated by the thermal and reprocessed emission from the accretion disc rather than the non-thermal jet component. A detailed spectral fitting with the energy-conserving accretion disc model of Done et al. constrains the Eddington ratio to L/L-Edd similar to 0.5 for a (non-rotating) Schwarzschild black hole and to L/L-Edd similar to 1 for a Kerr black hole with dimensionless spin of a* = 0.8. Higher spin values and so higher Eddington ratios are excluded, since they would strongly overpredict the observed soft X-ray flux.	[Landt, H.; Ward, M.

Our sub-grid accretion model captures the key scalings governing angular momentum transport by gravitational torques from galactic scales down to parsec scales, while our kinetic feedback implementation enables the injection of outflows with properties chosen to match observed nuclear outflows (star formation-driven winds are not included to isolate the effects of black hole feedback). We show that 'quasar mode' feedback can have a large impact on the thermal properties of the intergalactic medium and the growth of galaxies and massive black holes for kinetic feedback efficiencies as low as 0.1 per cent relative to the bolometric luminosity. None the less, our simulations indicate that the black hole-host scaling relations are only weakly dependent on the effects of black hole feedback on galactic scales, since black hole feedback suppresses the growth of galaxies and massive black holes by a similar amount. In contrast, the rate at which gravitational torques feed the central black hole relative to the host galaxy star formation rate governs the slope and normalization of the black hole-host correlations. Our results suggest that a common gas supply regulated by gravitational torques is the primary driver of the observed co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.

We validate this method using mock catalogues, before applying it to the analysis of the CMASS sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We find that this method enables accurate and precise measurements of cosmic expansion history and growth rate of large-scale structure. Modelling the 2DCF fully including non-linear effects and redshift space distortions in the scale range of 16-144 h(-1) Mpc, we find H(0.57) r(s)( z(d))/c = 0.0459 +/- 0.0006, DA(0.57)/r(s)( z(d)) = 9.011 +/- 0.073, and f(g)(0.57)sigma(8)(0.57) = 0.476 +/- 0.050, which correspond to precisions of 1.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent, and 10.5 per cent, respectively. We have defined r(s)(z(d)) to be the sound horizon at the drag epoch computed using a simple integral, f(g)(z) as the growth rate at redshift z, and sigma(8)(z) as the matter power spectrum normalization on 8 h(-1) Mpc scale at z. We find that neglecting the small-scale information significantly weakens the constraints on H(z) and D-A(z), and leads to a biased estimate of fg(z). Our results indicate that we can significantly tighten constraints on dark energy and modified gravity by reliably modelling small-scale galaxy clustering.

Assuming models with lognormal scatter about a median relation of the form M-star alpha M-halo(alpha), the preferred log-slope steepens from alpha similar or equal to 1.8 in the limit of zero scatter to alpha similar or equal to 2.6 in the case of 2 dex of scatter in M-star at fixed halo mass. We provide fitting functions for the best-fitting relations as a function of scatter, including cases where the relation becomes increasingly stochastic with decreasing mass. We show that if the scatter at fixed halo mass is large enough (greater than or similar to 1 dex) and if the median relation is steep enough (alpha greater than or similar to 2), then the ` too-big-to-fail' problem seen in the Local Group can be self-consistently eliminated in about similar to 5-10 per cent of realizations. This scenario requires that the most massive subhaloes host unobservable ultra-faint dwarfs fairly often; we discuss potentially observable signatures of these systems. Finally, we compare our derived constraints to recent high-resolution simulations of dwarf galaxy formation in the literature. Though simulation-to-simulation scatter in M-star at fixed M-halo is large among different authors (similar to 2 dex), individual codes produce relations with much less scatter and usually give relations that would overproduce local galaxy counts.

We study the long-term variability of the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1210 (also known as UGC4203, or the Phoenix galaxy). Methods. The source was observed by many X-ray facilities in the last 20 yr. Here we present a NuSTAR observation and put the results in the context of previously published observations. Results. NuSTAR observed Mrk 1210 in 2012 for 15.4 ks. The source showed Compton-thin obscuration similar to that observed by Chandra, Suzaku, BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton over the past two decades, but different from the first observation by ASCA in 1995, in which the active nucleus was caught in a low flux state or was obscured by Compton-thick matter with a reflection-dominated spectrum. Thanks to the high-quality hard X-ray spectrum obtained with NuSTAR and exploiting the long-term spectral coverage spanning 16.9 yr, we can precisely disentangle the transmission and reflection components and put constraints on both the intrinsic long-term variability and hidden nucleus scenarios. In the former case, the distance between the reflector and the source must be at least similar to 2 pc, while in the latter the eclipsing cloud may be identified with a water maser-emitting clump.

Physical properties derived from spectral energy distributions	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: starburst; galaxies: star formation; radio continuum: galaxies; submillimeter: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; DEEP-FIELD-SOUTH; FAR-INFRARED EMISSION; EVOLUTION SURVEY COSMOS; C II EMISSION; ALMA SURVEY; MU-M; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTION; RADIO CORRELATION; MOLECULAR GAS	Context. Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) in the early Universe are potential antecedents of the most massive galaxies we see in the present-day Universe. An important step towards quantifying this galactic evolutionary connection is to investigate the fundamental physical properties of SMGs, such as their stellar mass content (M-*) and star formation rate (SFR). Aims. We attempt to characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm selected, flux-limited, and interferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in the COSMOS field. Methods. We used the latest release of the MAGPHYS code to fit the multiwavelength (UV to radio) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 16 of the target SMGs, which lie at redshifts z similar or equal to 1.6-5.3. We also constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio bands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample, AzTEC 1 and AzTEC 3, benefit from previous (CO)-C-12-O-16 line observations, we studied their properties in more detail. Results. The median and 16th84th percentile ranges of M-*, infrared (8-1000 mum) luminosity (LIR), SFR, dust temperature (T-dust), and dust mass (M-dust) were derived to be log(M-*/M circle dot) = 10.96(-0.19)(+ 0.34), log(L-IR/L circle dot) = 12.93+ 0.09-0.19, SFR = 856(-310)(+191) M-circle dot yr(-1), Tdust = 40.6-(+7.5-)(8.1 K), and log(M-dust/M-circle dot) = 9.17(-0.33)(+0.03), respectively. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the galaxy main sequence by more than a factor of 3 and, hence, are starbursts. The 3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared with the present M-* estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are fairly consistent with the masssize relationship of z similar to 2 compact, quiescent galaxies (cQGs). The median radio spectral index is found to be alpha = -0.77(-0.42)(+0.28). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be q = 2.27(-0.13)(+0.27), which is lower than was measured locally (median q = 2.64). The gas-to-dust mass ratio for AzTEC 1 is derived to be delta(gdr) = 90(-19)(+23), while that for AzTEC 3 is 33(-18)(+28). AzTEC 1 is found to have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6(-0.)(+0.2)), while AzTEC 3 appears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two high-z SMGs would be exhausted in only similar to 86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR, respectively. Conclusions. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with those of equally bright SMGs in the ECDFS field (the ALESS SMGs) that are 870 mum selected and followed up by ALMA, suggests that the two populations share fairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. The somewhat higher Ldust for our sources (factor of 1.9(-1.6) (+9.3) on average) can originate in the longer selection wavelength of 1.1 mm. Although the derived median a is consistent with a canonical synchrotron spectral index, some of our SMGs exhibit spectral flattening or steepening, which can be attributed to different cosmic-ray energy gain and loss mechanisms. A hint of negative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of starburstiness and, hence, cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might be more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q values (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific merger or post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results, such as the M(*)3 GHz radio size analysis and comparison with the stellar masses of z similar to 2 cQGs in concert with the star formation properties of AzTEC 1 and 3, support the scenario where z > 3 SMGs evolve into the present day giant, gas-poor ellipticals	[Miettinen, O.; Delvecchio, I.; Smolcic, V.; Novak, M.] Univ Zagreb, Dept Phys, Bijenicka Cesta 32, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Aravena, M.] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ingn, Nucl Astron, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Karim, A.] Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, Hugel 71, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Murphy, E.

Discovery of a low-mass companion inside the debris ring surrounding the F5V star HD 206893	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						brown dwarfs; circumstellar matter; planet-disk interactions; planetary systems	GEMINI PLANET IMAGER; BROWN DWARFS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; BETA-PICTORIS; GIANT PLANETS; DISK; EXOPLANETS; CORONAGRAPH; PHOTOMETRY; REDUCTION	Aims. Uncovering the ingredients and the architecture of planetary systems is a very active field of research that has fuelled many new theories on giant planet formation, migration, composition, and interaction with the circumstellar environment. We aim at discovering and studying new such systems, to further expand our knowledge of how low-mass companions form and evolve. Methods. We obtained high-contrast H-band images of the circumstellar environment of the F5V star HD 206893, known to host a debris disc never detected in scattered light. These observations are part of the SPHERE High Angular Resolution Debris Disc Survey (SHARDDS) using the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) installed on VLT/SPHERE. Results. We report the detection of a source with a contrast of 3 : 6 x 10(-5) in the H-band, orbiting at a projected separation of 270 milliarcsec or 10 au, corresponding to a mass in the range 24 to 73 M-Jup for an age of the system in the range 0.2 to 2 Gyr. The detection was confirmed ten months later with VLT /NaCo, ruling out a background object with no proper motion. A faint extended emission compatible with the disc scattered light signal is also observed. Conclusions. The detection of a low-mass companion inside a massive debris disc makes this system an analog of other young planetary systems such as beta Pictoris, HR 8799 or HD 95086 and requires now further characterisation of both components to understand their interactions.

Thermally averaged cyclotron scattering cross sections, mean free photon-path tables, and electron momentum sampling	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						X-rays: binaries; stars: neutron; methods: numerical	STRONG MAGNETIC-FIELDS; LINE FORMATION; COMPTONIZATION; ABSORPTION; RADIATION; EMISSION; GEOMETRY	Context. Electron cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are observed as absorption-like lines in the spectra of X-ray pulsars. A significant fraction of the computing time for Monte Carlo simulations of these quantum mechanical features is spent on the calculation of the mean free path for each individual photon before scattering, since it involves a complex numerical integration over the scattering cross section and the (thermal) velocity distribution of the scattering electrons. Aims. We aim to numerically calculate interpolation tables which can be used in CRSF simulations to sample the mean free path of the scattering photon and the momentum of the scattering electron. The tables also contain all the information required for sampling the scattering electron's final spin. Methods. The tables were calculated using an adaptive Simpson integration scheme. The energy and angle grids were refined until a prescribed accuracy is reached. The tables are used by our simulation code to produce artificial CRSF spectra. The electron momenta sampled during these simulations were analyzed and justified using theoretically determined boundaries. Results. We present a complete set of tables suited for mean free path calculations of Monte Carlo simulations of the cyclotron scattering process for conditions expected in typical X-ray pulsar accretion columns (0.01 <= B/B-crit <= 0.12, where B-crit = 4.413 x 10(13) G, and 3 keV <= k(B)T <= 15 keV). The sampling of the tables is chosen such that the results have an estimated relative error of at most 1 = 15 for all points in the grid. The tables are available online (see link in footnote, page 1).

(Sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of COSMOS/AzTEC submillimetre galaxies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; large-scale structure of Universe; submillimeter: galaxies	PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; AZTEC MILLIMETER SURVEY; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; POINT-SOURCE CATALOG; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; WIDE-FIELD SURVEY; C II EMISSION; HIGH-REDSHIFT; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES	We investigate the environment of 23 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) drawn from a signal-to-noise (S/N)-limited sample of SMGs originally discovered in the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)/AzTEC 1.1 mm continuum survey of a Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) subfield and then followed up with the Submillimetre Array and Plateau de Bure Interferometer at 890 mu m and 1.3 mm, respectively. These SMGs already have well-defined multiwavelength counterparts and redshifts. We also analyse the environments of four COSMOS SMGs spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshifts z(spec) > 4 : 5, and one at z(spec) = 2 : 49 resulting in a total SMG sample size of 28. We search for overdensities using the COSMOS photometric redshifts based on over 30 UV-NIR photometric measurements including the new UltraVISTA data release 2 and Spitzer/SPLASH data, and reaching an accuracy of sigma(Delta z/(1+z)) = (1 + z) = 0 : 0067 (0 : 0155) at z < 3 : 5 (> 3.5). To identify overdensities we apply the Voronoi tessellation analysis, and estimate the redshift-space overdensity estimator delta(g) as a function of distance from the SMG and/or overdensity centre. We test and validate our approach via simulations, X-ray detected groups or clusters, and spectroscopic verifications using VUDS and zCOSMOS catalogues which show that even with photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field we can e ffi ciently retrieve overdensities out to z approximate to 5. Our results yield that 11 out of 23 (48%) JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm SMGs occupy overdense environments. Considering the entire JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm S = N >= 4 sample and taking the expected fraction of spurious detections into account, this means that 35-61% of the SMGs in the S/N-limited sample occupy overdense environments. We perform an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2 keV band using a 32 '' aperture and our SMG positions, and find statistically significant detections. For our z < 2 subsample we find an average flux of (4.0 +/- 0.8) x 10(-16) erg s(-1) cm(-2) and a corresponding total mass of M-200 = 2.8 x 10(13) M-circle dot. The z > 2 subsample yields an average flux of (1.3 +/- 0.5) x 10(-16) erg s(-1) cm(-2) and a corresponding total mass of M-200 = 2 x 10(13) M-circle dot. Our results suggest a higher occurrence of SMGs occupying overdense environments at z >= 3 than at z < 3. This may be understood if highly star-forming galaxies can only be formed in the highest peaks of the density field tracing the most massive dark matter haloes at early cosmic epochs, while at later times cosmic structure may have matured su ffi ciently that more modest overdensities correspond to su ffi ciently massive haloes to form SMGs.

VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS): IGM transmission towards galaxies with 2.5 < z < 5.5 and the colour selection of high-redshift galaxies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						Galaxy: evolution; Galaxy: formation; galaxies: high-redshift; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	LYMAN-BREAK GALAXIES; LY-ALPHA FOREST; COSMIC STAR-FORMATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CLUMPY UNIVERSE; QUASAR SPECTRA; EVOLUTION	The observed UV rest-frame spectra of distant galaxies are the result of their intrinsic emission combined with absorption along the line of sight produced by the inter-galactic medium (IGM). Here we analyse the evolution of the mean IGM transmission Tr(Ly alpha) and its dispersion along the line of sight for 2127 galaxies with 2.5 < z < 5.5 in the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We fitted model spectra combined with a range of IGM transmission to the galaxy spectra using the spectral fitting algorithm GOSSIP(+). We used these fits to derive the mean IGM transmission towards each galaxy for several redshift slices from z = 2.5 to z = 5.5. We found that the mean IGM transmission defined as Tr(Ly alpha) = e(-tau) (with tau as the HI optical depth) is 79%, 69%, 59%, 55%, and 46% at redshifts 2.75, 3.22, 3.70, 4.23, and 4.77, respectively. We compared these results to measurements obtained from quasar lines of sight and found that the IGM transmission towards galaxies is in excellent agreement with quasar values up to redshift z similar to 4. We found tentative evidence for a higher IGM transmission at z >= 4 compared to results from QSOs, but a degeneracy between dust extinction and IGM prevents us from firmly concluding whether the internal dust extinction for star-forming galaxies at z > 4 takes a mean value significantly in excess of E(B-V) > 0.15. Most importantly, we found a large dispersion of IGM transmission along the lines of sight towards distant galaxies with 68% of the distribution within 10 to 17% of the median value in delta z = 0 : 5 bins, similar to what is found on the lines of sight towards QSOs. We demonstrate that taking this broad range of IGM transmission into account is important when selecting high-redshift galaxies based on their colour properties (e.g. LBG or photometric redshift selection) because failing to do so causes a significant incompleteness in selecting high-redshift galaxy populations. We finally discuss the observed IGM properties and speculate that the broad range of observed transmissions might be the result of cosmic variance and clustering along lines of sight. This clearly shows that the sources that cause this extinction need to be more completely modelled.	[Thomas, R.; Le Fevre, O.; Le Brun, V.; Cassata, P.; Lemaux, B. C.; Tasca, L. A.

The number and quality of these detections is limited in part by thermally induced vibrations in the mirrors, which show up as noise in these interferometers. One way to reduce this thermally induced noise is to use low temperature mirrors made of high purity single-crystalline silicon. However, these low temperatures must be achieved without increasing the mechanical vibration of the mirror surface or the vibration of any surface within close proximity to the mirrors. The vibration of either surface can impose a noise inducing phase shift on the light within the interferometer or physically push the mirror through oscillating radiation pressure. This paper proposes a system for the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) to achieve the dual goals of low temperature and low vibration to reduce the thermally induced noise in silicon mirrors. Experimental results are obtained at Stanford University to prove that these dual goals can be realized simultaneously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Realistic 3-D cirri are modeled with the 3DCLOUD code, and top-of-atmosphere radiances are simulated by the 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer (RT) algorithm 3DMCPOL for two (8.65 m and 12.05 m) channels of the Imaging Infrared Radiometer on CALIPSO. At nadir, comparisons of 1-D and 3-D RT show that 3-D radiances are larger than their 1-D counterparts for direct emission but smaller for scattered radiation. For our cirrus cases, 99% of the 3-D total radiance is computed by the third scattering order, which corresponds to 90% of the total computational effort, but larger optical thicknesses need more scattering orders. To radically accelerate the 3-D RT computations (using only few percent of 3-D RT time with a Monte Carlo code), even in the presence of large optical depths, we develop a hybrid model based on exact 3-D direct emission, the first scattering order from 1-D in each homogenized column, and an empirical adjustment linearly dependent on the optical thickness to account for higher scattering orders. Good agreement is found between the hybrid model and the exact 3-D radiances for two very different cirrus models without changing the empirical parameters. We anticipate that a future deterministic implementation of the hybrid model will be fast enough to process multiangle thermal imagery in a practical tomographic reconstruction of 3-D cirrus fields.

Reliability physics behind the QFN state of stress	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							PREDICTED STRESSES; THERMAL-STRESSES	A physically meaningful analytical stress model is developed for the explanation of the reliability physics underlying the relief in the thermally induced interfacial shearing stresses in a typical Quad Flat No-lead (QFN) assembly. The stress relief in a QFN design is, in effect, an implementation of the general concept developed and quantified by the first author about a decade ago of using inhomogeneous bonds for lower thermal stresses in adhesively bonded or soldered assemblies. It is shown also that the maximum stress in the QFN design can be minimized, if the lengths of the peripheral zones are established based on the requirement that the stresses at the ends of the assembly are made equal to the stresses at the ends of its mid-portion. In the carried out numerical example the gain in the relief in the maximum interfacial shearing stress owing to the application of a bond with an elevated compliance is 9.94 %. When the optimized inhomogeneous bond is applied, the gain is 16.87 %. The gain in the stress relief owing to the optimized inhomogeneous bond (with respect to the homogeneous compliant bond) is 10.66 %. The computed interfacial stresses are below the yield stress of the solder material.

COLI; TEMPERATURE; MICROORGANISMS	Temperature is a unique input signal that could be used by engineered microbial therapeutics to sense and respond to host conditions or spatially targeted external triggers such as focused ultrasound. To enable these possibilities, we present two families of tunable, orthogonal, temperature-dependent transcriptional repressors providing switch-like control of bacterial " gene expression at thresholds spanning the biomedically relevant range of 32-46 degrees C. We integrate these molecular bioswitches into thermal logic circuits and demonstrate their utility in three in vivo microbial therapy scenarios, including spatially precise activation using focused ultrasound, modulation of activity in response to a host fever, and self-destruction after fecal elimination to prevent environmental escape. This technology provides a critical capability for coupling endogenous or applied thermal signals to cellular function in basic research, biomedical and industrial applications.

Impacts of increasing aridity and wildfires on aerosol loading in the intermountain Western US	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						aridity; wildfires; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; IMPROVE	UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; PROJECTIONS; DROUGHT; CARBON; FIRES; MODEL	Feedbacks between climate warming, land surface aridity, and wildfire-derived aerosols represent a large source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. Here, long-term observations of aerosol optical depth, surface level aerosol loading, fire-area burned, and hydrologic simulations are used to show that regional-scale increases in aridity and resulting wildfires have significantly increased summertime aerosol loading in remote high elevation regions of the Intermountain West of the United States. Surface summertime organic aerosol loading and total aerosol optical depth were both strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with aridity and fire area burned at high elevation sites across major western US mountain ranges. These results demonstrate that surface-level organic aerosol loading is dominated by summertime wildfires at many high elevation sites. This analysis provides new constraints for climate projections on the influence of drought and resulting wildfires on aerosol loading. These empirical observations will help better constrain projected increases in organic aerosol loading with increased fire activity under climate change.	[Hallar, A.

J	Mirocha, J; Furlanetto, SR; Sun, GC				Mirocha, Jordan; Furlanetto, Steven R.; Sun, Guochao			The global 21-cm signal in the context of the high-z galaxy luminosity function	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: high-redshift; intergalactic medium; galaxies: luminosity function, mass function; dark ages, reionization, first stars; diffuse radiation	X-RAY BINARIES; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; 21 CM SIGNAL; PRE-REIONIZATION ERA; DARK-MATTER HALOES; SIMILAR-TO 20; INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM; HIGH-REDSHIFT; ULTRAVIOLET LUMINOSITY; POWER SPECTRUM	We build a new model for the global 21-cm signal that is calibrated to measurements of the high-z galaxy luminosity function (LF) and further tuned to match the Thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background, tau(e). Assuming that the z less than or similar to 8 galaxy population can be smoothly extrapolated to higher redshifts, the recent decline in best-fitting values of tau(e) and the inefficient heating induced by X-ray binaries (the presumptive sources of the high-z X-ray background) imply that the entirety of cosmic reionization and reheating occurs at z less than or similar to 12. In contrast to past global 21-cm models, whose z similar to 20 (nu similar to 70 MHz) absorption features and strong similar to 25 mK emission features were driven largely by the assumption of efficient early star formation and X-ray heating, our new models peak in absorption at. similar to 110 MHz at depths similar to-160 mK and have negligible emission components. Current uncertainties in the faint-end of the LF, binary populations in star-forming galaxies, and UV and X-ray escape fractions introduce similar to 20 MHz (similar to 50 mK) deviations in the trough's frequency (amplitude), while emission signals remain weak (less than or similar to 10 mK) and are confined to nu greater than or similar to 140 MHz. These predictions, which are intentionally conservative, suggest that the detection of a 21-cm absorption minimum at frequencies below similar to 90 MHz and/or emission signals stronger than similar to 10mK at nu less than or similar to 140 MHz would provide strong evidence for ` new' sources at high redshifts, such as Population III stars and their remnants.

An observed link between AGN Eddington ratio and narrow-emission-line ratios	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; MASS-METALLICITY RELATION; BLACK-HOLE GROWTH; SHELL ABSORPTION-LINES; QUASI-STELLAR OBJECTS; ULTRA-FAST OUTFLOWS; STAR-FORMATION RATE; HOST GALAXIES; OPTICALLY DULL	We investigate the observed relationship between black hole mass (M-BH), bolometric luminosity (L-bol) and Eddington ratio (lambda(Edd)) with optical emission-line ratios ([N II] lambda 6583/H alpha, [S II] lambda lambda 6716, 6731/H alpha, [O I] lambda 6300/H alpha, [O III] lambda 5007/H beta, [Ne III] lambda 3869/H beta and He II lambda 4686/H beta) of hard X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. We show that the [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio exhibits a significant correlation with lambda(Edd) (R-Pear = -0.44, p-value = 3 x 10(-13), sigma = 0.28 dex), and the correlation is not solely driven by M-BH or L-bol. The observed correlation between [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio and M-BH is stronger than the correlation with L-bol, but both are weaker than the lambda(Edd) correlation. This implies that the large-scale narrow lines of AGN host galaxies carry information about the accretion state of the AGN central engine. We propose that [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha is a useful indicator of Eddington ratio with 0.6 dex of rms scatter, and that it can be used to measure lambda(Edd) and thus M-BH from the measured L-bol, even for high-redshift obscured AGN. We briefly discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this correlation, such as the mass-metallicity relation, X-ray heating, and radiatively driven outflows.

Cluster selection functions for next-generation surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; surveys; galaxies: abundances; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; RICHNESS-MASS RELATION; GALAXY CLUSTERS; X-RAY; SCALING RELATIONS; HIGH-REDSHIFT; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; OBSERVED GROWTH; FIELD SURVEY	We present the cluster selection function for three of the largest next-generation stage-IV surveys in the optical and infrared: Euclid-Optimistic, Euclid-Pessimistic and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). To simulate these surveys, we use the realistic mock catalogues introduced in the first paper of this series. We detected galaxy clusters using the Bayesian Cluster Finder in the mock catalogues. We then modelled and calibrated the total cluster stellar mass observable-theoretical mass (M-CL*-M-h) relation using a power-law model, including a possible redshift evolution term. We find a moderate scatter of sigma(MCL*)vertical bar(Mh) of 0.124, 0.135 and 0.136 dex for Euclid-Optimistic, Euclid-Pessimistic and LSST, respectively, comparable to other work over more limited ranges of redshift. Moreover, the three data sets are consistent with negligible evolution with redshift, in agreement with observational and simulation results in the literature. We find that Euclid-Optimistic will be able to detect clusters with >80 per cent completeness and purity down to 8 x 10(13) h(-1) M-circle dot up to z < 1. At higher redshifts, the same completeness and purity are obtained with the larger mass threshold of 2 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot up to z = 2. The Euclid-Pessimistic selection function has a similar shape with similar to 10 per cent higher mass limit. LSST shows similar to 5 per cent higher mass limit than Euclid-Optimistic up to z < 0.7 and increases afterwards, reaching a value of 2 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot at z = 1.4. Similar selection functions with only 80 per cent completeness threshold have also been computed. The complementarity of these results with selection functions for surveys in other bands is discussed.	[Ascaso, B.; Bartlett, J.

CARMA observations of massive Planck-discovered cluster candidates at z greater than or similar to 0.5 associated with WISE overdensities: breaking the size-flux degeneracy	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe; infrared: galaxies; radio continuum: general	SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH OBSERVATIONS; ARCMINUTE MICROKELVIN IMAGER; X-RAY MEASUREMENTS; GALAXY CLUSTERS; PRESSURE PROFILE; JOINT ANALYSIS; RADIO-SOURCES; HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM; SCALING RELATIONS; VIRIAL RADIUS	We use a Bayesian software package to analyse CARMA-8 data towards 19 unconfirmed Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-cluster candidates from Rodriguez-Gonzalvez et al. that are associated with significant overdensities in WISE. We use two cluster parameterizations, one based on a (fixed shape) generalized-NFW (gNFW) pressure profile and another on a beta gas density profile (with varying shape parameters) to obtain parameter estimates from the CARMA-8 data for the nine CARMA-8-detected clusters. Results from the beta model show that our cluster candidates exhibit a heterogeneous set of brightness-temperature profiles. Comparison of Planck and CARMA-8 measurements show good agreement in Y-500 and an absence of obvious biases. Applying a Planck prior in Y(500)to the CARMA-8 gNFW results reduces uncertainties in Y-500 and Theta(500) dramatically (by a factor >4), relative to the independent Planck or CARMA-8 measurements. From this combined analysis, we find that our sample is comprised of massive (Y-500 ranging from 3.3(-0.2)(+0.2) to 10(-1.5)(+1.1) x10(-4) arcmin(2), sd=2.2x10(-4)), relatively compact (theta(500) ranging from 2.1(-0.3)(+0.1) to 5.5(-0.8)(+0.2) arcmin, sd=1.0) systems. Spectroscopic Keck/MOSFIRE data confirmed a galaxy member of one of our cluster candidates at z = 0.565. At the preferred photometric redshift of 0.5, we estimate the cluster mass M-500 approximate to 0.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(15) M-circle dot. We here demonstrate a powerful technique to find massive clusters at intermediate (z greater than or similar to 0.5) redshifts using a cross-correlation between Planck and WISE data, with high-resolution CARMA-8 follow-up. We also use the combined capabilities of Planck and CARMA-8 to obtain a dramatic reduction, by a factor of several, in parameter uncertainties.	[Rodriguez-Gonzalvez, C.; Chary, R.

Chemistry is represented by a reduced kinetics mechanism containing 74 species and 976 reactions (reduced from Caltech-Mech). The effect of pressure has been isolated by fixing the Karlovitz numbers, the Lewis numbers, and the ratio of integral length scale to laminar flame thickness. On one hand, the results suggest that pressure has very limited effect on the mean heat release rate, such that turbulent burning velocity is proportional to the turbulent surface area. In addition, while the chemical pathways are strongly affected by pressure in laminar flames, the global effect of turbulence on these pathways is negligible, independent of pressure. On the other hand, the local distribution of heat release rate was found to be significantly affected by pressure through differential diffusion-chemistry effects.

Rapid decadal convective precipitation increase over Eurasia during the last three decades of the 20th century	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							NORTHERN EURASIA; WATER-VAPOR; CLIMATE; FREQUENCY; TEMPERATURE; EXTREMES; INTENSITY; MODELS; IMPACT; CMIP3	Convective precipitation-localized, short-lived, intense, and sometimes violent-is at the root of challenges associated with observation, simulation, and prediction of precipitation. The understanding of long-term changes in convective precipitation characteristics and their role in precipitation extremes and intensity over extratropical regions are imperative to future water resource management; however, they have been studied very little. We show that annual convective precipitation total has been increasing astonishingly fast, at a rate of 18.4%/degrees C, of which 16% is attributable to an increase in convective precipitation occurrence, and 2.4% is attributable to increased daily intensity based on the 35 years of two (combined) historical data sets of 3-hourly synoptic observations and daily precipitation. We also reveal that annual daily precipitation extreme has been increasing at a rate of about 7.4%/degrees C in convective events only. Concurrently, the overall increase in mean daily precipitation intensity is mostly due to increased convective precipitation, possibly at the expanse of nonconvective precipitation. As a result, transitional seasons are becoming more summer-like as convective becomes the dominant precipitation type that has accompanied higher daily extremes and intensity since the late 1980s. The data also demonstrate that increasing convective precipitation and daily extremes appear to be directly linearly associated with higher atmospheric water vapor accompanying a warming climate over northern Eurasia.

A model porphyrin system was chosen to study the influence of the solvent on lateral hole hopping, which plays a crucial role in the charge-transfer kinetics. We examined the influence of water, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate as solvents. Hole-hopping lifetimes varied by nearly 3 orders of magnitude among solvents, ranging from 3 ns in water to 2800 ns in propylene carbonate, and increased nonlinearly as a function of added acetonitrile in aqueous solvent mixtures. These results elucidate the important roles of solvation, molecular packing dynamics, and lateral charge-transfer mechanisms that have implications for all dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical device designs.

J	Kwok, K; Pellegrino, S				Kwok, Kawai; Pellegrino, Sergio			Micromechanics Models for Viscoelastic Plain-Weave Composite Tape Springs	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article							DEPLOYMENT; BEHAVIOR; CREEP; RELAXATION; ONBOARD	The viscoelastic behavior of polymer composites decreases the deployment force and the postdeployment shape accuracy of composite deployable space structures. This paper presents a viscoelastic model for single-ply cylindrical shells (tape springs) that are deployed after being held folded for a given period of time. The model is derived from a representative unit cell of the composite material, based on the microstructure geometry. Key ingredients are the fiber volume density in the composite tows and the constitutive behavior of the fibers (assumed to be linear elastic and transversely isotropic) and of the matrix (assumed to be linear viscoelastic). Finite-element-based homogenizations at two scales are conducted to obtain the Prony series that characterize the orthotropic behavior of the composite tow, using the measured relaxation modulus of the matrix as an input. A further homogenization leads to the lamina relaxation ABD matrix. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified against the experimentally measured time-dependent compliance of single lamina in either pure tension or pure bending. Finite element simulations of single-ply tape springs based on the proposed model are compared to experimental measurements that were also obtained during this study.

Here we present the results of a 2.4 Ms NuSTAR observing campaign aimed at studying the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We perform spatially resolved spectroscopic analyses of the Ti-44 ejecta, which we use to determine the Doppler shift and thus the three-dimensional (3D) velocities of the 44Ti ejecta. We find an initial Ti-44 mass of (1.54 +/- 0.21) x 10(-4) M-circle dot, which has a present-day average momentum direction of 340 degrees +/- 15 degrees projected onto the plane of the sky (measured clockwise from celestial north) and is tilted by 58 degrees +/- 20 degrees into the plane of the sky away from the observer, roughly opposite to the inferred direction of motion of the central compact object. We find some Ti-44 ejecta that are clearly interior to the reverse shock and some that are clearly exterior to it. Where we observe Ti-44 ejecta exterior to the reverse shock we also see shock-heated iron; however, there are regions where we see iron but do not observe Ti-44. This suggests that the local conditions of the supernova shock during explosive nucleosynthesis varied enough to suppress the production of Ti-44 by at least a factor of two in some regions, even in regions that are assumed to be the result of processes like alpha-rich freezeout that should produce both iron and titanium.

OGLE Collaboration; Spitzer Microlensing Team	OGLE-2015-BLG-0196: GROUND-BASED GRAVITATIONAL MICROLENS PARALLAX CONFIRMED BY SPACE-BASED OBSERVATION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; gravitational lensing: micro	SPITZER OBSERVATIONS; GALACTIC BULGE; SATELLITE MASS; OGLE-III; LENS; PHOTOMETRY; DISTANCES; SYSTEMS; PLANET; STARS	In this paper, we present an analysis of the binary gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0196. The event lasted for almost a year, and the light curve exhibited significant deviations from the lensing model based on the rectilinear lens-source relative motion, enabling us to measure the microlens parallax. The ground-based microlens parallax is confirmed by the data obtained from space-based microlens observations using the Spitzer telescope. By additionally measuring the angular Einstein radius from the analysis of the resolved caustic crossing, the physical parameters of the lens are determined up to the twofold degeneracy, u(0) < 0 and u(0) > 0, solutions caused by the well-known "ecliptic" degeneracy. It is found that the binary lens is composed of two M dwarf stars with similar masses, M-1 = 0.38 +/- 0.04M(circle plus) (0.50 +/- 0.05M(circle plus)) and M-2 = 0.38 +/- 0.04M(circle plus) (0.55 +/- 0.06M(circle plus)), and the distance to the lens is D-L = 2.77. +/- 0.23 kpc (3.30 +/- 0.29 kpc). Here the physical parameters outside and inside the parentheses are for the u(0) < 0 and u(0) > 0 solutions, respectively.

The existence of these high-mass stars that apparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm, which requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to understand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is necessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming. With the Hubble. Space. Telescope, we observe the seven most isolated massive (> 8 M-circle dot) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large. Magellanic. Cloud. The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other MYSOs, OB associations, and even known giant molecular clouds, they are actually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals similar to 100 to several hundred pre-mainsequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously undetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in most cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions. Contrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations suggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses less than 100 M-circle dot. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for isolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with random sampling of the initial mass function. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we find evidence that isolated clusters containing O stars can exist, which in itself is rare.

Although solved routinely in the course of power grid operations, it is known to be strongly NP-hard in general, and weakly NP-hard over tree networks. In this paper, we formulate the optimal power flow problem over tree networks as an inference problem over a tree-structured graphical model where the nodal variables are low-dimensional vectors. We adapt the standard dynamic programming algorithm for inference over a tree-structured graphical model to the OPF problem. Combining this with an interval discretization of the nodal variables, we develop an approximation algorithm for the OPF problem. Further, we use techniques from constraint programming (CP) to perform interval computations and adaptive bound propagation to obtain practically efficient algorithms. Compared to previous algorithms that solve OPF with optimality guarantees using convex relaxations, our approach is able to work for arbitrary tree-structured distribution networks and handle mixed-integer optimization problems. Further, it can be implemented in a distributed message-passing fashion that is scalable and is suitable for "smart grid" applications like control of distributed energy resources. Numerical evaluations on several benchmark networks show that practical OPF problems can be solved effectively using this approach.

Naturally, the bulk properties of a heterogeneous material can be different from those of its constituents. Thus, one needs to determine its overall or effective properties. For some of these properties, like effective elastic modulus, the characterization is well-known, while for other such as effective fracture toughness, it is a matter of ongoing research. In this paper, we present a method to measure the effective fracture toughness. For the method, we apply a time-dependent displacement condition called the surfing boundary condition. This boundary condition leads the crack to propagate steadily macroscopically but in an unconstrained manner microscopically. We then use the grid method, a non-contact full-field displacement measurement technique, to obtain the displacement gradient. With this field, we compute the macroscopic energy release rate via the area J-integral. Finally, we interpret the effective toughness as the peak of the energy release rate. Using this method, we investigate the influence of heterogeneity on effective fracture toughness. We find that the effective toughness can be enhanced due to the heterogeneity. Consequently, engineered heterogeneity may provide a means to improve fracture toughness in solids.

As a consequence, we obtain the following rigidity theorem for p-adic local systems on a connected rigid analytic variety: if the stalk of such a local system at one point, regarded as a p-adic Galois representation, is de Rham in the sense of Fontaine, then the stalk at every point is de Rham. Along the way, we also establish some basic properties of the p-adic Simpson correspondence. Finally, we give an application of our results to Shimura varieties.

J	Mbengue, C; Schneider, T				Mbengue, Cheikh; Schneider, Tapio			Storm-Track Shifts under Climate Change: Toward a Mechanistic Understanding Using Baroclinic Mean Available Potential Energy	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION RESPONSE; EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; LIMITED REGION; THERMAL STRATIFICATION; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; HADLEY CIRCULATION; EDDY; EDDIES; WAVE	Zonal-mean storm-track shifts in response to perturbations in climate occur even in idealized simulations of dry atmospheres with axisymmetric forcing. Nonetheless, a generally accepted theory of the mechanisms controlling the storm-track shifts is still lacking. Here, mean available potential energy (MAPE), a general measure of baroclinicity that is proportional to the square of the Eady growth rate, is used to understand storm-track shifts. It is demonstrated that, in dry atmospheres, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in a storm track is linearly related to the mean available potential energy, relative to a local reference state, and that maxima of the two are generally collocated in latitude. Changes in MAPE with climate are then decomposed into components. It is shown that in simulations of dry atmospheres, changes in the latitude of maximum MAPE are dominated by changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. By contrast, changes in the magnitude of MAPE are primarily determined by changes in static stability and in the depth of the troposphere. Atheory of storm-track shifts may build upon these findings and primarily needs to explain changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. The terminus of the Hadley circulation often shifts in tandem with storm tracks and is hypothesized to play an important role in triggering the storm-track shifts seen in this idealized dry context, especially in simulations where increases only in the convective static stability in the deep tropics suffice to shift storm tracks poleward.

Broadband Electromechanical Spectroscopy: A Method for Measuring the Dynamic Electromechanical Response of Ferroelectrics	MICRO AND NANOMECHANICS, VOL 5	Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series		English	Proceedings Paper	SEM Annual Conference and Exposition on Experimental and Applied Mechanics	JUN 06-09, 2016	Orlando, FL	Soc Expt Mech		Dynamic mechanical analysis; Electromechanical loading; Ferroelectricity; Lead zirconate titanate; Viscoelasticity	ELECTRIC-FIELD; DEPENDENCE; CONSTANTS	To gain a better understanding of the dynamic response of thermo-electro-mechanically coupled materials, in particular stiffness and mechanical damping, an experimental apparatus and method called Broadband Electromechanical Spectroscopy (BES) has been developed. The motivation for creating BES was to study the behavior of ferroelectric materials (and other electro-active materials) over wide ranges of frequencies of simultaneously-applied electric fields and mechanical stresses under accurate temperature control. By precisely controlling electric fields and mechanical loading, the effect of microstructural changes, in particular domain switching in ferroelectrics, on the material's dynamic mechanical response is measured. Experiments show large increases in mechanical damping during domain switching that can be tuned by appropriate electrical loading. Results obtained using the new capabilities brought by BES can be used to better understand the damping associated with domain wall motion to be able to create ceramic materials with both high stiffness and high damping-an elusive combination of properties in typical engineering materials. The design and use of the apparatus along with results obtained from tests on a particular ferroelectric, viz. lead zirconate titanate, are presented.

Na-exchange of Sn-Beta titrates the neighboring SiOH group in the open Sn site and shifts catalyst selectivity to mannose formed by a 1,2-C-shift reaction. To probe structure/activity relationships in the zeolite, tin-containing silsesquioxanes with (1a) and without (1b) a neighboring SiOH group were recently synthesized and tested. These molecular catalysts are active for glucose conversion, and the presence (absence) of the SiOH favors fructose (mannose) selectivity by intramolecular H(C)-shift reactions. Using density functional theory, we investigated numerous H/C-shift pathways on these tin-silsesquioxane catalysts. On both la and lb, the H-shift reaction occurs through a bidentate binding mode without participation of the SiOH, while the bidentate binding mode is not favored for the C-shift due to steric hindrance. Instead, the C-shift reaction occurs through different concerted reaction pathways, in which an acetylacetonate (acac) ligand interacts with the substrate in the transition state complexes. Favorable H-shift pathways without SiOH participation and acac ligand promotion of the C-shift pathway explain why la produces mannose from C-shift reactions instead of exclusively catalyzing H-shift reactions, as the Sn-Beta open site does.

Assuming membership in the AB Dor group, as suggested from its kinematics, the inferred mass of 2M2236+4751 b is 11-14. M-Jup. Follow-up Keck/OSIRIS K-band spectroscopy of the companion reveals strong CO absorption similar to other faint red L dwarfs and lacks signs of methane absorption, despite having an effective temperature of approximate to 900-1200 K. With a (J-K)(MKO) color of 2.69 +/- 0.12 mag, the near-infrared slope of 2M2236+4751 b is redder than all of the HR 8799 planets and instead resembles the approximate to 23 Myr isolated planetary-mass object PSO J318.5-22, implying that similarly thick photospheric clouds can persist in the atmospheres of giant planets at ages beyond 100 Myr. In near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams, 2M2236+4751 b is located at the tip of the red L dwarf sequence and appears to define the "elbow" of the AB Dor substellar isochrone separating low-gravity L dwarfs from the cooler young T dwarf track. 2M2236+4751 b is the reddest substellar companion to a star and will be a valuable benchmark to study the shared atmospheric properties of young low-mass brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets.

SPATIALLY RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY OF EUROPA'S LARGE-SCALE COMPOSITIONAL UNITS AT 3-4 mu m WITH KECK NIRSPEC	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: composition; planets and satellites: individual (Europa); planets and satellites: surfaces	GALILEAN SATELLITES; CASSINI VIMS; SURFACE; ICE; SPECTRA; ENCELADUS; PYTHON; OCEAN	We present spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of Europa's surface at 3-4 mu m obtained with the near-infrared spectrograph and adaptive optics system on the Keck II telescope. These are the highest quality spatially resolved reflectance spectra of Europa's surface at 3-4 mu m. The observations spatially resolve Europa's large-scale compositional units at a resolution of several hundred kilometers. The spectra show distinct features and geographic variations associated with known compositional units; in particular, large-scale leading hemisphere chaos shows a characteristic longward shift in peak reflectance near 3.7 mu m compared to icy regions. These observations complement previous spectra of large-scale chaos, and can aid efforts to identify the endogenous non-ice species.	[Fischer, P. D.; Brown, M. E.; Trumbo, S.

SPITZER SECONDARY ECLIPSE DEPTHS WITH MULTIPLE INTRAPIXEL SENSITIVITY CORRECTION METHODS OBSERVATIONS OF WASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b, AND HAT-P-22b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						atmospheric effects; methods: numerical; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: detection; techniques: photometric	INFRARED ARRAY CAMERA; M PHASE CURVES; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; GIANT PLANETS; GJ 436; EMISSION; TRANSIT; IRAC	We measure the 4.5 mu m thermal emission of five transiting hot Jupiters, WASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b, and HAT-P-22b using channel 2 of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Significant intrapixel sensitivity variations in Spitzer IRAC data require careful correction in order to achieve precision on the order of several hundred parts per million (ppm) for the measurement of exoplanet secondary eclipses. We determine eclipse depths by first correcting the raw data using three independent data reduction methods. The Pixel Gain Map (PMAP), Nearest Neighbors (NNBR), and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) each correct for the intrapixel sensitivity effect in Spitzer photometric time-series observations. The results from each methodology are compared against each other to establish if they reach a statistically equivalent result in every case and to evaluate their ability to minimize uncertainty in the measurement. We find that all three methods produce reliable results. For every planet examined here NNBR and PLD produce results that are in statistical agreement. However, the PMAP method appears to produce results in slight disagreement in cases where the stellar centroid is not kept consistently on the most well characterized area of the detector. We evaluate the ability of each method to reduce the scatter in the residuals as well as in the correlated noise in the corrected data. The NNBR and PLD methods consistently minimize both white and red noise levels and should be considered reliable and consistent. The planets in this study span equilibrium temperatures from 1100 to 2000. K and have brightness temperatures that require either high albedo or efficient recirculation. However, it is possible that other processes such as clouds or disequilibrium chemistry may also be responsible for producing these brightness temperatures.

J	Luan, J; Goldreich, P				Luan, Jing; Goldreich, Peter			CLASSIFICATION OF SATELLITE RESONANCES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability	STRONG TIDAL DISSIPATION; MEAN MOTION RESONANCES; URANIAN SATELLITES; SECONDARY RESONANCES; GIANT PLANETS; EVOLUTION; ENCELADUS; MIRANDA; MIMAS; CONSTRAINTS	Several pairs of solar system satellites occupy mean motion resonances (MMRs). We divide these into two groups according to their proximity to exact resonance. Proximity is measured by the existence of a separatrix in phase space. MMRs between Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede, and Enceladus-Dione are too distant from exact resonance for a separatrix to appear. A separatrix is present only in the phase spaces of the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs, and their resonant arguments are the only ones to exhibit substantial librations. Could there be a causal connection between the libration amplitude and the presence of a separatrix? Our suspicions were aroused by Goldreich & Schlichting, who demonstrate that sufficiently deep in a MMR, eccentricity damping could destabilize librations. However, our investigation reveals that libration amplitudes in both the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs are fossils. Although the Mimas-Tethys MMR is overstable, its libration amplitude grows on the tidal damping timescale of Mimas's inclination, which is considerably longer than a Hubble time. On the other hand, the Titan-Hyperion MMR is stable, but tidal damping of Hyperion's eccentricity is too weak to have affected the amplitude of its libration.

RESULTS FROM THE CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m: TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES FOR 151 NEARBY M DWARF SYSTEMS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						parallaxes; solar neighborhood; stars: distances; stars: low-mass; stars: statistics	PHOTOMETRIC STANDARD STARS; YR(-1) MOTION SAMPLE; M TELESCOPE PROGRAM; LOW-MASS STARS; SKY SURVEY; ASTROMETRIC COMPANIONS; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; MOVING GROUP; COOL DWARFS	We present 160 new trigonometric parallaxes for 151 M dwarf systems from the REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS) group's long-term astrometry/photometry program at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m telescope. Most systems (124 or 82%) are found to lie within 25 pc. The stars have 119 mas yr(-1) <= mu <= 828 mas yr(-1) and 3.85 <= (V - K) <= 8.47. Among these are 58 systems from the SuperCOSMOS-RECONS search, discovered via our proper motion trawls of the SuperCOSMOS digitized archival photographic plates, while the remaining stars were suspected via photometric distance estimates to lie nearby. Sixteen systems were newly discovered via astrometric perturbations to be binaries, many of which are ideal for accurate mass determinations due to their proximity and orbital periods on the order of a decade. A variability analysis of the stars presented, two-thirds of which are new results, shows six of the stars to vary by more than 20 mmag. This effort brings the total number of parallaxes for M dwarf systems measured by RECONS to nearly 500 and increases by 26% the number of southern M dwarf systems with accurate trigonometric parallaxes placing them within 25 pc.

From combined analysis of radial velocities and Kepler light curves, this system is found to be composed of two A-type stars, with masses of M-1 = 1.84 +/- 0.18. M-circle dot, M-2 = 1.73 +/- 0.17 M-circle dot and radii of R-1 = 2.01 +/- 0.09 R-circle dot, R-2 = 1.68 +/- 0.08 R-circle dot for the primary and secondary, respectively. In addition to an eclipse, the binary light curve shows a brightening and dimming near periastron, making this a somewhat rare eclipsing heartbeat star system. After removing the binary light curve model, more than 10 pulsational frequencies are present in the Fourier spectrum of the residuals, and most of them are integer multiples of the orbital frequency. These pulsations are tidally driven, and both the amplitudes and phases are in agreement with predictions from linear tidal theory for l = 2, m = -2 prograde modes.

CHEMISTRY AND KINEMATICS OF THE LATE-FORMING DWARF IRREGULAR GALAXIES LEO A, AQUARIUS, AND SAGITTARIUS DIG	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: abundances; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: individual (Leo A, DDO 210, Sgr dIG); Local Group; stars: abundances	STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; MULTIELEMENT ABUNDANCE MEASUREMENTS; KECK SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; CAMERA 2 OBSERVATIONS; RR-LYRAE STARS; LOCAL GROUP; SPHEROIDAL GALAXY; MILKY-WAY; SATELLITE GALAXIES; VELOCITY DISPERSION	We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of individual stars in the relatively isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies Leo. A, Aquarius, and the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy. The three galaxies-but especially Leo. A and Aquarius-share in common delayed star formation histories (SFHs) relative to many other isolated dwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has rotating H I gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are dark-matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from 4.4(-0.8)(+1.0) (SagDIG) to 9.6(-1.8)(+2.5) (Aquarius). Leo. A and SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were further along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo. A is inconsistent with a closed or leaky box model of chemical evolution, suggesting that the galaxy was preenriched or acquired external gas during star formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [alpha/Fe] ratios at a given [Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which indicates more extended SFHs than Sculptor, consistent with photometrically derived SFHs. Overall, the bulk kinematic and chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

J1119-6127 following its recent X-ray outburst. While initial observations showed no evidence of significant radio emission, subsequent observations detected pulsed emission across a large frequency band. In this Letter, we report on the initial disappearance of the pulsed emission and its prompt reactivation and dramatic evolution over several months of observation. The periodic pulse profile at S-band (2.3 GHz) after reactivation exhibits a multi-component emission structure, while the simultaneous X-band (8.4 GHz) profile shows a single emission peak. Single pulses were also detected at S-band near the main emission peaks. We present measurements of the spectral index across a wide frequency bandwidth, which captures the underlying changes in the radio emission profile of the neutron star. The high-frequency radio detection, unusual emission profile, and observed variability suggest similarities with magnetars, which may independently link the high-energy outbursts to magnetar-like behavior.

Enantioselective, convergent synthesis of the ineleganolide core by a tandem annulation cascade	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							INTRAMOLECULAR HYDROGEN ABSTRACTION; OCEAN SOFT CORAL; COPE REARRANGEMENT; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; ALKYL-HALIDES; RADICAL GENERATION; ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; CYCLIC ENONES; SINULARIA	An enantioselective and diastereoselective approach toward the synthesis of the polycyclic norditerpenoid ineleganolide is disclosed. A palladium-catalyzed enantioselective allylic alkylation is employed to stereoselectively construct the requisite chiral tertiary ether and facilitate the synthesis of a 1,3-cis-cyclopentenediol building block. Careful substrate design enabled the convergent assembly of the ineleganolide [6,7,5,5]-tetracyclic scaffold by a diastereoselective cyclopropanation-Cope rearrangement cascade under unusually mild conditions. Computational evaluation of ground state energies of late-stage synthetic intermediates was used to guide synthetic development and aid in the investigation of the conformational rigidity of these highly constrained and compact polycyclic structures. This work represents the first successful synthesis of the core structure of any member of the furanobutenolide-derived polycyclic norcembranoid diterpene family of natural products. Advanced synthetic manipulations generated a series of natural product-like compounds that were shown to possess selective secretory antagonism of either interleukin-5 or interleukin-17. This bioactivity stands in contrast to the known antileukemic activity of ineleganolide and suggests the norcembranoid natural product core may serve as a useful scaffold for the development of diverse therapeutics.

An analysis of high cloud variability: imprints from the El Nio-Southern Oscillation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Cloud fraction; Interannual variability; Principal component analysis	OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; DIURNAL CYCLE; CIRCULATION; FEEDBACK; CONVECTION; DATASETS; CMIP5; ISCCP	Using data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), we examine how near-global (60A degrees N-60A degrees S) high cloud fraction varies over time in the past three decades. Our focus is on identifying dominant modes of variability and associated spatial patterns, and how they are related to sea surface temperature. By performing the principal component analysis, we find that the first two principal modes of high cloud distribution show strong imprints of the two types of El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-the canonical ENSO and the ENSO Modoki. Comparisons between ISCCP data and 14 models from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (AMIP5) show that models simulate the spatial pattern and the temporal variations of high cloud fraction associated with the canonical ENSO very well but the magnitudes of the canonical ENSO vary among the models. Furthermore, the multi-model mean of the second principal mode in the AMIP5 simulations appears to capture the temporal behavior of the second mode but individual AMIP5 models show large discrepancies in capturing observed temporal variations. A new metric, defined by the relative variances of the first two principal components, suggests that most of the AMIP5 models overestimate the second principal mode of high clouds.

J	Mao, W; Thill, M; Hassibi, B				Mao, Wei; Thill, Matthew; Hassibi, Babak			On Ingleton-Violating Finite Groups	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Finite groups; entropy vectors; Ingleton inequality; network coding; group network codes	INFORMATION INEQUALITIES; ENTROPY REGION	Given n discrete random variables, its entropy vector is the 2(n) - 1-dimensional vector obtained from the joint entropies of all non-empty subsets of the random variables. It is well known that there is a close relation between such an entropy vector and a certain group-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and n of its subgroups; indeed, roughly speaking, knowing the region of all such group-characterizable vectors is equivalent to knowing the region of all entropy vectors. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space of entropic vectors and for designing network codes. If one restricts attention to abelian groups then not all entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an explanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al. that linear network codes cannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems (since linear network codes come from abelian groups). All abelian group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton inequality. General entropy vectors, however, do not necessarily have this property. It is, therefore, of interest to identify groups that violate the Ingleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian finite groups that yield characterizable vectors, which violate the Ingleton inequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group S-5 to be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study of the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to the Ingleton-violating family PGL(2, q) with a prime power q >= 5, i.e., the projective group of 2 x 2 nonsingular matrices with entries in F-q. We further interpret this family of groups, and their subgroups, using the theory of group actions and identify the subgroups as certain stabilizers. We also extend the construction to more general groups such as PGL(n, q) and GL(n, q). The families of groups identified here are therefore good candidates for constructing network codes more powerful than linear network codes, and we discuss some considerations for constructing such group network codes.

An Efficient and Incentive Compatible Mechanism for Wholesale Electricity Markets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Locational marginal pricing (LMP); power networks; Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism; wholesale electricity markets	EQUILIBRIUM CONSTRAINTS; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAM; POWER-SYSTEMS; AUCTIONS; NONCONVEXITIES; COORDINATION; PRICES; ENERGY	Being widely used in many deregulated wholesale electricity markets, the locational marginal pricing (LMP) mechanism is known to achieve social optimality in a competitive market. When profit-maximizing generators act strategically to manipulate prices; however, LMP may lead to high loss of economic efficiency. In this paper, we apply the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to wholesale electricity markets. We show that the VCG mechanism minimizes the total cost at a truth-telling dominant strategy equilibrium. We establish an important comparative result that the VCG mechanism always results in higher per-unit electricity prices than the LMP mechanism under any given set of reported supply curves. Numerical results show that the difference between the per-unit prices resulting from the two mechanisms is negligibly small (about 4%) in the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus test systems. Finally, we apply the VCG mechanism to a day-ahead setting with start-up cost (of conventional generators) and intermittent renewable generation. We show that the VCG mechanism induces the truth-telling behavior of conventional generators in dominant strategies and yields each conventional generator a non-negative expected profit.

Coupled High-Latitude Climate Feedbacks and Their Impact on Atmospheric Heat Transport	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							POLAR AMPLIFICATION; RADIATIVE FEEDBACKS; CIRCULATION; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; OCEAN; CLOUDS; GCM	The response of atmospheric heat transport to anthropogenic warming is determined by the anomalous meridional energy gradient. Feedback analysis offers a characterization of that gradient and hence reveals how uncertainty in physical processes may translate into uncertainty in the circulation response. However, individual feedbacks do not act in isolation. Anomalies associated with one feedback may be compensated by another, as is the case for the positive water vapor and negative lapse rate feedbacks in the tropics. Here a set of idealized experiments are performed in an aquaplanet model to evaluate the coupling between the surface albedo feedback and other feedbacks, including the impact on atmospheric heat transport. In the tropics, the dynamical response manifests as changes in the intensity and structure of the overturning Hadley circulation. Only half of the range of Hadley cell weakening exhibited in these experiments is found to be attributable to imposed, systematic variations in the surface albedo feedback. Changes in extratropical clouds that accompany the albedo changes explain the remaining spread. The feedback-driven circulation changes are compensated by eddy energy flux changes, which reduce the overall spread among experiments. These findings have implications for the efficiency with which the climate system, including tropical circulation and the hydrological cycle, adjusts to high-latitude feedbacks over climate states that range from perennial or seasonal ice to ice-free conditions in the Arctic.

D2H+ was generated in an extended negative glow discharge cell cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. We observed five new THz lines. All the available rotational transition frequencies together with the combination differences derived from the three fundamental bands were subject to least square analysis to determine the molecular constants. New THz measurements are definitely useful for better characterization of spectroscopic properties. The improved molecular constants provide better predictions of other unobserved rotational transitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Yu, S.; Pearson, J.

Line parameters for CO2 broadening in the nu(2) band of (HDO)-O-16	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						HDO-CO2 widths; HDO-CO2 shifts; HDO-CO2 calculated line list; Temperature dependence of widths; Off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients; Mars atmosphere	ROBERT-BONAMY FORMALISM; INTERMOLECULAR POTENTIAL PARAMETERS; DIODE-LASER MEASUREMENTS; HALF-WIDTHS; WATER-VAPOR; COLLISIONAL PARAMETERS; SHIFT COEFFICIENTS; H2O LINES; COMBINATION RULES; H2O-CO2 MIXTURES	CO2-rich planetary atmospheres such as those of Mars and Venus require accurate knowledge of CO2 broadened HDO half-width coefficients and their temperature dependence exponents for reliable abundance determination. Although a few calculated line lists have recently been published on HDO-CO2 line shapes and their temperature dependences, laboratory measurements of those parameters are thus far non-existent. In this work, we report the first measurements of CO2-broadened half-width and pressure-shift coefficients and their temperature dependences for over 220 transitions in the nu(2) band. First measurements of self-broadened half-width and self-shift coefficients at room temperature are also obtained for majority of these transitions. In addition, the first experimental determination of collisional line mixing has been reported for 11 transition pairs for HDO-CO2 and HDO-HDO systems. These results were obtained by analyzing ten high-resolution spectra of HDO and HDO-CO2 mixtures at various sample temperatures and pressures recorded with the Bruker IFS-125HR Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Two coolable absorption cells with path lengths of 2038 cm and 20.941 m were used to record the spectra. The various line parameters were retrieved by fitting all ten spectra simultaneously using a multispectrum nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The HDO transitions in the 1100-4100 cm(-1) range were extracted from the HITRAN2012 database. For the nu(2) and 2 nu(2) -nu(2) bands there were 2245 and 435 transitions, respectively. Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy formalism (MCRB) calculations were made for the half-width coefficients, their temperature dependence and the pressure shift coefficients for the HDO-CO2 and HDO-HDO collision systems. MCRB calculations are compared with the measured values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Devi, V. Malathy; Benner, D.

Two-dimensional radiative transfer for the retrieval of limb emission measurements in the martian atmosphere	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						2D; Radiative transfer; Limb geometry; Mars; MCS	3-D TOMOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL; MIDDLE-ATMOSPHERE; SOUNDING OBSERVATIONS; IMAGER GLORIA; MARS; SPECTRA; SENSITIVITY; MODEL	The remote sounding of infrared emission from planetary atmospheres using limb-viewing geometry is a powerful technique for deriving vertical profiles of structure and composition on a global scale. Compared with nadir viewing, limb geometry provides enhanced vertical resolution and greater sensitivity to atmospheric constituents. However, standard limb profile retrieval techniques assume spherical symmetry and are vulnerable to biases produced by horizontal gradients in atmospheric parameters. We present a scheme for the correction of horizontal gradients in profile retrievals from limb observations of the martian atmosphere. It characterizes horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, and aerosol extinction along the line-of-sight of a limb view through neighboring measurements, and represents these gradients by means of two-dimensional radiative transfer in the forward model of the retrieval. The scheme is applied to limb emission measurements from the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Retrieval simulations using data from numerical models indicate that biases of up to 10 K in the winter polar region, obtained with standard retrievals using spherical symmetry, are reduced to about 2 K in most locations by the retrieval with two-dimensional radiative transfer. Retrievals from Mars atmospheric measurements suggest that the two-dimensional radiative transfer greatly reduces biases in temperature and aerosol opacity caused by observational geometry, predominantly in the polar winter regions.

The resulting fiber displacements are neither uniform nor smooth; rather, displacements localize to form dense fibrous bands that span from one cell to another. It is thought that these bands may be a mechanism by which cells can sense their neighbors, but this hypothesis remains untested, because the mechanism for band formation remains unknown. Using digital volume correlation, we measure the displacements induced by contractile cells embedded in a fibrous matrix. We find that cell-induced displacements propagate over a longer range than predicted by linear elasticity. To explain the long-range propagation of displacements, we consider the effect of buckling of individual matrix fibers, which generates a nonlinear stress-strain relationship. We show that fiber buckling is the mechanism that causes the displacements to propagate over a long range and the bands to form between nearby cells. The results thus show that buckling of individual fibers provides a mechanism by which cells may sense their distant neighbors mechanically.

Thermomechanical response was measured employing the shear-compression specimen geometry, a split-Hopkinson pressure bar, and an infra-red detector. beta of both materials measured to be less than the common assumption of 0.9; however, heat conversion was observed to be greater for magnesium alloy. Thus, results suggest that alloying and grain size refinement not only improved yield strength but also affected the thermomechanical response.

We interpret the observed spectral changes as a combination of an ambipolar Burstein-Moss (BM) shift of the absorption edge due to band-filling under gate control, and-a quantum confined Franz-Keldysh (QCFK) effect, phenomena that have been proposed theoretically to occur for black phosphorus under an applied electric field. Distinct optical responses are observed depending on the flake thickness and starting carrier concentration. Transmission extinction modulation amplitudes of more than two percent are observed, suggesting the potential for use of black phosphorus as an active material in mid-infrared optoelectronic modulator applications.

Gate-Variable Mid-Infrared Optical Transitions in a (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 Topological Insulator	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Bismuth antimony telluride; topological insulator; tunable optical properties; mid-infrared; Burstein-Moss shift; optical modulator	BLACK PHOSPHORUS; GRAPHENE; PLASMONS; SEMICONDUCTOR; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSISTORS; FIELD	We report mid-infrared spectroscopy measurements of ultrathin, electrostatically gated (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 topological insulator films in which we observe several percent modulation of transmittance and reflectance as gating shifts the Fermi level. Infrared transmittance measurements of gated films were enabled by use of an epitaxial lift-off method for large-area transfer of topological insulator films from infrared-absorbing SrTiO3 growth substrates to thermal oxidized silicon substrates. We combine these optical experiments with transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to identify the observed spectral modulation as a gate-driven transfer of spectral weight between both bulk and 2D topological surface channels and interband and intraband channels. We develop a model for the complex permittivity of gated (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 and find a good match to our experimental data. These results open the path for layered topological insulator materials as a new candidate for tunable, ultrathin infrared optics and highlight the possibility of switching topological optoelectronic phenomena between bulk and spin-polarized surface regimes.

They are studied in many fields, but are especially well known in optics on account of the relative ease of their formation and control in optical fibre waveguides(1,2). Besides their many interesting properties, solitons are important to optical continuum generation(3), in mode-locked lasers(4,5), and have been considered as a natural way to convey data over great distances(6). Recently, solitons have been realized in microcavities(7), thereby bringing the power of microfabrication methods to future applications. This work reports a soliton not previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes soliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and time within an optical potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes and the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit from a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers in general. The discovery of a new optical soliton can impact work in other areas of photonics, including nonlinear optics and spectroscopy.

Ultra-High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Human Inner Ear at 11.7 Tesla	OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY			English	Article						11.7 Tesla; Cochlea; Inner ear; MRI; Ultra-high-field MRI; Vestibular labyrinth	VIVO	Objective: To evaluate the ability of ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) at 11.7 T to visualize membranous structures of the human inner ear. Specimens: Three temporal bones were extracted from cadaveric human heads for use with small-bore UHF-MRI. Intervention: Ex vivo cadaveric temporal bone specimens were imaged using an 11.7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner via T1-and T2-weighted-imaging with and without contrast. Main Outcome Measure: Qualitative visualization of membranous components of the inner ear compared with reports of UHF-MRI at lower field strengths. Results: The membranous anatomy of the inner ear was superbly visualized at 11.7 T. In the cochlea, Reissner's membrane, the scala media, and the basilar membrane were clearly shown on the scan. In the vestibular labyrinth, the wedge-shaped crista ampullaris and the maculae of both the saccule and utricle were visible. Details of the endolymphatic sac and duct were also demonstrated. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this report presents the first images of the ex vivo human inner ear using 11.7 T UHF-MRI, offering near-histologic resolution. Increased field strength may be particularly useful when imaging the delicate membranous anatomy of the inner ear. Further research on the use of UHF-MRI in clinical and research settings could illuminate structural changes associated with inner ear disorders.

In this paper, we present a method to jointly invert for centroid depths with local (distance < 5A degrees) seismic waveforms and regional (distance of 5A degrees-15A degrees) Rayleigh wave amplitude spectra on sparse networks. We use earthquake focal mechanisms and magnitudes retrieved with the Cut-and-Paste (CAP) method to compute synthetic amplitude spectra of fundamental mode Rayleigh wave for a range of depths. Then we grid search to find the optimal depth that minimizes the joint misfit of amplitude spectra and local waveforms. As case studies, we apply this method to the 2008 Wells, Nevada Mw6.0 earthquake and a Mw5.6 outer-rise earthquake to the east of Japan Trench in 2013. Uncertainties estimated with a bootstrap re-sampling approach show that this joint inversion approach constrains centroid depths well, which are also verified by independent teleseismic depth-phase data.

The scale-bridging technique is applied to the specific example of stretching dominated elastic and inelastic periodic truss networks. Experiments on small-scale truss structures have highlighted the importance of nodal connections on the effective stiffness and strength. Therefore, we describe the mechanics of trusses by accounting for the stretching of truss members and the deformation of nodes. For the representative 2D examples of lattices having square and triangular architectures and for example bar and nodal constitutive laws, we show that a simple continuum model based on affinely deforming a representative unit cell is sufficient to reproduce the nonlinear elastic behavior of discrete trusses. By contrast, localization that arises, e.g., from inelastic deformation requires a refined model. This is where the presented nonlocal continuum model is capable of accurately capturing details of localized deformation. We illustrate the performance of the model by comparing the results of example finite element simulations using the continuum constitutive model to discrete lattice calculations with elastic plastic bars. Optimal performance is achieved when the representative unit cell of the continuum model agrees with the actual size of the discrete truss unit cell, which accounts for size effects even in regimes where a separation of scales between finite element size and unit cell size does not strictly apply.

The IPAC Image Subtraction and Discovery Pipeline for the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						methods: analytical; methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ASTROMETRIC CALIBRATION; VARIABLE-STARS; CLASSIFICATION; CATALOG; SEARCH; KERNEL; PHOTOMETRY; SUPERNOVAE; ALGORITHM	We describe the near real-time transient-source discovery engine for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), currently in operations at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC), Caltech. We coin this system the IPAC/iPTF Discovery Engine (or IDE). We review the algorithms used for PSF-matching, image subtraction, detection, photometry, and machine-learned (ML) vetting of extracted transient candidates. We also review the performance of our ML classifier. For a limiting signal-to-noise ratio of 4 in relatively unconfused regions, bogus candidates from processing artifacts and imperfect image subtractions outnumber real transients by; 10:1. This can be considerably higher for image data with inaccurate astrometric and/or PSF-matching solutions. Despite this occasionally high contamination rate, the ML classifier is able to identify real transients with an efficiency (or completeness) of; 97% for a maximum tolerable false-positive rate of 1% when classifying raw candidates. All subtraction-image metrics, source features, ML probability-based real-bogus scores, contextual metadata from other surveys, and possible associations with known Solar System objects are stored in a relational database for retrieval by the various science working groups. We review our efforts in mitigating false-positives and our experience in optimizing the overall system in response to the multitude of science projects underway with iPTF.

Applying terrestrial lidar for evaluation and calibration of airborne lidar-derived shrub biomass estimates in Arctic tundra	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; LEAF-AREA	Monitoring of climate-driven expansion of low-stature shrubs in Arctic tundra can be improved through application of high-resolution remote sensing. However, the destructive nature of harvest sampling that is usually performed for validation of these data is resource intensive and can limit future comparisons by destroying benchmark measurements. We compared aboveground shrub biomass estimates derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) with the goal of determining whether TLS data can be used to accurately calibrate ALS estimates of shrub biomass in Arctic tundra. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation calibration of canopy volume against harvested shrub biomass to establish predictive relationships between TLS canopy volume and harvested shrub biomass, and between ALS canopy volume and TLS-derived shrub biomass estimates. TLS produced more accurate predictions of shrub biomass (R-2 = 0.78; root mean square deviation [RMSD] = 102 g) than did ALS, but the accuracy of ALS-derived shrub biomass predictions was the same whether they were calibrated directly against harvest biomass or against TLS-derived estimates of biomass (R-2 = 0.62; RMSD = 140 g). Our results suggest that once the initial TLS-harvest relationship is known, TLS can provide valid ground reference data for calibration of ALS-derived estimates of shrub biomass without the need for additional destructive harvest.

Crown group Oxyphotobacteria postdate the rise of oxygen	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							GREAT OXIDATION; SNOWBALL EARTH; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; EVOLUTION; GENOME; ORIGIN; LIFE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CYANOBACTERIA; NITROGEN	The rise of oxygen ca. 2.3 billion years ago (Ga) is the most distinct environmental transition in Earth history. This event was enabled by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in the ancestors of Cyanobacteria. However, long-standing questions concern the evolutionary timing of this metabolism, with conflicting answers spanning more than one billion years. Recently, knowledge of the Cyanobacteria phylum has expanded with the discovery of non-photosynthetic members, including a closely related sister group termed Melainabacteria, with the known oxygenic phototrophs restricted to a clade recently designated Oxyphotobacteria. By integrating genomic data from the Melainabacteria, cross-calibrated Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses show that crown group Oxyphotobacteria evolved ca. 2.0 billion years ago (Ga), well after the rise of atmospheric dioxygen. We further estimate the divergence between Oxyphotobacteria and Melainabacteria ca. 2.5-2.6 Ga, which-if oxygenic photosynthesis is an evolutionary synapomorphy of the Oxyphotobacteria-marks an upper limit for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved relatively close in time to the rise of oxygen.	[Shih, P.

Hopanoids play a role in stress tolerance and nutrient storage in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							2-METHYLHOPANOID PRODUCTION; CELLULAR-DIFFERENTIATION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; GREEN; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; RESISTANCE; SIGNATURES	Hopanes are abundant in ancient sedimentary rocks at discrete intervals in Earth history, yet interpreting their significance in the geologic record is complicated by our incomplete knowledge of what their progenitors, hopanoids, do in modern cells. To date, few studies have addressed the breadth of diversity of physiological functions of these lipids and whether those functions are conserved across the hopanoid-producing bacterial phyla. Here, we generated mutants in the filamentous cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme, that are unable to make all hopanoids (shc) or 2-methylhopanoids (hpnP). While the absence of hopanoids impedes growth of vegetative cells at high temperature, the shc mutant grows faster at low temperature. This finding is consistent with hopanoids acting as membrane rigidifiers, a function shared by other hopanoid-producing phyla. Apart from impacting fitness under temperature stress, hopanoids are dispensable for vegetative cells under other stress conditions. However, hopanoids are required for stress tolerance in akinetes, a resting survival cell type. While 2-methylated hopanoids do not appear to contribute to any stress phenotype, total hopanoids and to a lesser extent 2-methylhopanoids were found to promote the formation of cyanophycin granules in akinetes. Finally, although hopanoids support symbiotic interactions between Alphaproteobacteria and plants, they do not appear to facilitate symbiosis between N. punctiforme and the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus. Collectively, these findings support interpreting hopanes as general environmental stress biomarkers. If hopanoid-mediated enhancement of nitrogen-rich storage products turns out to be a conserved phenomenon in other organisms, a better understanding of this relationship may help us parse the enrichment of 2-methylhopanes in the rock record during episodes of disrupted nutrient cycling.

We found that simultaneous deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 in mouse CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes resulted in dysregulated development and proliferation of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells). Tet2-Tet3 double-knockout (DKO) iNKT cells displayed pronounced skewing toward the NKT17 lineage, with increased DNA methylation and impaired expression of genes encoding the key lineage-specifying factors T-bet and ThPOK. Transfer of purified Tet2-Tet3 DKO MKT cells into immunocompetent recipient mice resulted in an uncontrolled expansion that was dependent on the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein CD1d, which presents lipid antigens to iNKT cells. Our data indicate that TET proteins regulate MKT cell fate by ensuring their proper development and maturation and by suppressing aberrant proliferation mediated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR).

Discs were processed by high-pressure torsion until saturation in grain refinement. Dynamic hardness testing revealed a gradual increase in strain rate sensitivity up to m approximate to 0.2. High ductility was observed in the ultrafine-grained magnesium including an exceptional elongation of similar to 360% in tension at room temperature and stable deformation in micropillar compression. Grain coarsening and an increase in frequency of grain boundaries with misorientations in the range 15 degrees-45 degrees occurred during deformation in tension. The experimental evidence, when combined with an analysis of the deformation behavior, suggests that grain boundary sliding plays a key role in low strain rate deformation of pure magnesium when the grain sizes are at and below similar to 5 mu m.

The number of small satellite and CubeSat missions has increased significantly in recent years. Compared to traditional larger satellite missions, CubeSats are designed at lower cost and with shorter development cycles. The reliability of CubeSats and small satellites in on-orbit radiation environments needs to be ensured for mission success. In this study, single event effect analysis has been performed for a 6U-Class satellite instrument in low Earth orbit to improve its on-orbit reliability. Critical commercial off-the-shelf parts of the Command and Data Handling Subsystem of a 6U-Class satellite instrument have been tested under heavy-ion radiation at the Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute Radiation Effects Facility. SEE characteristics have been tested and analyzed for analog-to-digital data converters, voltage regulators, and current sensing and voltage monitoring devices. Device-and system-level risk analyses have been performed for the Command and Data Handling electronics based on the results of heavy-ion radiation testing. System-level mitigation techniques have been studied to minimize the effects of SEEs on electronic systems for deployment on 6U-Class satellites in low Earth orbit.

We have observed that the shielding provided by the concentrator system is remarkable. In order to obtain an accurate prediction of the overall shield needed in our concentrator system triple-junction space solar cells have been irradiated on the edge with 350-keV protons at a fluence of 10(12) p(+) cm(-2).

We propose an ultralight, modular power station, having specific power in the range of 1-10 kW/kg for the photovoltaic (PV) collection subsystem. The building block of the power station is the 'tile,' a self-contained element that performs PV energy collection, conversion to radio frequency (RF), and transmission to earth. To minimize PV mass, we select a 1D, 10-20X parabolic trough concentrator geometry, which provides cooling and radiation shielding for the cells, and which folds flat for deployment.

The smoothing technique improved the surface roughness of the CFRP surface from similar to 3 mu m root mean square (RMS) for as-cast to similar to 5 nm RMS after smoothing. The surfaces were then coated with metal, which retained the sub-wavelength surface roughness, to produce a high-quality specular reflector. The mirrors were tested in an 11x geometrical concentrator configuration and achieved an optical efficiency of 78% under an AM0 solar simulator. With further development, lightweight CFRP mirrors will enable dramatic improvements in the specific power, power per unit mass, achievable for concentrated photovoltaics in space.

Effects of Electron and Proton Radiation on Perovskite Solar Cells for Space Solar Power Application	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC					We report the effects of high energy electron and proton radiation on perovskite solar cells. For irradiation with 1 MeV electrons, at fluence from 10(12) to 10(16) cm(-2), there are no significant changes in the morphology and the crystal phase in the perovskites, and the perovskite solar cells show only slight degradation in photovoltaic performance and spectral response. The results from Monte Carlo simulations show most of the electrons completely penetrate through all of the layers of solar cells with little scattering. In addition, 50 keV proton radiation with fluence of 10(12) cm(-2) has no significant impact on the open-circuit voltage or short-circuit current, and degrades only the fill factor. We have further found that the fill factor can be restored with a vacuum annealing process. The results suggest that perovskites have superior electron and proton radiation tolerance, and thus hold particular promise for space applications.

Enhanced Light Trapping in Thin Silicon Solar Cells using Effectively Transparent Contacts (ETCs)	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC			light trapping; photovoltaic cells; contacts; silicon	HETEROJUNCTION	We report on the light trapping properties of densely spaced microscale triangular cross-section effectively transparent contacts (ETCs). Optical simulations of thin silicon with closely spaced ETCs were performed and the absorption within the silicon was determined. We found that with a metal coverage of 62.5% the short circuit current density would only be decreased by 0.25%. Such low value of parasitic reflection and transmission is obtained due to the excellent reflection properties of silver microstructures. In the interval 700 nm-1100 nm the short circuit current density is even enhanced by around 1 mA/cm2 compared to a structure without any metal contact. This results from nearly loss free in-coupling in combination with internal reflection at the bottom of the metal lines which increases the path length of light. These results are particularly interesting for 4-terminal silicon tandem devices as the bottom cell only receives the spectrum between around 850 nm and 1100 nm.

Micro-optical Tandem Luminescent Solar Concentrator	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC			Luminescent solar concentrator; quantum dots; microoptics; Bragg gratings	ENERGY; NANOCRYSTALS	We propose a design for a concentrated photo-voltaic (CPV) module with features that can capture both direct and diffuse sunlight. This approach uses a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) sheet that includes quantum dots, and a tailored optical coating that enhances concentration and delivery of sunlight to the micro-PV cells. In addition, the light not captured by the quantum dots impinges on a tandem solar cell beneath the LSC sheet. The design of the LSC focuses on lowering the number of expensive micro-PV cells needed within the concentrator waveguide, thus reducing system costs while maintaining high efficiency. The design also allows the module to be effective without a tracking system, making it attractive to all PV markets.

The cost and feasibility of future missions to 5-10 AU and beyond would greatly benefit from the availability of high-efficiency solar arrays optimized for low-irradiance low-temperature (LILT) environments. We have therefore set out to develop an advanced-architecture solar cell technology that will produce over 20% more power per unit area at LILT than the current state of practice. This technology will leverage recent advances in bandgap engineering originally developed for 1 AU, such as inverted or upright metamorphic multijunction device architectures. In addition, the new technology will feature a LILT-optimized, radiation-hard design. This paper reports on initial results from JPL's advanced-architecture LILT cell development project, specifically ground-based laboratory measurements of temperature-dependent illuminated current-voltage (LIV) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). Test conditions included irradiances corresponding to Sun distances from 1 AU to 9.5 AU, and junction temperatures between +28 degrees C and -165 degrees C. Through such measurements, multiple advanced architectures have been identified which demonstrate superior performance even prior to completing the design optimization for LILT, at both beginning of life (BOL, pre-radiation) and at end of life (EOL, post le15 1 MeV e(-)/cm(2)). For example, we measured 5.5 AU -140 degrees C average efficiencies of similar to 35% at BOL and similar to 31-33% at EOL for inverted metamorphic four-junction cells from SolAero and upright metamorphic triple-junction cells from Spectrolab. Further efficiency improvements are to be expected in the near future as we investigate, identify and eliminate from the device design those mechanisms that limit the cell performance at LILT.

Thermodynamic Efficiency Limit of Bifacial Solar Cells for Various Spectral Albedos	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC			Bifacial Solar Cells; Spectral albedo; Thermodynamic efficiency limit; Shockley-Queisser-Limit	PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES; ANNUAL PERFORMANCE; SILICON; PANEL	We have adapted the Shockley-Queisser radiative flux balance model to investigate the influence of the spectral dependent albedo on the power conversion efficiency of bifacial solar cells. By taking the spectral albedo of the surroundings into account the optimal band gap becomes dependent on the type of ground-reflecting surface. Furthermore, we find that the maximum efficiency depends on the spectral albedo of the surroundings and that optimal cell performance cannot be assessed when only accounting for a spectrally-independent albedo. We predict that the power conversion efficiency for a bifacial silicon solar cell surrounded by green grass is an absolute 0.90% higher than expected from a wavelength independent albedo, and even 1.51% higher for white sand, with the spectral albedo model. Furthermore, we calculated spectral properties of antireflection coatings and we found that commonly used antireflection coatings in silicon solar cells provide good properties in order to accept back-scattered light from surfaces with different spectral albedos.

Particles were deposited using aerosol (dry) and droplet (wet) deposition. Results from the previous study show that the CO2 composite spray system is capable of cleaning to sterility for aerosol deposited spores and is capable of cleaning a minimum of a 4-log reduction for droplet deposited spores. This minimum 4-log reduction matches current Planetary Protection dry heat microbial reduction requirements. In this paper we will present new data to further correlate the cleaning efficiency with how contamination was introduced to the surface, the surface roughness, and particle size. Possible causes for such correlations will be discussed.

In the early days of the Space Program, this figure was small, and could be described in bits or maybe even megabits. But now, missions are capable of returning data volumes two or three orders of magnitude larger. For example, Voyager 1 and 2 combined produced a little over 5 Terabits of data in 39 years of operation. In contrast, the Cassini mission, launched two decades after Voyager, produced about one and a half times those data volumes in half the time. NISAR, an Earth Science Mission currently in implementation, plans to produce over 28 Petabits of raw data in just 3 years. This means that NISAR will produce about as many data in 30 days as the combined data production of nearly all planetary missions to date. These increases in capability are a result of technology enhancements in two main areas: telecommunications architecture (both space and ground segments) and data storage technology. This paper describes the progression of these two technologies over the course of more than three decades of space missions and provides additional insight into the design of the end-to-end NISAR Data System Architecture. Trends in the data are briefly explored and compared to Moore's Law which provides only a qualitative model for memory growth but not for data production. In summary, early missions are found to be driven by unrefined processes while later missions, having utilized earlier lessons learned, focus more on improvements to flight and ground capabilities. Data return seems to fall into three categories. First, deep space missions are driven by the large distances that limit data return to the Earth. Next, the orbiter infrastructure around Mars helps these missions generate more data than other deep space spacecraft. Finally, near-Earth missions have the greatest capabilities for the studied metrics due to their close proximity to Earth and the ground network availability.	[Jasper, Lee E.

During this time, regular astrometric measurements of Cassini's sky position have been made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). These are high precision differential measurements that determine the position of Cassini with respect to angularly nearby extragalactic radio sources. Differential, narrow-angle astrometry reduces many error sources, particularly those associated with signal propagation effects in the ionosphere and troposphere. The background radio sources positions are tied to the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) by other international VLBI observations. Thus, we obtain a series of ICRF positions for Cassini, which can be combined with spacecraft orbit solutions from Deep Space Network doppler tracking to get ICRF positions for the center of mass of the Saturn system. These positions have typical accuracies at the nano-radian level. For some epochs uncertainties in the background source positions are a major component of the total error, but these positions are being constantly improved as additional VLBI observations are incorporated into radio source catalogs. The planetary ephemeris group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses our position measurements to fit improved orbital solutions for Saturn. As a result the orientation of the plane of Saturn's orbit is now known to approximately 0.25 milli-arcseconds (1.25 nrad), nearly an order of magnitude improvement over its pre-VLBA uncertainty. We will continue this observing program until the end of the Cassini mission in late 2017. By that time we will have covered about 1/3 of Saturn's orbital longitude range. Future improvements to this technique will include the use of higher spacecraft downlink frequencies (Ka band instead of X band) and higher ground array sensitivity to permit the use of weaker but angularly closer reference sources. In addition, the continuing international campaigns to enhance the accuracy of radio source catalogs will be extended to weaker sources, improving their ties to the ICRF.

Each team submitted a Mission Concept Study to NASA in August 2016, and in January of 2017 NASA selected Psyche and a second mission for flight. This paper describes Psyche, a unique investigation of a metal world, which is the only one of the original five mission concepts studied in detail to propose the use of Electric Propulsion (EP) to accomplish its mission objectives. Psyche will harness commercially developed EP and space power systems with strong system-level heritage to accomplish a deep space NASA science mission at comparatively low technical-risk and cost-risk. This paper describes the Psyche mission concept and the unique Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) architecture that allows the use of SSL's commercial SPT-140 Hall thruster propulsion system at solar distances of up to 3.3 AU with only minimal modifications. Building on previous work analyzing SEP systems for Discovery-class missions, this paper describes the heritage, design, and testing which have been conducted on the power and propulsion systems to develop the Psyche mission, addresses the differences between GEO and deep-space environments, and describes actions taken to ensure that GEO heritage systems can be operated reliably in deep-space.

This method was developed for the Mars Exploration Rovers mission's surface operations to aid in determining orbiter visibility periods for downlink data, and is now being considered for all Mars surface missions and for a variety of applications. Starting with images received from Mars rovers or landers, the horizon pixel location is found by (1) obtaining the gradient images using the Sobel operator, (2) calculating the preliminary horizon locations by optimizing the maximum difference between sky and ground regions in the gradient domain, and (3) applying a multi-variable thresholding method. The results are analyzed using a variety of images from the Mars rovers, as an example one dataset's results were categorized as 94.2% Good, 4.11% Okay, and 1.65% Poor. The pixel location corresponding to the found horizon in an image is converted to azimuth and elevation values using the camera model. The elevation of the terrain surrounding the rover or lander directly affects the duration orbiters are visible for downlink data volume, and when the sun is visible for image quality or solar energy consumption. Having an automated process to detect the elevation of the terrain allows the operation team to better predict the outcome of the plan, reducing heath and safety risks and allowing new operational limits to be defined.

A three-mission campaign concept is currently being investigated. The Mars 2020 rover mission is intended to core and collect samples. These samples will be sealed in tubes and left on the surface for potential return to Earth. In the current MSR campaign concept, a Sample Retrieval and Launch (SRL) mission would collect the sample tubes left by the Mars 2020 rover and load them into a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) to be launched into orbit. The third mission concept involves a spacecraft capturing the samples in Martian orbit and returning them to Earth. This paper focuses on the SRL mission concept to collect the sample tubes, addressing the problem of autonomously detecting, localizing, and grasping sample tubes deposited on the Martian surface. We employ two approaches: The first one is context-based. It would use a high precision map computed from images captured during tube release, to locate the tubes without directly observing them. The second approach directly detects the sample tubes visually and estimates their 6-DoF pose onboard from dense stereo data.

In particular, space-based radio interferometers can detect signals in frequency ranges that are absorbed by Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere. Furthermore, such formation missions are now feasible under constrained cost caps due to the growing availability of SmallSat components with spaceflight heritage that are compatible the CubeSat form-factor. Accordingly, we analyze a mission concept operating multiple SmallSats in a passive cluster to establish a space-based interferometer. The goal of this array is to reconstruct radio emissions associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, giving us insight into the particle acceleration occurring during these events. This low-cost mission concept presents a number of unique challenges in regards to mission design and navigation, particularly the configuration of the spacecraft to optimize science return and the reconstruction of precise spacecraft-spacecraft separation values. After providing a brief overview of the mission concept, this paper presents several key features of the mission design and orbit determination strategy that enable this potential heliophysics mission.

A Framework for Writing Measurement Requirements and its Application to the Planned Europa Mission	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Science-engineering communication is critical to the success of any science-driven mission. The process of building this understanding relies on a shared language for communicating science needs and engineering results, which can be particularly difficult on large space-science missions where many different institutions contribute to the science team. The Science Traceability Matrix can be used to formalize this communication pathway, but it has limited use in the development of the science requirements flowdown, and varies in format, scope and content from mission to mission. There are many guidelines on developing well-constructed requirements in general, but very little is published on how to actually write these science-driven requirements in a systematic way. This paper discusses the measurement-domain science traceability and alignment framework, or M-STAF, which was developed to help frame the conversation between scientists and engineers in the development of measurement requirements. The M-STAF provides a common language that can be used to ensure consistency across instruments, completeness in the coverage of the requirements, and traceability of the engineering work to the science objectives of the project. This work discusses the framework in the context of other communication tools and its implementation on a flight project. The general framework is presented through the lens of its potential application on the planned Europa Mission.

During this stage of human Mars exploration, it would be necessary to provision the crews with equipment and supplies both before and during their missions. In this paper, we study the use of 150 kW reusable SEP tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and to the surface. The SEP tugs would make use of technology currently being developed for the proposed Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. The SEP tugs envisioned would be staged at a quasi-stable Lunar Near Rectilinear Orbit (NRO). The tugs would then mate with cargo vessels and xenon propellant being delivered by an SLS launch vehicle and continue on to Mars orbit where the cargo is delivered and the SEP tug returns to NRO to repeat the process. It was found that it is more efficient to deliver surface cargo via direct launch and entry versus using the tug cycler. Thousands of optimized low-thrust trajectories were simulated in order to create "Bacon plots" (like porkchop plots, but for low thrust transfers) in order to map out potential trajectories for dates from 2039 to 2052. This study maps out the buildup of a surface outpost as well as the necessary orbital and surface resupply launches in order to maintain it. In the steady state, a cadence of 9 cargo launches is required every 4 years to sustain the human outpost.

In this paper, we presented the first calorimetry and timing performance measurement of Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) as the active material of sampling calorimeter, using 2 GeV to 200 GeV electron beam from CERN beam lines. A good energy performance is achieved due to the better sensitivity of CdTe to X ray photons in the secondary shower than other semi-conducting sensors such as silicon. The timing resolution of the tested CdTe sensor is measured to be down to 21 ps under the best conditions.

Each crystal has a dimension of 34x34x200 mm(3), and is readout by a large area SiPM array. A series of technical specifications on mechanical and optical parameters was defined according to the calorimeter physics requirements. Pre-production CsI crystals were procured from three firms: Amcrys, Saint-Gobain and SIC. We report the quality assurance on crystal's scintillation properties and their radiation hardness against ionization dose and neutrons. With a fast decay time of about 30 ns and a light output of more than 100 p.e./MeV measured by a bi-alkali PMT, un-doped CsI crystals provide a cost-effective solution for Mu2e.

For very large distributed datasets, this slows down the analytics process, and for extremely large datasets it is often impractical to download such massive volumes due to bandwidth limitations. In such cases, data scientists need to be provided explicit access to the remote servers hosting the datasets, and possess detailed knowledge of the server infrastructure and environments, in order to send their analytics packages to the data owner. This alternative poses considerable challenges and has not been adequately addressed to date. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to addressing this challenge called Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI) which seamlessly allows users to conduct analytics-in-place by distributing analytics to the distributed repositories without moving the underlying datasets to a common location. By allowing automated analytics scripts to be sent to the data and orchestration of distributed infrastructure, VIFI allows users to conduct, execute and coordinate complex analytics activities in-place with the data on multiple data repositories. VIFI uses Docker containerization technology along with open-source workflow tool NIFI to achieve automated orchestration and distributed analytics without requiring users to posses detailed knowledge of the distributed repositories and their underlying infrastructure. We demonstrate and evaluate VIFI on a Earth Science use-case for evaluation of precipitation over the Great Plains involving analytics on massive distributed data repositories.

This new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively owned heterogeneous resources, with the fundamental objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of resource owners. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified framework that accomplishes this goal. The foundation of Unicorn is RSDP, an autonomous, privacy-preserving resource discovery and representation system to provide accurate resource availability information. Its core is a novel abstraction called resource vector abstraction which describes the resource availability in a set of linear constraints. In addition, Unicorn also provides a series of advanced solutions to support automatic, efficient management of resource dynamics on both supply and demand sides, including an automatic workflow transformer, an intelligent resource demand estimator and an efficient, scalable multi-resource orchestrator. Being the first unified framework for this new paradigm, Unicorn plays a fundamental role in next-generation data-intensive collaborative computing systems.

Photometric Redshift Estimation: An Active Learning Approach	2017 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 27-DEC 01, 2017	Honolulu, HI	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			DOMAIN ADAPTATION; DISTANCE	A long-lasting problem in astronomy is the accurate estimation of galaxy distances based solely on the information contained in photometric filters. Due to observational selection effects, the spectroscopic (source) sample lacks coverage throughout the feature space (e.g. colors and magnitudes) compared to the photometric (target) sample; this results in a clear mismatch in terms of photometric measurement distributions. We propose a solution to this problem based on active learning, a machine learning technique where a sampling strategy enables us to select the most informative instances to build a predictive model; specifically, we use active learning following a Query by Committee approach. We show that by making wisely selected queries in the target domain, we are able to increase our predictive performance significantly. We also show how a relatively small number of queries (spectroscopic follow-up measurements) suffices to improve the performance of photometric redshift estimators significantly.

Energized electrons excite Langmuir waves, which convert into radio emission at the local plasma frequency, with the most intense acceleration thought to occur within 20 R-S. The capability of ground-based radio arrays to track this radio emission is limited by ionospheric absorption (nu greater than or similar to 15 MHz) to altitudes less than about 3R(S). The state of the art for tracking such emission from space is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES), in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping; there has been some success in triangulating the emission between the spacecraft, but considerable uncertainties remain. The Sun Radio Imaging Space Experiment (SunRISE) mission concept would be a constellation of small spacecraft operating as an interferometer designed to localize and track radio emissions in the inner heliosphere. Each spacecraft would carry a receiving system for observations below 25 MHz, and SunRISE would image CMEs more than a few solar radii from the Sun.	[Lazio, T.

We examine network parameters to describe spatio-temporal correlations in the TEC data for January 2016. We find that significant network structure exists distinguishing the dayside and nightside ionosphere, and specific features in the high-latitudes (cusp/ionospheric footpoints of magnetospheric boundary layers, polar cap, and auroral zone), and that these features vary with IMF clock angle. In this brief summary paper, we provide proof of concept results and identify important areas of future research, providing a basis for the discussion of network analysis and machine learning approaches for space weather applications.

LIGO Sci Collaboration; LIGO Sci Collaboration; VIRGO Collaboration	The basic physics of the binary black hole merger GW150914	ANNALEN DER PHYSIK			English	Article							GRAVITATIONAL-RADIATION; MAXIMUM MASS; PULSAR; WAVES	The first direct gravitational-wave detection was made by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The GW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform model, in the filtered detector strain data. Here, features of the signal visible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and general relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere, in showing that the signal was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The black holes were each of approximately 35M(circle dot), still orbited each other as close as similar to 350 km apart and subsequently merged to form a single black hole. Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in gravitational waves.	[Abbott, B.

It presents the first algorithm that uses optimal storage and provably computes a low-rank approximation of a solution. In particular, when all solutions have low rank, the algorithm converges to a solution. This algorithm, SketchyCGM, modifies a standard convex optimization scheme, the conditional gradient method, to store only a small randomized sketch of the matrix variable. After the optimization terminates, the algorithm extracts a low-rank approximation of the solution from the sketch. In contrast to non-convex heuristics, the guarantees for SketchyCGM do not rely on statistical models for the problem data. Numerical work demonstrates the benefits of SketchyCGM over heuristics.

Using example of hydrology, we emphasize how meta-data and ontologies are crucial in such an undertaking. Using the infrastructure being designed for EarthCube - the Virtual Observatory for the earth sciences - we discuss essential steps for better transfer of tools and techniques in the future e.g. domain adaptation. Finally we point out that it is never a one-way process and there is enough for astroinformatics to learn from geoinformatics as well.	[Mahabal, Ashish A.; Djorgovski, S.

Dealing with the size and complexity of this requires new techniques and methodologies. Quasars are an ideal work set for developing and applying these: they vary in a detectable but not easily quantifiable manner whose physical origins are poorly understood. In this paper, we will review how quasars are identified by their variability and how these techniques can be improved, what physical insights into their variability can be gained from studying extreme examples of variability, and what approaches can be taken to increase the number of quasars known. These will demonstrate how astroinformatics is essential to discovering and understanding this important population.	[Graham, Matthew J.; Djorgovski, S.

Updates to the infrastructure and data integration techniques are enabling more than a 10-fold expansion; NED will soon contain over a billion objects with their fundamental attributes fused across the spectrum via cross-identifications among the largest sky surveys (e.g., GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, AllWISE, EMU), and over 100,000 smaller but scientifically important catalogs and journal articles. The recent discovery of super-luminous spiral galaxies exemplifies the opportunities for data mining and science discovery directly from NED's rich data synthesis. Enhancements to the user interface, including new APIs, VO protocols, and queries involving derived physical quantities, are opening new pathways for panchromatic studies of large galaxy samples. Examples are shown of graphics characterizing the content of NED, as well as initial steps in exploring the database via interactive statistical visualizations.

MiNDSTEp differential photometry of the gravitationally lensed quasars WFI 2033-4723 and HE0047-1756: microlensing and a new time delay	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; techniques: photometric; quasars: general	HAMBURG ESO SURVEY; BRIGHT QSOS; LENSING EXPERIMENT; IMAGE SUBTRACTION; COLOR VARIATIONS; HE 0435-1223; COSMOGRAIL; REDSHIFT; GALAXY; FLUX	Aims. We present V and R photometry of the gravitationally lensed quasars WFI 2033-4723 and HE 0047-1756. The data were taken by the MiNDSTEp collaboration with the 1.54 m Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla observatory from 2008 to 2012. Methods. Differential photometry has been carried out using the image subtraction method as implemented in the HOTPAnTS package, additionally using GALFIT for quasar photometry. Results. The quasar WFI 2033-4723 showed brightness variations of order 0.5 mag in V and R during the campaign. The two lensed components of quasar HE 0047-1756 varied by 0.2-0.3 mag within five years. We provide, for the first time, an estimate of the time delay of component B with respect to A of Delta t = (7.6 +/- 1.8) days for this object. We also find evidence for a secular evolution of the magnitude difference between components A and B in both filters, which we explain as due to a long-duration microlensing event. Finally we find that both quasars WFI 2033-4723 and HE 0047-1756 become bluer when brighter, which is consistent with previous studies.	[Giannini, E.; Schmidt, R.

VERITAS Collaboration; MAGIC Collaboration	A SEARCH FOR SPECTRAL HYSTERESIS AND ENERGY-DEPENDENT TIME LAGS FROM X-RAY AND TeV GAMMA-RAY OBSERVATIONS OF Mrk 421	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						BL Lacertae objects: individual (Markarian 421); galaxies: active; gamma rays: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; XMM-NEWTON; MULTIWAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS; VARIABILITY; EMISSION; MARKARIAN-421; TELESCOPE; PHOTONS; BLAZARS; FLARE	Blazars are variable emitters across all wavelengths over a wide range of timescales, from months down to minutes. It is therefore essential to observe blazars simultaneously at different wavelengths, especially in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, where the broadband spectral energy distributions usually peak. In this work, we report on three " target-of-opportunity" observations of Mrk 421, one of the brightest TeV blazars, triggered by a strong flaring event at TeV energies in 2014. These observations feature long, continuous, and simultaneous exposures with XMM-Newton (covering the X-ray and optical/ultraviolet bands) and VERITAS (covering the TeV gamma-ray band), along with contemporaneous observations from other gamma-ray facilities (MAGIC and Fermi-Large Area Telescope) and a number of radio and optical facilities. Although neither rapid flares nor significant X-ray/TeV correlation are detected, these observations reveal subtle changes in the X-ray spectrum of the source over the course of a few days. We search the simultaneous X-ray and TeV data for spectral hysteresis patterns and time delays, which could provide insight into the emission mechanisms and the source properties (e. g., the radius of the emitting region, the strength of the magnetic field, and related timescales). The observed broadband spectra are consistent with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We find that the power spectral density distribution at greater than or similar to 4 x 10(-4) Hz from the X-ray data can be described by a power-law model with an index value between 1.2 and 1.8, and do not find evidence for a steepening of the power spectral index (often associated with a characteristic length scale) compared to the previously reported values at lower frequencies.

SPECTRAL CHANGES IN THE HYPERLUMINOUS PULSAR IN NGC 5907 AS A FUNCTION OF SUPER-ORBITAL PHASE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; pulsars: individual (NGC 5907 ULX1); X-rays: binaries	X-RAY SOURCE; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; BLACK-HOLES; BROAD-BAND; ULTRALUMINOUS STATE; ACCRETION DISKS; NEUTRON-STARS; GX 339-4; 1313 X-1	We present broadband, multi-epoch X-ray spectroscopy of the pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 5907. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data from 2014 are best described by a multicolor blackbody model with a temperature gradient as a function of accretion disk radius significantly flatter than expected for a standard thin accretion disk (T(r) proportional to r(-p), with p = 0.608(-0.012)(+0.014)). Additionally, we detect a hard power-law tail at energies above 10 keV, which we interpret as being due to Comptonization. We compare this observation to archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR data from 2003, 2012, and 2013, and investigate possible spectral changes as a function of phase over the 78-day. super-orbital period of this source. We find that observations taken around phases 0.3-0.4 show very similar temperature profiles, even though the observed flux varies significantly, while one observation taken around phase 0 has a significantly steeper profile. We discuss these findings in light of the recent discovery that the compact object is a neutron star and show that precession of the accretion disk or the neutron star can self-consistently explain most observed phenomena.

DETECTION OF VERY LOW-FREQUENCY, QUASI-PERIODIC OSCILLATIONS IN THE 2015 OUTBURST OF V404 CYGNI	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: statistical; relativistic processes; stars: black holes; X-rays: binaries	X-RAY BINARIES; ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION; LENS-THIRRING PRECESSION; LONG-TERM VARIABILITY; POWER SPECTRAL COMPONENTS; MICROQUASAR GRO J1655-40; BLACK-HOLE TRANSIENTS; NOVA XTE J1550-564; TIMING BEHAVIOR; GS 2023+338	In 2015 June, the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) V404 Cygni went into outburst for the first time since 1989. Here, we present a comprehensive search for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of V404 Cygni during its recent outburst, utilizing data from six instruments on board five different X-ray missions: Swift/XRT, Fermi/GBM, Chandra/ACIS, INTEGRAL's IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X, and NuSTAR. We report the detection of a QPO at 18 mHz simultaneously with both Fermi/GBM and Swift/XRT, another example of a rare but slowly growing new class of mHz-QPOs in BHXRBs linked to sources with a high orbital inclination. Additionally, we find a duo of QPOs in a Chandra/ACIS observation at 73 mHz and 1.03 Hz, as well as a QPO at 136 mHz in a single Swift/XRT observation that can be interpreted as standard Type-C QPOs. Aside from the detected QPOs, there is significant structure in the broadband power, with a strong feature observable in the Chandra observations between 0.1 and 1 Hz. We discuss our results in the context of current models for QPO formation.
