A Control Barrier Perspective on Episodic Learning via Projection-to-State Safety	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS			English	Article						Machine learning; Lyapunov methods; uncertain systems	QUADRATIC PROGRAMS	In this letter we seek to quantify the ability of learning to improve safety guarantees endowed by Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). In particular, we investigate how model uncertainty in the time derivative of a CBF can be reduced via learning, and how this leads to stronger statements on the safe behavior of a system. To this end, we build upon the idea of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to define Projection-to-State Safety (PSSf), which characterizes degradation in safety in terms of a projected disturbance. This enables the direct quantification of both how learning can improve safety guarantees, and how bounds on learning error translate to bounds on degradation in safety. We demonstrate that a practical episodic learning approach can use PSSf to reduce uncertainty and improve safety guarantees in simulation and experimentally.

In this letter, we present a control scheme based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) with robust constraint satisfaction where the constraint uncertainty, stemming from the road users' behavior, is multimodal. The method combines ideas from tube-based and scenario-based MPC strategies in order to approximate the expected cost and to guarantee robust state and input constraint satisfaction. In particular, we design a feedback policy that is a function of the disturbance mode and allows the controller to take less conservative actions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through two numerical simulations, where we compare it against a standard robust MPC formulation.

Multi-Rate Control Design Leveraging Control Barrier Functions and Model Predictive Control Policies	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS			English	Article						Predictive control; autonomous systems; Lyapunov methods		In this letter we present a multi-rate control architecture for safety critical systems. We consider a high level planner and a low level controller which operate at different frequencies. This multi-rate behavior is described by a piecewise nonlinear model which evolves on a continuous and a discrete level. First, we present sufficient conditions which guarantee recursive constraint satisfaction for the closed-loop system. Afterwards, we propose a control design methodology which leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for low level control and Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies for high level planning. The control barrier function is designed using the full nonlinear dynamical model and the MPC is based on a simplified planning model. When the nonlinear system is control affine and the high level planning model is linear, the control actions are computed by solving convex optimization problems at each level of the hierarchy. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on a simulation example, where the low level control action is updated at a higher frequency than the high level command.

Coupled Control Systems: Periodic Orbit Generation With Application to Quadrupedal Locomotion	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS			English	Article						Robotics; cooperative control; optimization	SYNCHRONIZATION	A robotic system can be viewed as a collection of lower-dimensional systems that are coupled via reaction forces (Lagrange multipliers) enforcing holonomic constraints. Inspired by this viewpoint, this letter presents a novel formulation for nonlinear control systems that are subject to coupling constraints via virtual "coupling" inputs that abstractly play the role of Lagrange multipliers. The main contribution of this letter is a process-mirroring solving for Lagrange multipliers in robotic systems-wherein we isolate subsystems free of coupling constraints that provably encode the full-order dynamics of the coupled control system from which it was derived. This dimension reduction is leveraged in the formulation of a nonlinear optimization problem for the isolated subsystem that yields periodic orbits for the full-order coupled system. We consider the application of these ideas to robotic systems, which can be decomposed into subsystems. Specifically, we view a quadruped as a coupled control system consisting of two bipedal robots, wherein applying the framework developed allows for gaits (periodic orbits) to be generated for the individual biped yielding a gait for the full-order quadrupedal dynamics. This is demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot through simulation and walking experiments on rough terrains.

Safety-Critical Event Triggered Control via Input-to-State Safe Barrier Functions	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS			English	Article						Discrete event systems; sampled-data control; Lyapunov methods		The efficient utilization of available resources while simultaneously achieving control objectives is a primary motivation in the event-triggered control paradigm. In many modern control applications, one such objective is enforcing the safety of a system. The goal of this letter is to carry out this vision by combining event-triggered and safety-critical control design. We discuss how a direct transcription, in the context of safety, of event-triggered methods for stabilization may result in designs that are not implementable on real hardware due to the lack of a minimum interevent time. We provide an example showing this phenomena and, building on the insight gained, propose an event-triggered control approach via Input-to-State Safe Barrier Functions that achieves safety while ensuring that interevent times are uniformly lower bounded.

Separable Control Lyapunov Functions With Application to Prostheses	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS			English	Article						Lyapunov methods; nonlinear systems; prosthetics	ROBOTIC WALKING	This letter extends bipedal trajectory tracking methods to prostheses to enable construction of a class of model-dependent prosthesis controllers using locally available sensor information. The rapidly exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov functions (RES-CLFs) developed for bipedal robots guarantee stability of the hybrid zero dynamics in the presence of impacts that occur in walking. These methods cannot be directly applied to prostheses because of the unknown human dynamics. We overcome this challenge with two RES-CLFs, one for the prosthesis subsystem and another for the remaining human system. Further, we outline a method to construct these RES-CLFs for this type of separable system by first constructing separable CLFs for partially feedback linearizable systems. This letter develops a class of separable subsystem controllers that rely only on local information but provide formal guarantees of stability for the full hybrid system with zero dynamics.

While a majority of these historic results on set invariance consider flow conditions on the boundary, this letter fully characterizes set invariance through minimal barrier functions by directly appealing to a comparison result to define a flow condition over the entire domain of the system. A considerable benefit of this approach is the removal of regularity assumptions of the barrier function. This letter also outlines necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid differential inequality condition, giving the minimum conditions for this type of approach. We also show when minimal barrier functions are necessary and sufficient for set invariance.

The NCM uses a deep long short-term memory recurrent neural network for a global approximation of an optimal contraction metric, the existence of which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability of nonlinear systems. The optimality stems from the fact that the contraction metrics sampled offline are the solutions of a convex optimization problem to minimize an upper bound of the steady-state Euclidean distance between perturbed and unperturbed system trajectories. We demonstrate how to exploit NCMs to design an online optimal estimator and controller for nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances utilizing their duality. The performance of our framework is illustrated through Lorenz oscillator state estimation and spacecraft optimal motion planning problems.

Agent-to-agent communication is not required, yet a simple broadcasting scheme improves the performance of the algorithm. The key idea is based on a control barrier function constructed with a backup controller, and we show that by assuming other agents respecting the same CBF condition, the supervisory control algorithm can be implemented decentrally and guarantees obstacle avoidance for all agents.

We focus our study on a Gilbert-type delta growing by the sediment discharged at the river mouth. The evolving velocity of the shoreline depends on its local geometrical configuration including the water depth, repose angle, and curvature. Linear analysis of this local model suggests that when the sediment supply to the shoreline front can be maintained at a constant value, unstable growth occurs for adverse bathymetry (back-tilted basement) and there exists a critical water depth that leads to a self-similar evolution. A novel nonlinear analysis based on a rescaling idea reveals that there exists a critical flux J(c) at the shoreline such that a desired shoreline shape can be achieved and maintained self-similarly independent of the water depth information, though the critical flux J(c) may depend on the water depth. We then develop a semi-implicit numerical method to investigate the nonlinear dynamic of the shoreline. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with the linear theory when the shape perturbation is small, and confirm that in the nonlinear regime the shoreline may evolve self-similarly under J(c). In particular, we demonstrate that a prescribed shoreline morphology can be achieved by a well-designed J(c). The existence of shape-preserving growing delta goes beyond the well known dynamical patterns and highlights the feasibility of shape control. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During operation, however, the batteries experience substantial current ripple. Conventional ripple-current reduction methods rely on bulky passive components or complicated control. This article presents modulation and common-mode voltage injection methods for cascaded double-H-bridge converters (CHB2). The control methods directly mitigate the source of the ripple current-the fluctuating arm power-by exploiting the parallel interconnection across the CHB2 arms. In the lab setup, the proposed solution approximately halves the battery current ripple compared to the CHB counterpart.

Deep-ultraviolet Raman spectra of Mars-relevant evaporite minerals under 248.6 nm excitation	ICARUS			English	Article						Mineralogy; Deep-UV Raman spectroscopy; Mars; Evaporites; Mineral spectroscopy	CARBONATE; SPECTROSCOPY; BORATE; ABSORPTION; SEARCH; ROCKS	We have measured the deep-ultraviolet (DUV) Raman spectra of a number of evaporite minerals that are relevant to lacustrine and fluvial environments found on Earth and Mars, and show that DUV Raman can provide detailed information on elemental composition and crystal structure. The minerals included three borates, eight carbonates, and seven sulfates, with each class of mineral exhibited very distinct spectra under 248.6 nm excitation, dominated by the various internal vibrations of the borate, carbonate or sulfate oxyanion. Peak positions were shifted by markedly lower wavenumbers vs positions reported in the literature for longer wavelengths, a phenomenon we ascribe to the effect of pre-resonance with the oxyanion. Within each class, minerals consisting different metallic cations could be distinguished by the position of the dominant vibrational mode and the relative intensities of the minor modes, ascribed to the electrostatic impact of the cation on the vibrational behavior of the oxyanion. There was also evidence that DUV Raman can reveal minor metallic components even if they are not apparent in XRD, as two of three calcite (CaCO3) samples exhibited a shoulder on the dominant peak consistent with perturbation by similar to 19% Mg. UV absorption by Fe2+/3+ was a major factor in determining measurable signal, with Fe-rich minerals exhibiting weak/undetectable spectra. Understanding the spectra of these evaporite minerals will be essential to interpreting and identifying complex mineral samples using this technique, and represents an important addition to the spectral standards library of DUV Raman spectroscopy.

In this study, we employ a bonded-interface indentation technique coupled with strain field mapping to identify the governing yield criterion in metallic glass composites as a function of their microstructural length scales. A crossover from the shear plane to maximum shear stress yield criterion is uncovered at a crystalline fraction of approximately 60%, thus signaling an effective transition from incipient to homogeneous flow as the dominant deformation mode of the composite microstructure.

A look back, part II: The drilling campaign of the Curiosity rover during the Mars Science Laboratory's second and third martian years	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Instrumentation; Mars, surface; Prebiotic environments	GALE CRATER; K-AR; SANDSTONE; MUDSTONE; MINERALOGY; KIMBERLEY; CHEMCAM	The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, completed its second Martian year, 1337 sols (1374 Earth days), of operation on May 11, 2016, and its third Martian year, 2006 sols (2061 Earth days), of operation on March 28, 2018. During this time the rover successfully drilled twelve full depth drill holes into the Martian surface and analyzed the recovered material using onboard instruments, giving us new insights into the potential habitability and geologic diversity of ancient Mars. During the second Martian year, four holes were drilled into the mudstones of the Murray formation: 'Confidence Hills' (Sol 759), 'Mojave 2' (Sol 882), 'Telegraph Peak' (908) & 'Buckskin' (Sol 1060); while four more holes were drilled into the sandstones of the Stimson formation: 'Big Sky' (Sol 1119), 'Greenhorn' (Sol 1137), 'Lubango' (Sol 1320) & 'Okoruso' (Sol 1332). During the third Martian year, four additional holes were drilled into the Murray formation: 'Oudam' (Sol 1361), 'Marimba' (Sol 1422), 'Quela' (Sol 1464) & 'Sebina' (Sol 1495). In this paper, we will give a brief overview of the rover sampling hardware and nominal drilling protocols, followed by a discussion of how these protocols were refined and altered early during the course of Curiosity's second year on Mars. In addition, we will describe the 'Bonanza King' (Sol 724) drill campaign, the mission's first 'successful failure', and how it influenced these changes. We will also briefly discuss the events leading up to the drill feed fault on Sol 1536, which resulted in suspension of all drill activities for the remainder of the third Martian year. Finally, we will present scientific highlights obtained from each drill site utilizing MSL's onboard instrumentation (SAM & CheMin), results enabled by the drill's ability to excavate sample at depth and transfer it to these instruments.

Vertically-resolved observations of Jupiter's quasi-quadrennial oscillation from 2012 to 2019	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter; Atmospheres; Structure; Infrared observations; Spectroscopy	ROTOTRANSLATIONAL ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; PLANETARY-SCALE DISTURBANCE; EQUATORIAL OSCILLATION; BIENNIAL OSCILLATION; TEMPERATURES; JET; DISRUPTION; RESOLUTION	Over the last eight years, a rich dataset of mid-infrared CH4 observations from the TEXES instrument at IRTF has been used to characterize the thermal evolution of Jupiter's stratosphere. These data were used to produce vertically-resolved temperature maps between latitudes of 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N, allowing us to track approximately two periods of Jupiter's quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO). During the first five years of observations, the QQO has a smooth sinusoidal pattern with a period of 4.0 +/- 0.2 years and an amplitude of 7 +/- 1 K at 13.5 mbar (our region of maximum sensitivity). In 2017, we note an abrupt change to this pattern, with the phase being shifted backwards by similar to 1 year. Searching for possible causes of this QQO delay, we investigated the TEXES zonally-resolved temperature retrievals and found that in May/June 2017, there was an unusually warm thermal anomaly located at a latitude of 28 degrees N and a pressure of 1.2 mbar, moving westward with a velocity of 19 +/- 4 ms(-1). We suggest that there may be a link between these two events.	[Giles, R. S.; Greathouse, T. K.] Southwest Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78238 USA; [Cosentino, R.

Starting from available data regarding species composition, temperature and pressure, the general thermodynamic and transport properties of the Venus lower atmosphere are first computed at altitudes below the cloud layer. The thermodynamic and transport properties are validated with known data. A thermodynamic stability analysis for a variety of potentially existing mixtures is conducted to highlight the sensitivity of the thermodynamic regime to the variation of the species molar fractions. The limits of thermodynamic stability are represented in the thermodynamic phase diagram of the mixture, and thus regions of phase stability and instability are determined. It is found that the Venus lower-atmosphere thermodynamic regime is located in the stable, single-phase regime, with supercritical conditions occurring in the lower few kilometers, thereby validating ad-hoc expectations which have never envisaged the existence of a two-phase regime at those altitudes. Using thermodynamic and transport-property information thus computed, several non-dimensional numbers are calculated. The Prandtl number is first evaluated. Then, the characteristic Reynolds number is estimated for different assumed length scales, showing that, independent of the length scale, the entire lower atmosphere below the cloud deck is in a fully-turbulent flow regime. Finally, the speed of sound and the Mach number are computed as function of altitude. The information obtained from all these calculations fills a scientific void, and may be crucial for the design of landers on the Venus surface.

The loss from the atmosphere is the main mass source for Jupiter's large magnetosphere. Numerous previous studies attributed various transient phenomena in Io's environment and Jupiter's magnetosphere to a sudden change in the mass loss from the atmosphere supposedly triggered by a change in volcanic activity. Since the gas in volcanic plumes does not escape directly, such causal correlation would require a transient volcano-induced change in atmospheric abundance, which has never been observed so far. Here we report four observations of atmospheric SO2 and NaCl from the same hemisphere of Io, obtained with the IRAM NOEMA interferometer on 11 December 2016, 14 March, 6 and 29 April 2017. These observations are compared to measurements of volcanic hot spots and Io's neutral and plasma environment. We find a stable NaCl column density in Io's atmosphere on the four dates. The SO2 column density derived for December 2016 is about 30% lower compared to the SO2 column density found in the period of March to April 2017. This increase in SO2 from December 2016 to March 2017 might be related to increasing volcanic activity observed at several sites in spring 2017, but the stability of the volcanic trace gas NaCl and resulting decrease in NaCl/SO2 ratio do not support this interpretation. Observed dimmings in both the sulfur ion torus and Na neutral cloud suggest rather a decrease in mass loading in the period of increasing SO2 abundance. The dimming Na brightness and stable atmospheric NaCl furthermore dispute an earlier suggested positive correlation of the sodium cloud and the hot spot activity at Loki Patara, which considerably increased in this period. The environment of Io overall appears to be in a rather quiescent state, preventing further conclusions. Only Jupiter's aurora morphology underwent several short-term changes, which are apparently unrelated to Io's quiescent environment or the relatively stable atmosphere.

Constraints on Neptune's haze structure and formation from VLT observations in the H-band	ICARUS			English	Article						Neptune; Haze microphysics; Radiative transfer	ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; STRATOSPHERIC HAZE; CLOUD STRUCTURE; OVERTONE BAND; TEMPERATURES; ATMOSPHERE; URANUS; MODEL; PAIRS; PHOTOCHEMISTRY	A 1-dimensional microphysics model has been used to constrain the structure and formation of haze in Neptune's atmosphere. These simulations were coupled to a radiative-transfer and retrieval code (NEMESIS) to model spectral observations of Neptune in the H-band performed by the SINFONI Integral Field Unit Spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2013. It was found that observations in the H-band and with emission angles <= 60 degrees are largely unaffected by the imaginary refractive index of haze particles, allowing a notable reduction of the free parameters required to fit the observations. Our analysis shows a total haze production rate of (2.61 +/- 0.18) x 10(-14) kg m(-2) s(-1), about 10 times larger than that found in Uranus's atmosphere, and a particle electric charge of q = 8.6 +/- 1.1 electrons per mu m radius at latitudes between 5 and 15 degrees S. This haze production rate in Neptune results in haze optical depths about 10 times greater than those in Uranus. The effective radius r(eff) was found to be 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 0.26 +/- 0.02 mu m at the 0.1 and 1-bar levels, respectively, with haze number densities of 8.48(+1.78)(-1.31) and 9.31(+2.52)(-1.91) particles per cm(3). The fit at weak methane-absorbing wavelengths reveals also the presence of a tropospheric cloud with a total optical depth >10 at 1.46 mu m. The tropospheric cloud base altitude was found near the 2.5-bar level, although this estimation may be only representative of the top of a thicker and deeper cloud. Our analysis leads to haze opacities about 3.5 times larger than that derived from Voyager-2 observations (Moses et al., 1995). This larger opacity indicates a haze production rate 2 times larger at least. To study this difference haze opacity or production rate, we performed a timescale analysis with our microphysical model to estimate the time required for haze particles to grow and settle out. Although this analysis shows haze timescales (similar to 15 years) shorter than the time lapsed between Voyager-2 observations and 2013, the solar illumination at the top of the atmosphere has not varied significantly during this period (at the studied latitudes) to explain the increase in haze production. This difference in haze production rate derived for these two periods may arise from: a) the fact that in our analysis we employed spectral observations in the infrared (H-band), while Moses et al. (1995) used photometric images taken at 5 different filters in the visible. While high-phase-angle Voyager observations are more sensitive to small haze particles and at altitudes above the 0.1-bar level, the haze constraints derived from VLT spectra in H-band are limited to pressures greater than 0.1 bar. As a result of the different phase angles of the two set of observations, differences in the estimation of M-0 may arise from the use of Mie phase functions as well. b) our 1-dimensional model does not account for latitudinal redistributions of the haze by dynamics. A possible meridional transport of haze with wind velocities greater than similar to 0.03 m s(-1) would result in dynamics timescales shorter than 15 years and thus might explain the observed variations in the haze production rate during this period. Compared with our estimations, photochemical models point to even larger production rates on Neptune (by a factor of 2.4). Assuming that the photochemical simulations are correct, we found that this discrepancy can be explained if haze particles evaporate before reaching the tropospheric-cloud levels. This scenario would decrease the cumulative haze opacity above the 1-bar level, and thus a larger haze production rate would be required to fit our observations. However, to validate this haze vertical structure future microphysical simulations that include the evaporation rates of haze particles are required.	[Toledo, Daniel; Irwin, Patrick G.

J	Watkins, JA; Ehlmann, BL; Yin, A				Watkins, Jessica A.; Ehlmann, Bethany L.; Yin, An			Spatiotemporal evolution, mineralogical composition, and transport mechanisms of long-runout landslides in Valles Marineris, Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Landslides; Morphology; Geological processes; Hydrated minerals; Mars	ACOUSTIC FLUIDIZATION; SILICATE MINERALS; ROCK AVALANCHES; MASS MOVEMENTS; DEBRIS FLOWS; MOBILITY; ORIGIN; WATER; ICE; STURZSTROMS	Long-runout landslides with transport distances of >50 km are ubiquitous in Valles Marineris (VM), yet the transport mechanisms remain poorly understood. Four decades of studies reveal significant variation in landslide morphology and emplacement age, but how these variations are related to landslide transport mechanisms is not clear. In this study, we address this question by conducting systematic geological mapping and compositional analysis of VM long-runout landslides using high-resolution Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter imagery and spectral data. Our work shows that: (1) a two-zone morphological division (i.e., an inner zone characterized by rotated blocks and an outer zone expressed by a thin sheet with a nearly flat surface) characterizes all major VM landslides; (2) landslide mobility is broadly dependent on landslide mass; and (3) the maximum width of the outer zone and its transport distance are inversely related to the basal friction that was estimated from the surface slope angle of the outer zone. Our comprehensive Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) compositional analysis indicates that hydrated silicates are common in landslide outer zones and nearby trough-floor deposits. Furthermore, outer zones containing hydrated minerals are sometimes associated with longer runout and increased lateral spreading compared to those without detectable hydrated minerals. Finally, with one exception we find that hydrated minerals are absent in the inner zones of the investigated VM landslides. These results as whole suggest that hydrated minerals may have contributed to the magnitude of lateral spreading and long-distance forward transport of major VM landslides.

Sharp") in Gale crater, Mars. They were observed in HiRISE images acquired from orbit prior to the landing of the Curiosity rover. The rover was used to investigate three of these units named Blackfoot, Brandberg, and Bimbe between sols 1099 and 1410. These unconsolidated units overlie the lower Murray formation that forms the base of Mt. Sharp, and consist of pebbles, cobbles and boulders. Blackfoot also overlies portions of the Stimson formation, which consists of eolian sandstone that is understood to significantly postdate the dominantly lacustrine deposition of the Murray formation. Blackfoot is elliptical in shape (62 x 26 m), while Brandberg is nearly circular (50 x 55 m), and Bimbe is irregular in shape, covering about ten times the area of the other two. The largest boulders are 1.5-2.5 m in size and are interpreted to be sandstones. As seen from orbit, some boulders are light-toned and others are dark-toned. Rover-based observations show that both have the same gray appearance from the ground and their apparently different albedos in orbital observations result from relatively flat skyfacing surfaces. Chemical observations show that two clasts of fine sandstone at Bimbe have similar compositions and morphologies to nine ChemCam targets observed early in the mission, near Yellowknife Bay, including the Bathurst Inlet outcrop, and to at least one target (Pyramid Hills, Sol 692) and possibly a cap rock unit just north of Hidden Valley, locations that are several kilometers apart in distance and tens of meters in elevation. These findings may suggest the earlier existence of draping strata, like the Stimson formation, that would have overlain the current surface from Bimbe to Yellowknife Bay. Compositionally these extinct strata could be related to the Siccar Point group to which the Stimson formation belongs. Dark, massive sandstone blocks at Bimbe are chemically distinct from blocks of similar morphology at Bradbury Rise, except for a single float block, Oscar (Sol 516). Conglomerates observed along a low, sinuous ridge at Bimbe consist of matrix and clasts with compositions similar to the Stimson formation, suggesting that stream beds likely existed nearly contemporaneously with the dunes that eventually formed the Stimson formation, or that they had the same source material. In either case, they represent a later pulse of fluvial activity relative to the lakes associated with the Murray formation. These three units may be local remnants of infilled impact craters (especially circular-shaped Brandberg), decayed buttes, patches of unconsolidated fluvial deposits, or residual mass-movement debris. Their incorporation of Stimson and Murray rocks, the lack of lithification, and appearance of being erosional remnants suggest that they record erosion and deposition events that post-date the exposure of the Stimson formation.

J	Wang, C; Gharib, M				Wang, Cong; Gharib, Morteza			Effect of the dynamic slip boundary condition on the near-wall turbulent boundary layer	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						turbulence control; turbulent boundary layers; drag reduction	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DRAG REDUCTION; FLOWS; MECHANICS; WAVE	The manipulation of near-wall turbulent structures in a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) is an effective way to reduce the turbulent frictional drag. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a novel approach for the manipulation of near-wall structures in a TBL with Reynolds number (Re-theta) set to 1200. The manipulation is achieved by employing a sustainable wall-attached air-film array. The static and dynamic interface configuration of the air film can be modulated, which generates a dynamic slip boundary condition. For modulation frequencies within the TBL receptivity, this approach shows that it can effectively modify the TBL near-wall velocity/vorticity field. For a typical modulation frequency of 50 Hz, the near-wall mean streamwise velocity decreases and the wall-normal velocity increases when compared to the canonical flat plate TBL. The mean transverse vorticity is suppressed in the near-wall region and its peak is `pushed' outward away from the wall. In the vicinity of modulated air-film array, the phase-locked velocity/vorticity field demonstrates harmonic motions such as a Stokes-type oscillatory motion. The distribution of shear stresses indicates suppressed momentum transfer toward the wall. Estimation of the wall skin friction via the Clauser chart method indicates a reduction of the wall skin friction up to 40% in the downstream region of the air-film array. A control volume analysis shows that the TBL gains a significant amount of momentum over the oscillating air films, which suggests that the oscillating air film acts like a source of momentum. This pumping effect could potentially explain the observed wall skin friction reduction effect.

By incorporating environmental noise, the model has been shown to be robust to natural variations. Apart from the role of noise, the apparent ubiquity of quasi-periodicity in nature also motivates a more comprehensive understanding of periodically-coupled models of Parrondo's paradox. Such models can enable a wider range of applications of the Parrondo effect to biological and social systems. In this paper, we modify the canonical Parrondo's games to show how the Parrondo effect can still be achieved despite the increased complexity in periodically-noisy environments. Our results suggest the extension of Parrondo's paradox to real-world phenomena strongly subjected to periodic variations, such as ecological systems experiencing seasonal changes, disease in wildlife and humans, or resource management.

Ambiguity in mean-flow-based linear analysis	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						jet noise	TURBULENT; STABILITY; FRAMEWORK; SOUND	Linearisation of the Navier-Stokes equations about the mean of a turbulent flow forms the foundation of popular models for energy amplification and coherent structures, including resolvent analysis. While the Navier-Stokes equations can be equivalently written using many different sets of dependent variables, we show that the properties of the linear operator obtained via linearisation about the mean depend on the variables in which the equations are written prior to linearisation, and can be modified under nonlinear transformation of variables. For example, we show that using primitive and conservative variables leads to differences in the singular values and modes of the resolvent operator for turbulent jets, and that the differences become more severe as variable-density effects increase. This lack of uniqueness of mean-flow-based linear analysis provides new opportunities for optimising models by specific choice of variables while also highlighting the importance of carefully accounting for the nonlinear terms that act as a forcing on the resolvent operator.

Charge-carrier transmission across twins in graphene	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						graphene; twining; charge-carrier transport; Landauer-Buttiker formalism; tight-binding model	DISCRETE DISLOCATIONS; TRANSPORT	Twinning is a known accommodation mechanism of graphene that results in low-energy microstructures or twins. In view of their mechanical stability, twins suggest themselves as a possible means of introducing extended defects in graphene leading to the opening of transmission band gaps. We investigate charge-carrier transmission across the twin structures in graphene using the Landauer-Buttiker (LB) formalism in combination with a tight-binding model. We verify the approach by means of selected comparisons with density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations using the code SIESTA and TRANSIESTA. The calculations reveal that graphene twins open transport gaps depending on the twin geometry up to maximum of 1.15 eV. As previously reported for grain boundaries, we find that localized states arise at dislocation cores in the twin boundaries that introduce peaks near the Fermi level.	[Arca, F.; Ariza, M.

Modern constraints on the sources and climate signals recorded by sedimentary plant waxes in west Greenland	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Compound-specific hydrogen isotopes; Compound-specific carbon isotopes; Leaf waxes; Paleohydrology; Paleoclimate; Arctic lakes; Greenland; Kangerlussuaq	DELTA-D VALUES; HYDROGEN-ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; N-ALKANOIC ACIDS; LEAF WAXES; ORGANIC-MATTER; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; ALKYL LIPIDS; TERRESTRIAL PLANTS; VEGETATION CHANGE; FATTY-ACIDS	The hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2 values) of plant waxes preserved in the sedimentary record is a useful proxy for past hydroclimate, but a number of known biological and environmental factors can confound the climate signal this proxy records. High-latitude ecology and environmental conditions differ from those of the better-studied low latitudes, and the influence of arctic conditions on factors that affect delta H-2 records of climate is poorly constrained. Direct observations of arctic plant waxes and their delta H-2 values, particularly from aquatic plants, are very limited. Here we present a study of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid homologue distributions, delta H-2 values, and delta C-13 values from west Greenland, including measurements of terrestrial and aquatic plants, algae, and Nostoc (colonial cyanobacteria). By examining samples collected from the same region and season, we focus on climate-independent factors that may affect the delta H-2 values of sedimentary plant waxes. We observe that the average abundance of leaf n-alkyl lipids (C-20-C-31) in common terrestrial plants from this region exceeds that in aquatic sources by up to 30x. We also note weaker source specificity in n-alkanoic acids than in n-alkanes. A comparison of these data with surface sedimentary plant waxes from a lake within the study area, previously reported by McFarlin et al. (2019), indicates that at this site both mid-chain and long-chain sedimentary waxes are likely to derive from dominantly terrestrial sources, particularly biased towards the genus Salix. Abundance-weighted isotope data reveal that while terrestrial plants show taxonomic trends in delta H-2 values, the amplitude of these trends is unlikely to exceed the error of the proxy (the standard deviation on calculated epsilon(app)). n-Alkane epsilon(app) values are more variable in aquatic than in terrestrial sources, with median values ranging from -115 parts per thousand in n-C-31 to -143 parts per thousand in n-C-21. However, because sedimentary waxes at our study site are most similar to terrestrial plants for all homologues (in isotopic composition and proportional abundance), the large variability in aquatic epsilon(app) is unlikely to strongly impact sedimentary wax delta H-2 values here and in comparable environments. Our findings do not support using comparisons of mid- and long-chain homologues to infer differences between lake water and precipitation without independent validation of the source of mid-chain waxes. Nevertheless, we show that homologue abundance, delta H-2 values, and delta C-13 values of sedimentary n-alkanes can inform wax-based reconstructions of paleoclimate at high latitudes. This work provides new insights into the wax contributions from west Greenland plant communities and highlights important areas for future studies of arctic plants and plant wax proxies.

Dynamic and Versatile Humanoid Walking via Embedding 3D Actuated SLIP Model With Hybrid LIP Based Stepping	IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS			English	Article						Humanoid and bipedal locomotion; legged robots; slip; hybrid-linear inverted pendulum	LEGGED LOCOMOTION	In this letter, we propose an efficient approach to generate dynamic and versatile humanoid walking with non-constant center of mass (COM) height. We exploit the benefits of using reduced order models (ROMs) and stepping control to generate dynamic and versatile walking motion. Specifically, we apply the stepping controller based on the Hybrid Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (H-LIP) to perturb a periodic walking motion of a 3D actuated Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (3D-aSLIP), which yields versatile walking behaviors of the 3D-aSLIP, including various 3D periodic walking, fixed location tracking, and global trajectory tracking. The 3D-aSLIP walking is then embedded on the fully-actuated humanoid via the task space control on the COM dynamics and ground reaction forces. The proposed approach is realized on the robot model of Atlas in simulation, wherein versatile dynamic motions are generated.

On-board terrain classification using visual information has limitations, and is sensitive to illumination conditions. Classification can be improved if one fuses visual imagery with additional infrared (IR) imagery of the scene, yet unfortunately there are no IR image sensors on the current Mars rovers. A virtual IR sensor, estimating IR from RGB imagery using deep learning, was proposed in the context of a MU-Net architecture. However, virtual IR estimation was limited by the fact that slope angle variations induce temperature differences within the same terrain. This paper removes this limitation, giving good IR estimates and as a consequence improving terrain classification by including the additional angle from the surface normal to the Sun and the measurement of solar radiation. The estimates are also useful when estimating thermal inertia, which can enhance slip prediction and small rock density estimation. Our approach is demonstrated in two applications. We collected a new data set to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show its benefit by applying to the two applications.

Intensified traction associated with the Late Cretaceous flattening of the subducting Farallon plate, responsible for deforming the SW U.S., likely played a key role in "bulldozing" the tectonically eroded LC-SCML similar to 500 km eastwards, to underneath the Colorado Plateau Transition Zone (CPTZ) and further inboard. The garnet clinopyroxenite xenoliths from two CPTZ localities, Chino Valley and Camp Creek (central Arizona), provide a rare glimpse of the material underlying the CPTZ. Thermodynamic modeling, in addition to major and trace element thermobarometry, suggests that the xenoliths experienced peak conditions of equilibration at 600-900 degrees C and 12-28 lobar. These peak conditions, along with the composition of the xenoliths (type "B" garnet and diopsidic clinopyroxene) strongly suggest a continental arc residue ("arclogite"), rather than a lower plate subduction ("eclogite"), origin. A bimodal zircon U-Pb age distribution with peaks at ca. 75 and 150 Ma, and a Jurassic Sm-Nd garnet age (154 +/- 16 Ma, with initial sNd value of +8) overlaps eastern SCB pluton ages and suggests a consanguineous relationship. Cenozoic zircon U-Pb ages, REE geochemistry of zircon grains, and partially re-equilibrated Sm-Nd garnet ages indicate that displaced arclogite remained at elevated PT conditions (>700 degrees C) for lOs of Myr following its dispersal until late Oligocene entrainment in host latite. With a similar to 100 Myr long thermal history overlapping that of the SCB and the CPTZ, these assemblages also contain evidence for late-stage hydration (e.g. secondary amphibole), potentially driven by de-watering of the Laramide slab. In light of these results, we suggest that the CPTZ arclogite originates from beneath the eastern half of the SCB, where it began forming in Late Jurassic time as mafic keel to continental arc magmas. The displacement and re-affixation of the arclogites further inboard during the Late Cretaceous flat slab subduction, might have contributed to the tectonic stability of the Colorado Plateau relative to adjacent geologic provinces through Laramide time and likely preconditioned the region to Cenozoic tectonism, e.g. present-day delamination beneath the plateau, high-magnitude extension and formation of metamorphic core complexes.

Basaltic lavas from some of these hotspots show anomalous daughter isotope abundances for the short-lived I-129-Xe-129, Sm-146-Nd-142, and Hf-182-W-182 radioactive decay systems, suggesting that their lower mantle sources contain material that dates back to Earth-forming events during the first 100 million years in solar system history. Survival of such 'primordial' remnants in Earth's mantle places important constraints on the evolution and inner workings of terrestrial planets. Here we report high-precision W-182/W-184 measurements for a large suite of kimberlite volcanic rocks from across the African tectonic plate, which for the past 250 million years has drifted over the most prominent thermochemical seismic anomaly at the core-mantle boundary. This so-called African LLSVP, or 'large low shear-wave velocity province', is widely suspected to store early Earth remnants and is implicated as the ultimate source of global Phanerozoic kimberlite magmatism. Our results show, however, that kimberlites from above the African LLSVP, including localities with lower mantle diamonds such as Letseng and Karowe Orapa A/K6, lack anomalous W-182 signatures, with an average mu W-182 value of 0.0 +/- 4.1 (2SD) for the 18 occurrences studied. If kimberlites are indeed sourced from the African LLSVP or superplume, then the extensive W-182 evidence suggests that primordial or core-equilibrated mantle materials, which may contribute resolvable mu W-182 excesses or deficits, are only minor or locally concentrated components in the lowermost mantle, for example in the much smaller 'ultra-low velocity zones' or ULVZs. However, the lack of anomalous W-182 may simply suggest that low-volume kimberlite magmas are not derived from hot lower mantle plumes. In this alternative scenario, kimberlite magmas originate from volatile-fluxed ambient convecting upper mantle domains beneath relatively thick and cold lithosphere from where previously 'stranded' lower mantle and transition zone diamonds can be plucked.

Although one of the main advantages of spherical robots is their capability to operate on uneven surfaces, energy analysis and path planning of such systems have been studied only for flat terrains. This work introduces a novel approach to evaluate the dynamic equations, energy consumption, and separation analysis of these robots rolling on uneven terrains. The presented dynamics modeling, separation analysis, and energy analysis allow us to implement path planning algorithms to find an optimal path. One of the advantages of this work is that these algorithms can be used when either the analytical or the empirical information about the terrain is available.

Identifying the proton loading site cluster in the ba(3) cytochrome c oxidase that loads and traps protons	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS			English	Article						Monte Carlo sampling; Cytochrome c oxidase; Proton affinity; MCCE	COUPLED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; PUMPING MECHANISM; CATALYTIC CYCLE; ACTIVE-SITE; HEME; TRANSLOCATION; ELECTROSTATICS; DYNAMICS; LIGAND; MODEL	Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) is the terminal electron acceptor in aerobic respiratory chain, reducing O-2 to water. The released free energy is stored by pumping protons through the protein, maintaining the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. Protons are held transiently in a proton loading site (PLS) that binds and releases protons driven by the electron transfer reaction cycle. Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics (MCCE) was applied to crystal structures and Molecular Dynamics snapshots of the B-type Thermus thermophilus CcO. Six residues are identified as the PLS, binding and releasing protons as the charges on heme b and the binuclear center are changed: the heme a(3) propionic acids, Asp287, Asp372, His376 and G1u126B. The unloaded state has one proton and the loaded state two protons on these six residues. Different input structures, modifying the PLS conformation, show different proton distributions and result in different proton pumping behaviors. One loaded and one unloaded protonation states have the loaded/unloaded states close in energy so the PLS binds and releases a proton through the reaction cycle. The alternative proton distributions have state energies too far apart to be shifted by the electron transfers so are locked in loaded or unloaded states. Here the protein can use active states to load and unload protons, but has nearby trapped states, which stabilize PLS protonation state, providing new ideas about the CcO proton pumping mechanism. The distance between the PLS residues Asp287 and His376 correlates with the energy difference between loaded and unloaded states.

The introduced framework allows us to consider the nonlinear dynamics of MAVs, nonlinear geometric constraints, while guarantees real-time performance. Our first contribution is to reveal underlying planes within a 3D point cloud, obtained from a 3D lidar scanner, by designing an efficient subspace clustering method. The second contribution is to incorporate the extracted information into the nonlinear constraints of NMPC for avoiding collisions. Our third contribution focuses on making the controller robust by considering the uncertainty of localization in NMPC using Shannon's entropy to define the weights involved in the optimization process. This strategy enables us to track position or velocity references or none in the event of losing track of position or velocity estimations. As a result, the collision avoidance constraints are defined in the local coordinates of the MAV and it remains active and guarantees collision avoidance, despite localization uncertainties, e.g., position estimation drifts. The efficacy of the suggested framework has been evaluated using various simulations in the Gazebo environment.

The proposed NMPC formulation allows for a fully parametric obstacle trajectory, while in this letter we apply a classification scheme to differentiate between different kinds of trajectories to predict future obstacle positions. The trajectory calculation is done from an initial condition, and fed to the NMPC as an additional input. The solver used is the nonlinear, non-convex solver Proximal Averaged Newton for Optimal Control (PANOC) and its associated software OpEn (Optimization Engine), in which we apply a penalty method to properly consider the obstacles and other constraints during navigation. The proposed NMPC scheme allows for real-time solutions using a sampling time of 50 ms and a two second prediction of both the obstacle trajectory and the NMPC problem, which implies that the scheme can be considered as a local path-planner. This letter will present the NMPC cost function and constraint formulation, as well as the methodology of dealing with the dynamic obstacles. We include multiple laboratory experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control architecture, and to show that the proposed method delivers fast and computationally stable solutions to the dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.

Coniacian-Campanian magnetostratigraphy of the Marambio Group: The Santonian-Campanian boundary in the Antarctic Peninsula and the complete Upper Cretaceous - Lowermost Paleogene chronostratigraphical framework for the James Ross Basin	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Late Cretaceous; Ammonites; Paleomagnetism; Biostatigraphy; Cretaceous Normal Superchron; Coniacian-Santonian boundary	BACK-ARC; ISLAND; STRATIGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; AMMONITES; PATTERNS; STRATA; ANDES; STAGE; FAN	Recent magnetostratigraphic works from different areas of the James Ross Basin have expanded on chronostratigraphic studies previously based on ammonite, palynomorph and nanoplankton biostratigraphy, and strontium isotope stratigraphy. Here we present a new magnetostratigraphy of Coniacian through Campanian marine sedimentary rocks from Hidden Lake, Santa Marta and Snow Hill Island Formations, on northwest James Ross Island. A total of 189 paleomagnetic directions were obtained along more than 1500 m of stratigraphic thickness from Brandy Bay to Santa Marta Cove areas, identifying three polarity chrons of the global polarity time scale. The local magnetostratigraphic column starts in the upper part of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron C34N (Coniacian) and ends in Chron C33N (middle Campanian). The correlation between the magnetostratigraphy and the age framework given by ammonite biostratigraphy allowed the assignment of precise ages to particular horizons of the Santa Marta Formation. The newly identified geomagnetic polarity reversals are the earliest identified in the James Ross Basin and include: a) C34N/C33R (84.2 Ma, late Santonian - early Campanian) in the Alpha Member of the Santa Marta Formation and b) C33R/C33N (79.9 Ma, middle Campanian) in the upper Beta Member (Santa Marta Formation). By integrating this new data with previous work, we present a complete Upper Cretaceous - lowermost Paleogene chronostratigraphical framework for the basin, spanning both proximal to distal sedimentary facies of the Marambio Group.

This paper proposes choosing them optimally by using an objective function that combines a measure of parameter uncertainty, the expected information entropy, along with the cost of both sensors and actuators. The resulting optimization problem over discrete decision variables is computationally challenging, but here it is convexified by relaxing them into continuous variables, thus obtaining a significant reduction of the computational cost. The proposed approach is applied to ultrasonic guided-wave based inspection and is illustrated using two case studies with arbitrary geometries and different materials. The results demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the convex optimization in trading-off uncertainty and cost in order to provide optimal sensor configurations in complex structures. As a key contribution, the proposed methodology allows us to include the actuators with the sensors in the optimization problem while still maintaining the efficiency of the minimization process. In the application to ultrasonic guided-waves, the optimal configurations lead to set-ups where the sensors and actuators are coincident in number and position. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A rigid body network, consisting of multiple rigid bodies constrained to a spherical surface and an interconnection topology, is first formulated. In this formulation, it is shown that motion coordination on a sphere is equivalent to attitude coordination on the 3-dimensional Special Orthogonal group. Then, an angle-based control barrier function that can handle a geodesic distance constraint on a spherical surface is presented. The proposed control barrier function is then extended to a relative motion case and applied to a collision avoidance problem for a rigid body network operating on a sphere. Each rigid body chooses its control input by solving a distributed optimization problem to achieve a nominal distributed motion coordination strategy while satisfying constraints for collision avoidance. The proposed collision-free motion coordination law is validated via simulation.

The target is the smaller component of the binary asteroid 65,803 Didymos. We have conducted high-fidelity rigid full two-body simulations of the mutual dynamics of this system in a broad benchmarking exercise to find the best simulation methodologies, and to understand the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. Due to the non-spherical shapes of the components and their close proximity, the components cannot be treated as point masses and so the dynamics differ significantly from a simple Keplerian orbit, necessitating the use of numerical simulations to fully capture the system's dynamics. We find that the orbit phase (angular position or true anomaly) of the secondary is highly sensitive to the initial rotation phase of the primary, making prediction of the secondary's location from numerical simulation challenging. Finally, we show that the DART impact should induce significant free and forced librations on the secondary. If this libration can be measured by ESA's recently approved follow-up spacecraft, Hera, it may be possible to constrain properties of the secondary's interior structure.

Photometrically-corrected global infrared mosaics of Enceladus: New implications for its spectral diversity and geological activity	ICARUS			English	Article						Enceladus; Cassini; VIMS; Spectrophotometry; Image processing	SATURNS ICY SATELLITES; RESOLVED PHOTOMETRY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; WATER-ICE; H2O ICE; CASSINI; TEMPERATURE; SURFACE; SPECTROMETER; CRYSTALLINE	Between 2004 and 2017, spectral observations have been gathered by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on-board Cassini (Brown et al., 2004) during 23 Enceladus close encounters, in addition to more distant surveys. The objective of the present study is to produce a global hyperspectral mosaic of the complete VIMS data set of Enceladus in order to highlight spectral variations among the different geological units. This requires the selection of the best observations in terms of spatial resolution and illumination conditions. We have carried out a detailed investigation of the photometric behavior at several key wavelengths (1.35, 1.5, 1.65, 1.8, 2.0, 2.25, 2.55 and 3.6 mu m), characteristics of the infrared spectra of water ice. We propose a new photometric function, based on the model of Shkuratov et al. (2011). When combined, corrected mosaics at different wavelengths reveal heterogeneous areas, in particular in the terrains surrounding the Tiger Stripes on the South Pole and in the northern hemisphere around 30 degrees N, 90 degrees W. Those areas appear mainly correlated to tectonized units, indicating an endogenous origin, potentially driven by seafloor hotspots.

However, current constraints on the ocean composition need to rely largely on its expression on the surface. In this work, we combine chemical divide modeling with cryogenic Raman and X-ray diffraction experiments to examine freezing of a simple putative brine system containing Nathorn, Mg2+, Cl, and SO42 across a range of ionic concentrations and freezing rates to assess the feasibility of inferring the ocean's chemical composition via in-situ techniques. The results suggest that multiple hydrated salts not predicted by chemical models are frequently encountered in the final solid phase, making accurate quantification of the subsurface liquid composition via surface observables rather challenging. In addition, flash freezing of diluted brines often produces water ice together with vitreous Mg-bearing salt hydrates, which may significantly hinder their detection. These findings can help inform both analytical protocols for a Raman spectrometer onboard a Europa surface lander as well as potential locations for exploration, in order to best provide meaningful constraints on emplacement mechanisms and the composition of frozen salt minerals on the surface.

Batteries based on lithium carbon monofluoride (Li/CFX) provide similar to 50% higher specific energy than heritage cells (Li/SO2 or Li/SOCl2) in relevant conditions. Radiation tolerance is a major concern due to the high radiation environment surrounding Jupiter and its moons. Gamma radiation exposure may also become the sterilization (a critical step for any lander to planetary bodies where life may survive) technique of choice because the alternative thermal technique (prolonged exposure to high temperature) results in significant capacity loss for Li/CFX cells. Several D-sized Li/CFX and Li/CFX-MnO2 cells have been exposed to gamma radiation from a Co-60 source. The energy and capacity of the cells decreased by less than 2% following radiation and trends regarding the open circuit voltage and impedance spectroscopy are reported. To better understand the effects of radiation, samples of individual materials have been exposed to radiation as well as three-electrode cylindrical Li/CFX cells. These component-level tests, along with the experimental cell tests, reveal that the electrolyte/electrode interaction in a full cell is the likely cause of increased impedance and decreased energy/capacity, following exposure to ionizing radiation.

J	Yang, YC; Dorn, C				Yang, Yongchao; Dorn, Charles			Affinity propagation clustering of full-field, high-spatial-dimensional measurements for robust output-only modal identification: A proof-of-concept study	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Structural dynamics; Full-field measurement; Operational modal analysis; Clustering; Visualization; Video processing	PARAMETER-ESTIMATION	Determination of the model order is a challenging problem in system identification, especially in output-only or operational modal identification where some modes are weakly excited. Although existing methods such as the stabilization diagram method (spectral information) are effective, they do not scale to high-dimensional data, which is usually needed for high-fidelity characterization of structural dynamics and has been made available in the emerging full-field measurement techniques using optical methods such as photogrammetry and laser vibrometers. In this proof-of-concept study we present a new non-parametric, data-driven approach for robust output-only identification of high-spatial-dimensional modal parameters of basic structures by efficiently processing and interactively exploiting the full-field measurement (i.e., very dense spatial measurement points). Specifically, we first over-estimate the system model once, producing a pool of candidate modes associated with their modal frequencies and full-field, high-spatial-dimensional mode shapes. This is accomplished by a data-driven method termed affinity propagation clustering (APC), where the active clusters, which are the active modes in our formulations, emerge from the "message-passing" procedure and does not require a pre-determination of the cluster number (mode or model order). Next, rather than using the spectral information to distinguish the physical and spurious modes in the stabilization diagram method, we exploit and visualize the spatial, full-field mode shape associated with each candidate mode to do so. We conduct extensive experiments on basic structural models with comparisons to a few existing methods. The results indicate that the new method is computationally efficient for identifying high-spatial-dimensional modal parameters, and robust to identify weak modes by exploiting the full-field measurement. We also discuss its applicability and limitations for structures with complex geometry (shapes). (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Near-surface dynamics of a gas bubble collapsing above a crevice	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						bubble dynamics; cavitation	PRESSURE GENERATION; CAVITATION BUBBLES; GROWTH; FLOWS; MODEL	The impact of a collapsing gas bubble above rigid, notched walls is considered. Such surface crevices and imperfections often function as bubble nucleation sites, and thus have a direct relation to cavitation-induced erosion and damage structures. A generic configuration is investigated numerically using a second-order accurate compressible multi-component flow solver in a two-dimensional axisymmetric coordinate system. Results show that the crevice geometry has a significant effect on the collapse dynamics, jet formation, subsequent wave dynamics and interactions. The wall-pressure distribution associated with erosion potential is a direct consequence of development and intensity of these flow phenomena.

We show that the mechanical frequency of the particle oscillation is independent on the particle properties and is proportional to the free fall acceleration constant, similarly to the classical mechanical pendulum. The frequency can be used to measure the gravity field. The eddy-current induced attenuation constant does not depend on the mass of the particle and reduces with the particle volume. The quality factor of the mechanical motion can be as high as 10(9) and is comparable with the attenuation due to interaction of the particle with incompletely evacuated air. A possibility of usage of the particle as a quantum mechanical system is discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deposition of sulfate aerosols with positive Delta S-33 in the Neoarchean	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Archean; Mutliple sulfur isotopes; Atmospheric evolution	MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION; CARBONATE-ASSOCIATED SULFATE; BARBERTON GREENSTONE-BELT; MULTIPLE SULFUR ISOTOPES; TRANSVAAL SUPERGROUP; KAAPVAAL CRATON; ARCHEAN ATMOSPHERE; HYDROTHERMAL CIRCULATION; CAMPBELLRAND SUBGROUP; BUSHVELD COMPLEX	Anomalous sulfur isotope compositions present in Archean rocks have been intensely scrutinized over the last 20 years because they record key aspects of Earth's atmospheric composition prior to the appearance of free molecular oxygen ca. 2.3 billion years ago. These isotopic compositions can be described as mass anomalous fractionations (MAF) and are produced in the atmosphere as UV light interacts with SO2 molecules. Most interpretations suggest that atmospheric processes generate a reduced S-phase with a positive (S-33-enriched) MAF signature, as measured in pyrites, and an oxidized S-phase with a negative anomaly, as measured in bedded barite deposits. However, recent data for carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) - a direct proxy for the isotopic composition of sulfur from seawater sulfate - in Neoarchean rocks showed no such negative values, but rather the opposite. To understand if the positive MAF anomalies we measured in Neoarchean CAS reflect secondary processes (diagenetic, metamorphic, handling) instead of original signals of Archean seawater sulfate, we collected additional sample suites with various degrees of preservation and metamorphic alteration across the Campbellrand-Malmani platform in South Africa. Results illustrate that within this comprehensive suite, less-altered samples all contain positive MAF values while secondary processes tend to either remove CAS from the sample and/or decrease the S-33-enrichment. This positive MAF signal in sulfate is therefore reasonably interpreted as a primary depositional origin, and implies that the assumption that sulfate always carries a negative MAF anomaly throughout the Archean rock record needs to be reconsidered. Our CAS observations suggest that future experiments and calculations should also consider atmospheric and/or sulfur cycling processes that can produce oxidized sulfur with a positive MAF signature.

This paper investigates to what extent it is possible to retrieve structural parameters of two different parameterization schemes from direct transmittance derived from digital hemispherical photography and 3D radiative transfer modeling for two study sites with different vegetation canopy architectures. Neglecting the representation of 3D canopy structure in radiative transfer schemes leads to significant errors in shortwave radiation partitioning (up to 3.5 times more direct transmittance in the 3D model). Structural parameters, referred to as whole canopy 'clumping indices', were obtained in order to evaluate the impact of angular variation in clumping on shortwave radiation transfer. Impacts on photosynthesis were evaluated at site level with the UKESM land surface model, JULES. A comparison between flux tower derived and modeled photosynthesis indicates that considering zenith angular variations of structural parameters in the radiative transfer scheme of the UKESM land surface model significantly improves photosynthesis prediction in light limited ecosystems (from RMSE = 2.91 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1) to RMSE = 1.51 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1), 48% smaller), typically with enhanced photosynthesis from bottom layers.

Brachiopod delta S-34(CAS) microanalyses indicate a dynamic, climate-influenced Permo-Carboniferous sulfur cycle	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						biogeochemical cycles; sulfur isotope geochemistry; carbonate associated sulfate; brachiopods; Permo-Carboniferous	CARBONATE-ASSOCIATED SULFATE; PALEOZOIC ICE-AGE; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; PENNSYLVANIAN SHALES; ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; PYRITE SULFUR; EVOLUTION; SEAWATER; RECORDS; SR-87/SR-86	Early isotopic studies of sulfate in carbonate minerals (carbonate associated sulfate; CAS) suggested that carbonates can provide a reliable, well-dated archive of the marine sulfur cycle through time. However, subsequent research has shown that diagenetic alteration can impose highly heterogeneous CAS sulfur isotopic compositions (delta S-34(CAS)) among different carbonate phases within sediments. Such alteration necessitates targeted sampling of well-preserved, primary carbonate phases. Here, we present a new record of Carboniferous and Early Permian brachiopod delta S-34(CAS) generated from over 130 measurements of microsampled brachiopod shells. Our record refines existing brachiopod delta S-34(CAS) records and confirms a large, similar to 6.5 parts per thousand delta S-34(CAS) decrease in the Early Carboniferous. Importantly, the record also features a novel 3-5 parts per thousand increase in delta S-34(CAS) near the Serpukhovian-Bashkirian boundary (323.4 Ma) that coincides with carbonate delta C-13 and delta O-18 increases. Variability in delta S-34(CAS) is minor both within (<= 0.3 parts per thousand) and among (<= 2 parts per thousand) individual co-depositional brachiopod specimens. A taxon-specific delta(ScAs)-Sc-34 offset is present one species (Composita subtilita) that also exhibits a delta C-13 offset, supporting the existence of biological "vital effects" on delta S-34(CAS). Geologic evidence and mathematical modeling of the Permo-Carboniferous carbon and sulfur cycles suggest that changes in the burial ratio of organic carbon to pyrite sulfur (R-C:S) are insufficient to explain the observed mid-Carboniferous delta(ScAs)-Sc-34 record. We find that changes in the S-34 depletion of pyrite relative to seawater sulfate ((34)epsilon) or in the delta S-34 of the input to the ocean (delta S-34(in)) are also needed. Large additions of O-2 from organic carbon burial during the Permo-Carboniferous cannot be entirely compensated for with sulfur cycle changes; lower than modern late Visean pO(2) and/or additional O-2 sinks are needed to keep pO(2) at plausible levels. Based on the geologic context surrounding our record's mid-Carboniferous delta S-34(CAS) increase, we advocate for simultaneous changes in pyrite burial, (34)epsilon, and delta S-34(in), driven by sea level or tectonically induced changes in environments of sulfur burial, as a viable mechanism to produce rapid seawater delta S-34 changes.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						River hydrology; Radar interferometry	SATELLITE IMAGERY; WIDTH	Water surface elevation (WSE), slope and width measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will enable spaceborne estimates of global river discharge. WSE will be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). InSAR measurements are vulnerable to contamination from layover, a phenomenon wherein radar returns from multiple locations arrive at the sensor simultaneously, rendering them indistinguishable. This study assesses whether layover will significantly impact the precision of SWOT estimates of global river discharge. We present a theoretical river layover uncertainty model at the scale of nodes and reaches, which constitute nominal 200 m and 10 km averages, respectively, along river centerlines. The model is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of SWOT radar interaction with topography covering a total of 41,233 node observations, across a wide range of near-river topographic features. We find that height uncertainty increases to a maximum value at relatively low values of topographic standard deviation and varies strongly with position in the swath. When applied at global scale, the calibrated model shows that layover causes expected height uncertainty to increase by only a modest amount (from 9.4 to 10.4 cm at the 68th percentile). The 68th percentile of the slope uncertainty increases more significantly, from 10 to 17 mm/km. Nonetheless, the 68th percentile discharge uncertainty increases only marginally. We find that the impact of layover on SWOT river discharge is expected to be small in most environments.

Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage, yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach. The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts, i.e. changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color, on the LiDAR signal. The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post-fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels, as defined by the composite burn index (CBI). A new metric is proposed, the waveform area relative change (WARC), which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color. It showed a strong correlation with CBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.9 +/- 0.02), outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling, such as the relative height of energy quantiles (Spearman's Rho = 0.56 +/- 0.07, for the relative change of RH60, the second strongest correlation). Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R-2 (+/- standard deviation) and RMSE (+/- standard deviation) of 0.8 (+/- 0.05) and 0.22 (+/- 0.03), respectively. LiDAR metrics were evaluated over the King Fire, California, U.S., for which pre- and post-fire discrete return airborne LiDAR data were available. Pseudo-waveforms were computed after radiometric normalization of the intensity data. The WARC showed again the strongest correlation with field measures of GeoCBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.91), closely followed by the relative change of RH40 (Spearman's Rho = 0.89). The logarithmic model fitted using WARC offered an R-2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 0.37. The accurate results obtained for the King Fire, with very different vegetation characteristics compared to our simulated data, demonstrate the robustness of the new metric proposed and its generalization capabilities to estimate the severity of fires.

Quantifying uncertainty for remote spectroscopy of surface composition	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Imaging spectroscopy; Geologic mapping; Cuprite Nevada; Calibration visible-shortwave infrared; Atmospheric correction; Statistical methods; Hyperspectral imagers	IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS; REFLECTANCE; RETRIEVAL; PRODUCTS; WATER; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOMETRY; VEGETATION; CUPRITE	Remote surface measurements by imaging spectrometers play an important role in planetary and Earth science. To make these measurements, investigators calibrate instrument data to absolute units, invert physical models to estimate atmospheric effects, and then determine surface properties from the spectral reflectance. This study quantifies the uncertainty in this process. Global missions demand predictive uncertainty models that can estimate future errors for varied environments and observing conditions. Here we validate uncertainty predictions with remote surface composition retrievals and in situ measurements in a field analogue of Earth and planetary exploration. We consider rover transects at Cuprite, Nevada, and remote observations by NASA's NextGeneration Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). We show that accounting for input uncertainties can benefit mineral detection methods such as constrained spectrum fitting. This suggests that operational uncertainty estimates could improve future NASA missions like the Earth Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) and the Lunar Trailblazer mission, as well as NASA's Decadal Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) Investigation.

However, due to sparse ground measurements, the changes of frozen soil and the environmental controls over the vast cryosphere are still unclear, such as in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, a process-based model solely driven by satellite remote sensing data is employed to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost over the entire TP (similar to 3 million km(2)) during 2002-2016 at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Comprehensive validations against in situ observations of frozen ground types, mean annual ground temperature, active layer thickness, soil temperature, and frozen depth at 608 boreholes and 109 meteorological stations demonstrate an overall satisfactory performance of the model in reproducing the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the frozen soil in the region. Spatially, land surface temperature (LST; both in-season and off-season) primarily controls the frozen ground types and frozen depth, with seasonally frozen ground and permafrost covering similar to 56% and similar to 37% of the plateau, respectively. The estimated spatial-averaged annual maximum soil freeze depth (SFD) is similar to 1.29 m, and the annual maximum active layer thickness (ALT) of permafrost is similar to 1.85 m. Temporally, ALT shows an overall increasing trend at an average rate of +3.17 cm yr(-1), while SFD exhibits both decreasing (at similar to 62% areas) and increasing (at similar to 38% areas) trends in the region. Again, LST is found to be the dominant factor that controls the temporal changes in both SFD and ALT while precipitation (i.e., both rainfall and snowfall) plays an important (especially in more arid areas and regions near the lower limit of permafrost) but secondary role. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the satellite-based method in frozen soil simulations over large scales with complex topography and landscape and highlight the important roles of both temperature and precipitation in shaping the frozen soil patterns on the TP or other cold, dry regions.

The spectra were measured on four occasions during a four-month period in 2018, in order to search for variability of the 3-mu m emissions of CH4 and C2H6. The observed locations of the brightest spots of the C2H6 and CH4 emissions at 65 degrees N differed in longitude typically by 20 degrees during this period. The peak emission intensities of these species showed large variations, with the highest intensities 3-4 times greater than the lowest intensities. In addition, the brightest 3-mu m CH4 emissions and hottest temperatures at the 8CNPHS were significantly less than those at the 3-mu m CH4 north polar hot spot (3CNPHS, Kim et al., 2015). Recently, Sinclair et al. (2019) reported a coincidence between solar wind dynamical pressure and the 8-mu m brightening of the 8CNPHS. In contrast, we find lack of correlation in our data between the 3-mu m hydrocarbon emission intensities at the 8CNPHS and the solar wind strength. We also find lack of correlation between H3+ intensities and the solar wind strength during the period. However, due to the limited observational data, it is too early to conclude whether this lack of correlation indicates that the solar wind activity induced no significant changes in local temperatures (<40 K) and/or mixing ratios of these molecules. Our observing period was close to the historic grand solar minimum. The detailed influence of the solar activity on the 3 and 8 mu m brightness at the 8CNPHS is not quantitatively understood at the present time.

Radar observations and a physical model of binary near-Earth asteroid 65803 Didymos, target of the DART mission	ICARUS			English	Article						Satellites of asteroids; Radar observations; Near-Earth objects; Asteroids	FAILURE; IMPACT	Near-Earth asteroid Didymos is a binary system and the target of the proposed Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission (Chong et al., 201e), which is a planetary defense experiment. The DART spacecraft will impact the satellite, causing changes in the binary orbit that will be measured by Earth-based observers. We observed Didymos using the planetary radars at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) in November 2003. Delay-Doppler radar imaging of the binary system provided range resolutions of up to 15 m/ pixel that placed hundreds of pixels on the primary. We used the radar data to estimate a 3D shape model and spin state for the primary, the secondary size and spin, the mutual orbit parameters, and the radar scattering properties of the binary system. We included lightcurves obtained by Pravec et al. (200e) in the shape model estimation. The primary is top-shaped with an equatorial bulge, a conspicuous facet along the equator, and a volume-equivalent diameter of 780 +/- 30 m. The extents along the three principal axes are 832 m, 838 m, and 786 m, (uncertainties are 6% along the x and y axes, and 10% along the z axis). The radar data do not provide complete rotational coverage of the secondary but show visible extents of about 75 m, implying a diameter of 150 +/- 30 m. The bandwidth of the secondary in the images suggests a spin period of 12.4 +/- 3.0 h that is consistent with rotation that is synchronized with the mutual orbit period of 11.9 h. We fit a mutual orbit to the system using the delay and Doppler separations between the binary components and obtain a semimajor axis of 1190 +/- 30 m, an eccentricity of <0.05, and an orbital period of 11.93 +/- 0.01 h that are consistent with those obtained by Sc heitit h and Prase (2009) and kg and Margot (2012). The mutual orbit implies a system mass of (5.4 + 0.4) x 10(11) kg and a system bulk density of 2170 +/- 350 kg m(-3). The system has S- and X-band radar albedos of 0.20 +/- 0.05 and 0.30 +/- 0.08 respectively, and an optical albedo of 0.15 +/- 0.04.	[Naidu, S. P.; Benner, L. A. M.; Brozovic, M.; Ostro, S.

In a task involving audio-visual conflict, using magnetoencephalography recordings in humans, we first demonstrated that the neuronal dominance - auditory cortex functionally influencing visual cortex - was associated with the sensory dominance - sound qualitatively altering visual perception. Further, we found that prestimulus auditory-to-visual connectivity could predict the perceptual outcome on a trial-by-trial basis. Subsequently, we performed an effective connectivity-guided neurofeedback electroencephalography experiment and showed that participants who were briefly trained to increase the neuronal dominance from auditory to visual cortex showed higher sensory, that is auditory, dominance during the conflict task immediately after the training. These results shed new light into the interactive neuronal nature of multisensory integration and open up exciting opportunities by enhancing or suppressing targeted mental functions subserved by effective connectivity.

J	Bernardi, M				Bernardi, Marco			Physical origin of the one-quarter exact exchange in density functional theory	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						density functional theory; exchange interaction; hybrid functionals; spin singlet and triplet	THERMOCHEMISTRY	Exchange interactions are a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and play a key role in predicting the properties of materials from first principles. In density functional theory (DFT), a widely used approximation to the exchange energy combines fractions of density-based and Hartree-Fock (exact) exchange. This so-called hybrid DFT scheme is accurate in many materials, for reasons that are not fully understood. Here we show that a 1/4 fraction of exact exchange plus a 3/4 fraction of density-based exchange is compatible with a correct quantum mechanical treatment of the exchange energy of an electron pair in the unpolarized electron gas. We also show that the 1/4 exact-exchange fraction mimics a correlation interaction between doubly-excited electronic configurations. The relation between our results and trends observed in hybrid DFT calculations is discussed, along with other implications.

Challenges with manufacturing the material from the melt has previously limited the processing of Al 7075 via welding, casting, and additive manufacturing. Recent research has shown the capabilities of nanoparticle additives to control the solidification behavior of high-strength aluminum alloys, showcasing the first Al 7075 components processed via casting, welding, and AM. In this work, the properties of nanoparticle-enhanced aluminum 7075 are investigated on welded parts, overlays and through wire-based additive manufacturing. The hardness and tensile strength of the deposited materials were measured in the as-welded and T73 heat-treated conditions showing that the properties of Al 7075 T73 can be recovered in welded and layer-deposited parts. The work shows that Al 7075 now has the potential to be conventionally welded or additively manufactured from wire into high-strength, crack-free parts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

New methods to assess and improve LIGO detector duty cycle	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY			English	Article						advanced LIGO; gravitational wave detectors; machine learning		A network of three or more gravitational wave detectors simultaneously taking data is required to generate a well-localized sky map for gravitational wave sources, such as GW170817. Local seismic disturbances often cause the LIGO and Virgo detectors to lose light resonance in one or more of their component optic cavities, and the affected detector is unable to take data until resonance is recovered. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to gain insight into the predictive behavior of the LIGO detector optic cavities during the second LIGO-Virgo observing run. We identify a minimal set of optic cavity control signals and data features which capture interferometer behavior leading to a loss of light resonance, orlockloss. We use these channels to accurately distinguish between lockloss events and quiet interferometer operating times via both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. This analysis yields new insights into how components of the LIGO detectors contribute to lockloss events, which could inform detector commissioning efforts to mitigate the associated loss of uptime. Particularly, we find that the state of the component optical cavities is a better predictor of loss of lock than ground motion trends. We report prediction accuracies of 98% for times just prior to lock loss, and 90% for times up to 30 s prior to lockloss, which shows promise for this method to be applied in near-real time to trigger preventative detector state changes. This method can be extended to target other auxiliary subsystems or times of interest, such as transient noise or loss in detector sensitivity. Application of these techniques during the third LIGO-Virgo observing run and beyond would maximize the potential of the global detector network for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves.

HD 191939: Three Sub-Neptunes Transiting a Sun-like Star Only 54 pc Away	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SUPER-EARTHS; PLANETS; MASSES; RADII; ISOCHRONES; PARAMETERS; SOLAR	We present the discovery of three sub-Neptune-sized planets transiting the nearby and bright Sun-like star HD 191939 (TIC 269701147, TOI 1339), a K-s = 7.18 mag G8 V dwarf at a distance of only 54 pc. We validate the planetary nature of the transit signals by combining 5 months of data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite with follow-up ground-based photometry, archival optical images, radial velocities, and high angular resolution observations. The three sub-Neptunes have similar radii (R-b = 3.42(-0.11)(+0.11), R-c = 3.23(-0.11)(+0.11), and R-d = 3.16(-0.11)(+0.11) R-circle plus), and their orbits are consistent with a stable, circular, and coplanar architecture near mean-motion resonances of 1:3 and 3:4 (P-b = 8.88, P-c = 28.58, and P-d = 38.35 days). The HD 191939 system is an excellent candidate for precise mass determinations of the planets with high-resolution spectroscopy due to the host star's brightness and low chromospheric activity. Moreover, the system's compact and near-resonant nature can provide an independent way to measure planetary masses via transit timing variations while also enabling dynamical and evolutionary studies. Finally, as a promising target for multiwavelength transmission spectroscopy of all three planets' atmospheres, HD 191939 can offer valuable insight into multiple sub-Neptunes born from a protoplanetary disk that may have resembled that of the early Sun.

We performed ground-based follow-up observations-comprised of Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope transit photometry, NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging, and FIbre-fed Echelle Spectrograph, CORALIE, High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher, High Resolution echelle Spectrometer, and Planet Finder Spectrograph high-precision Doppler measurements-and confirmed the planetary nature of the 16 day transiting candidate announced by the TESS team. We discovered an additional radial velocity signal with a period of five days induced by the presence of a second planet in the system, which we also found to transit its host star. We found that the inner mini-Neptune, TOI-421 b, has an orbital period of P-b = 5.19672 +/- 0.00049 days, a mass of M-b = 7.17 +/- 0.66 M-circle plus, and a radius of R-b = R-circle plus, whereas the outer warm Neptune, TOI-421 c, has a period of P-c = 16.06819 +/- 0.00035 days, a mass of M-c = 16.42(-1.04)(+1.06)M(circle plus), a radius of R-c = 5.09(-0.15)(+0.16)R(circle plus), and a density of rho(c) = 0.685(-0.072)(+0.080) cm(-3). With its characteristics, the outer planet (rho(c) = 0.685(-0.0072)(+0.080) cm(-3)) is placed in the intriguing class of the super-puffy mini-Neptunes. TOI-421 b and TOI-421 c are found to be well-suited for atmospheric characterization. Our atmospheric simulations predict significant Ly alpha transit absorption, due to strong hydrogen escape in both planets, as well as the presence of detectable CH4 in the atmosphere of TOI-421 c if equilibrium chemistry is assumed.

A High Angular Resolution Survey of Massive Stars in Cygnus OB2: JHK Adaptive Optics Results from the Gemini Near-Infrared Imager	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Massive stars; Early-type stars; Wide binary stars; OB associations; OB stars	PHOTOMETRY; MULTIPLICITY; BINARIES; FRAGMENTATION; EVOLUTION; CATALOG; DESIGN; SYSTEM	We present results of a high angular resolution survey of massive OB stars in the Cygnus OB2 association that we conducted with the Near-Infrared Imager camera and ALTAIR adaptive optics system of the Gemini North telescope. We observed 74 O- and early-B-type stars in Cyg OB2 in the JHK infrared bands in order to detect binary and multiple companions. The observations are sensitive to equal-brightness pairs at separations as small as 0 ''.08, and progressively fainter companions are detectable out to Delta K = 9 mag at a separation of 2 ''. This faint contrast limit due to read noise continues out to 10 '' near the edge of the detector. We assigned a simple probability of chance alignment to each companion based upon its separation and magnitude difference from the central target star and upon areal star counts for the general star field of Cyg.OB2. Companion stars with a field membership probability of less than 1% are assumed to be physical companions. This assessment indicates that 47% of the targets have at least one resolved companion that is probably gravitationally bound. Including known spectroscopic binaries, our sample includes 27 binary, 12 triple, and 9 systems with 4 or more components. These results confirm studies of high-mass stars in other environments that find that massive stars are born with a high-multiplicity fraction. The results are important for the placement of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the interpretation of their spectroscopic analyses, and for future mass determinations through measurement of orbital motion.

Validation of the TOI-700 System	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet systems; Transit photometry; Low mass stars; M dwarf stars; Astronomy data analysis	M-DWARF STARS; EJECTION CME ACTIVITY; STELLAR X-RAY; MASS M-STARS; TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANETS; SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD; HOST-STARS; M4 DWARF; ORBIT; EFFICIENT	We present the discovery and validation of a three-planet system orbiting the nearby (31.1 pc) M2 dwarf star TOI-700 (TIC 150428135).TOI-700lies in the TESS continuous viewing zone in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere; observations spanning 11 sectors reveal three planets with radii ranging from 1 R(circle plus)to 2.6 R(circle plus)and orbital periods ranging from 9.98 to 37.43 days. Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enables us to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the system of planets. The outermost planet, TOI-700 d, has a radius of 1.19 0.11R(circle plus)and resides within a conservative estimate of the host star's habitable zone, where it receives a flux from its star that is approximately 86% of Earth's insolation. In contrast to some other low-mass stars that host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, TOI-700 exhibits low levels of stellar activity, presenting a valuable opportunity to study potentially rocky planets over a wide range of conditions affecting atmospheric escape. While atmospheric characterization of TOI-700 d with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be challenging, the larger sub-Neptune, TOI-700 c (R = 2.63R(circle plus)), will be an excellent target for JWST and future space-based observatories. TESS is scheduled to once again observe the Southern Hemisphere, and it will monitor TOI-700 for an additional 11 sectors in its extended mission. These observations should allow further constraints on the known planet parameters and searches for additional planets and transit timing variations in the system.

II. Spitzer Confirms TOI-700 d	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanets; Habitable planets; Habitable zone; Low mass stars; Antarctic observatories; Exoplanet astronomy; Exoplanet detection methods; Exoplanet systems	LIGHT-CURVE PROJECT	We present Spitzer 4.5 mu m observations of the transit of TOI-700 d, a habitable-zone Earth-sized planet in a multiplanet system transiting a nearby M-dwarf star (TIC 150428135, 2MASS J06282325-6534456). TOI-700 d has a radius of -+1.144(-0.061)(0.062)R(circle plus) and orbits within its host star's conservative habitable zone with a period of 37.42 days (T-eq similar to 269 K). TOI-700 also hosts two small inner planets (R-b= 1.037(-0.064)(+0.065)R(circle plus) and R-c = 2.65(-0.15)(+0.16) R-circle plus) with periods of 9.98 and 16.05 days, respectively. Our Spitzer observations confirm the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detection of TOI-700 d and remove any remaining doubt that it is a genuine planet. We analyze the Spitzer light curve combined with the 11 sectors of TESS observations and a transit of TOI-700 c from the LCOGT network to determine the full system parameters. Although studying the atmosphere of TOI-700 d is not likely feasible with upcoming facilities, it may be possible to measure the mass of TOI-700 d using state-of-the-art radial velocity (RV) instruments (expected RV semiamplitude of similar to 70 cm s(-1)).

Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope Observations of 2012 Solar Eclipse: A Multi-wavelength Study of cm-lambda Gyroresonance Emission from Active Regions	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						Solar eclipses; Radio astronomy; Solar observatories	SLOWLY CHANGING COMPONENT; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; VLA OBSERVATIONS; DENSITY; MODEL; MAPS	Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) is a science education partnership among NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Lewis Center for Educational Research, offering unique opportunities for K-12 students and their teachers. The GAVRT program operates a 34 m radio telescope with a wide-band, low noise receiver, which is tunable in four independent dual-polarization bands from 3 to 14 GHz. The annular eclipse of the Sun on 2012 May 20 was observed by GAVRT as part of education outreach. In this paper we present the results of this eclipse data and discuss the multi-wavelength strip scan brightness distribution across three active regions. We derive the source brightness temperatures and angular sizes as a function of frequency and interpret the results in terms of the gyroresonance mechanism. We show examples of the increasing brightness and widening of source size (isogauss surface) with wavelength as evidence for gyroresonance emission layers of broader (diverging) isogauss surfaces of the magnetic field geometry in the corona above solar surface. We present an example how the derived frequency-brightness temperature relationship is translated to a magnetic field-brightness temperature relationship under the frame-work of gyroresonance emission. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of GAVRT bands as excellent probes to study the layers of the corona above the active regions (Sun spots), in particular the prevalence of the gyroresonance mechanism. Our results provide a frame-work for multiwavelength cm-lambda eclipse observations and illustrate how the GAVRT program and K-12 student/teacher participation can produce science data useful to the scientific community and science missions.

We report here that doping NiCoOOH nanosheets with 8% Ir leads to a low overpotential of only 260 mV for 50 mA/cm(2), far better than previous OER catalysts. We synthesized this catalyst using a novel photochemical deposition method that leads to a uniform distribution of dopant, large catalytic active area, high interfacial charge transfer efficiency, good adhesion between catalyst and matrix, and long lifetime. Moreover, these nanosheets show significant stable performance for 70 h in alkaline media. Our density functional theory calculations show that Ir and Co both play essential bifunctional roles in stabilizing the key O radical intermediate on Ir and promoting the O-O bond coupling on Co, which are optimum for the 8% Ir.

Guidelines for designing the antithetic feedback motif	PHYSICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						control theory; antithetic feedback; synthetic biology; integral feedback; biological feedback control	ROBUST PERFECT ADAPTATION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY; GENE-EXPRESSION; GLOBAL ANALYSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; HOMEOSTASIS; BINDING; CONTEXT; LIMITS	Integral feedback control is commonly used in mechanical and electrical systems to achieve zero steady-state error following an external disturbance. Equivalently, in biological systems, a property known as robust perfect adaptation guarantees robustness to environmental perturbations and return to the pre-disturbance state. Previously, Briatet alproposed a biomolecular design for integral feedback control (robust perfect adaptation) called the antithetic feedback motif. The antithetic feedback controller uses the sequestration binding reaction of two biochemical species to record the integral of the error between the current and the desired output of the network it controls. The antithetic feedback motif has been successfully built using synthetic componentsin vivoinEscherichia coliandSaccharomyces cerevisiaecells. However, these previous synthetic implementations of antithetic feedback have not produced perfect integral feedback control due to the degradation and dilution of the two controller species. Furthermore, previous theoretical results have cautioned that integral control can only be achieved under stability conditions that not all antithetic feedback motifs necessarily fulfill. In this paper, we study how to design antithetic feedback motifs that simultaneously achieve good stability and small steady-state error properties, even as the controller species are degraded and diluted. We provide simple tuning guidelines to achieve flexible and practical synthetic biological implementations of antithetic feedback control. We use several tools and metrics from control theory to design antithetic feedback networks, paving the path for the systematic design of synthetic biological controllers.

Several models involving one or more fixed plumes beneath the northeastward migrating African plate have been suggested to explain the space-time distribution of magmatism in east Africa. We devise paleogeographically constrained global models of mantle convection and, based on the evolution of flow in the deepest lower mantle, show that the Afar plume migrated southward throughout its lifetime. The models suggest that the mobile Afar plume provides a dynamically consistent explanation for the spatial extent of the southward propagation of the east African rift system (EARS), which is difficult to explain by the northeastward migration of Africa over one or more fixed plumes alone, over the last approximate to 45 Myr. We further show that the age-progression of volcanism associated with the southward propagation of EARS is consistent with the apparent surface hotspot motion that results from southward motion of the modelled Afar plume beneath the northeastward migrating African plate. The models suggest that the Afar plume became weaker as it migrated southwards, consistent with trends observed in the geochemical record.

The main systematic in IRAC light-curve data is position changes due to unavoidable telescope motions coupled with an intrapixel response function. We aim to use the large amount of publicly available calibration data for the single pixel used for this type of work (the sweet-spot pixel) to make a fast, easy-to-use, accurate correction to science data. This correction on calibration data has the advantage of using an independent data set instead of the science data themselves, which has the disadvantage of including astrophysical variations. After focusing on feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization, we show that a boosted random forest model can reduce the data such that we measure the median of 10 archival eclipse observations of XO-3b to be 1459 200 ppm. This is a comparable depth to the average of those in the literature done by seven different methods; however, the spread in measurements is 30%-100% larger than those literature values, depending on the reduction method. We also caution others attempting similar methods to check their results with the fiducial data set of XO-3b, as we were also able to find models providing initially great scores on their internal test data sets but whose results significantly underestimated the eclipse depth of that planet.

In recent years, scientific assessments have shown a rapid decline in spawning stock biomass around the UK attributed to poor recruitment (driven by environmental factors) and high fishing mortality. This resulted in significant reductions in the harvest of sea bass following technical measures implemented by the European Commission to conserve stocks. Individual-based models (IBMs) are simulations of individual 'agents' of organisms that interact with each other and their environment locally and have been shown to be effective management tools in many systems. Here, an IBM that simulates the population dynamics and spatial distribution of sea bass was developed to assess how technical management measures applied to subsets of the population impact the overall stock. Conventional stock assessment techniques were used to model the processes affecting population dynamics, while the spatial distribution was simulated using a combination of temperature preferences and information from tagging studies. The IBM was parameterised using existing knowledge from the literature and can mimic key assessment outputs used to inform management and advice on fishing opportunities. Utility of the IBM is demonstrated by simulating the population consequences of several key management scenarios based on those implemented by the European Commission, including short-term bans on pelagic trawling in spawning areas, commercial and recreational catch limits and increasing the minimum conservation reference size. The IBM has potential to complement the annual stock assessment in managing European sea bass because it models individual movement, environmental drivers and emergent spatial distribution, thereby providing enhanced predictions of management strategy outcomes that could inform spatial advice on fishing opportunities and policy.

The ligand demonstrates variable binding modes, adapting to the electronic and geometric requirements of the metal center. In Mo-0 and Mo-II polycarbonyl complexes, coordination through the sigma-donating pyridine nitrogen lone pair is observed. Upon oxidative group transfer with anionic azide, a Mo-IV nitride compound is formed, accompanied by a change in the ancillary ligand binding mode to the pyridine pi-system. The sigma-coordination was restored by subsequent functionalization of the nitride moiety with either silyl electrophiles or protons. Protonation results in redox disproportionation with concomitant nitride functionalization. Characterization by single crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopy is discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brooke			"We're being tracked at all times": Student perspectives of their privacy in relation to learning analytics in higher education	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PRINCIPLES; ETHICS	Higher education institutions are continuing to develop their capacity for learning analytics (LA), which is a sociotechnical data-mining and analytic practice. Institutions rarely inform their students about LA practices, and there exist significant privacy concerns. Without a clear student voice in the design of LA, institutions put themselves in an ethical gray area. To help fill this gap in practice and add to the growing literature on students' privacy perspectives, this study reports findings from over 100 interviews with undergraduate students at eight U.S. higher education institutions. Findings demonstrate that students lacked awareness of educational data-mining and analytic practices, as well as the data on which they rely. Students see potential in LA, but they presented nuanced arguments about when and with whom data should be shared; they also expressed why informed consent was valuable and necessary. The study uncovered perspectives on institutional trust that were heretofore unknown, as well as what actions might violate that trust. Institutions must balance their desire to implement LA with their obligation to educate students about their analytic practices and treat them as partners in the design of analytic strategies reliant on student data in order to protect their intellectual privacy.

These observations triggered the present study that aims to determine the conditions under which the high-pressure (HP) ice layer, likely present between the deep ocean and the silicate core, poses a barrier for the exchange of volatiles. We model heat and water transport through this convecting HP ice layer using a two-phase numerical model of solid ice-liquid water mixture. We observe that for a large range of heat fluxes from the silicate core and HP ice layer thicknesses, a few percent of liquid water forms at the interface with the silicates. Liquid water being less dense than the HP ice, it creates additional buoyancy, thus facilitating the transport of volatiles towards the ocean. Our results also show that convection is characterized by the presence of hot and the absence of cold plumes. We derive a scaling law that describes the dependence of a critical heat flux for the onset of melting at the silicates interface on the thickness of the HP ice layer and the ice viscosity. We also study the processes at the interface with the base of the ocean where a few tens of kilometers thick layer of temperate (partially molten) ice is present. We find a scaling law for its thickness that depends mainly on the ice viscosity and the density difference between the ice and water. Water from this partially molten, temperate layer flows into the ocean thus completing the connection with the silicate core. The water flux depends primarily on the amount of heat supplied from the silicates.

Both optimization and Bayesian approaches are considered, based around a regularizing quadratic form found from an affine transformation of the Laplacian, raised to a possibly fractional, exponent. Conditions on the parameters defining this quadratic form are identified under which well-defined limiting continuum analogues of the optimization and Bayesian semi-supervised learning problems may be found, thereby shedding light on the design of algorithms in the large graph setting. The large graph limits of the optimization formulations are tackled through G-convergence, using the recently introduced TLp metric. The small labeling noise limits of the Bayesian formulations are also identified, and contrasted with pre-existing harmonic function approaches to the problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Echo of ring current storms in the ionosphere	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Ring current; Dst; V sigma index; Ionosphere; Plasmasphere; Total electron content; Storm	TIME; TEC; DST; PARAMETERS; INTENSITY; GRADIENTS; DENSITY; WEATHER; MODEL; MAPS	The ionospheric weather V sigma index maps are generated from GIM-TEC produced at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with the denser grids of 1 x 1 degrees in latitude and longitude, respectively. Using sliding-window statistical analysis, moving TEC median mu for 15 preceding days with estimated variance bounds is obtained for each grid pixel of GIM-TEC. The ionosphere variability index, V sigma, is Delta TEC deviation from the median normalized by the standard deviation sigma. V sigma index segmentation is introduced specifying TEC storm if an instant TEC is outside the bound of mu +/- 2 sigma. Comparisons of V sigma variability of 1 x 1 degrees GIM-TEC maps with normal GIM-TECs of 2.5. 5. in latitude and longitude demonstrates the greater TEC storm activity with denser grids maps. The superposed epoch analysis is performed for 77 intense storms (Dst <= -100 nT) and 246 moderate storms (-100 < Dst <= -50 nT) during 2000-2017, with zero time, t(0), at Dst storm peak. The probabilities of TEC storm occurrence both positive (V sigma p index) and negative (V sigma n) are evaluated for 24 h prior to t(0) and 48 h after t(0) for global scale and three specified latitude zones: North High (NH) magnetic latitudes lambda > 50 degrees, South High (SH). < 50., and Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) Band between.35. magnetic latitudes. The equinoctial positive V sigma p index shows the maxima on March and September, Dst intensity peaks on April and October, and the negative V sigma n peaks on May and November. The amplitude of V sigma p for the intense storms exceeds that for the moderate storm by 2 times and exceeds the amplitude of V sigma n by 1.5 times. Storm Enhanced Density (SED) is evident with the largest amplitude of V sigma p at EIA Band exceeding V sigma p for NH and SH zones by 3 times. The negative V sigma n occurrence observed for selected zones during the intense storms is decreased by 5 times for the moderate storms. The normalized cross-correlation function is used to define lag (time delay) between peak of V sigma p and V sigma n and t(0) of Dst peak. The majority of positive V sigma p indices (57.5%) are observed prior to Dst storm (lag varies from 1 to 6 h with Dst from 50 to 400 nT) so the TEC enhancement can serve as a precursor of Dst storm. The time delay for the negative V sigma n is inversely related with Dst storm intensity (lag varies from 11 to 8 h with Dst from -50 to -400 nT).

There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture definition, reference implementation, and deployment. This provides the basis for further innovation of smart network services to accelerate scientific discovery in the era of big data, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Dynamic compressive behaviour of sandwich panels with lattice truss core filled by shear thickening fluid	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING			English	Article						Dynamic compressive behaviour; Sandwich panels with lattice truss core; Shear thickening fluid; Hydrodynamic constitutive model; Analytical model; Fluid-structure interaction	ONE-DIMENSIONAL RESPONSE; PLATES; DEFORMATION; SUSPENSIONS; MODEL	The compressive behaviour of sandwich panels with lattice truss core filled by shear thickening fluid (SPLTCSTF) at high strain-rates is performed analytically and numerically. Firstly, a hydrodynamic constitutive model for the shear thickening fluid (STF) involving shear thinning, shear thickening, and hydrostatic compressibility is undertaken to describe the dynamic behaviour of the STF. Then an analytical model based on the squeezing flow of viscous fluids is proposed. The squeezing resistance of the STF between the two panels of the SPLTC under various loading velocities is analysed using a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation, by which the constitutive parameters of the STF are obtained. Finally, the dynamic response of the SPLTC-STF involving buckling and post-buckling of core struts in the STF is investigated using the FSI method. The enhanced energy absorption capacity of the SPLTC-STF observed in Ref [1] is numerically interpreted. The effects of shear thickening behaviour of STF on the dynamic response of SPLTC-STF are predicted, providing a method of optimal design for STF filled sandwich panels over a wide range of impulse loadings for dynamic energy absorption.

Data bandwidth is very limited between planetary rovers and ground-based data system. What's worse, even though NASA has accumulated over 34 million images from various missions, it requires significant effort and is hardly possible for any scientist to go through all of them. In order to improve the degree of automation and the efficiency of these processes, we propose a system leveraging machine learning for planetary rovers to actively look for scientifically interesting and valuable features according to text instructions from scientists and prioritize the images captured onboard with those features for downlink. Such an image prioritization mechanism can also be naturally applied to content-based image search through text description in any local planetary image data server, allowing scientists to search for images with desired features without going through them one by one. Besides theoretical and engineering details of our proposed approach, we also present both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the system along with some concrete examples.

The incident electron energies range from near-threshold of 6.3 eV to 20 eV. Experimental scattering angles range from 20 degrees to 120 degrees. The normalization of the experimental cross sections is made to available experimental elastic scattering data (Gibsonet al1996J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys.293197). TheR-matrix calculations use three distinct close-coupling models and their results are compared to available experimental and theoretical cross sections. The overall comparison leads to significantly improved description of the excitation cross sections for this target.

Self-sustained elastoinertial Tollmien-Schlichting waves	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						drag reduction; turbulent transition	EXACT COHERENT STRUCTURES; NONLINEAR TRAVELING-WAVES; MAXIMUM DRAG REDUCTION; PIPE-FLOW; CHANNEL FLOW; TRANSITION; TURBULENCE; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; STATES	Direct simulations of two-dimensional plane channel flow of a viscoelastic fluid at Reynolds number reveal the existence of a family of attractors whose structure closely resembles the linear Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) mode, and in particular exhibits strongly localized stress fluctuations at the critical layer position of the TS mode. At the parameter values chosen, this solution branch is not connected to the nonlinear TS solution branch found for Newtonian flow, and thus represents a solution family that is nonlinearly self-sustained by viscoelasticity. The ratio between stress and velocity fluctuations is in quantitative agreement for the attractor and the linear TS mode, and increases strongly with Weissenberg number, . For the latter, there is a transition in the scaling of this ratio as increases, and the at which the nonlinear solution family comes into existence is just above this transition. Finally, evidence indicates that this branch is connected through an unstable solution branch to two-dimensional elastoinertial turbulence (EIT). These results suggest that, in the parameter range considered here, the bypass transition leading to EIT is mediated by nonlinear amplification and self-sustenance of perturbations that excite the TS mode.

Pushing and Pulling on Ropes: Hierarchical Woven Materials	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						architected materials; extensible materials; resilient materials; tensile responses; woven lattices	MECHANICAL RESILIENCE; STRUCTURAL HIERARCHY; ENERGY-ABSORPTION; METAMATERIALS; LATTICES; ELECTROLESS; LIGHTWEIGHT; TOUGHNESS; STIFFNESS	Hierarchy in natural and synthetic materials has been shown to grant these architected materials properties unattainable independently by their constituent materials. While exceptional mechanical properties such as extreme resilience and high deformability have been realized in many human-made three-dimensional (3D) architected materials using beam-and-junction-based architectures, stress concentrations and constraints induced by the junctions limit their mechanical performance. A new hierarchical architecture in which fibers are interwoven to construct effective beams is presented. In situ tension and compression experiments of additively manufactured woven and monolithic lattices with 30 mu m unit cells demonstrate the superior ability of woven architectures to achieve high tensile and compressive strains (>50%)-without failure events-via smooth reconfiguration of woven microfibers in the effective beams and junctions. Cyclic compression experiments reveal that woven lattices accrue less damage compared to lattices with monolithic beams. Numerical studies of woven beams with varying geometric parameters present new design spaces to develop architected materials with tailored compliance that is unachievable by similarly configured monolithic-beam architectures. Woven hierarchical design offers a pathway to make traditionally stiff and brittle materials more deformable and introduces a new building block for 3D architected materials with complex nonlinear mechanics.

J	Mark, DK; Motrunich, OI				Mark, Daniel K.; Motrunich, Olexei, I			eta-pairing states as true scars in an extended Hubbard model	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							LONG-RANGE ORDER; NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; GROUND-STATE; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; SYSTEM; CHAIN	The eta-pairing states are a set of exactly known eigenstates of the Hubbard model on hypercubic lattices, first discovered by Yang [C. N. Yang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 2144 (1989)]. These states are not many-body scar states in the Hubbard model because they occupy unique symmetry sectors defined by the so-called n-pairing SU(2) symmetry. We study an extended Hubbard model with bond-charge interactions, popularized by Hirsch [J. E. Hirsch, Physica C 158, 326 (1989)], where the eta-pairing states survive without the eta-pairing symmetry and become true scar states. We also discuss similarities between the eta-pairing states and exact scar towers in the spin-1 XY model found by Schecter and Iadecola [M. Schecter and T. Iadecola, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 147201 (2019)], and systematically arrive at all nearest-neighbor terms that preserve such scar towers in one dimension. We also generalize these terms to arbitrary bipartite lattices. Our study of the spin-1 XY model also leads us to several scarred models, including a spin-1/2 J(1) - J(2) model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, in realistic quantum magnet settings in one and two dimensions.

LIGO Sci Collaboration; Virgo Collaboration	GW190412: Observation of a binary-black-hole coalescence with asymmetric masses	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							GRAVITATIONAL WAVE-FORMS; COMPACT BINARIES; AGN DISCS; STAR-CLUSTERS; EVOLUTION; MERGERS; PROGENITORS; PREDICTIONS; PERTURBATIONS; METALLICITY	We report the observation of gravitational waves from a binary-black-hole coalescence during the first two weeks of LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run. The signal was recorded on April 12, 2019 at 05:30:44 UTC with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 19. The binary is different from observations during the first two observing runs most notably due to its asymmetric masses: a similar to 30 M-circle dot black hole merged with a similar to 8 M-circle dot black hole companion. The more massive black hole rotated with a dimensionless spin magnitude between 0.22 and 0.60 (90% probability). Asymmetric systems are predicted to emit gravitational waves with stronger contributions from higher multipoles, and indeed we find strong evidence for gravitational radiation beyond the leading quadrupolar order in the observed signal. A suite of tests performed on GW190412 indicates consistency with Einstein's general theory of relativity. While the mass ratio of this system differs from all previous detections, we show that it is consistent with the population model of stellar binary black holes inferred from the first two observing runs.

Anharmonic Origin of the Giant Thermal Expansion of NaBr	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; ALKALI-HALIDES; SODIUM; NACL	All phonons in a single crystal of NaBr are measured by inelastic neutron scattering at temperatures of 10, 300, and 700 K. Even at 300 K, the phonons, especially the longitudinal-optical phonons, show large shifts in frequencies and show large broadenings in energy owing to anharmonicity. Ab initio computations are fast performed with the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) in which the phonon frequencies depend only on V and on T only insofar as it alters V by thermal expansion. This QHA is an unqualified failure for predicting the temperature dependence of phonon frequencies, even 300 K, and the thermal expansion is in error by a factor of 4. Ab initio computations that include both anharmonicity and quasiharmonicity successfully predict both the temperature dependence of phonons and the large thermal expansion of NaBr. The frequencies of longitudinal-optical phonon modes decrease significantly with temperature owing to the real part of the phonon self-energy from explicit anharmonicity originating from the cubic anharmonicity of nearest-neighbor NaBr bonds.

Entangled light-matter interactions and spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; BIPHOTON SPECTROSCOPY; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; X-RAY; QUANTUM; POLARIZATION; INTERFERENCE; FLUORESCENCE; ABSORPTION; PHOTONS	Entangled photons exhibit non-classical light-matter interactions that create new opportunities in materials and molecular science. Notably, in entangled two-photon absorption, the intensity-dependence scales linearly as if only one photon was present. The entangled two-photon absorption cross section approaches but does not match the one-photon absorption cross section. The entangled two-photon cross section also does not follow classical two-photon molecular design motifs. Questions such as these seed the rich but nascent field of entangled light-matter interactions. In this perspective, we use the experimental developments in entangled photon spectroscopy to outline the current status of the field. Now that the fundamental tools are outlined, it is time to start the exploration of how materials, molecules, and devices can control or utilize interactions with entangled photons.

A study with an ensemble density functional theory method	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							IONIZATION-POTENTIALS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; KOOPMANS THEOREM; QUANTUM DYNAMICS; CYCLOHEXADIENE; MATRICES; PRODUCT; STATE	Time-resolved photoelectron spectra during the photochemical ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD) are modeled by an ensemble density functional theory (eDFT) method. The computational methodology employed in this work is capable of correctly describing the multi-reference effects arising in the ground and excited electronic states of molecules, which is important for the correct description of the ring-opening reaction of CHD. The geometries of molecular species along the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) trajectories reported in a previous study of the CHD photochemical ring-opening were used in this work to calculate the ionization energies and the respective Dyson orbitals for all possible ionization channels. The obtained theoretical time-resolved spectra display decay characteristics in a reasonable agreement with the experimental observations;i.e., the decay (and rise) of the most mechanistically significant signals occurs on the timescale of 100-150 fs. This is very different from the excited state population decay characteristics (tau(S1)= 234 +/- 8 fs) obtained in the previous NAMD study. The difference between the population decay and the decay of the photoelectron signal intensity is traced back to the geometric transformation that the molecule undergoes during the photoreaction. This demonstrates the importance of including the geometric information in interpretation of the experimental observations.

Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies	CELL			English	Article							POTENT NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; CRYO-EM STRUCTURE; FUNCTIONAL RECEPTOR; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; CORONAVIRUS; PROTECTION; HIV-1; SARS; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION	Neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses mainly target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the trimeric spike. Here, we characterized polyclonal immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1(A) and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4 A cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses, and characterized IgGs would not be affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. Overall, our studies structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from VH3-53/VH3-66 and similarity to a SARS-CoV VH3-30 antibody, providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies.

Extracellular DNA Promotes Efficient Extracellular Electron Transfer by Pyocyanin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms	CELL			English	Article							CHARGE-TRANSPORT; MICROBIAL NANOWIRES; BACTERIAL BIOFILMS; MECHANISMS; DIFFUSION; EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE; CONDUCTIVITY; ANTIBIOTICS; PHENAZINES; FLAVINS	Redox cycling of extracellular electron shuttles can enable the metabolic activity of subpopulations within multicellular bacterial biofilms that lack direct access to electron acceptors or donors. How these shuttles catalyze extracellular electron transfer (EET) within biofilms without being lost to the environment has been a long-standing question. Here, we show that phenazines mediate efficient EET through interactions with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Retention of pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine carboxamide in the biofilm matrix is facilitated by eDNA binding. In vitro, different phenazines can exchange electrons in the presence or absence of DNA and can participate directly in redox reactions through DNA. In vivo, biofilm eDNA can also support rapid electron transfer between redox active intercalators. Together, these results establish that PYO:eDNA interactions support an efficient redox cycle with rapid EET that is faster than the rate of PYO loss from the biofilm.

However, the relative contribution of the father to offspring care differs markedly across animals, even between related species. The mechanisms that organize and control paternal behavior remain poorly understood. Using Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice, two species at opposite ends of the paternal spectrum, we identified that distinct electrical oscillation patterns in neuroendocrine dopamine neurons link to a chain of low dopamine release, high circulating prolactin, prolactin receptor-dependent activation of medial preoptic area galanin neurons, and paternal care behavior in male mice. In rats, the same parameters exhibit inverse profiles. Optogenetic manipulation of these rhythms in mice dramatically shifted serum prolactin and paternal behavior, whereas injecting prolactin into non-paternal rat sires triggered expression of parental care. These findings identify a frequency-tuned brain-endocrine-brain circuit that can act as a gain control system determining a species' parental strategy.

We executed an interactome screen of 564 human cell-surface and secreted proteins, most of which are immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, using a high-throughput, automated ELISA-based screening platform employing a pooled-protein strategy to test all 318,096 PPI combinations. Screen results, augmented by phylogenetic homology analysis, revealed similar to 380 previously unreported PPIs. We validated a subset using surface plasmon resonance and cell binding assays. Observed PPIs reveal a large and complex network of interactions both within and across biological systems. We identified new PPIs for receptors with well-characterized ligands and binding partners for "orphan" receptors. New PPIs include proteins expressed on multiple cell types and involved in diverse processes including immune and nervous system development and function, differentiation/proliferation, metabolism, vascularization, and reproduction. These PPIs provide a resource for further biological investigation into their functional relevance and may offer new therapeutic drug targets.

A cryogenic silicon interferometer for gravitational-wave detection	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY			English	Article						gravitational wave astronomy; interferometry; cryogenic silicon; next generation gravitational wave detection; two micron lasers; binary black holes	SQUEEZED STATES; RADIATION-PRESSURE; OPTICAL-ABSORPTION; SINGLE-FREQUENCY; LOW-TEMPERATURES; NOISE; POWER; PERFORMANCE; SENSITIVITY; REDUCTION	The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers by LIGO has opened the era of gravitational wave astronomy, revealing a previously hidden side of the cosmos. To maximize the reach of the existing LIGO observatory facilities, we have designed a new instrument able to detect gravitational waves at distances 5 times further away than possible with Advanced LIGO, or at greater than 100 times the event rate. Observations with this new instrument will make possible dramatic steps toward understanding the physics of the nearby Universe, as well as observing the Universe out to cosmological distances by the detection of binary black hole coalescences. This article presents the instrument design and a quantitative analysis of the anticipated noise floor.	[Adhikari, R. X.; Arai, K.; Brooks, A.

Tectonics and seismicity in the Northern Apennines driven by slab retreat and lithospheric delamination	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Numerical modeling; Geodynamics; Seismotectonics orogen; Delamination; Northern Apennines	BACK-ARC EXTENSION; MEDITERRANEAN REGION; MANTLE DYNAMICS; NORMAL FAULTS; GPS DATA; SUBDUCTION; CONSTRAINTS; PLATE; TOPOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION	Understanding how long-term subduction dynamics relates to the short-term seismicity and crustal tec tonics is a challenging but crucial topic in seismotectonics. We attempt to address this issue by linking long-term geodynamic evolution with short-term seismogenic deformation in the Northern Apennines. This retreating subduction orogen displays tectonic and seismogenic behaviors on various spatiotemporal scales that also characterize other subduction zones in the Mediterranean area. We use visco-elasto-plastic seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) modeling with a realistic 2D setup based on available geological and geophysical data. The subduction dynamics and seismicity are coupled in the numerical modeling, and driven only by buoyancy forces, i.e., slab pull. Our results suggest that lower crustal rheology and lithospheric mantle temperature modulate the crustal tectonics of the Northern Apennines, as inferred by previous studies. The observed spatial distribution of upper crustal tectonic regimes and surface displacements requires buoyant, highly ductile material in the subduction channel beneath the internal part of the orogen. This allows protrusion of the asthenosphere in the lower crust and lithospheric delamination associated with slab retreat. The resulting surface velocities and principal stress axes generally agree with present-day observations, suggesting that slab delamination and retreat can explain the dynamics of the orogen. Our simulations successfully reproduce the type and overall distribution of seismicity with thrust faulting events in the external part of the orogen and normal faulting in its internal part. Slab temperatures and lithospheric mantle stiffness affect the cumulative seismic moment release and spatial distribution of upper crustal earthquakes. The properties of deep, sub-crustal material are thus shown to influence upper crustal seismicity in an orogen driven by slab retreat, even though the upper crust is largely decoupled from the lithospheric mantle. Our simulations therefore highlight the effect of deep lower crustal rheologies, self-driven subduction dynamics and mantle properties in controlling shallow deformation and seismicity.

CMS Collaboration	Measurement of the associated production of a Z boson with charm or bottom quark jets in proton-proton collisions at root s=13 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							GLUON SPLITTING RATE; PLUS PLUS; PAIRS	Ratios of cross sections, sigma(Z + c jets)/sigma(Z + jets), sigma(Z + b jets)/sigma(Z + jets), and sigma(Z + c jets)/sigma(Z + b jets) in the associated production of a Z boson with at least one charm or bottom quark jet are measured in proton-proton collisions at root s = 13 TeV. The data sample, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1), with a fiducial volume of p(T) > 30 GeV and vertical bar eta vertical bar < 2.4 for the jets, where p(T) and eta represent transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, respectively. The Z boson candidates come from leptonic decays into electrons or muons with p(r) > 25 GeV and vertical bar eta vertical bar < 2.4, and the dilepton mass satisfies 71 < m(z) < 111 GeV. The measured values are sigma(Z + c jets)/sigma(Z + jets) = 0.102 +/- 0.002 +/- 0.009, sigma(Z + b jets)/6(Z + jets) = 0.0633 +/- 0.0004 +/- 0.0015, and sigma(Z + c jets)/sigma(Z + b jets) = 1.62 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.15. Results on the inclusive and differential cross section ratios as functions of jet and Z boson transverse momentum are compared with predictions from leading and next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. These arc the first measurements of the cross section ratios at 13 TeV.	[Sirunyan, A.

Interaction of forced Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire modes in a low-order representation of turbulent channel flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article							LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURES; PROPER ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION; ENERGY AMPLIFICATION; STABILITY	A resolvent-based reduced-order representation is used to capture time-averaged second-order statistics in turbulent channel flow. The recently proposed decomposition of the resolvent operator into two distinct families related to the Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire operators [Rosenberg and McKeon, Efficient representation of exact coherent states of the Navier-Stokes equations using resolvent analysis, Fluid Dyn. Res. 51, 011401 (2019)] results in dramatic improvement in the ability to match all components of the energy spectra and the uv cospectrum. The success of the new representation relies on the ability of the Squire modes to compete with the vorticity generated by Orr-Sommerfeld modes, which is demonstrated by decomposing the statistics into contributions from each family. It is then shown that this competition can be used to infer a phase relationship between the two sets of modes. Additionally, the relative Reynolds number scalings for the two families of resolvent weights are derived for the universal classes of resolvent modes presented by Moarref et al. [Moarref, Sharma, Tropp, and McKeon, Model-based scaling of the streamwise energy density in high-Reynolds-number turbulent channels, J. Fluid Mech. 734, 275 (2013)]. These developments can be viewed as a starting point for further modeling efforts to quantify nonlinear interactions in wall-bounded turbulence.

J	Stepanik, V; Sun, JJ; Stathopoulos, A				Stepanik, Vincent; Sun, Jingjing; Stathopoulos, Angelike			FGF Pyramus Has a Transmembrane Domain and Cell-Autonomous Function in Polarity	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							FIBROBLAST-GROWTH-FACTOR; SIGNAL PEPTIDE PREDICTION; MESODERM MIGRATION; DROSOPHILA GASTRULATION; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; FACTOR RECEPTOR; C-ELEGANS; PROTEIN; HEARTLESS; ENCODES	Most fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) function as receptor ligands through their conserved FGF domain, but sequences outside this domain vary and are not well studied, This core domain of 120 amino acids (aa) is flanked in all FGFs by highly divergent amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal sequences of variable length. Drosophila has fewer FGF genes, with only three identified to date, pyramus (pyr), thisbe (ths), and branchless (bnn, and all three encoding relatively large FGF proteins (similar to 80 kDa). We hypothesized that the longer FGF proteins present in Drosophila and other organisms may relate to an ancestral form, in which multiple functions or regulatory properties are present within a single polypeptide. Here, we focused analysis on Pyr, finding that it harbors a transmembrane domain (TMD) and extended C-terminal intracellular domain containing a degron. The intracellular portion limits Pyr levels, whereas the TMD promotes spatial precision in the paracrine activation of Heartless FGF receptor. Additionally, degron deletion mutants that upregulate Pyr exhibit cell polarity defects that lead to invagination defects at gastrulation, demonstrating a previously uncharacterized cellautonomous role. In summary, our data show that Pyr is the first demonstrated transmembrane FGF, that it has both extracellular and intracellular functions, and that spatial distribution and levels of this particular FGF protein are tightly regulated. Our results suggest that other FGFs may be membrane tethered or multifunctional like Pyr.

J	Riccobono, D; Genta, G; Moreland, S; Backes, P				Riccobono, Dario; Genta, Giancarlo; Moreland, Scott; Backes, Paul			A multidisciplinary design tool for robotic systems involved in sampling operations on planetary bodies	CEAS SPACE JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Design tool; Sampling; Robotic systems; Lander; Planetary exploration	MARS PATHFINDER MISSION; ROSETTA LANDER; SCIENCE; SURFACE; PROBE	The analysis of robotic systems (e.g. landers and rovers) involved in sampling operations on planetary bodies is crucial to ensure mission success, since those operations generate forces that could affect the stability of the robotic system. This paper presents MISTRAL (MultIdisciplinary deSign Tool for Robotic sAmpLing), a novel tool conceived for trade space exploration during early conceptual and preliminary design phases, where a rapid and broad evaluation is required for a very high number of configurations and boundary conditions. The tool rapidly determines the preliminary design envelope of a sampling apparatus to guarantee the stability condition of the whole robotic system. The tool implements a three-dimensional analytical model capable to reproduce several scenarios, being able to accept various input parameters, including the physical and geometrical characteristics of the robotic system, the properties related to the environment and the characteristics related to the sampling system. This feature can be exploited to infer multidisciplinary high-level requirements concerning several other elements of the investigated system, such as robotic arms and footpads. The presented research focuses on the application of MISTRAL to landers. The structure of the tool and the analysis model are presented. Results from the application of the tool to real mission data from NASA's Phoenix Mars lander are included. Moreover, the tool was adopted for the definition of the high-level requirements of the lander for a potential future mission to the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus, currently under investigation at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This case study was included to demonstrate the tool's capabilities. MISTRAL represents a comprehensive, versatile, and powerful tool providing guidelines for cognizant decisions in the early and most crucial stages of the design of robotic systems involved in sampling operations on planetary bodies.

J	Bausch, J; Cubitt, TS; Lucia, A; Perez-Garcia, D				Bausch, Johannes; Cubitt, Toby S.; Lucia, Angelo; Perez-Garcia, David			Undecidability of the Spectral Gap in One Dimension	PHYSICAL REVIEW X			English	Article						Condensed Matter Physics; Quantum Physics	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; GROUND-STATES; QUANTUM; COMPUTATION; COMPLEXITY; SYSTEMS	The spectral gap problem-determining whether the energy spectrum of a system has an energy gap above ground state, or if there is a continuous range of low-energy excitations-pervades quantum many-body physics. Recently, this important problem was shown to be undecidable for quantum-spin systems in two (or more) spatial dimensions: There exists no algorithm that determines in general whether a system is gapped or gapless, a result which has many unexpected consequences for the physics of such systems. However, there are many indications that one-dimensional spin systems are simpler than their higher-dimensional counterparts: For example, they cannot have thermal phase transitions or topological order, and there exist highly effective numerical algorithms such as the density matrix renormalization group- and even provably polynomial-time ones-for gapped 1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area law. Furthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on aperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D. So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D? In this paper, we prove this is not the case by constructing a family of 1D spin chains with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor interactions for which no algorithm can determine the presence of a spectral gap. This not only proves that the spectral gap of 1D systems is just as intractable as in higher dimensions, but it also predicts the existence of qualitatively new types of complex physics in 1D spin chains. In particular, it implies there are 1D systems with a constant spectral gap and nondegenerate classical ground state for all systems sizes up to an uncomputably large size, whereupon they switch to a gapless behavior with dense spectrum.

Bosonic topological insulator intermediate state in the superconductor-insulator transition	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition; Superconductor-insulator transition; Bose metal; Bosonic topological insulator; Josephson junction arrays; Quantum Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition	ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; METAL; SUPERINSULATOR; CHARGE; ONSET	A low-temperature intervening metallic regime arising in the two-dimensional superconductor-insulator transition challenges our understanding of electronic fluids. Here we develop a gauge theory revealing that this emergent anomalous metal is a bosonic topological insulator where bulk transport is suppressed by mutual statistics interactions between out-of-condensate Cooper pairs and vortices and the longitudinal conductivity is mediated by symmetry-protected gapless edge modes. We explore the magnetic-field-driven superconductor-insulator transition in a niobium titanium nitride device and find marked signatures of a bosonic topological insulator behavior of the intervening regime with the saturating resistance. The observed superconductor-anomalous metal and insulator-anomalous metal dual phase transitions exhibit quantum Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criticality in accord with the gauge theory.

Improved Constraints on Northern Extratropical CO2 Fluxes Obtained by Combining Surface-Based and Space-Based Atmospheric CO2 Measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						carbon cycle; CO2 flux; data assimilation; GOSAT; TCCON; OCO-2	ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; POLE OBSERVATIONS HIPPO; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; IN-SITU; PARAMETERIZATION SIB2; GOSAT; DIOXIDE; IMPACT; MODEL	Top-down estimates of CO2 fluxes are typically constrained by either surface-based or space-based CO2 observations. Both of these measurement types have spatial and temporal gaps in observational coverage that can lead to differences in inferred fluxes. Assimilating both surface-based and space-based measurements concurrently in a flux inversion framework improves observational coverage and reduces sampling related artifacts. This study examines the consistency of flux constraints provided by these different observations and the potential to combine them by performing a series of 6-year (2010-2015) CO2 flux inversions. Flux inversions are performed assimilating surface-based measurements from the in situ and flask network, measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), and space-based measurements from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), or all three data sets combined. Combining the data sets results in more precise flux estimates for subcontinental regions relative to any of the data sets alone. Combining the data sets also improves the accuracy of the posterior fluxes, based on reduced root-mean-square differences between posterior flux-simulated CO2 and aircraft-based CO2 over midlatitude regions (0.33-0.56 ppm) in comparison to GOSAT (0.37-0.61 ppm), TCCON (0.50-0.68 ppm), or in situ and flask measurements (0.46-0.56 ppm) alone. These results suggest that surface-based and GOSAT measurements give complementary constraints on CO2 fluxes in the northern extratropics and can be combined in flux inversions to improve constraints on regional fluxes. This stands in contrast with many earlier attempts to combine these data sets and suggests that improvements in the NASA Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) retrieval algorithm have significantly improved the consistency of space-based and surface-based flux constraints.

Assessment of Observational Evidence for Direct Convective Hydration of the Lower Stratosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						stratosphere; water vapor; convection	WATER-VAPOR MEASUREMENTS; TROPOPAUSE; TRANSPORT; UNCERTAINTIES; DEHYDRATION; HYGROMETER; PLUMES	In situ and remote sensing observations of water vapor are analyzed to assess the evidence for direct convective hydration of the lower stratosphere. We have examined several hundred balloon-borne and airborne in situ measurements of lower stratospheric humidity in the tropics and northern midlatitudes. We find that the tropical lower stratospheric H2O enhancements above the background occur quite infrequently, and the height of the enhancements is within about 1 km of the cold-point tropopause. Following Schwartz et al. (2013, https://doi.org/10.1002/grl.50421), we examine the anomalously high (above 8 ppmv) water vapor mixing ratios retrieved by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) at 100- and 82-hPa pressure levels, and we determine their vertical location relative to the local tropopause based on both Global Forecast System (GFS) operational analysis and the ERA5 reanalysis temperature data. We find that essentially all of the >8-ppmv MLS water vapor measurements over the extratropical North American monsoon region are above the relatively low lapse-rate tropopause in the region, and most are above the local cold-point tropopause. Over the Asian monsoon region, most (80/90%) of the high H2O values occur below the relatively high-altitude local lapse-rate/cold-point tropopause. Anomalously high MLS water vapor retrievals at 100 and 82 hPa almost never occur in the deep tropics. We show that this result is consistent with the in situ observations given the broad vertical averaging kernel of the MLS measurement. The available evidence suggests that direct hydration of the lower stratosphere is important over North America during the monsoon season but likely has limited impact in the tropics.	[Jensen, E.

The latter is divided into two subsets with (SON6) and without FIREs (NOS6) in CMIP6. Improvement in nonfalling cloud ice (similar to 20 g m(-2)) is noticeable over convective regions in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5. The inclusion of FIREs in SON6 subset may contribute to reduce biases of overestimated outgoing longwave radiation and downward surface shortwave and underestimated reflected shortwave at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by magnitudes of similar to 8 W m(-2) over convective regions against CERES, compared to NOS6 subset. The reduced biases in radiative fluxes in convective regions stabilize the atmosphere and lead to circulation, SST, cloud, and precipitation changes over the trade wind regions, as seen from improved radiative fluxes (similar to 15 W m(-2)), surface wind stress biases, SST (similar to 0.8 K), and precipitation (1 mm day(-1)) biases. The significant improvement from NOS6 to SON6 leads to improved multimodel means for CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 for radiation fields over the trade wind regions but the degradation over convective zones is attributed to NOS6 subset. The results suggest that other sources of uncertainty and deficiencies in climate models may play significant roles for reducing discrepancies although FIREs, via radiation-circulation coupling, may be one of the factors that help to reduce regional biases.

Strength Evolution of Ice Plume Deposit Analogs of Enceladus and Europa	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sintering; strength; ice; Europa; Enceladus	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; CONE PENETRATION; WATER; SURFACE; HYDROGEN; SALTS; OCEAN	Enceladus and possibly Europa spew materials from their internal ocean into their exosphere, some of which are deposited back onto the surface of those Ocean Worlds. This setting provides a unique opportunity to seek traces of past or extant life in ice plume deposits on their surfaces. However, the design of lander missions and surface sampling techniques and the choice of sampling locations rely heavily on strength expectations. Here we present an experimental investigation of the evolution in strength of ice plume deposit analogs at several temperatures, as well as a model that predicts first-order estimates of the strength of evolved ice plume deposits under geologic timescales relevant to Enceladus and Europa. These results suggest that plume deposits remain weak and poorly consolidated on Enceladus, while they may develop substantial strength (comparable to solid ice) within <100 Myr on Europa. Plain Language Summary Enceladus and Europa are Ocean Worlds; they harbor an internal ocean beneath their ice shells. There is proof that a plume emits ocean materials out of Enceladus, similar to geysers on Earth, and some evidence for similar activity on Europa. Based on the composition of the plumes and the surface, both Enceladus and Europa are the leading outer solar system candidates for possibly harboring life. Areas where fresh plume materials are deposited would be the best location to search for traces of life on the surface. A major challenge in preparing mission concepts to explore these locations arises from the need to collect samples of the surface ice, while little is known at present about the mechanical properties of the surface. In this study, we prepared icy plume deposit analogs and let them evolve in the laboratory over extended periods of time to investigate the evolution of their strength. We find that plume deposits are likely to remain loose and exhibit a low strength over geologic timescales under Enceladus's conditions, suggesting that they would be relatively easy to sample. Conversely, under Europa's surface conditions, such plume deposits appear likely to develop a substantial strength.	[Choukroun, M.; Molaro, J. L.; Hodyss, R.; Marteau, E.; Backes, P.; Carey, E.

High-Spatiotemporal Resolution Observations of Jupiter Lightning-Induced Radio Pulses Associated With Sferics and Thunderstorms	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; lightning; Juno; Hubble Space Telescope; Waves; MWR	MOIST CONVECTION; GALILEO IMAGES; FREQUENCY; RADIATION; VOYAGER-1; WHISTLER; SIGNALS; CLOUDS; WATER	Jupiter lightning discharges produce various kinds of phenomena including radio wave pulses at different frequencies. On 6 April 2019, the Juno Waves instrument captured an extraordinary series of radio pulses at frequencies below 150kHz on timescales of submilliseconds. Quasi-simultaneous multi-instrument data show that the locations of their magnetic footprints are very close to the locations of ultrahigh frequency (UHF) sferics recorded by the Juno MWR instrument. Hubble Space Telescope images show that the signature of active convection includes cloud-free clearings, in addition to the convective towers and deep water clouds that were also recognized in previous spacecraft observations of lightning source regions. Furthermore, the detections of 17 very low frequency/low-frequency (VLF/LF) radio pulses suggest a minimum duration of lightning processes on the order of submilliseconds. These observations provide new constraints on the physical properties of Jupiter lightning. Plain Language Summary Jupiter lightning illuminates clouds and produces a strong pulse at radio wavelengths. Juno's radio observatory (consisting of two onboard instruments) in a broad radio range made several detections of extraordinary radio pulses on 6 April 2019. The high-temporal observations of such radio pulses detected below 150kHz indicate variations of the lightning related processes on the order of submilliseconds. Observations of these radio pulses and direct lightning-induced radio emissions at 600MHz come from the same area, very close to deep water clouds detected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the Jovian atmosphere. The coordinated Juno-HST lightning observations provide a new way of understanding the lightning processes and lightning source regions associated with the cloud features at Jupiter.

Here we present the first global retrievals of SIF at red wavelengths from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Despite the weak signal level, considerable uncertainties, and subtle measurement artifacts, spatial patterns and magnitudes agree with independent data sets. Over land, spatial patterns of our red SIF estimates covary with the far-red SIF data. Red SIF over the ocean is highly consistent with the normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) inferred from measurements of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), even when comparing single days and fine spatial scales. Major advantages of our Fraunhofer line-based SIF retrievals include the capability to sense SIF through optically thin cloud/aerosol layers and an insensitivity to ocean color. This opens up new avenues for studying ocean biogeochemistry from space. Plain Language Summary Plants absorb sunlight to power photosynthesis, but a small fraction of the energy is always re-emitted as a faint glow termed solar-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF). This weak electromagnetic signal can be measured with spectrometers that are sensitive enough and cover the wavelengths where SIF occurs (red to far red). Even though SIF is not a direct measure of the carbon uptake by photosynthesis, strong linear relationships between far-red SIF and independent estimates of photosynthesis have been observed over land. ESA's Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite hosts the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a highly sensitive sensor designed to monitor atmospheric trace gases and air pollutants from space. The band setting of TROPOMI permits us also to infer SIF in both the red and far-red wavelength domain. Here, we present global estimates of red SIF over both marine and terrestrial surfaces as seen from TROPOMI.

Collapse occurred in 62 discrete events, with "inflationary" deformation external to the collapse, similar to previous basaltic collapses. We take advantage of GPS data from the collapsing block and independent constraints on the magma chamber geometry from inversion of deflation prior to collapse onset. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to constrain the collapse geometry. Employing an axisymmetric finite element model, the co-collapse displacements are best explained by piston-like subsidence along a high angle (similar to 85 degrees) normal ring fault that may steepen to vertical with depth. Reservoir magma has compressibility of 2 -> 15x10(-10)Pa(-1), indicating bubble volume fractions from 1% to 7% (lower if fault steepens with depth). Magma pressure increases during collapses are 1 to 3MPa, depending on compressibility. Depressurization of a triaxial point source in a homogeneous half-space fits the data well but provides a biased representation of the source depth and process. Plain Language Summary When large volumes of magma erupt rapidly, the rock overlying the subsurface reservoir founders, producing a caldera. During the 2018 eruption of Klauea Volcano, Hawai'i, collapse occurred in over 60 events, each lasting 5 to 10s. We analyze GPS data collected during the last 32 of these events to determine the geometry of the ring fault system bounding the caldera block and the properties of the underlying magma. The faults are on average very steep but dip slightly inward at shallow depth. Inferred pressure increases during collapse events constrain the compressibility of the magma and imply an exsolved gas phase with 1% to 7 % bubbles by volume.

Formation of two glass phases in binary Cu-Ag liquid	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Metallic glasses; Glass transition; MD-simulation; Thermodynamics; Elasticity	AMORPHOUS PHASE; TRANSITION; DYNAMICS; TEMPERATURE; FRAGILITY	The glass transition is alternatively described as either a dynamic transition in which there is a dramatic slowing down of the kinetics, or as a thermodynamic phase transition. To examine the physical origin of the glass transition in fragile Cu-Ag liquids, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on systems in the range of 32,000 to 2,048,000 atoms. Surprisingly, we identified a 1st order freezing transition from liquid (L) to metastable heterogenous solid-like phase, denoted as the G-glass, when a supercooled liquid evolves isothermally below its melting temperature at deep undercooling. In contrast, a more homogenous liquidlike glass, denoted as the L-glass, is achieved when the liquid is quenched continuously to room temperature with a fast cooling rate of similar to 10(11) K/sec. We report a thermodynamic description of the L-G transition and characterize the correlation length of the heterogenous structure in the G-glass. The shear modulus of the G-glass is significantly higher than the L-glass, suggesting that the first order L-G transition is linked fundamentally to long-range elasticity involving elementary configurational excitations in the G-glass.

We quantify step retreat velocity and etch pit density to compare dissolution in seawater to low ionic strength water, and also to compare calcite dissolution under AFM conditions to those conducted in bulk solution experiments (e.g. Subhas et al., 2015, Dong et al., 2018). Bulk dissolution rates and step retreat velocities are slower at high and mid -saturation state (0) values and become comparable to low ionic strength water rates at low 0. The onset of defect -assisted etch pit formation in seawater is at 0 - 0.85 (defined as 0 critical), higher than in low ionic strength water (0 - 0.54). There is an abrupt increase in etch pit density (from -10 6 cm -2 to -10 8 cm -2) occurring when 0 falls below 0.7 in seawater, compared to 0 - 0.1 in low ionic strength water, suggesting a transition from defect -assisted dissolution to homogeneous dissolution much closer to equilib- rium in seawater. The step retreat velocity (v) does not scale linearly with undersaturation (1-0) across an 0 range of 0.4 to 0.9 in seawater, potentially indicating a high order correlation between kink rate and 0 for non-Kossel crystals such as calcite, or surface complexation processes during calcite dissolution in seawater.

Photochemical transformation of perfluoroalkyl acid precursors in water using engineered nanomaterials	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						PFAAs precursors; Engineered nanoparticles; Photochemical transformation; Reactive oxygen species; PFOS; PFOA	PHOSPHATE DIESTER; CARBON NANOTUBES; SUBSTANCES; OXYGEN; ENVIRONMENT; PERFLUOROPHOSPHONATES; BIOTRANSFORMATION; BIODEGRADATION; ACCUMULATION; TOXICITY	The production of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) has been phased out over recent decades; however, no significant decline in their environmental concentrations has been observed. This is partly due to the photochemical decomposition of PFAAs precursors (PrePFAAs) which remain in extensive use. The decomposition of PrePFAAs may be accelerated by the light-activated engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in water. In light of this hypothesis, we investigated the photochemical transformation of three PrePFAAs, which are 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (8:2 FTSA), 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH), and 2-(N-ethylperfluorooctane-1-sulfonamido ethyl] phosphate (SAmPAP), in the presence of six ENMs under simulated sunlight irradiation. The transformation rates of 8:2 FTSA and 8:2 FTOH were increased by 2-6 times when in the presence of six ENMs. However, most of ENMs appeared to inhibit the decomposition of SAmPAP. The transformation rates of PrePFAAs were found to depend on the yield of reactive oxygen species generated by ENMs, but the rates were also related to compound photo-stability, adsorption to surfaces, and photo-shielding effects. The PrePFAAs are transformed to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or/and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with higher toxicity and longer half-life, PFOA or PFOS and a few PFAAs having shorter carbon chain lengths. Higher concentrations of the PFAAs photodegradation products were observed in the presence of most of the ENMs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, as the number of tunable elements grows, the required control architecture becomes insurmountably complex. Here, we discuss the concept of perimeter-controlled tuning to shape far-zone radiation. We discuss applications of our approach to beam forming, holography, and image projection. We show that, with a proper design, the complexity of a control architecture may be dramatically simplified. We further discuss the use of our method to time-sharing image projection and holography. Our concept is applicable to a variety of systems, including phased array optical antennas and metasurfaces.

A molecular mediator for reductive concerted proton-electron transfers via electrocatalysis	SCIENCE			English	Article							BASIS-SETS; COMPLEXES; SCALE; FE; ACETONITRILE; UNIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS; REACTIVITY; CONSTANTS; OXIDATION	Electrocatalytic approaches to the activation of unsaturated substrates via reductive concerted proton-electron transfer ( CPET) must overcome competing, often kinetically dominant hydrogen evolution. We introduce the design of a molecular mediator for electrochemically triggered reductive CPET through the synthetic integration of a Bronsted acid and a redox mediator. Cathodic reduction at the cobaltocenium redox mediator substantially weakens the homolytic nitrogen-hydrogen bond strength of a Bronsted acidic anilinium tethered to one of the cyclopentadienyl rings. The electrochemically generated molecular mediator is demonstrated to transform a model substrate, acetophenone, to its corresponding neutral a-radical via a rate-determining CPET.

However, direct growth of graphene on silicon has been difficult due to the inert, oxidized silicon surfaces. Transferring graphene from metallic growth substrates to silicon is not a good solution either, because most transfer methods involve multiple steps that often lead to polymer residues or degradation of sample quality. Here we report a single-step method for large-area direct growth of continuous horizontal graphene sheets and vertical graphene nano-walls on silicon substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) without active heating. Comprehensive studies utilizing Raman spectroscopy, x-ray/ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical transmission are carried out to characterize the quality and properties of these samples. Data gathered by the residual gas analyzer (RGA) during the growth process further provide information about the synthesis mechanism. Additionally, ultra-low friction (with a frictional coefficient similar to 0.015) on multilayer graphene-covered silicon surface is achieved, which is approaching the superlubricity limit (for frictional coefficients <0.01). Our growth method therefore opens up a new pathway towards scalable and direct integration of graphene into silicon technology for potential applications ranging from structural superlubricity to nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and even the next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

The conversion methodology is presented, followed by an evaluation of the conversion algorithm's robustness. The SAGE-based backscatter products were compared to backscatter coefficients derived from ground-based lidar at three sites (Table Mountain Facility, Mauna Loa, and Observatoire de Haute-Provence). Further, the SAGE-derived lidar ratios were compared to values from previous balloon and theoretical studies. This evaluation includes the major eruption of Mt.

This heterogeneity has been hypothesized to have consequences for how cells are able to survive in changing environments. Recent work has explored the use of information theory as a framework to understand the accuracy with which cells can ascertain the state of their surroundings. Yet the predictive power of these approaches is limited and has not been rigorously tested using precision measurements. To that end, we generate a minimal model for a simple genetic circuit in which all parameter values for the model come from independently published data sets. We then predict the information processing capacity of the genetic circuit for a suite of biophysical parameters such as protein copy number and protein-DNA affinity. We compare these parameter-free predictions with an experimental determination of protein expression distributions and the resulting information processing capacity of E. coli cells. We find that our minimal model captures the scaling of the cell-to-cell variability in the data and the inferred information processing capacity of our simple genetic circuit up to a systematic deviation.

We show that the conjecture is satisfied for the axion-dilaton-gravity system if we assume duality constraints on the higher derivative corrections in addition to positivity bounds which follow from unitarity, analyticity, and locality of UV scattering amplitudes. On the other hand, the conjecture does not follow if we assume the positivity bounds only. This presents an example where derivation of the weak gravity conjecture requires more detailed UV information than the consistency of scattering amplitudes.

Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the bbZZ channel in proton-proton collisions at root s=13 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							CMS EXPERIMENT; PP COLLISIONS; MASS; EVENTS	A search for the production of a narrow-width resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons decaying into the bbZZ channel is presented. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector during 2016, in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1). The final states considered are the ones where one of the Z bosons decays into a pair of muons or electrons, and the other Z boson decays to either a pair of quarks or a pair of neutrinos. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the production of narrow-width spin-0 or spin-2 particles decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons, in models with and without an extended Higgs sector. For a resonance mass range between 260 and 1000 GeV, limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of a spin-0 and spin-2 resonance range from 0.1 to 5.0 pb and 0.1 to 3.6 pb, respectively. These results set limits in parameter space in bulk Randall-Sundrum radion, Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton, and next-to-minimal two-Higgs doublet models (N2HDMs). For specific choices of parameters the N2HDM can be excluded in a mass range between 360 and 620 GeV for a resonance decaying to two Higgs bosons. This is the first search for Higgs boson resonant pair production in the bbZZ channel.	[Sirunyan, A.

The heat capacities were integrated to obtain the enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy and to quantify how these thermodynamic functions are altered by nanocrystallinity. From the phonon density of states (DOS) measured by inelastic neutron scattering, we find that the Gibbs free energy is dominated by phonons and that the larger heat capacity of the nanomaterial below 100 K is attributable to its enhanced phonon DOS at low energies. Besides electronic and magnetic contributions, the nanocrystalline material has an additional contribution at higher temperatures, consistent with phonon anharmonicity. The nanocrystalline material shows a stronger increase with temperature of both the enthalpy and entropy compared to the bulk sample. Its entropy exceeds that of the bulk material by 0.4 kB/atom at 300 K. This is insufficient to overcome the enthalpy of grain boundaries and defects in the nanocrystalline material, making it thermodynamically unstable with respect to the bulk control material.

In support of KORUS-AQ, 2554 whole air samples (WAS) were collected aboard the NASA DC-8 research aircraft and analyzed for 82 C-1-C(10 )volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using multi-column gas chromatography. Together with fast-response measurements from other groups, the air samples were used to characterize the VOC composition in Seoul and surrounding regions, determine which VOCs are major ozone precursors in Seoul, and identify the sources of these reactive VOCs. (1) The WAS VOCs showed distinct signatures depending on their source origins. Air collected over Seoul had abundant ethane, propane, toluene and n-butane while plumes from the Daesan petrochemical complex were rich in ethene, C-2-C(6 )alkanes and benzene. Carbonyl sulfide (COS), CFC-113, CFC-114, carbon tetrachloride (CCI)(4) and 1,2-dichloroethane were good tracers of air originating from China. CFC-11 was also elevated in air from China but was surprisingly more elevated in air over Seoul. (2) Methanol, isoprene, toluene, xylenes and ethene were strong individual contributors to OH reactivity in Seoul. However methanol contributed less to ozone formation based on photochemical box modeling, which better accounts for radical chemistry. (3) Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and other techniques indicated a mix of VOC source influences in Seoul, including solvents, traffic, biogenic, and long-range transport. The solvent and traffic sources were roughly equal using PMF, and the solvents source was stronger in the KORUS-AQ emission inventory. Based on PMF, ethene and propene were primarily associated with traffic, and toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes with solvents, especially non-paint solvents for toluene and paint solvents for ethylbenzene and xylenes. This suggests that VOC control strategies in Seoul could continue to target vehicle exhaust and paint solvents, with additional regulations to limit the VOC content in a variety of non-paint solvents.

While the rovers have made major discoveries and dramatically increased our understanding of Mars, they require a great deal of interaction from the operations teams, and achieving mission objectives can take longer than anticipated when productivity is paced by the ground teams' ability to react. We have conducted a project to explore technologies and techniques for creating self-reliant rovers (SRR): rovers that are able to maintain high levels of productivity with reduced reliance on ground interactions. This paper describes the design of SRR and a prototype implementation that we deployed on a research rover. We evaluated the system by conducting a simulated campaign in which members of the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover) science team used our rover to explore a geographical region. The evaluation demonstrated the system's ability to maintain high levels of productivity with limited communication with operators.

Study of central exclusive pi(+)pi(-) production in proton-proton collisions at root s=5.02 and 13 TeV	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							PARTIAL-WAVE ANALYSIS; PP INTERACTIONS; MESON; SYSTEM	Central exclusive and semiexclusive production of pi(+)pi(-) pairs is measured with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at center-of-mass energies of 5.02 and 13 TeV. The theoretical description of these non-perturbative processes, which have not yet been measured in detail at the LHC, poses a significant challenge to models. The two pions are measured and identified in the CMS silicon tracker based on specific energy loss, whereas the absence of other particles is ensured by calorimeter information. The total and differential cross sections of exclusive and semiexclusive central pi(+)pi(-) production are measured as functions of invariant mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity of the pi(+)pi(-) system in the fiducial region defined as transverse momentum p(T)(p) > 0.2GeV and pseudorapidity vertical bar eta(p)vertical bar < 2.4. The production cross sections for the four resonant channels f(0)(500), rho(0) (770), f(0)(980), and f(2)(1270) are extracted using a simple model. These results represent the first measurement of this process at the LHC collision energies of 5.02 and 13 TeV.	[Sirunyan, A.

Yet, the developmental consequences of specific aneuploidies remain unexplored. Here, we determine the extent of post-implantation development of human embryos bearing common aneuploidies using a recently established culture platform. We show that while trisomy 15 and trisomy 21 embryos develop similarly to euploid embryos, monosomy 21 embryos exhibit high rates of developmental arrest, and trisomy 16 embryos display a hypo-proliferation of the trophoblast, the tissue that forms the placenta. Using human trophoblast stem cells, we show that this phenotype can be mechanistically ascribed to increased levels of the cell adhesion protein E-CADHERIN, which lead to premature differentiation and cell cycle arrest. We identify three cases of mosaicism in embryos diagnosed as full aneuploid by pre-implantation genetic testing. Our results present the first detailed analysis of post-implantation development of aneuploid human embryos. Aneuploidy, abnormal chromosome number, is a major cause of early pregnancy loss. Here the authors determine the extent of post-implantation development of human embryos with common aneuploidies in culture, finding developmental arrest of monosomy 21 embryos, and trophoblast hypo-proliferation in trisomy 16 embryos.

Impact heat driven volatile redistribution at Occator crater on Ceres as a comparative planetary process	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; MARS; EVOLUTION; SHAPE; DEPOSITS; HISTORY; ORIGIN; MELT	Hydrothermal processes in impact environments on water-rich bodies such as Mars and Earth are relevant to the origins of life. Dawn mapping of dwarf planet (1) Ceres has identified similar deposits within Occator crater. Here we show using Dawn high-resolution stereo imaging and topography that Ceres' unique composition has resulted in widespread mantling by solidified water- and salt-rich mud-like impact melts with scattered endogenic pits, troughs, and bright mounds indicative of outgassing of volatiles and periglacial-style activity during solidification. These features are distinct from and less extensive than on Mars, indicating that Occator melts may be less gas-rich or volatiles partially inhibited from reaching the surface. Bright salts at Vinalia Faculae form thin surficial precipitates sourced from hydrothermal brine effusion at many individual sites, coalescing in several larger centers, but their ages are statistically indistinguishable from floor materials, allowing for but not requiring migration of brines from deep crustal source(s). Dawn mission's second extended phase provided high resolution observations of Occator crater of the dwarf planet Ceres. Here, the authors show stereo imaging and topographic maps of this crater revealing the influence of crustal composition on impact related melt and hydrothermal processes, and compare features to those on Mars, Earth and the Moon.

The varied sources of faculae-forming brines in Ceres' Occator crater emplaced via hydrothermal brine effusion	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DEPOSITS; SURFACE; VESTA; ICE	Before acquiring highest-resolution data of Ceres, questions remained about the emplacement mechanism and source of Occator crater's bright faculae. Here we report that brine effusion emplaced the faculae in a brine-limited, impact-induced hydrothermal system. Impact-derived fracturing enabled brines to reach the surface. The central faculae, Cerealia and Pasola Facula, postdate the central pit, and were primarily sourced from an impact-induced melt chamber, with some contribution from a deeper, pre-existing brine reservoir. Vinalia Faculae, in the crater floor, were sourced from the laterally extensive deep reservoir only. Vinalia Faculae are comparatively thinner and display greater ballistic emplacement than the central faculae because the deep reservoir brines took a longer path to the surface and contained more gas than the shallower impact-induced melt chamber brines. Impact-derived fractures providing conduits, and mixing of impact-induced melt with deeper endogenic brines, could also allow oceanic material to reach the surfaces of other large icy bodies. The second extended phase of the Dawn mission provided high resolution observations of Occator crater of the dwarf planet Ceres. Here, the authors show that the central faculae were sourced in an impact-induced melt chamber, with a contribution from the deep brine reservoir, while the Vinalia Faculae were sourced by the deep brine reservoir alone.

Post-impact cryo-hydrologic formation of small mounds and hills in Ceres's Occator crater	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access							WATER ICE; TUKTOYAKTUK PENINSULA; DOME CRATERS; GROWTH; PINGOS	Mounds within Ceres's Occator crater may have formed by freezing of water-rich impact-induced melt, by a process analogous to that of pingo formation on Earth, according to an analysis of data from NASA's Dawn mission. The intimate mixture of ice and silicate within the uppermost few kilometres of Ceres influences its geology and the evolution of its subsurface. Both ground ice and cryovolcanic processes have been hypothesized to form geologic terrains on Ceres, including within Occator crater, where they have been suggested to influence the post-impact surface evolution. Both types of processes involve the presence and expression of volatiles and brines, such that distinguishing between them could be difficult. Here, we use images and topography data from the NASA Dawn mission to investigate the morphology, age and distribution of mounds and hills within Occator crater, and infer their origin. The shapes and relative ages of many of these features suggest that they formed as impact-induced water-rich flows that covered the crater floor refroze in a manner similar to the formation of periglacial ice-cored mounds on Earth called pingos. We suggest that impacts on Ceres produced hydrologic conditions for surface changes in the absence of cryovolcanic processes. Our findings imply that cryo-hydrologic processes extend beyond Earth and Mars, and have been active on Ceres in the geologically recent past.	[Schmidt, B. E.; Hughson, K. H. G.; Duarte, K.

Improved Constraints on Sterile Neutrino Mixing from Disappearance Searches in the MINOS, MINOS+, Daya Bay, and Bugey-3 Experiments	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; REACTOR; MODEL	Searches for electron antineutrino, muon neutrino, and muon antineutrino disappearance driven by sterile neutrino mixing have been carried out by the Daya Bay and MINOS+ collaborations. This Letter presents the combined results of these searches, along with exclusion results from the Bugey-3 reactor experiment, framed in a minimally extended four-neutrino scenario. Significantly improved constraints on the theta(mu e) mixing angle are derived that constitute the most constraining limits to date over five orders of magnitude in the mass-squared splitting Delta m(41)(2), excluding the 90% C.L. sterile-neutrino parameter space allowed by the LSND and MiniBooNE observations at 90% CLs for Delta m(41)(2) < 13 eV(2). Furthermore, the LSND and MiniBooNE 99% C.L. allowed regions are excluded at 99% CLs for Delta m(41)(2) < 1.6 eV(2).	[Adamson, P.; Childress, S.; Hahn, S.

The lift-up mechanism was recently identified in turbulent jets via local analysis by Nogueira et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 873, 2019, pp. 211-237) at low Strouhal number () and non-zero azimuthal wavenumbers (). In these limits, a global SPOD analysis of data from high-fidelity simulations reveals streamwise vortices and streaks similar to those found in turbulent wall-bounded flows. These structures are in qualitative agreement with the global resolvent analysis, which shows that they are a response to upstream forcing of streamwise vorticity near the nozzle exit. Analysis of mode shapes, component-wise amplitudes and sensitivity analysis distinguishes the three mechanisms and the regions of frequency-wavenumber space where each dominates, finding lift-up to be dominant as . Finally, SPOD and resolvent analyses of localized regions show that the lift-up mechanism is present throughout the jet, with a dominant azimuthal wavenumber inversely proportional to streamwise distance from the nozzle, with streaks of azimuthal wavenumber exceeding five near the nozzle, and wavenumbers one and two most energetic far downstream of the potential core.

Long Wavelength InAs/InAsSb Infrared Superlattice Challenges: A Theoretical Investigation	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						Infrared detector; unipolar barrier; type-II superlattice; InAs; InAsSbsuperlattice		InAs/InAsSb type-II superlattice focal plane arrays that demonstrate high operability and uniformity with cutoffs ranging from 5 mu m to 13 mu m have already been demonstrated. Compared to InAs/GaSb, the InAs/InAsSb superlattice is easier to grow and has longer minority carrier lifetimes, but requires a longer superlattice period to achieve long or very long wavelength cutoffs. A longer type-II superlattice period leads to smaller absorption coefficients and larger growth-direction hole conductivity effective masses. We explore by theoretical modeling some of the ideas aimed at addressing these challenges for the long and very long wavelength InAs/InAsSb superlattice. Increasing the Sb fraction in the InAsSb alloy can reduce the InAs/InAsSb superlattice period significantly, but this benefit can be negated by Sb segregation. Thin AlAsSb barrier layers can be inserted in InAs/InAsSb to form polytype W, M, and N superlattices in order to increase electron-hole wavefunction overlap for stronger optical absorption. However, this strategy can be unfavorable since the AlAsSb barriers increase the band gap, and thereby increase the superlattice period required to reach a given cutoff wavelength. Metamorphic growth on virtual substrates with larger lattice constants than GaSb can decrease the superlattice period needed to reach a specified cutoff wavelength, but this benefit should be weighed against the need for metamorphic buffer growth and the resulting higher defect density.

Unexpected air pollution with marked emission reductions during the COVID-19 outbreak in China	SCIENCE			English	Article							MEXICO-CITY; MODELING SYSTEM; APEC BLUE; AEROSOLS; HAZE; HONO; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; GASES	The absence of motor vehicle traffic and suspended manufacturing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China enabled assessment of the efficiency of air pollution mitigation. Up to 90% reduction of certain emissions during the city-lockdown period can be identified from satellite and ground-based observations. Unexpectedly, extreme particulate matter levels simultaneously occurred in northern China. Our synergistic observation analyses and model simulations show that anomalously high humidity promoted aerosol heterogeneous chemistry, along with stagnant airflow and uninterrupted emissions from power plants and petrochemical facilities, contributing to severe haze formation. Also, because of nonlinear production chemistry and titration of ozone in winter, reduced nitrogen oxides resulted in ozone enhancement in urban areas, further increasing the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and facilitating secondary aerosol formation.

Trajectories with two lunar gravity assists are considered and analyzed. Two approaches are applied and tested for the design of missions aimed at Near-Earth asteroids. In the first method, indirect optimization of the heliocentric leg is combined to an approximate analytical treatment of the geocentric phase for short escape trajectories. In the second method, the results of pre-computed maps of escape C3 are employed for the design of longer Sun-perturbed escape sequences combined with direct optimization of the heliocentric leg. Features are compared and suggestions about a combined use of the approaches are presented. The techniques are efficiently applied to the design of a mission to a near-Earth asteroid.

Small lightning flashes from shallow electrical storms on Jupiter	NATURE			English	Article							MOIST CONVECTION; GALILEO IMAGES; ATMOSPHERE; PERFORMANCE; CLOUDS	Small lightning flashes detected on Jupiter by Juno have shallow origins above the 2-bar level of Jupiter's atmosphere where temperatures are too low for liquid water to exist. Lightning flashes have been observed by a number of missions that visited or flew by Jupiter over the past several decades. Imagery led to a flash rate estimate of about 4 x 10(-3)flashes per square kilometre per year (refs.(1,2)). The spatial extent of Voyager flashes was estimated to be about 30 kilometres (half-width at half-maximum intensity, HWHM), but the camera was unlikely to have detected the dim outer edges of the flashes, given its weak response to the brightest spectral line of Jovian lightning emission, the 656.3-nanometre H alpha line of atomic hydrogen(1,3-6). The spatial resolution of some cameras allowed investigators to confirm 22 flashes with HWHM greater than 42 kilometres, and to estimate one with an HWHM of 37 to 45 kilometres (refs.(1,7-9)). These flashes, with optical energies comparable to terrestrial 'superbolts'-of (0.02-1.6) x 10(10) joules-have been interpreted as tracers of moist convection originating near the 5-bar level of Jupiter's atmosphere (assuming photon scattering from points beneath the clouds)(1-3,7,8,10-12). Previous observations of lightning have been limited by camera sensitivity, distance from Jupiter and long exposures (about 680 milliseconds to 85 seconds), meaning that some measurements were probably superimposed flashes reported as one(1,2,7,9,10,13). Here we report optical observations of lightning flashes by the Juno spacecraft with energies of approximately 10(5)-10(8) joules, flash durations as short as 5.4 milliseconds and inter-flash separations of tens of milliseconds, with typical terrestrial energies. The flash rate is about 6.1 x 10(-2)flashes per square kilometre per year, more than an order of magnitude greater than hitherto seen. Several flashes are of such small spatial extent that they must originate above the 2-bar level, where there is no liquid water(14,15). This implies that multiple mechanisms for generating lightning on Jupiter need to be considered for a full understanding of the planet's atmospheric convection and composition.

FMRI hemodynamic response function (HRF) as a novel marker of brain function: applications for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder pathology and treatment response	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Early Access						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI; Hemodynamic response function; HRF; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; OCD; Cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT; Machine learning	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; DYNAMIC GRANGER CAUSALITY; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; BOLD RESPONSE; STATE; VARIABILITY	The hemodynamic response function (HRF) represents the transfer function linking neural activity with the functional MRI (fMRI) signal, modeling neurovascular coupling. Since HRF is influenced by non-neural factors, to date it has largely been considered as a confound or has been ignored in many analyses. However, underlying biophysics suggests that the HRF may contain meaningful correlates of neural activity, which might be unavailable through conventional fMRI metrics. Here, we estimated the HRF by performing deconvolution on resting-state fMRI data from a longitudinal sample of 25 healthy controls scanned twice and 44 adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) before and after 4-weeks of intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). HRF response height, time-to-peak and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) in OCD were abnormal before treatment and normalized after treatment in regions including the caudate. Pre-treatment HRF predicted treatment outcome (OCD symptom reduction) with 86.4% accuracy, using machine learning. Pre-treatment HRF response height in the caudate head and time-to-peak in the caudate tail were top-predictors of treatment response. Time-to-peak in the caudate tail, a region not typically identified in OCD studies using conventional fMRI activation or connectivity measures, may carry novel importance. Additionally, pre-treatment response height in caudate head predicted post-treatment OCD severity (R = -0.48,P = 0.001), and was associated with treatment-related OCD severity changes (R = -0.44,P = 0.0028), underscoring its relevance. With HRF being a reliable marker sensitive to brain function, OCD pathology, and intervention-related changes, these results could guide future studies towards novel discoveries not possible through conventional fMRI approaches like standard BOLD activation or connectivity.

Core collapse in massive scalar-tensor gravity	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							EQUATION-OF-STATE; NUCLEAR-MATTER; CAUCHY-PROBLEM; BLACK-HOLES; SUPERNOVA; PRINCIPLE; DYNAMICS; DICKE; HOT	This paper provides an extended exploration of the inverse-chirp gravitational-wave signals from stellar collapse in massive scalar-tensor gravity reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 201103]. We systematically explore the parameter space that characterizes the progenitor stars, the equation of state, and the scalar-tensor theory of the core collapse events. We identify a remarkably simple and straightforward classification scheme of the resulting collapse events. For any given set of parameters, the collapse leads to one of three end states: a weakly scalarized neutron star, a strongly scalarized neutron star, or a black hole, possibly formed in multiple stages. The latter two end states can lead to strong gravitational-wave signals that may be detectable in present continuous-wave searches with ground-based detectors. We identify a very sharp boundary in the parameter space that separates events with strong gravitational-wave emission from those with negligible radiation.

However, conventional methods for creating gaps result in un-defined geometries and poorly characterized conditions (cell death factors and cell debris), which can influence the gap closure process. To overcome these limitations, a novel method to create well-defined geometrical gaps is developed. First, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are seeded in variously shaped micro-containers made out of hyaluronic acid hydrogels. Cell proliferation and cell tension induce fibrous collagen production by SMCs predominantly around the edges of the micro-containers. Upon removal of SMCs, the selectively deposited collagen results in micro-containers with cell-adhesive regions along the edges and walls. Fibroblasts are seeded in these micro-containers, and upon attaching and spreading, they naturally form gaps with different geometries. The rapid proliferation of fibroblasts from the edge results in filling and closure of the gaps. It is demonstrated that gap closure rate as well as closure mechanism is strongly influenced by geometrical features, which points to an important role for cellular tension and cell proliferation in gap closure.

A data resource from concurrent intracranial stimulation and functional MRI of the human brain	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MOTION ARTIFACT; CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK; FMRI; SEGMENTATION; REGISTRATION; OPTOGENETICS; ACCURATE; DISEASE	Mapping the causal effects of one brain region on another is a challenging problem in neuroscience that we approached through invasive direct manipulation of brain function together with concurrent whole-brain measurement of the effects produced. Here we establish a unique resource and present data from 26 human patients who underwent electrical stimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (es-fMRI). The patients had medically refractory epilepsy requiring surgically implanted intracranial electrodes in cortical and subcortical locations. One or multiple contacts on these electrodes were stimulated while simultaneously recording BOLD-fMRI activity in a block design. Multiple runs exist for patients with different stimulation sites. We describe the resource, data collection process, preprocessing using the fMRIPrep analysis pipeline and management of artifacts, and provide end-user analyses to visualize distal brain activation produced by site-specific electrical stimulation. The data are organized according to the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) specification, and are available for analysis or future dataset contributions on openneuro.org including both raw and preprocessed data.

Static and dynamic characterization of a focused laser differential interferometer	EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS			English	Article							BOUNDARY-LAYER	A focused laser differential interferometer (FLDI) is experimentally characterized via static and dynamic benchtop testing. The static response is probed using a steady, laminar helium jet, and the dynamic response is investigated using an ultrasonic acoustic beam. In the case of the jet, the refractive index field is independently measured using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer operating simultaneously integrated with FLDI. The experimental data for the static response are compared with numerical simulations of the FLDI based on geometric optics and a ray-tracing algorithm, while the dynamic response is compared with an analytical transfer function derived from the same theory. Close quantitative agreement is found between experiment and theory, validating this approach to modeling FLDI performance. Emphasis is given to quantification of the spatial sensitivity of the system which is a key characteristic of FLDI, especially when applied to hypervelocity ground testing facilities where turbulent flow exists in shear or boundary layers outside the core flow.

To synthesize (A)GroEL(B) with two different DNA strands A and B at its opposite apical domains, we utilized the unique biological property of GroEL, i.e., Mg2+/ATP-mediated ring exchange between (A)GroEL(A) and (B)GroEL(B) with their hollow cylindrical double-decker architectures. This exchange event was reported more than 24 years ago but has never been utilized for molecular engineering of GroEL. We leveraged DNA nanotechnology to purely isolate Janus A GroEL B and succeeded in its precision ternary supramolecular copolymerization with two DNA comonomers, A** and B*, that are partially complementary to A and B in (A)GroEL(B), respectively, and programmed to self-dimerize on the other side. Transmission electron microscopy allowed us to confirm the formation of the expected dual-periodic copolymer sequence -((B)*(/B)GroEL(A/A)**(/A)**(/A)GroEL(B/B)*)- in the form of a laterally connected lamellar assembly rather than a single-chain copolymer.

It has emerged that advanced age and obesity are risk factors for complications but questions concerning the potential effects on fetal health and successful pregnancy for those infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unanswered. Here, we examine human pre-gastrulation embryos to determine the expression patterns of the genesACE2, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, andTMPRSS2, encoding a protease that cleaves both the viral spike protein and the ACE2 receptor to facilitate infection. We show expression and co-expression of these genes in the trophoblast of the blastocyst and syncytiotrophoblast and hypoblast of the implantation stages, which develop into tissues that interact with the maternal blood supply for nutrient exchange. Expression ofACE2andTMPRSS2in these tissues raises the possibility for vertical transmission and indicates that further work is required to understand potential risks to implantation, placental health and fetal health that require further study.

Phase-sensitive optomechanical amplifier for quantum noise reduction in laser interferometers	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							FORMALISM; OPTICS	The sensitivity of future gravitational wave interferometers is expected to be limited throughout the detection band by quantum vacuum fluctuations, which can be reduced by applying quantum optics techniques such as squeezed vacuum injection. However, decoherence caused by optical losses in the readout chain will severely limit the effectiveness of such schemes. It was proposed that effect of losses in the final stage of detection can be mitigated by a phase-sensitive amplifier placed in between the output port of the interferometer and the photodetector. In this paper we propose to implement such amplification using an optomechanical device, study some of its practical limitations, and discuss its applicability to next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

H.; Teague, D.; Trembath-reichert, S.; Vetens		CMS Collaboration	Measurements of (tt)over-barH Production and the CP Structure of the Yukawa Interaction between the Higgs Boson and Top Quark in the Diphoton Decay Channel	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							SEARCH	The first observation of the (tt) over barH process in a single Higgs boson decay channel with the full reconstruction of the final state (H -> gamma gamma) is presented, with a significance of 6.6 standard deviations (sigma). The CP structure of Higgs boson couplings to fermions is measured, resulting in an exclusion of the pure CP-odd structure of the top Yukawa coupling at 3.2 sigma. The measurements are based on a sample of protonproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy root s = 13 TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb(-1). The cross section times branching fraction of the (tt) over barH process is measured to be sigma B-(tt) over barH(gamma gamma) = 1.56(-0.32)(+0.34) th, which is compatible with the standard model prediction of 1.13(-0.11)(+0.08) fb. The fractional contribution of the CP-odd component is measured to be f(CP)(Hu) = 0.00 +/- 0.33.	[Sirunyan, A.

Raman signal from a hindered hydrogen rotor	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; EQUATION-OF-STATE; SOLID HYDROGEN; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; MICROWAVE-ABSORPTION; PRESSURE; DEUTERIUM; EXCITATIONS; SPECTROSCOPY; BEHAVIOR	We present a method for calculation of Raman modes of the quantum solid phase I hydrogen and deuterium. We use the mean-field assumption that the quantized excitations are localized on one molecule. This is done by explicit solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation in an angle-dependent potential, and direct calculation of the polarization. We show that in the free rotor limit, the H-2 and D-2 frequencies differ by a factor of 2, which evolves toward root 2 as the modes acquire librational character due to stronger interactions. The ratio overshoots root 2 if anharmonic terms weaken the harmonic potential. We also use density functional theory and molecular dynamics to calculate the E-2g optical phonon frequency and the Raman linewidths. The molecular dynamics shows that the molecules are not free rotors except at very low pressure and high temperature, and become like oscillators as phase II is approached. We fit the interaction strengths to experimental frequencies, but good agreement for intensities requires us to also include strong preferred orientation and stimulated Raman effects between S-0(1) and S-0(0) contributions. The experimental Raman spectrum for phase II cannot be reproduced, suggesting that the mean-field assumption is invalid in that case.	[Cooke, Peter I.

In this work, a double negative differential resistance (D-NDR) characteristic of a hybrid 2D vdW/organic tunneling device consisting of a hafnium disulfide/pentacene heterojunction and a 3D pentacene resistor is reported. This D-NDR phenomenon is achieved by precisely controlling an NDR peak voltage with the pentacene resistor and then integrating two distinct NDR devices in parallel. Then, the operation of a controllable-gain amplifier configured with the D-NDR device and an n-channel transistor is demonstrated using the Cadence Spectre simulation platform. The proposed D-NDR device technology based on a hybrid 2D vdW/organic heterostructure provides a scientific foundation for various circuit applications that require the NDR phenomenon.

During these two periods, short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) can be transported to neonates via transplacental and breastfeeding transfers, and eventually posing potential adverse effects to neonates. Up to date, no simultaneous investigation of prenatal and postnatal exposure of CPs is reported. To bridge this knowledge gap, we have analyzed SCCPs and MCCPs in 20 complete sets of maternal serum, umbilical cord serum, placenta, and breast milk. The levels of both Sigma SCCP and Sigma MCCP followed the order of maternal serum > breast milk > cord serum > placenta. The breastfeeding transfer ratios (R-BM approximate to 1.0) of CPs were greater than the corresponding transplacental transfer ratios (R-CM < 1.0), demonstrating the higher transport of CPs during the lactation period. The placental retention/or accumulation ratios (R-PM) showed that CPs were effectively retained by the placental barrier. Furthermore, the total exposure amount of SCCPs and MCCPs during the lactation period was > 100 times higher than the gestation exposure amounts. This study helps to better understand the prenatal and postnatal exposure of CPs and provides a solid basis for accurate human health risk assessment of CPs.

A novel ALI system, the Dosimetric Aerosol in Vitro Inhalation Device (DAVID), bioinspired by the human respiratory system, uses water-based condensation for highly efficient aerosol deposition to ALI cell culture. Here, welding fumes (well-studied and inherently toxic ultrafine particles) were used to assess the ability of DAVID to generate toxicological responses between differing welding conditions. After fume exposure, ALI-cultured cells showed reductions in viability that were both distinct between welding conditions and linearly dose-dependent with respect to exposure time; comparatively, submerged cell cultures ran in parallel did not show these trends across exposure levels. DAVID delivers a substantial dose in minutes (> 100 mu g/cm(2)), making it preferable over previous ALI systems, which require hours of exposure to deliver sufficient dose, and over submerged techniques, which lack comparable physiological relevance. DAVID has the potential to provide the most accurate assessment of in vitro toxicity yet from the perspectives of physiological relevance to the human respiratory system and efficiency in collecting ultrafine aerosol common to hazardous exposure conditions.

Here Tr-k[A] denotes the k(th) elementary symmetric polynomial of the eigenvalues of A. This result gives an alternative proof for the concavity of A bar right arrow Tr-k exp(H + log A)(1/k) that was obtained and used in a recent work to derive expectation estimates and tail bounds on partial spectral sums of random matrices.

In mammals, this pathway is mediated by the UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 E3 ubiquitin ligases, and by the p62 regulator of autophagy. UBR1 and UBR2 are sequelogous, functionally overlapping, and dominate the targeting of Arg/N-degron substrates in examined cell lines. We constructed, here, mouse strains in which the double mutant [UBR1(-/-)UBR2(-/-)] genotype can be induced conditionally, in adult mice. We also constructed human [UBR1(-/-)UBR2(-/-)] HEK293T cell lines that unconditionally lack UBR1/UBR2. ATF3 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes and can act as either a repressor or an activator of transcription. Using the above double-mutant mice and human cells, we found that the levels of endogenous, untagged ATF3 were significantly higher in both of these [UBR1(-/-)UBR2(-/-)] settings than in wild-type cells. We also show, through chase-degradation assays with [UBR1(-/-)UBR2(-/-)] and wild-type human cells, that the Arg/N-degron pathway mediates a large fraction of ATF3 degradation. Furthermore, we used split-ubiquitin and another protein interaction assay to detect the binding of ATF3 to both UBR1 and UBR2, in agreement with the UBR1/UBR2-mediated degradation of endogenous ATF3. Full-length 24 kDa ATF3 binds to similar to 100 kDa fragments of 200 kDa UBR1 and UBR2 but does not bind (in the setting of interaction assays) to full-length UBR1/UBR2. These and other binding patterns, whose mechanics remain to be understood, may signify a conditional (regulated) degradation of ATF3 by the Arg/N-degron pathway.	[Vu, Tri T.

Assessment of Regional Methane Emission Inventories through Airborne Quantification in the San Francisco Bay Area	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LOS-ANGELES; GOSAT; OIL	This study derives methane emission rates from 92 airborne observations collected over 23 facilities including 5 refineries, 10 landfills, 4 wastewater treatment plants (POTWs), 2 composting operations, and 2 dairies in the San Francisco Bay Area. Emission rates are measured using an airborne mass-balance technique from a low-flying aircraft. Annual measurement-based sectorwide methane emissions are 19,000 +/- 2300 Mg for refineries, 136,700 +/- 25,900 Mg for landfills, 11,900 +/- 1,500 Mg for POTWs, and 11,100 +/- 3,400 Mg for composting. The average of measured emissions for each refinery ranges from 4 to 23 times larger than the corresponding emissions reported to regulatory agencies, while measurement-derived landfill and POTW estimates are approximately twice the current inventory estimates. Significant methane emissions at composting facilities indicate that a California mandate to divert organics from landfills to composting may not be an effective measure for mitigating methane emissions unless best management practices are instituted at composting facilities. Complementary evidence from airborne remote sensing imagery indicates atmospheric venting from refinery hydrogen plants, landfill working surfaces, composting stockpiles, etc., to be among the specific source types responsible for the observed discrepancies. This work highlights the value of multiple measurement approaches to accurately estimate facility-scale methane emissions and perform source attribution at subfacility scales to guide and verify effective mitigation policy and action.

TW membrane filters have been charged with UV or simulated sunlight and subsequently transferred to a once-through flow-type system. The charged TW filters can transfer the stored electrons to dissolved O-2, producing ROSs that mediate As(III) oxidation in the dark. Dramatic inhibition of As(V) production with O-2 removal or addition of ROS quenchers indicates an ROS-mediated As(III) oxidation mechanism. Electron paramagnetic spectroscopic analysis has confirmed the formation of the HO2 center dot-/O-2(center dot-) pair in the dark. The WO3 fraction in the TW filter significantly influences the performance of the As(III) oxidation, while As(V) production is enhanced with increasing charging time and solution pH. The As(III) oxidation is terminated when the singly charged TW filter is fully discharged; however, recharging of TW recovers the catalytic activity for As(III) oxidation. The proposed oxidation process using charged TW membrane filters is practical and environmentally benign for the continuous treatment of As(III)-contaminated water during periods of unavailability of sunlight.

Commercially available acousto-optic modulators are based on bulk materials and consume Watts of radio frequency power. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 3-GHz acousto-optic frequency shifter on thin-film lithium niobate, featuring a carrier suppression over 30 dB. Further, we demonstrate a gigahertz-spaced optical frequency comb featuring more than 200 lines over a 0.6-THz optical bandwidth by recirculating the light in an active frequency shifting loop. Our integrated acousto-optic platform leads to the development of on-chip optical routing, isolation, and microwave signal processing.

Unlike nucleic acids, proteins cannot be amplified, making detection of minute quantities from single cells difficult. Here, we develop a strategy to detect targeted protein and its PTM isoforms in single cells. We barcode the proteins from single cells by tagging them with oligonucleotides, pool barcoded cells together, run bulk gel electrophoresis to separate protein and its PTM isoform and quantify their abundances by sequencing the oligonucleotides associated with each protein species. We used this strategy, iDentification and qUantification sEparaTion (DUET), to measure histone protein H2B and its monoubiquitination isoform, H2Bub, in single yeast cells. Our results revealed the heterogeneities of H2B ubiquitination levels in single cells from different cell-cycle stages, which is obscured in ensemble measurements. Yandong Zhang, et al. develop iDentification and qUantification sEparaTion (DUET) to quantify target protein and its post-translational modification isoforms in single cells. Using their method, they report heterogeneities in the ubiquitination levels of histone H2B in single yeast cells and reveal the cell-cycle dynamics of H2B monoubiquitination.

HOMs are formed by rapid, gas-phase autoxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as alpha-pinene, the most abundant monoterpene in the atmosphere. Due to their abundance and low volatility, HOMs can play an important role in new-particle formation (NPF) and the early growth of atmospheric aerosols, even without any further assistance of other low-volatility compounds such as sulfuric acid. Both the autoxidation reaction forming HOMs and their NPF rates are expected to be strongly dependent on temperature. However, experimental data on both effects are limited. Dedicated experiments were performed at the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN to address this question. In this study, we show that a decrease in temperature (from + 25 to -50 degrees C) results in a reduced HOM yield and reduced oxidation state of the products, whereas the NPF rates (J(1.7) (nm)) increase substantially. Measurements with two different chemical ionization mass spectrometers (using nitrate and protonated water as reagent ion, respectively) provide the molecular composition of the gaseous oxidation products, and a two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D VBS) model provides their volatility distribution. The HOM yield decreases with temperature from 6.2 % at 25 degrees C to 0.7 % at -50 degrees C. However, there is a strong reduction of the saturation vapor pressure of each oxidation state as the temperature is reduced. Overall, the reduction in volatility with temperature leads to an increase in the nucleation rates by up to 3 orders of magnitude at -50 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C. In addition, the enhancement of the nucleation rates by ions decreases with decreasing temperature, since the neutral molecular clusters have increased stability against evaporation. The resulting data quantify how the interplay between the temperature-dependent oxidation pathways and the associated vapor pressures affect biogenic NPF at the molecular level. Our measurements, therefore, improve our understanding of pure biogenic NPF for a wide range of tropospheric temperatures and precursor concentrations.

J	Bhattacharyya, P; Beck, J				Bhattacharyya, Pinaky; Beck, James			Exploiting convexification for Bayesian optimal sensor placement by maximization of mutual information	STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING			English	Article; Early Access						Bayesian model updating; convex optimization; mutual information; optimal sensor location; structural dynamics	SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; METHODOLOGY; LOCATION	Bayesian optimal sensor placement, in its full generality, seeks to maximize the mutual information between uncertain model parameters and the predicted data to be collected from the sensors for the purpose of performing Bayesian inference. Equivalently, the expected information entropy of the posterior of the model parameters is minimized over all possible sensor configurations for a given sensor budget. In the context of structural dynamical systems, this minimization is computationally expensive because of the large number of possible sensor configurations. Here, a very efficient convex relaxation scheme is presented to determine informative and possibly optimal solutions to the problem, thereby bypassing the necessity for an exhaustive, and often infeasible, combinatorial search. The key idea is to relax the binary sensor location vector so that its components corresponding to all possible sensor locations lie in the unit interval. Then, the optimization over this vector is a convex problem that can be efficiently solved. This method always yields a unique solution for the relaxed problem, which is often binary and therefore the optimal solution to the original problem. When not binary, the relaxed solution is often suggestive of what the optimal solution for the original problem is. An illustrative example using a 50-story shear building model subject to sinusoidal ground motion is presented, including a case where there are over 47 trillion possible sensor configurations. The solutions and computational effort are compared with greedy and heuristic methods.

Evidence of general economic principles of bargaining and trade from 2,000 classroom experiments	NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR			English	Article; Early Access							ULTIMATUM GAME; DECISION-MAKING; FAIRNESS; MARKET; REPLICABILITY; BEHAVIOR; DAMAGE; NORM	Camerer et al. use standardized experiments across thousands of students to demonstrate empirical regularities in two-person bargaining and trading in markets. Bargaining outcomes lean toward equal sharing, and markets rapidly create prices that match supply and demand. Standardized classroom experiments provide evidence about how well scientific results reproduce when nearly identical methods are used. We use a sample of around 20,000 observations to test reproducibility of behaviour in trading and ultimatum bargaining. Double-auction results are highly reproducible and are close to equilibrium predictions about prices and quantities from economic theory. Our sample also shows robust correlations between individual surplus and trading order, and autocorrelation of successive price changes, which test different theories of price dynamics. In ultimatum bargaining, the large dataset provides sufficient power to identify that equal-split offers are accepted more often and more quickly than slightly unequal offers. Our results imply a general consistency of results across a variety of different countries and cultures in two of the most commonly used designs in experimental economics.

J	Bruckner, A; Heethoff, M				Brueckner, Adrian; Heethoff, Michael			Fatty acid metabolism in an oribatid mite: de novo biosynthesis and the effect of starvation	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY			English	Article						Neutral lipid fatty acids; Starvation; Stable-isotope labeling; Soil animal; Biochemistry	PANSTRONGYLUS-MEGISTUS HEMIPTERA; LINOLEIC-ACID; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; SELECTIVE MOBILIZATION; FOOD-WEB; TOLERANCE; PREDATION; QUALITY	The fatty acid (FA) composition of lipids in animals is influenced by factors such as species, life stage, availability and type of food, as well as the ability to synthesize certain FAs de novo. We investigated the effect of starvation on the neutral lipid (NLFA) and phospholipid (PLFA) fatty acid patterns of the oribatid miteArchegozetes longisetosusAoki. Furthermore, we performed stable-isotope labeled precursors feeding experiments under axenic conditions to delineate de novo FA synthesis by profiling(13)C and deuterium incorporation via single-ion monitoring. Starvation of mites resulted in a decline in the total amount of NLFAs and significantly changed the fatty acid patterns, indicating that NLFAs were metabolized selectively. Biochemical tracer experiments confirmed that oribatid mites, like other animals, can produce stearic (18:0) and oleic acid (18:1 omega 9) de novo. Mass spectrometric data also revealed that they appear to synthesize linoleic acid [18:2 omega 6,9 = (9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid]-an ability restricted only to a few arthropod taxa, including astigmatid mites. The physiological and biosynthesis processes revealed here are crucial to understand the potential biomarker function of fatty acids-especially 18:2 omega 6,9-in oribatid mites and their applicability in soil animal food web studies.

Regeneration is initiated by rapid accumulation of auxin near the injury site but the source of this auxin is unknown. Here, we show that auxin accumulation arises from the activity of multiple auxin biosynthetic sources that are newly specified near the cut site and that their continuous activity is required for the regeneration process. Auxin synthesis is highly localized while PIN-mediated transport is dispensable for auxin accumulation and tip regeneration. Roots lacking the activity of the regeneration competence factorERF115, or that are dissected at a zone of low regeneration potential, fail to activate local auxin sources. Remarkably, restoring auxin supply is sufficient to confer regeneration capacity to these recalcitrant tissues. We suggest that regeneration competence relies on the ability to specify new local auxin sources in a precise temporal pattern. When root stem cells are destroyed, the remaining neighbour cells accumulate auxin to prepare for regeneration. Where does this auxin come from? Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, the authors show that auxin is synthesized locally and not transported from elsewhere.

We particularly highlight an ability to infer a source's sky location, both when combined with a network of ground-based detectors to form a long triangulation baseline, and by itself for the early warning of merger events. Such an accurate location measurement is the key for using GW signals as standard sirens for constraining the Hubble constant. This kind of detector also opens up the possibility to test type la supernovae progenitor hypotheses by constraining the merger rates of white dwarf binaries with both superand sub-Chandrasekhar masses separately. We will discuss other scientific outcomes that can be delivered, including the constraint of structure formation in the early Universe, the search for intermediate-mass black holes, the precise determination of black hole spins, the probe of binary systems' orbital eccentricity evolution, and the detection of tertiary masses around merging binaries.

Fully Integrated Time-Gated 3D Fluorescence Imager for Deep Neural Imaging	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)	OCT 17-19, 2019	Nara, JAPAN	IEEE, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE Solid State Circuits Soc, Tateisi Sci & Technol Fdn, Nanolux, Nidek Co Ltd, Hisol, Keysight Technologies, Horiba Adv Techno, Maxwell Biosystems, Sysmex, Kyocera, Shimadzu, Santen, Omron, ThorLabs, Hamamatsu, Mdpi, Micromachines		Single photon avalanche diode; time-gated fluorescence imaging; neural imaging; computational imaging	AVALANCHE-DIODE ARRAY; SENSORS; FILTER; BRAIN	This paper presents a device for time-gated fluorescence imaging in the deep brain, consisting of two on-chip laser diodes and 512 single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). The edge-emitting laser diodes deliver fluorescence excitation above the SPAD array, parallel to the imager. In the time domain, laser diode illumination is pulsed and the SPAD is time-gated, allowing a fluorescence excitation rejection up to O.D. 3 at 1 ns of time-gate delay. Each SPAD pixel is masked with Talbot gratings to enable the mapping of 2D array photon counts into a 3D image. The 3D image achieves a resolution of 40, 35, and 73 mu m in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, in a noiseless environment, with a maximum frame rate of 50 kilo-frames-per-second. We present measurement results of the spatial and temporal profiles of the dual-pulsed laser diode illumination and of the photon detection characteristics of the SPAD array. Finally, we show the imager's ability to resolve a glass micropipette filled with red fluorescent microspheres. The system's 420 mu m-wide cross section allows it to be inserted at arbitrary depths of the brain while achieving a field of view four times larger than fiber endoscopes of equal diameter.

We have detected radio emission from IM Fri, RW Sex, V3885 Sgr, and V603 AqI. While RW Sex, V3885 Sgr, and V603 Aql had been previously detected, this is the first reported radio detection of IM Fri. Our observations have doubled the sample of non-magnetic CVs with sensitive radio data. We observe that at our radio detection limits, a specific optical luminosity greater than or similar to 2.2 x 10(18) erg s(-1) Hz(-1) (corresponding to M-V less than or similar to 6.0) is required to produce a radio detection. We also observe that the X-ray and radio luminosities of our detected nova-like CVs are on an extension of the L-x a proportional to L-R(similar to 0.7) power law originally proposed for non-pulsating neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. We find no other correlations between the radio emission and emission in other wavebands or any other system parameters for the existing sample of radio-detected non-magnetic CVs. We measure in-band (0.9-1.7 GHz) radio spectral indices that are consistent with reports from earlier work. Finally, we constructed broad spectral energy distributions for our sample from published multiwavelength data, and use them to place constraints on the mass transfer rates of these systems.

Simplifications of the available relativistic reflection models limit the capability of performing accurate measurements of the properties of black holes. In this paper, we present an extension of the modelrelxill_nkin which the accretion disk has a finite thickness rather than being infinitesimally thin. We employ the accretion disk geometry proposed by Taylor & Reynolds and we construct relativistic reflection models for different values of the mass accretion rate of the black hole. We apply the new model to high-quality Suzaku data of the X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 to explore the impact of the thickness of the disk on tests of the Kerr metric.

We apply two methods: the Max Spectrum method can detect the predominant clusters, and the declustering threshold time method provides details on the typical clustering properties and timescales. Our analysis shows that during the different phases of solar cycles 23 and 24, CMEs with speeds >= 1000 km s(-1)preferentially occur as isolated events and in clusters with, on average, two members. However, clusters with more members appear, particularly during the maximum phases of the solar cycles. Over the total period and in the maximum phases of solar cycles 23 and 24, about 50% are isolated events, 18% (12%) occur in clusters with two (three) members, and another 20% in larger clusters >= 4, whereas in a solar minimum, fast CMEs tend to occur more frequently as isolated events (62%). During different solar cycle phases, the typical declustering timescales of fast CMEs are tau(c) = 28-32 hr, irrespective of the very different occurrence frequencies of CMEs during a solar minimum and maximum. These findings suggest that tau(c)for extreme events may reflect the characteristic energy build-up time for large flare and CME-prolific active regions. Statistically associating the clustering properties of fast CMEs with the disturbance storm time index at Earth suggests that fast CMEs occurring in clusters tend to produce larger geomagnetic storms than isolated fast CMEs. This may be related to CME-CME interaction producing a more complex and stronger interaction with Earth's magnetosphere.	[Gomez, Jenny M.

This QSO is the first spectroscopically confirmed candidate from an ongoing search using the combination of Gaia and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry to identify bright QSOs at z > 2, the redshift regime for which the Ly alpha forest is accessible with ground-based facilities. With a Gaia apparent magnitude G = 16.07, 2MASS J13260399 + 7023462 is one of the brightest QSOs known at z > 2, with only 15 currently known brighter QSOs. Given its inferred M-1450,M-AB magnitude and redshift, it is among the most luminous objects in the universe; the inferred black hole mass and corresponding Eddington ratio are (2.7 +/- 0.4) x 10(10) M-circle dot and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively. Follow-up Hubble observations confirm it is not gravitationally lensed.

TOI-1728b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder Confirms a Warm Super-Neptune Orbiting an M-dwarf Host	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet detection methods; Radial velocity; Planet hosting stars	TRANSMISSION SPECTRA; MASS; EXOPLANETS; PERTURBATIONS; LUMINOSITY; EVOLUTION; EFFICIENT; BINARIES; VELOCITY; CATALOG	We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-1728b using a combination of ground-based photometry, near-infrared Doppler velocimetry and spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. TOI-1728 is an old, inactive M0 star with Teff = 3980(-32)(+31) K, which hosts a transiting super-Neptune at an orbital period of similar to 3.49 days. Joint fitting of the radial velocities and TESS and ground-based transits yields a planetary radius of 5.05(-0.17)(+0.16) R-circle plus, mass 26.78(-5.13)(+5.43) M-circle plus, and eccentricity 0.057(-0.039)(+0.054). We estimate the stellar properties, and perform a search for He 10830 angstrom absorption during the transit of this planet and claim a null detection with an upper limit of 1.1% with 90% confidence. A deeper level of He 10830 angstrom absorption has been detected in the planet atmosphere of GJ 3470b, a comparable gaseous planet. TOI-1728b is the largest super-Neptune-the intermediate subclass of planets between Neptune and the more massive gas-giant planets-discovered around an M dwarf. With its relatively large mass and radius, TOI-1728 represents a valuable data point in the M-dwarf exoplanet mass-radius diagram, bridging the gap between the lighter Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs. With a low bulk density of 1.14(-0.24)(+0.26) g cm(-3), and orbiting a bright host star (J similar to 9.6, V similar to 12.4), TOI-1728b is also a promising candidate for transmission spectroscopy both from the ground and from space, which can be used to constrain planet formation and evolutionary models.

We use this survey to constrain the geometry of the circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding SN IIn explosions, which may shed light on their progenitor diversity. In order to distinguish between aspherical and spherical CSM, we estimate the blackbody radius temporal evolution of the SNe IIn of our sample, following the method introduced by Soumagnac et al. We find that higher-luminosity objects tend to show evidence for aspherical CSM. Depending on whether this correlation is due to physical reasons or to some selection bias, we derive a lower limit between 35% and 66% for the fraction of SNe IIn showing evidence for aspherical CSM. This result suggests that asphericity of the CSM surrounding SNe IIn is common-consistent with data from resolved images of stars undergoing considerable mass loss. It should be taken into account for more realistic modeling of these events.

Relativistic Reflection and Reverberation in GX 339-4 with NICER and NuSTAR	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Black holes; High energy astrophysics; Astrophysical black holes; Stellar mass black holes; Low-mass X-ray binary stars; X-ray astronomy	X-RAY REVERBERATION; SPECTRAL-TIMING PROPERTIES; ACCRETING BLACK-HOLES; XMM-NEWTON DATA; LOW/HARD STATE; HARD STATE; DISC TRUNCATION; CYGNUS X-1; INNER-DISK; TIME LAGS	We analyze seven Neutron Star Interior Composition Interior Explorer (NICER) and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array epochs of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 in the hard state during its two most recent hard-only outbursts in 2017 and 2019. These observations cover the 1-100 keV unabsorbed luminosities between 0.3% and 2.1% of the Eddington limit. With NICER's negligible pileup, high count rate, and unprecedented time resolution, we perform a spectral-timing analysis and spectral modeling using relativistic and distant reflection models. Our spectral fitting shows that as the inner disk radius moves inward, the thermal disk emission increases in flux and temperature, the disk becomes more highly ionized, and the reflection fraction increases. This coincides with the inner disk increasing its radiative efficiency around similar to 1% Eddington. We see a hint of the hysteresis effect at similar to 0.3% of Eddington; the inner radius is significantly truncated during the rise (>49R(g)), while only a mild truncation (similar to 5R(g)) is found during the decay. At higher frequencies (2-7 Hz) in the highest-luminosity epoch, a soft lag is present whose energy dependence reveals a thermal reverberation lag with an amplitude similar to previous findings for this source. We also discuss the plausibility of the hysteresis effect and the debate of the disk truncation problem in the hard state.

We now expand its capabilities to include the ability to compute secondary eclipse depths. We have also added the option to calculate models using the correlated-kmethod for radiative transfer, which improves accuracy without sacrificing speed. Additionally, we update the opacities inPLATON-many of which were generated using old or proprietary line lists-using the most recent and complete public line lists. These opacities are made available atR = 1000 andR = 10,000 over the 0.3-30 mu m range, and atR = 375,000 in select near-IR bands, making it possible to utilizePLATONfor ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation studies. To demonstratePLATON's new capabilities, we perform a retrieval on published Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This is the first joint transit and secondary eclipse retrieval for this planet in the literature, as well as the most comprehensive set of both transit and eclipse data assembled for a retrieval to date. We find that these high signal-to-noise data are well matched by atmosphere models with a C/O ratio of 0.66(-0.09)(+0.05) and a metallicity of 12(-5)(+8) times solar where the terminator is dominated by extended nanometer-sized haze particles at optical wavelengths. These are among the smallest uncertainties reported to date for an exoplanet, demonstrating both the power and the limitations of HST and Spitzer exoplanet observations.

J	Jasinski, JM; Nordheim, TA; Hasegawa, Y; Murphy, N				Jasinski, Jamie M.; Nordheim, Tom A.; Hasegawa, Yasuhiro; Murphy, Neil			The Importance of Local Interstellar Conditions on the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum at Exoplanets	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Habitable planets; Exoplanets; Astrospheres; Galactic cosmic rays	SOLAR-SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT; EARTH; PROPAGATION; MODULATION; PARTICLES; PLANETS; REGION; PLASMA; CLOUDS	Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are highly energetic particles that can have significant effects on the atmospheres and potentially also surfaces of (exo)planets and moons. Their propagation through the Sun's heliosphere and their interaction with planetary bodies have been widely studied in the solar system (e.g., Earth, Mars, Venus, and Europa). There is currently much interest in exoplanetary science, particularly in terms of characterizing the potential habitability of exoplanetary environments. As a consequence of this, models have been developed to quantify the effect of GCRs on exoplanet systems. However, many such studies assume Earth-like (1 au) GCR fluxes. Here we will demonstrate why this is not a reasonable assumption. We briefly discuss the journey that GCRs make from their birth to the arrival at an exoplanet, and discuss the various implications this will have on GCR fluxes. We demonstrate the importance of understanding the specific local interstellar medium (ISM) that an exoplanetary system resides within, as this determines the size of the astrosphere of the host star. This has strong implications for the modulation of GCR fluxes throughout an astrosphere. We estimate how GCR proton fluxes at 1 au (from the Sun) would be different from current values if the solar system was embedded in a different ISM environment. Furthermore, we provide estimates of the wide range of possible GCR proton fluxes at the exoplanets Kepler-20f and Kepler-88c using previously published estimates for the local ISM parameters at these bodies.

J	Simard, D; Ravi, V				Simard, Dana; Ravi, Vikram			Scintillation Can Explain the Spectral Structure of the Bright Radio Burst from SGR 1935+2154	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Neutron stars; Magnetars; Radio bursts; Interstellar scattering	MULTIFREQUENCY OBSERVATIONS; INTERSTELLAR SCINTILLATION; CURVATURE RADIATION; SCATTERING; CONSTRAINTS; MAGNETAR; PULSARS; TURBULENCE; PULSES	The discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB) associated with a magnetar in the Milky Way by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB collaboration (CHIME/FRB) and the Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 has provided an unprecedented opportunity to refine FRB emission models. The burst discovered by CHIME/FRB shows two components with different spectra. We explore interstellar scintillation as the origin for this variation in spectral structure. Modeling a weak scattering screen in the supernova remnant associated with the magnetar, we find that a superluminal apparent transverse velocity of the emission region of >9.5cis needed to explain the spectral variation. Alternatively, the two components could have originated from independent emission regions >8.3 x 10(4)km apart. These scenarios may arise in "far-away" models where the emission originates from well beyond the magnetosphere of the magnetar (for example, through a synchrotron maser mechanism set up by an ultrarelativistic radiative shock), but not in "close-in" models of emission from within the magnetosphere. If further radio observations of the magnetar confirm scintillation as the source of the observed variation in spectral structure, this scattering model thus constrains the location of the emission region.

Cold molecular gas and free-free emission from hot, dust-obscured galaxies at z similar to 3	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; radio lines: galaxies	SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; RADIO PROPERTIES; HIGH-REDSHIFT; PHYSICS; QUASARS; MERGERS	We report on observations of redshifted CO(1-0) line emission and observed-frame similar to 30 GHz radio continuum emission from five ultra-luminous, mid-IR selected hot, Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at z greater than or similar to 3 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We detect CO(1-0) line emission in all five Hot DOGs, with one of them at high signal-to-noise ratio. We analyse FIR-radio spectral energy distributions, including dust, free-free, and synchrotron emission for the galaxies. We find that most of the 115 GHz rest-frame continuum is mostly due to synchrotron or free-free emission, with only a potentially small contribution from thermal emission. We see a deficit in the rest-frame 115 GHz continuum emission compared to dusty star-forming galaxies and sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) at high redshift, suggesting that Hot DOGs do not have similar cold gas reserves compared with star-forming galaxies. One target, W2305-0039, is detected in the FIRST 1.4 GHz survey, and is likely to possess compact radio jets. We compare to the FIR-radio correlation, and find that at least half of the Hot DOGs in our sample are radio-quiet with respect to normal galaxies. These findings suggest that Hot DOGs have comparably less cold molecular gas than star-forming galaxies at lower, z similar to 2 redshifts, and are dominated by powerful, yet radio-quiet AGN.

We specifically focus on Milky Way-mass disc galaxies at late times (z approximate to 0). In agreement with observations, we find a relatively flat relationship, with sigma approximate to N 15-30 km s(-1) in neutral gas across 3 dex in SFRs. We show that higher dense gas fractions (ratios of dense gas to neutral gas) and SFRs arc correlated at constant sigma. Similarly, lower gas fractions (ratios of gas to stellar mass) are correlated with higher sigma at constant SFR. The limits of the sigma-Sigma(SFR) relation correspond to the onset of strong outflows. We see evidence of 'on-off' cycles of star formation in the simulations, corresponding to feedback injection time-scales of 10-100 Myr, where SFRs oscillate about equilibrium SFR predictions. Finally, SFRs and velocity dispersions in the simulations agree well with feedback-regulated and marginally stable gas disc (Toomre's Q = 1) model predictions, and the simulation data effectively rule out models assuming that gas turns into stars at (low) constant efficiency (i.e. 1 per cent per free-fall time). And although the simulation data do not entirely exclude gas accretion/gravitationally powered turbulence as a driver of sigma, it appears to be subdominant to stellar feedback in the simulated galaxy discs at z approximate to 0.

Testing the relativistic Doppler boost hypothesis for the binary candidate quasar PG1302-102 with multiband Swift data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						quasars: individual: PG1302-102; quasars: supermassive black holes	BLACK-HOLE BINARIES; VARIABILITY; ACCRETION; PERIODICITY; POPULATION; DISCS	The bright quasar PG1302-102 has been identified as a candidate supermassive black hole binary from its near-sinusoidal optical variability. While the significance of its optical periodicity has been debated due to the stochastic variability of quasars, its multiwavelength variability in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands is consistent with relativistic Doppler boost caused by the orbital motion in a binary. However, this conclusion was based previously on sparse UV data that were not taken simultaneously with the optical data. Here, we report simultaneous follow-up observations of PG1302-102 with the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in six optical + UV bands. The additional nine Swift observations produce light curves roughly consistent with the trend under the Doppler boost hypothesis, which predicts that UV variability should track the optical, but with a similar to 2.2 times higher amplitude. We perform a statistical analysis to quantitatively test this hypothesis. We find that the data are consistent with the Doppler boost hypothesis when we compare the the amplitudes in optical B-band and UV light curves. However, the ratio of UV to V-band variability is larger than expected and is consistent with the Doppler model, only if either the UV/optical spectral slopes vary, the stochastic variability makes a large contribution in the UV, or the sparse new optical data underestimate the true optical variability. We have evidence for the latter from comparison with the optical light curve from All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. Additionally, the simultaneous analysis of all four bands strongly disfavours the Doppler boost model whenever Swift V band is involved. Additional, simultaneous optical + UV observations tracing out another cycle of the 5.2-yr proposed periodicity should lead to a definitive conclusion.

J	Beniamini, P; Hotokezaka, K				Beniamini, Paz; Hotokezaka, Kenta			Turbulent mixing of r-process elements in the Milky Way	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: abundances; stars: neutron; Galaxy: abundances	NEUTRON-STAR MERGERS; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; ABUNDANCES; ENRICHMENT; SUPERNOVAE; EVOLUTION; SITES; WAVES	We study turbulent gas diffusion affects on r-process abundances in Milky Way stars, by a combination of an analytical approach and a Monte Carlo simulation. Higher r-process event rates and faster diffusion, lead to more efficient mixing corresponding to a reduced scatter of r-process abundances and causing r-process enriched stars to start appearing at lower metallicities. We use three independent observations to constrain the model parameters: (i) the scatter of radioactively stable r-process element abundances, (ii) the largest r-process enrichment values observed in any solar neighborhood stars, and (iii) the isotope abundance ratios of different radioactive r-process elements ((PU)-P-244/U-238 and Cm-247/U-238) at the early Solar system as compared to their formation. Our results indicate that the Galactic r-process rate and the diffusion coefficient are respectively r < 4 x 10(-5) yr(-1), D > 0.1 kpc(2) Gyr(-1) (r < 4 x 10(-6 )yr(-1), D > 0.5 kpc(2) Gyr(-1) for collapsars or similarly prolific r-process sources) with allowed values satisfying an approximate anticorrelation such that D approximate to r(-2/3), implying that the time between two r-process events that enrich the same location in the Galaxy, is tau(mix )approximate to 100-200 Myr. This suggests that a fraction of similar to 0.8 (similar to 0.5) of the observed Cm-247 (Pu-244) abundance is dominated by one r-process event in the early Solar system. Radioactively stable element abundances are dominated by contributions from similar to 10 different events in the early Solar system. For metal poor stars (with [Fe/H] less than or similar to -2), their r-process abundances are dominated by either a single or several events, depending on the star formation history.

The C-Band All-Sky Survey: total intensity point-source detection over the northern sky	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; surveys; methods: data analysis; cosmic background radiation; radio continuum: general; cosmology: observations	NRAO PMN SURVEYS; MEXICAN HAT WAVELET; RADIO-SOURCES; SOURCE CATALOG; NON-GAUSSIANITY; SOURCE COUNTS; COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION; DEEP FIELD; 15 GHZ; POLARIZATION	We present a point-source detection algorithm that employs the second-order Spherical Mexican Hat wavelet filter (SMHW2), and use it on C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS) northern intensity data to produce a catalogue of point sources. This catalogue allows us to cross-check the C-BASS flux-density scale against existing source surveys, and provides the basis for a source mask that will be used in subsequent C-BASS and cosmic microwave background (CMB) analyses. The SMHW2 allows us to filter the entire sky at once, avoiding complications from edge effects arising when filtering small sky patches. The algorithm is validated against a set of Monte Carlo simulations, consisting of diffuse emission, instrumental noise, and various point-source populations. The simulated source populations are successfully recovered. The SMHW2 detection algorithm is used to produce a 4.76 GHz northern sky source catalogue in total intensity, containing 1784 sources and covering declinations delta >= -10 degrees. The C-BASS catalogue is matched with the Green Bank 6 cm (GB6) and Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) catalogues over their areas of common sky coverage. From this we estimate the 90 per cent completeness level to be approximately 610 mJy, with a corresponding reliability of 98 per cent, when masking the brightest 30 per cent of the diffuse emission in the C-BASS northern sky map. We find the C-BASS and GB6 flux-density scales to be consistent with one another to within approximately 4 per cent.	[Grumitt, R. D.

Three-dimensional models of core-collapse supernovae from low-mass progenitors with implications for Crab	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						hydrodynamics; neutrinos; stars massive; stars: neutron; supernovae: general; supernovae: individual: Crab	EQUATION-OF-STATE; ELECTRON-CAPTURE SUPERNOVAE; NEUTRINO-DRIVEN EXPLOSIONS; ACCRETION SHOCK; SIMULATIONS; EVOLUTION; INSTABILITIES; NUCLEOSYNTHESIS; TRANSPORT; NEBULA	We present 3D full-sphere supernova simulations of non-rotating low-mass (similar to 9 M-circle dot) progenitors, covering the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce and shock revival, through shock breakout from the stellar surface, until fallback is completed several days later. We obtain low-energy explosions (similar to 0.5-1.0 x 10(50) erg) of iron-core progenitors at the low-mass end of the core-collapse supernova (LMCCSN) domain and compare to a super-AGB (sAGB) progenitor with an oxygen-neon-magnesium core that collapses and explodes as electron-capture supernova (ECSN). The onset of the explosion in the LMCCSN models is modelled self-consistently using the VERTEX-PROMETHEUS code, whereas the ECSN explosion is modelled using parametric neutrino transport in the PRomETHEus-HOTB code, choosing different explosion energies in the range of previous self-consistent models. The sAGB and LMCCSN progenitors that share structural similarities have almost spherical explosions with little metal mixing into the hydrogen envelope. A LMCCSN with less second dredge-up results in a highly asymmetric explosion. It shows efficient mixing and dramatic shock deceleration in the extended hydrogen envelope. Both properties allow fast nickel plumes to catch up with the shock, leading to extreme shock deformation and aspherical shock breakout. Fallback masses of less than or similar to 5 x 10(-3) M-circle dot have no significant effects on the neutron star (NS) masses and kicks. The anisotropic fallback carries considerable angular momentum, however, and determines the spin of the newly born NS. The LMCCSN model with less second dredge-up results in a hydrodynamic and neutrino-induced NS kick of >40 km s(-1) and a NS spin period of similar to 30 ms, both not largely different from those of the Crab pulsar at birth.

J	Hopkins, PF; Squire, J; Seligman, D				Hopkins, Philip F.; Squire, Jonathan; Seligman, Darryl			Simulating diverse instabilities of dust in magnetized gas	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; instabilities; turbulence; planets and satellites: formation; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: formation	RESONANT DRAG INSTABILITY; PREFERENTIAL CONCENTRATION; PASSIVE-SCALAR; STREAMING INSTABILITY; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; NONLINEAR EVOLUTION; INTERSTELLAR DUST; SOLID PARTICLES; SCALING LAWS; DIFFUSION	Recently, Squire & Hopkins showed that charged dust grains moving through magnetized gas under the influence of a uniform external force (such as radiation pressure or gravity) are subject to a spectrum of instabilities. Qualitatively distinct instability families are associated with different Alfven or magnetosonic waves and drift or gyro motion. We present a suite of simulations exploring these instabilities, for grains in a homogeneous medium subject to an external acceleration. We vary parameters such as the ratio of Lorentz-to-drag forces on dust, plasma beta, size scale, and acceleration. All regimes studied drive turbulent motions and dust-to-gas fluctuations in the saturated state, rapidly amplify magnetic fields into equipartition with velocity fluctuations, and produce instabilities that persist indefinitely (despite random grain motions). Different parameters produce diverse morphologies and qualitatively different features in dust, but the saturated gas state can be broadly characterized as anisotropic magnetosonic or Alfvenic turbulence. Quasi-linear theory can qualitatively predict the gas turbulent properties. Turbulence grows from small to large scales, and larger scale modes usually drive more vigorous gas turbulence, but dust velocity and density fluctuations are more complicated. In many regimes, dust forms structures (clumps, filaments, sheets) that reach extreme overdensities (up to >> 10(9) times mean), and exhibit substantial substructure even in nearly incompressible gas. These can be even more prominent at lower dust-to-gas ratios. In other regimes, dust self-excites scattering via magnetic fluctuations that isotropize and amplify dust velocities, producing fast, diffusive dust motions.

The most intense geomagnetic storm (SYM-H peak = -146 nT) starting on September 7 had a three-step main phase. A compound interplanetary structure resulting from an FS encountering and compressing the upstream MC southward interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) caused the first two steps of the storm. A magnetospheric supersubstorm (SSS; SML peak = -3712 nT) led to the third and most intense step. An MC portion of an ICME created an intense storm (SYM-H peak = -115 nT) on September 8. A second SSS (SML peak = -2642 nT) occurred during the main phase of this storm. Intense geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) occurred during the SSSs. Two moderate magnetic storms with peak SYM-H indices of -65 and -74 nT occurring on September 13 and 27 were caused by sheath and CIR southward IMFs, respectively. Six FSs and their associated sheaths caused sudden impulses (SI(+)s) of magnitude ranging from +11 to +56 nT. The shocks/sheaths led to magnetospheric relativistic electron flux decreases. The RWs caused SI(-)s and substorm recoveries by reducing southward IMFs. The high-intensity long-duration continuous AE activities (HILDCAAs) caused by the HSSs were related to the increase/acceleration of relativistic electron fluxes.

We detect [C II] emission from 80% of the total positions, with a 95% detection rate from the dense boundary region. The integrated intensity of the [C II] emission remains relatively constant across each boundary, despite the observed range in optical extinction between 1 and 10 mag. This flat profile indicates a constant heating and cooling rate within both regions observed. The integrated intensity of [C II] emission is reasonably well correlated with the neutral hydrogen (H I) column density, as well as the total gas column density. This, in addition to the 80' (7 pc) extent of the [C II] emission from the cloud center, suggests that the H I envelope plays a dominant role in explaining the [C II] emission emanating from Perseus. We compare the [C II] and (CO)-C-12 integrated intensities with predictions from a 1D, two-sided slab PDR model and show that a simple core + envelope, equilibrium model without an additional "CO-dark" H-2 component can reproduce observations well. Additional observations are needed to disentangle how much of the [C II] emission is associated with the "CO-dark" H-2 gas, as well as constrain spatial variations of the dust-to-gas ratio across Perseus.

FIREBall observes a component of galaxies that plays a key role in how galaxies form and evolve, likely contains a significant amount of baryons, and has only recently been observed at higher redshifts in the visible. Here we report on the 2018 flight of the FIREBall-2 Balloon telescope, which occurred on 2018 September 22 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The flight was the culmination of a complete redesign of the spectrograph from the original FIREBall fiber-fed integral field unit to a wide-field multiobject spectrograph. The flight was terminated early owing to a hole in the balloon, and our original science objectives were not achieved. The overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 LU, due primarily to increased noise from stray light. We discuss the design of the FIREBall-2 spectrograph, including modifications from the original FIREBall payload, and provide an overview of the performance of all systems. We were able to successfully flight-test a new pointing control system, a UV-optimized, delta-doped, and coated electron multiplying CCD, and an aspheric grating. The FIREBall-2 team is rebuilding the payload for another flight attempt in the fall of 2021, delayed from 2020 as a result of COVID-19.

SN 2019ehk shows a double-peaked optical light curve peaking at t = 3 and 15 days. The first peak is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying Swift-XRT-discovered X-ray emission (L-x approximate to 10(41) erg s(-1) at 3 days; L-x proportional to t(-3)), and a Shane/Kast spectral detection of narrow Ha and He II emission lines (nu approximate to 500 km s(-1)) originating from pre-existent circumstellar material (CSM). We attribute this phenomenology to radiation from shock interaction with extended, dense material surrounding the progenitor star at r < 10(15) cm and the resulting cooling emission. We calculate a total CSM mass of similar to 7 x 10(-3) M-circle dot (M-He/M-H approximate to 6) with particle density n approximate to 10(9) cm(-3). Radio observations indicate a significantly lower density n < 10(4) cm(-3) at larger radii r > (0.1-1) x 10(17) cm. The photometric and spectroscopic properties during the second light-curve peak are consistent with those of Ca-rich transients (rise-time of t(r) = 13.4 +/- 0.210 days and a peak B-band magnitude of M-B = -15.1 +/- 0.200 mag). We find that SN 2019ehk synthesized (3.1 +/- 0.11) x 10(-2) M-circle dot of Ni-56 and ejected M-ej = (0.72 +/- 0.040) M-circle dot total with a kinetic energy E-k = (1.8 +/- 0.10) x 10(50) erg. Finally, deep HST pre-explosion imaging at the SN site constrains the parameter space of viable stellar progenitors to massive stars in the lowest mass bin (similar to 10 M-circle dot) in binaries that lost most of their He envelope or white dwarfs (WDs). The explosion and environment properties of SN 2019ehk further restrict the potential WD progenitor systems to low-mass hybrid HeCO WD+CO WD binaries.

Caenorhabditis elegans AF4/FMR2 Family Homolog affl-2 Regulates Heat-Shock-Induced Gene Expression	GENETICS			English	Article						affl-1; affl-2; heat shock response; C. elegans; AF4/FMR2	RNA-POLYMERASE-II; COMPLEX SEC FAMILY; ELONGATION COMPLEX; P-TEFB; TRANSCRIPTION ELONGATION; NUCLEAR-LOCALIZATION; TARGET SPECIFICITY; EWING SARCOMA; WEB SERVER; PROTEIN	To mitigate the deleterious effects of temperature increases on cellular organization and proteotoxicity, organisms have developed mechanisms to respond to heat stress. In eukaryotes, HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock transcriptional response, but the heat shock response pathway is not yet fully understood. From a forward genetic screen for suppressors of heatshock-induced gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found a new allele of hsf-1 that alters its DNA-binding domain, and we found three additional alleles of sup-45, a previously molecularly uncharacterized genetic locus. We identified sup-45 as one of the two hitherto unknown C. elegans orthologs of the human AF4/FMR2 family proteins, which are involved in regulation of transcriptional elongation rate. We thus renamed sup-45 as affl-2 (AF4/FMR2-Like). Through RNA-seq, we demonstrated that affl-2 mutants are deficient in heat-shock-induced transcription. Additionally, affl-2 mutants have herniated intestines, while worms lacking its sole paralog (affl-1) appear wild type. AFFL-2 is a broadly expressed nuclear protein, and nuclear localization of AFFL-2 is necessary for its role in heat shock response. affl-2 and its paralog are not essential for proper HSF-1 expression and localization after heat shock, which suggests that affl-2 may function downstream of, or parallel to, hsf-1. Our characterization of affl-2 provides insights into the regulation of heat-shock-induced gene expression to protect against heat stress.

Metabolic multistability and hysteresis in a model aerobe-anaerobe microbiome community	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							POSITIVE FEEDBACK; GUT MICROBIOTA; STABILITY; RESPONSES; STATES	Major changes in the microbiome are associated with health and disease. Some microbiome states persist despite seemingly unfavorable conditions, such as the proliferation of aerobe-anaerobe communities in oxygen-exposed environments in wound infections or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Mechanisms underlying transitions into and persistence of these states remain unclear. Using two microbial taxa relevant to the human microbiome, we combine genome-scale mathematical modeling, bioreactor experiments, transcriptomics, and dynamical systems theory to show that multistability and hysteresis (MSH) is a mechanism describing the shift from an aerobedominated state to a resilient, paradoxically persistent aerobe-anaerobe state. We examine the impact of changing oxygen and nutrient regimes and identify changes in metabolism and gene expression that lead to MSH and associated multi-stable states. In such systems, conceptual causation-correlation connections break and MSH must be used for analysis. Using MSH to analyze microbiome dynamics will improve our conceptual understanding of stability of microbiome states and transitions between states.

Using the fast impact of anthropogenic aerosols on regional land temperature to constrain aerosol forcing	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							GFDL GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE; OCEAN HEAT UPTAKE; STRATIFORM CLOUDS; PART I; CLIMATE; CIRCULATION; PARAMETERIZATION; SCHEME; SENSITIVITY; CONVECTION	Anthropogenic aerosols have been postulated to have a cooling effect on climate, but its magnitude remains uncertain. Using atmospheric general circulation model simulations, we separate the land temperature response into a fast response to radiative forcings and a slow response to changing oceanic conditions and find that the former accounts for about one fifth of the observed warming of the Northern Hemisphere land during summer and autumn since the 1960s. While small, this fast response can be constrained by observations. Spatially varying aerosol effects can be detected on the regional scale, specifically warming over Europe and cooling over Asia. These results provide empirical evidence for the important role of aerosols in setting regional land temperature trends and point to an emergent constraint that suggests strong global aerosol forcing and high transient climate response.

We build a catalog of 88 eclipsing binaries with spectroscopic information, taking advantage of observations from both the Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope and the Palomar Transient Factory surveys. A software pipeline is constructed to identify binary candidates by examining their light curves. The orbital periods of binaries are derived from the Lomb-Scargle method. The key distinguishing features of eclipsing binaries are recognized by a new filter,Flat Test. We classify the eclipsing binaries by applying a Fourier analysis on the light curves. Among all the binary stars, 13 binaries are identified as eclipsing binaries for the first time. The catalog contains the following information: the position, primary eclipsing magnitude and time, eclipsing depth, the number of photometry and radial velocity observations, largest radial velocity difference, binary type, the effective temperature of the observable starT(eff), and surface gravity of the observable star logg. The false-positive probability is calculated by using both a Monte Carlo simulation and real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 Standard Catalog. The binaries in the catalog are mostly with a period of less than one day. The period distribution shows a 0.22 day cutoff, which is consistent with the low probability of an eclipsing binary rotating with such a period.

The combined data set used in this work includes data from the Low-Frequency Array Two-meter Sky Survey, NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. We find that there are five radio sources, which are all located within 500 kpc (similar to 1 ') of the cluster center and have radio luminositiesP(1.4 GHz) > 1.6 x 10(24)W Hz(-1). The typical host galaxies are among the highest stellar mass galaxies in the cluster. The exceptional radio activity among the massive galaxy population appears to be linked to the dynamical state of the cluster. The galaxy distribution suggests an ongoing merger, with a subgroup found to the northwest of the main cluster. Furthermore, two of the five sources are classified as bent-tail sources, with one being a potential wide-angle tail/hybrid morphology radio source, indicating a dynamic environment. The cluster also lies in a region of the mass-richness plane occupied by other merging clusters in the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. The data suggest that during the merger phase, radio activity can be dramatically enhanced, which would contribute to the observed trend of increased radio activity in clusters with increasing redshift.

This letter proposes and evaluates a multi-level cache-enabled network, where cache-hit users can fetch their data from the available cache at either small base-stations, unmanned aerial vehicles, or cache-enabled mobile device-to-device users. Cache-miss users, on the other hand, fetch their data from the central cloud via limited capacity backhaul links. This letter considers the problem of maximizing the network weighted-sum rate by jointly determining the users' mode of operation and their transmit powers, subject to backhaul capacity and transmit power constraints. After showing how the association problem can be formulated as a generalized assignment problem, the letter solves the transmit power problem using an iterative function evaluation apprach. The resulting mode-selection and power-allocation (MSPA) iterative algorithm is then tested through numerical simulations, which suggest that, while being easily implementable, the proposed multi-level caching can substantially relieve the backhaul congestion, especially in dense-networks, and at low-backhaul capacity regimes.

Here, we present the detection and mass measurement of a small, short-period (4 days) transiting planet around the bright (V = 7.9), solar-type star HD 86226 (TOI-652, TIC 22221375), previously known to host a long-period (similar to 1600 days) giant planet. HD 86226c (TOI-652.01) has a radius of 2.16 0.08 R-circle plus and a mass of M-circle plus, based on archival and new radial velocity data. We also update the parameters of the longer-period, not-known-to-transit planet, and find it to be less eccentric and less massive than previously reported. The density of the transiting planet is 3.97 g cm(-3), which is low enough to suggest that the planet has at least a small volatile envelope, but the mass fractions of rock, iron, and water are not well-constrained. Given the host star brightness, planet period, and location of the planet near both the "radius gap" and the "hot Neptune desert," HD 86226c is an interesting candidate for transmission spectroscopy to further refine its composition.

Rotation of Two Micron All Sky Survey Clumps in Molecular Clouds	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Interstellar medium; Interstellar dynamics; Interstellar molecules; Intercloud medium; Interstellar emissions	DARK CLOUDS; DENSE CORES; ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; STAR-FORMATION; FRAGMENTATION; EVOLUTION; COLLAPSE; CO; ABSORPTION; KINEMATICS	We have analyzed the rotational properties of 12 clumps using (CO)-C-13 (1-0) and (CO)-O-18 (1-0) maps of the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 13.7 m radio telescope. The clumps, located within molecular clouds, have radii (R) in the range of 0.06-0.27 pc. The direction of clump elongation is not correlated with the direction of the velocity gradient. We measured the specific angular momentum (J/M) to be between 0.0022-0.025 pc km s(-1)based on (CO)-C-13 images, and between 0.0025-0.021 pc km s(-1)based on (CO)-O-18 images. The consistency ofJ/Mbased on different tracers indicates the(13)CO and (CO)-O-18 in dense clumps trace essentially the same material despite significantly different opacities. We also found thatJ/Mincreases monotonically as a function ofRin power-law form,<J/M proportional to R-1.58 +/- 0.11. The ratio between rotation energy and gravitational energy,beta, ranges from 0.0012 to 0.018. The small values of beta imply that rotation alone is not sufficient to support the clump against gravitational collapse.

Evidence of Runaway Gas Cooling in the Absence of Supermassive Black Hole Feedback at the Epoch of Cluster Formation	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						High-redshift galaxy clusters; Supermassive black holes; Cooling flows; Intracluster medium; X-ray observatories	RELAXED GALAXY CLUSTERS; X-RAY CAVITIES; INTRACLUSTER LIGHT; STAR-FORMATION; AGN FEEDBACK; SPECTROSCOPIC CONFIRMATION; CHANDRA; SAMPLE; ACCRETION; EMISSION	Cosmological simulations, as well as mounting evidence from observations, have shown that supermassive black holes play a fundamental role in regulating the formation of stars throughout cosmic time. This has been clearly demonstrated in the case of galaxy clusters in which powerful feedback from the central black hole is preventing the hot intracluster gas from cooling catastrophically, thus reducing the expected star formation rates by orders of magnitude. These conclusions, however, have been almost entirely based on nearby clusters. Based on new Chandra X-ray observations, we present the first observational evidence for massive, runaway cooling occurring in the absence of supermassive black hole feedback in the high-redshift galaxy cluster SpARCS104922.6 + 564032.5 (z = 1.709). The hot intracluster gas appears to be fueling a massive burst of star formation (900Myr(-1)) that is offset by dozens of kpc from the central galaxy. The burst is co-spatial with the coolest intracluster gas but not associated with any galaxy in the cluster. In less than 100 million years, such runaway cooling can form the same amount of stars as in the Milky Way. Therefore, intracluster stars are not only produced by tidal stripping and the disruption of cluster galaxies, but can also be produced by runaway cooling of hot intracluster gas at early times. Overall, these observations show the dramatic impact when supermassive black hole feedback fails to operate in clusters. They indicate that in the highest overdensities, such as clusters and protoclusters, runaway cooling may be a new and important mechanism for fueling massive bursts of star formation in the early universe.

We present > 650 field-based, surface-displacement observations for these ruptures and synthesize our results into cumulative along-strike displacement distributions. Using these data, we calculate displacement gradients and compare our results with historical strike-slip ruptures in the eastern California shear zone. For the M-w 6.4 rupture, we report 96 displacements measured along 18 km of northeast-striking rupture. Cumulative displacement curves for the rupture yield a mean left-lateral displacement of 0.3-0.5 m and maximum of 0.7-1.6 m. Net mean vertical displacement based on the difference of down-to-the-west (DTW) and down-to-the-east (DTE) displacement curves is close to zero (0.02 m DTW). The M-w 6.4 displacement distribution shows that the majority of displacement occurred southwest of the intersection with the M-w 7.1 rupture. The M-w 7.1 rupture is northwest-striking and 50 km long based on 576 field measurements. Displacement curves indicate a mean right-lateral displacement of 1.2-1.7 m and a maximum of 4.3-7.0 m. Net vertical displacement in the rupture averages 0.3 m DTW. The M-w 7.1 displacement distributions demonstrate that maximum displacement occurred along a 12-km-long portion of the fault near the M-w 7.1 epicenter, releasing 66% of the geologically based seismic moment along 24% of the total rupture length. Using our displacement distributions, we calculate kilometer-scale displacement gradients for the M-w 7.1 rupture. The steepest gradients (similar to 1-3 m/km) flank the 12-km-long region of maximum displacement. In contrast, gradients for the 1992 M-w 7.3 Landers and 1999 M-w 7.1 Hector Mine earthquakes are <0.6 m/km. Our displacement distributions are important for understanding the influence of cross-fault rupture on M-w 6.4 and 7.1 rupture length and displacement and will facilitate comparisons with distributions generated remotely and at broader scales.

Seismicity, Stress State, and Style of Faulting of the Ridgecrest-Coso Region from the 1930s to 2019: Seismotectonics of an Evolving Plate Boundary Segment	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; FOCAL MECHANISMS; FIELD; CATALOG; NEVADA; VALLEY; RANGE; CRUST	Decadal scale variations in the seismicity rate in the Ridgecrest-Coso region, part of the Eastern California Shear Zone, included seismic quiescence from the 1930s to the early 1980s, followed by increased seismicity until the 2019 M-w 6.4 and 7.1 Ridgecrest sequence. This sequence exhibited complex rupture on almost orthogonal faults and triggered aftershocks over an area of similar to 90 km long by similar to 5-10 km wide, which is a fraction of the area of the previously seismically active Indian Wells Valley and Coso range region. During the last 40 yr, the seismicity has been predominantly the result of strike-slip motion, extending north from the Garlock fault, along the Little Lake and Airport Lake fault zones, and approaching the southernmost Owens Valley fault to the north. The Coso range forms an extensional stepover between these two strike-slip fault systems. This evolution of a plate boundary zone is driven by the northwestward motion of the Sierra Nevada, and crustal extension along the southwestern edge of the Basin and Range Province. Stress inversion of focal mechanisms shows that the postseismic stress state consists of almost horizontal sigma(1) and vertical sigma(2). The sigma(1) is spatially rotated across the Coso range stepover with sigma(1)-trending similar to N17 degrees E to the north, whereas, along the M-w 7.1 mainshock rupture, the trend is similar to N6 degrees E. The friction angles as measured between fault strikes and the a l trends correspond to a frictional coefficient of 0.75, suggesting average fault strength. In comparison, the mature Garlock fault has a smaller frictional coefficient of 0.28, similar to weak faults like the San Andreas fault. Thus, it appears that the heterogeneously oriented and spatially distributed but strong Ridgecrest-Coso faults accommodate seismicity at seemingly random places and times within the region and are in the process of self-organizing to form a major throughgoing plate-boundary segment.

We consider the extent to which a damage proxy map (DPM) generated from satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar images can detect minor damage throughout the town of Ridgecrest. The DPM does not, as expected, detect all minor structural damage to individual structures, nor can it distinguish between structural damage and earthquake-related movement that is not consequential. However, the DPM does confirm many instances of minor structural damage to larger structures and groups of smaller structures and in some instances suggests minor structural damage that is not apparent upon visual inspection. Although ambiguous identification of minor damage may not be useful to guide earthquake response, the identification of minor, possibly hidden damage is potentially useful for other purposes. Overall, the DPM confirms that structural damage was commensurate with modified Mercalli intensity no higher than 7 throughout Ridgecrest. We consider both instrumental and intensity data to explore further the distribution of near-field ground motions over the frequency range of engineering concern. Peak ground accelerations and peak ground velocities estimated from "Did You Feel It?" intensity data using the Worden et al. (2012) ground-motion intensity conversion equation (GMICE) are consistent with recorded instrumental data. Both instrumental and estimated mainshock peak accelerations are further consistent with predictions from both the Boore et al. (2014) ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE), but lower than predicted by the Atkinson and Wald (2007) and Atkinson et al. (2014) intensity prediction equations (IPEs). A GMPE such as Boore et al. which is constrained by a large global dataset, together with a well- constrained GMICE, may thus characterize expected shaking intensities for large earthquakes better than an IPE based on more limited intensity data.

These representations are based on relocated hypocenter catalogs expanded by template matching and focal mechanisms for M 4 and larger events. Following the approach of Riesner et al. (2017), we generate reproducible 3D fault geometries by integrating hypocenter, nodal plane, and surface rupture trace constraints. We used the southwest-northeast-striking nodal plane of the 4 July 2019 M 6.4 event to constrain the initial representation of the southern Little Lake fault (SLLF), both in terms of location and orientation. The eastern Little Lake fault (ELLF) was constrained by the 5 July 2019 M 7.1 hypocenter and nodal planes of M 4 and larger aftershocks aligned with the main trend of the fault. The approach follows a defined workflow that assigns weights to a variety of geometric constraints. These main constraints have a high weight relative to that of individual hypocenters, ensuring that small aftershocks are applied as weaker constraints. The resulting fault planes can be considered averages of the hypocentral locations respecting nodal plane orientations. For the final representation we added detailed, fieldmapped rupture traces as strong constraints. The resulting fault representations are generally smooth but nonplanar and dip steeply. The SLLF and ELLF intersect at nearly right angles and cross on another. The ELLF representation is truncated at the Airport Lake fault to the north and the Garlock fault to the south, consistent with the aftershock pattern. The terminations of the SLLF representation are controlled by aftershock distribution. These new 3D fault representations are available as triangulated surface representations, and are being added to a Community Fault Model (CFM; Plesch et al., 2017, 2019; Nicholoson et al., 2019) for wider use and to derived products such as a CFM trace map and viewer (Su et al., 2019).

In 2018, we began retrospective and internal real-time testing of the propagation of local undamped motion (PLUM) method for earthquake warning in California, Oregon, and Washington, with the potential that PLUM might one day be included in the ShakeAlert EEW system. A real-time version of PLUM was running on one of the ShakeAlert EEW system's development servers at the time of the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence, allowing us to evaluate the timeliness and accuracy of PLUM's warnings for the M 6.4 and 7.1 mainshocks in real time with the actual data availability and latencies of the operational ShakeAlert EEW system. The latter is especially important because high-data latencies during the M 7.1 earthquake degraded ShakeAlert's performance. PLUM proved to be largely immune to these latencies. In this article, we present a retrospective analysis of PLUM performance and explore three potential regional alerting strategies ranging from spatially large regions (counties), to moderate-size regions (National Weather Service public forecast zones), to high-spatial specificity (50 km regular geographic grid). PLUM generated initial shaking forecasts for the two mainshocks 5 and 6 s after their respective origin times, and faster than the ShakeAlert system's first alerts. PLUM was also able to accurately forecast shaking across southern California for all three alerting strategies studied. As would be expected, a cost-benefit analysis of each approach illustrates trade-offs between increasing warning time and minimizing the area receiving unneeded alerts. Choosing an optimal alerting strategy requires knowledge of users' false alarm tolerance and minimum required warning time for taking protective action, as well as the time required to distribute alerts to users.

ShakeAlert Earthquake Early Warning System Performance during the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							MOTION PREDICTION EQUATIONS; RUPTURE DETECTOR FINDER; REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE; PARAMETERS; CALIFORNIA; MAGNITUDE; ALGORITHM	During July 2019, a sequence of earthquakes, including an M-w 6.4 foreshock and an M-w 7.1 mainshock, occurred near Ridgecrest, California. ShakeAlert, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake early warning system being developed for the U.S. West Coast, was operational during this time, although public alerting was only available within Los Angeles County. ShakeAlert created alert messages for the two largest events and for many of the larger aftershocks. In this study, we dissect log files and replay data through the system to reconstruct the sequence of events and analyze the performance of the system during that period. Although the system performed reasonably well overall, the sequence also revealed various issues and short comings that will be addressed in impending and future system upgrades. ShakeAlert detected and characterized both the M-w 6.4 and M-w 7.1 earthquakes within 6.9 s of their origin times and created alert messages that were available to ShakeAlert's pilot users. No public alerts were sent out by the ShakeAlertLA cell phone app (the only publicly available alerting method at the time), because the predicted shaking for Los Angeles County was below the app's alerting threshold of modified Mercalli intensity 4.0. For the M-w 6.4 event, this was accurate. For the M-w 7.1 event, public alerts for Los Angeles County were warranted, but ShakeAlert underpredicted the shaking levels, because both the point-source and finite-fault algorithms underestimated the magnitude of the earthquake by 0.8 units. A number of software and hardware issues that were responsible for the magnitude underestimation of the mainshock have been identified and will be addressed in future ShakeAlert releases. We also analyze the hypothetical alerting performance of ShakeAlert had public alerting been available throughout southern California.

Geophysical information in the Valley is also sparse. In addition, the absence of an open database which compiles in situ geophysical tests, borehole records, and geotechnical laboratory data is affecting the advancement of knowledge in the region.

Impact-driven mobilization of deep crustal brines on dwarf planet Ceres	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							EVOLUTION; GRAVITY; MODEL; CRATER; STATE; SHAPE; ICE	Ceres, the only dwarf planet in the inner Solar System, appears to be a relict ocean world. Data collected by NASA's Dawn spacecraft provided evidence that global aqueous alteration within Ceres resulted in a chemically evolved body that remains volatile-rich(1). Recent emplacement of bright deposits sourced from brines attests to Ceres being a persistently geologically active world(2,3), but the surprising longevity of this activity at the 92-km Occator crater has yet to be explained. Here, we use new high-resolution Dawn gravity data to study the subsurface architecture of the region surrounding Occator crater, which hosts extensive young bright carbonate deposits (faculae). Gravity data and thermal modelling imply an extensive deep brine reservoir beneath Occator, which we argue could have been mobilized by the heating and deep fracturing associated with the Occator impact, leading to long-lived extrusion of brines and formation of the faculae. Moreover, we find that pre-existing tectonic cracks may provide pathways for deep brines to migrate within the crust, extending the regions affected by impacts and creating compositional heterogeneity. The long-lived hydrological system resulting from the impact might also occur for large impacts in icy moons, with implications for creation of transient habitable niches over time. High-resolution data of Ceres's bright spots (faculae), obtained by Dawn's second extended mission, suggest the existence of a deep brine-rich reservoir that emerged to the surface through long-lived cryovolcanic activity as a consequence of the impact that created Occator crater.

Evidence of non-uniform crust of Ceres from Dawn's high-resolution gravity data	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; GROUND ICE; EVOLUTION; SHAPE; INSIGHTS; MOON	High-resolution gravity data from Dawn's second extended mission could probe the global and local structure of Ceres's crust. The results show significant spatial and vertical variations of crustal density and porosity, associated with ice features and ice-related processes driven from the interior, and impacts. The gravity and shape data acquired by the Dawn spacecraft during its primary mission revealed that Ceres is partially differentiated with an interior structure consistent with a volatile-rich crust, a mantle of hydrated rock and isostatically compensated topography(1-3). Detailed analyses showed that the mechanically strong crust overlays a weak, fluid-bearing upper mantle(4). Previous studies, however, assumed that Ceres's crust is a uniform layer. Here, we report findings from the new high-resolution gravity data from Dawn's second extended mission (XM2), which reveal a complex crustal structure of Ceres. In the low-altitude regions probed by the Dawn spacecraft during the XM2 phase, we observe that gravity-topography admittance progressively shifts to a lower density solution at higher degrees, implying a radial density gradient across Ceres's crust that is consistent with decreasing porosity with depth and/or increasing content of dense phases, such as rock and salts. That gradient brings a critical new constraint on the crustal freezing history, suggesting that the salts and silicates concentrated in the liquid phase while the crust was growing. Localized spectral analysis of the new data also shows evidence for a lower crustal density in the north polar region than in the south or near the equator, supporting impact-driven porosity variations for the observed latitudinal density differences(5). On the local scale, the new data show evidence for density or rheological variations within the crust, in association with lobate landslides and ejecta deposits that were inferred to be ice-rich(6,7)as well as an extensional fault system(8). These inferences provide geophysical context for geological features on the surface and help us advance our understanding of the evolution of an ice-rich but heat-starved body, whose evolution was in part shaped by impacts.

Fresh emplacement of hydrated sodium chloride on Ceres from ascending salty fluids	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							WATER ICE; ORGANIC-MATTER; SURFACE; DEPOSITS; CRATER; PLUME	Spectroscopic data obtained at high spatial resolution from Dawn detected the presence of fresh chloride salts at Cerealia Facula on Ceres. The spatial distribution of the hydration level of these salts suggests that they surfaced a maximum of a few centuries ago and that the upwelling of salty fluids may still be active. The surface and internal structure of Ceres show evidence of a global process of aqueous alteration, indicating the existence of an ocean in the past. However, it is not clear whether part of this ocean is still present and whether residual fluids are still circulating in the dwarf planet. These fluids may be exposed in a geologically young surface, and the most promising site to verify the occurrence of present fluids on Ceres is Cerealia Facula dome, in Occator crater. This very young facula exhibits minerals that are relatively rare in our Solar System, the formation of which requires the presence of liquid water in combination with hydrothermal activity. Here we report the discovery of hydrated sodium chloride on Cerealia Facula. These newly identified chloride salts are concentrated on the top of the dome, close to a system of radial fractures. The spatial distribution of the hydrated phase suggests that chloride salts are the solid residue of deep brines that reached the surface only recently, or are still ascending. These salts are very efficient in maintaining Ceres's warm internal temperature and lowering the eutectic temperature of the brines, in which case ascending salty fluids may exist in Ceres today.

We present a simplified framework for developing a high spatial resolution map of urban vegetation cover in the Southern California Air Basin (SoCAB) with publicly available satellite imagery. This method uses Sentinel-2 (10-60 x 10-60 m) and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) (0.6 x 0.6 m) optical imagery to classify urban and non-urban areas of impervious surface, tree, grass, shrub, bare soil/non-photosynthetic vegetation, and water. Our approach was designed for Los Angeles, a geographically complex megacity characterized by diverse Mediterranean land cover and a mix of high-rise buildings and topographic features that produce strong shadow effects. We show that a combined NAIP and Sentinel-2 classification reduces misclassified shadow pixels and resolves spatially heterogeneous vegetation gradients across urban and non-urban regions in SoCAB at 0.6-10 m resolution with 85% overall accuracy and 88% weighted overall accuracy. Results from this study will enable the long-term monitoring of land cover change associated with urbanization and quantification of biospheric contributions to carbon and water cycling in cities.

Motivated by this problem, we introduce counting temporal logics-formal languages that enable concise expression of multirobot task specifications over possibly infinite horizons in this article. We first introduce a general logic called counting linear temporal logic plus (cLTL+), and propose an optimization-based method that generates individual trajectories such that satisfaction of a given cLTL+ formula is guaranteed when these trajectories are synchronously executed. We then introduce a fragment of cLTL+, called counting linear temporal logic (cLTL), and show that a solution to a planning problem with cLTL constraints can be obtained more efficiently if all robots have identical dynamics. In the second part of this article, we relax the synchrony assumption and discuss how to generate trajectories that can be asynchronously executed, while preserving the satisfaction of the desired cLTL+ specification. In particular, we show that when the asynchrony between robots is bounded, the method presented in this article can be modified to generate robust trajectories. We demonstrate these ideas with an experiment and provide numerical results that showcase the scalability of the method.

We explained the MIR flare using a dust echo model in which the radiative transfer is involved. The MIR flare can be well explained as thermal reradiation from dust heated by UV-optical photons of a primary nuclear transient event. Although the transient event was not seen directly owing to dust obscuration, we can infer that it may produce a total energy of at least similar to 10(51)erg, most of which was released in less than similar to 3 yr. The nature of the transient event could be a stellar tidal disruption event by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), or a sudden enhancement of the existing accretion flow onto the SMBH, or a supernova that was particularly bright.

J	Peng, SR; Batygin, K				Peng, Shirui; Batygin, Konstantin			Interactions among Noninteracting Particles in Planet Formation Simulations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Planet formation; Solar system formation; N-body simulations; Dynamical friction	INTEGRATOR	Over the course of recent decades,N-body simulations have become a standard tool for quantifying the gravitational perturbations that ensue in planet-forming disks. Within the context of such simulations, massive non-central bodies are routinely classified into "big" and "small" particles, where big objects interact with all other objects self-consistently, while small bodies interact with big bodies but not with each other. Importantly, this grouping translates to an approximation scheme where the orbital evolution of small bodies is dictated entirely by the dynamics of the big bodies, yielding considerable computational advantages with little added cost in terms of astrophysical accuracy. Here we point out, however, that this scheme can also yield spurious dynamical behavior where, even in the absence of big bodies within a simulation, indirect coupling among small bodies can lead to excitation of the constituent "non-interacting" orbits. We demonstrate this self-stirring by carrying out a sequence of numerical experiments, and confirm that this effect is largely independent of the time-step or the integration algorithm employed. Furthermore, adopting the growth of angular momentum deficit as a proxy for dynamical excitation, we explore its dependence on time, the cumulative mass of the system, as well as the total number of particles present in the simulation. Finally, we examine the degree of such indirect excitation within the context of conventional terrestrial planet formation calculations, and conclude that although some level of caution may be warranted, this effect plays a negligible role in driving the simulated dynamical evolution.

The measured secondary eclipse depth and peak-to-peak atmospheric brightness modulation are<CDATA<iand 566 16 ppm, respectively. The planet's brightness variation reaches maximum 31 5 minutes before the midpoint of the secondary eclipse, indicating a 52 09 eastward shift in the dayside hot spot from the substellar point. We also detect stellar pulsations on KELT-9 with a period of 7.58695 0.00091 hr. The dayside emission of KELT-9b in the TESS bandpass is consistent with a blackbody brightness temperature of 4600 100 K. The corresponding nightside brightness temperature is 3040 100 K, comparable to the dayside temperatures of the hottest known exoplanets. In addition, we detect a significant phase-curve signal at the first harmonic of the orbital frequency and a marginal signal at the second harmonic. While the amplitude of the first harmonic component is consistent with the predicted ellipsoidal distortion modulation assuming equilibrium tides, the phase of this photometric variation is shifted relative to the expectation. Placing KELT-9b in the context of other exoplanets with phase-curve observations, we find that the elevated nightside temperature and relatively low day-night temperature contrast agree with the predictions of atmospheric models that include H(2)dissociation and recombination. The nightside temperature of KELT-9b implies an atmospheric composition containing about 50% molecular and 50% atomic hydrogen at 0.1 bar, a nightside emission spectrum that deviates significantly from a blackbody, and a 0.5-2.0 mu m transmission spectrum that is featureless at low resolution.

Comparable Planet Occurrence in the FGK Samples of Campaign 5 and Kepler	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet catalogs; Dwarf stars	SYSTEMS; MULTIPLICITY; METALLICITY; VALLEY; MASS	Using our K2 Campaign 5 fully automated planet-detection data set (43 planets), which has corresponding measures of completeness and reliability, we infer an underlying planet population model for the FGK dwarf sample (9257 stars). Implementing a broken power law for both the period and radius distributions, we find an overall planet occurrence of 1.00(-0.51)(+1.07) planets per star within a period range of 0.5-38 days. Making similar cuts and running a comparable analysis on the Kepler sample (2318 planets; 94,222 stars), we find an overall occurrence of 1.10 +/- 0.05 planets per star. Since the Campaign 5 field is nearly 120 angular degrees away from the Kepler field, this occurrence similarity offers evidence that the Kepler sample may provide a good baseline for Galactic inferences. Furthermore, the Kepler stellar sample is metal-rich compared to the K2 Campaign 5 sample, so a finding of occurrence parity may reduce the role of metallicity in planet formation. However, a weak (1.5 sigma) difference, in agreement with metal-driven formation, is found when assuming the Kepler model power laws for the K2 Campaign 5 sample and optimizing only the planet occurrence factor. This weak trend indicates that further investigation of metallicity-dependent occurrence is warranted once a larger sample of uniformly vetted K2 planet candidates is made available.

The volatile chemistry in the disk is expected to evolve over time, though this evolution is poorly constrained observationally. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of (CO)-O-18, C2H, and the isotopologues (HCN)-C-13, (HCN)-N-15, and DCN toward five Class 0/I disk candidates. Combined with a sample of 14 Class II disks presented in Bergner et al., this data set offers a view of volatile chemical evolution over the disk lifetime. Our estimates of (CO)-O-18 abundances are consistent with a rapid depletion of CO in the first similar to 0.5-1 Myr of the disk lifetime. We do not see evidence that C2H and HCN formation are enhanced by CO depletion, possibly because the gas is already quite under-abundant in CO. Further CO depletion may actually hinder their production by limiting the gas-phase carbon supply. The embedded sources show several chemical differences compared to the Class II stage, which seem to arise from shielding of radiation by the envelope (impacting C2H formation and (HCN)-N-15 fractionation) and sublimation of ices from infalling material (impacting HCN and (CO)-O-18 abundances). Such chemical differences between Class 0/I and Class II sources may affect the volatile composition of planet-forming material at different stages in the disk lifetime.

This gap appears to define a transition region in which sub-Neptune planets are believed to have lost their H/He envelopes, potentially by photoevaporation or core powered mass loss, and have thus been transformed into bare core terrestrial planets. Here we investigate the transition between sub-Neptunes and super-Earths using a real sample of observed small close-in planets and applying envelope evolution models of the H/He envelope together with the mass-radius diagram and a photoevaporation model. We find that photoevaporation can explain the H/He envelope loss of most super-Earths in 100 Myr, although an additional loss mechanism appears necessary in some planets. We explore the possibility that these planets' families have different core masses and find a continuum in the primordial population of the strongly irradiated super-Earths and the sub-Neptunes. Our analysis also shows that close-orbiting sub-Neptunes withR R(circle plus)typically lose similar to 30% of their primordial envelope.

Discovery of the Optical Afterglow and Host Galaxy of Short GRB 181123B at z=1.754: Implications for Delay Time Distributions	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Gamma-ray bursts	GAMMA-RAY BURST; UV LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; FAINT-END SLOPE; STAR-FORMATION; MULTIOBJECT SPECTROGRAPH; PHOTOMETRIC SYSTEM; IA SUPERNOVAE; LOCAL-RATE; REDSHIFT; TELESCOPE	We present the discovery of the optical afterglow and host galaxy of the Swift short-duration gamma-ray burst (SGRB) GRB 181123B. Observations with Gemini-North starting approximate to 9.1 hr after the burst reveal a faint optical afterglow with i approximate to 25.1 mag at an angular offset of 0.'' 59 +/- 0.'' 16 from its host galaxy. Using grizYJHK observations, we measure a photometric redshift of the host galaxy of z = 1.77(-0.17)(+0.30). From a combination of Gemini and Keck spectroscopy of the host galaxy spanning 4500-18000 angstrom, we detect a single emission line at 13390 A, inferred as H beta at z = 1.754 +/- 0.001 and corroborating the photometric redshift. The host galaxy properties of GRB 181123B are typical of those of other SGRB hosts, with an inferred stellar mass of approximate to 9.1 x 10(9)M(circle dot), a mass-weighted age of approximate to 0.9 Gyr, and an optical luminosity of approximate to 0.9L*. At z = 1.754, GRB 181123B is the most distant secure SGRB with an optical afterglow detection and one of only three at z > 1.5. Motivated by a growing number of high-z SGRBs, we explore the effects of a missing z > 1.5 SGRB population among the current Swift sample on delay time distribution (DTD) models. We find that lognormal models with mean delay times of approximate to 4-6 Gyr are consistent with the observed distribution but can be ruled out to 95% confidence, with an additional one to five Swift SGRBs recovered at z > 1.5. In contrast, power-law models with proportional to t(-1) are consistent with the redshift distribution and can accommodate up to approximate to 30 SGRBs at these redshifts. Under this model, we predict that approximate to 1/3 of the current Swift population of SGRBs is at z > 1. The future discovery or recovery of existing high-z SGRBs will provide significant discriminating power on their DTDs and thus their formation channels.

The excitation mechanisms of such arms are under debate. The two leading hypotheses-companion-disk interaction and gravitational instability (GI)-predict distinct motion for spirals. By imaging the MWC 758 spiral arm system at two epochs spanning similar to 5 yr using the SPHERE instrument on the Very Large Telescope, we test the two hypotheses for the first time. We find that the pattern speeds of the spirals are not consistent with the GI origin. Our measurements further evince the existence of a faint "missing planet" driving the disk arms. The average spiral pattern speed is 0 degrees.22.+/-.0 degrees. 03 yr(-1), pointing to a driver at 172(-14)(+18) au around a 1.9 M-circle dot central star if it is on a circular orbit. In addition, we witness time-varying shadowing effects on a global scale that are likely originating from an inner disk.

Dynamical Packing in the Habitable Zone: The Case of Beta CVn	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Astrobiology; Habitable zone; Habitable planets; Orbital evolution; Exoplanets; Exoplanet dynamics	PLANET-SEARCH; GIANT PLANETS; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; MASS; JUPITER; ORIGIN; STARS; DWARF; CHAOS	Uncovering the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets within the habitable zone (HZ) of their host stars has been a particular focus of exoplanetary science in recent years. The statistics of these occurrence rates have largely been derived from transiting planet discoveries, and have uncovered numerous HZ planets in compact systems around M-dwarf host stars. Here we explore the width of the HZ as a function of spectral type, and the dynamical constraints on the number of stable orbits within the HZ for a given star. We show that, although the Hill radius for a given planetary mass increases with larger semimajor axis, the width of the HZ for earlier-type stars allows for more terrestrial planets in the HZ than late-type stars. In general, dynamical constraints allow similar to 6 HZ Earth-mass planets for stellar masses greater than or similar to 0.7M, depending on the presence of farther out giant planets. As an example, we consider the case of Beta CVn, a nearby bright solar-type star. We present 20 yr of radial velocities (RV) from the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and Automated Planet Finder (APF) instruments and conduct an injection-recovery analysis of planetary signatures in the data. Our analysis of these RV data rule out planets more massive than Saturn within 10 au of the star. These system properties are used to calculate the potential dynamical packing of terrestrial planets in the HZ and show that such nearby stellar targets could be particularly lucrative for HZ planet detection by direct imaging exoplanet missions.

We propose a multistage procedure, calledCoarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis calledSystem Level Synthesisthat enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.

However, controlled two-qubit entanglement generation has so far been limited to alkali species, leaving the exploitation of more complex electronic structures as an open frontier that could lead to improved fidelities and fundamentally different applications such as quantum-enhanced optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values. Our results pave the way for novel applications, including programmable quantum metrology and hybrid atom-ion systems, and set the stage for alkaline-earth based quantum computing architectures.

J	Lambert, V; Tsai, VC				Lambert, Valere; Tsai, Victor C.			Time-Dependent Stresses From Fluid Extraction and Diffusion With Applications to Induced Seismicity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						computational mechanics; elasticity; stress analysis	GAS-PRODUCTION; INDUCED EARTHQUAKES; FOCAL MECHANISMS; INJECTION; FIELD; OKLAHOMA; TEXAS	Over recent decades, it has become clear that the extraction of fluids from underground reservoirs can be linked to seismicity and aseismic deformation around producing fields. Using a simple model with uniform fluid extraction from a reservoir, Segall (1989, "Earthquakes Triggered by Fluid Extraction," Geology, 17(10), pp. 942-946) illustrated how poroelastic stresses resulting from fluid withdrawal may be consistent with earthquake focal mechanisms surrounding some producing fields. Since these stress fields depend on the spatial gradient of the change in pore fluid content within the reservoir, both quantitative and qualitative predictions of the stress changes surrounding a reservoir may be considerably affected by assumptions in the geometry and hydraulic properties of the producing zone. Here, we expand upon the work of Segall (1989, "Earthquakes Triggered by Fluid Extraction," Geology, 17, pp. 942-946 and 1985, "Stress and Subsidence Resulting From Subsurface Fluid Withdrawal in the Epicentral Region of the 1983 Coalinga Earthquake," J. Geophys. Res. Solid Earth, 90, pp. 6801-6816) to provide a quantitative analysis of the surrounding stresses resulting from fluid extraction and diffusion in a horizontal reservoir. In particular, when considering the diffusion of fluids, the spatial pattern and magnitude of imposed stresses is controlled by the ratio between the volumetric rate of fluid extraction and the reservoir diffusivity. Moreover, the effective reservoir length expands over time along with the diffusion front, predicting a time-dependent rotation of the induced principal stresses from relative tension to compression along the ends of the producing zone. This reversal in perturbed principal stress directions may manifest as a rotation in earthquake focal mechanisms or varied sensitivity to poroelastic triggering, depending upon the criticality of the pre-existing stress state and fault orientations, which may explain inferred rotations in principal stress directions associated with some induced seismicity.

The mass ratio of the two stars is q(s) = 0.289 +/- 0.011, and their projected separation is s(s) = 2. +/- 0.7 au, while the projected separation of the planet from the primary is s(p) = 2.2 +/- 0.8 au. For this lens system to have stable orbits, the three-dimensional separation of either the primary and secondary stars or the planet and primary star must be much larger than the projected separations. Since we do not know which is the case, the system could include either a circumbinary or a circumstellar planet. Because there is no measurement of the microlensing parallax effect or lens system brightness, we can only make a rough Bayesian estimate of the lens system masses and brightness. We find host star and planet masses of M-L1 = 0.35(-0.20)(+0.30) M-circle dot, M-L2 = 0.10(-0.06)(+0.09) M-circle dot, and m(p) = 144(-82)(+126) M-circle dot, and the K-band magnitude of the combined brightness of the host stars is K-L = 19.7(-1.0)(+0.7). The separation between the lens and source system will be similar to 90 mas in mid-2020, so it should be possible to detect the host system with follow-up adaptive optics or Hubble Space Telescope observations.

Although the origin of the anomaly is identified to be a companion to the lens with a low mass ratio q, the interpretation is subject to two different degeneracy types. The first type is the ambiguity in rho, representing the angular source radius scaled to the angular radius of the Einstein ring, theta(E), and the other is the s <-> s(-1) degeneracy. The former type, "finite -source degeneracy," causes ambiguities in both s and q, while the latter induces an ambiguity only in s. Here, s denotes the separation (in units of theta(E)) in projection between the lens components. We estimate that the lens components have masses (M-1, M-2) similar to (0.27(-0.15)(+0.36) M-circle dot, 11(-7)(+16) M-j) and similar to(0.48(-0.28)(+0.40) M-circle dot, 1.3(-0.7)(1)(+1.) M-J) according to the two solutions subject to the finite-source degeneracy, indicating that the lens comprises an M dwarf and a companion with a mass around the planet/brown dwarf boundary or a Jovian-mass planet. It is possible to lift the finite-source degeneracy by conducting future observations utilizing a high resolution instrument because the relative lens source proper motion predicted by the solutions is widely different.

Multiscale Surface Roughness for Improved Soil Moisture Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Passive microwave; soil moisture (SM); soil moisture active passive (SMAP); surface roughness	L-BAND; MICROWAVE EMISSION; DEPRESSIONAL STORAGE; WATER-CONTENT; RETRIEVAL; SMOS; BARE; VEGETATION; TILLAGE; MODEL	Surface roughness parameterization plays an important role in passive microwave soil moisture (SM) retrieval. This article proposes a new formulation for estimating surface roughness. The proposed model incorporates the field-scale (micro) roughness as well as topographic (macro) roughness. The performance of the model is evaluated by inverting the traditional tau-omega model for retrieving SM. The study focuses on the passive active L-band system (PALS) radiometer data collected as a part of two Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAPVEX), i.e., SMAPVEX12 (humid Manitoba, Canada) and SMAPVEX15 (semiarid Arizona, USA) with highly different microroughness and macroroughness. The measured surface roughness is observed to increase exponentially with clay fraction (CF). This behavior is minimized with increase in leaf area index (LAI). In the absence of vegetation, the contribution of topography toward surface roughness increases. A higher surface roughness value is estimated for SMAPVEX12, which positively correlate with LAI and CF and negatively correlate with wetness conditions. On the other hand, due to the high topographic variability in SMAPVEX15 region, the contribution of topography (surface curvature) toward total surface roughness is significant. Also, consistently dry SM resulted in high microroughness for SMAPVEX15. Nevertheless, a total surface roughness estimated for SMAPVEX15 region is less than for SMAPVEX12. The surface roughness formulation presented in this study can be extrapolated to any spatial resolution.

An FPGA-Based Signal Processor for FMCW Doppler Radar and Spectroscopy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Radar theory; millimeter-wave Doppler radar; spectroscopy		We report on the design and development of a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based radar and spectrometer signal processor. It leverages an efficient implementation of a fixed-point frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) Doppler radar algorithm and has been demonstrated in a short-range W-band radar system developed for mapping plume and jet phenomena in the solar system. The signal processor also performs Fourier transform-based spectroscopy with a resolution, bandwidth, and averaging time appropriate for millimeter- and submillimeter-wave passive remote sensing in space. With a dc power consumption totaling only 3 W, the processor helps make the Doppler radar and spectrometer instrument well-suited for spaceborne, airborne, or portable platforms. Here, we describe the fixed-point implementation of the radar and spectrometer algorithm, emphasizing its computational efficiency for low resource utilization, and provide examples of Doppler radar sensing of rain and spectrometer sensitivity to hot and cold blackbody loads.

Resource-Efficient Quantum Computing by Breaking Abstractions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Qubit; Logic gates; Hardware; Ions; Optimization; Computer architecture; Quantum computing (QC); software design; system analysis and design		Building a quantum computer that surpasses the computational power of its classical counterpart is a great engineering challenge. Quantum software optimizations can provide an accelerated pathway to the first generation of quantum computing (QC) applications that might save years of engineering effort. Current quantum software stacks follow a layered approach similar to the stack of classical computers, which was designed to manage the complexity. In this review, we point out that greater efficiency of QC systems can be achieved by breaking the abstractions between these layers. We review several works along this line, including two hardware-aware compilation optimizations that break the quantum instruction set architecture (ISA) abstraction and two error-correction/information-processing schemes that break the qubit abstraction. Last, we discuss several possible future directions.

The absence of significant clean ice in GPR data, paired with observations of talus and interstitial ice influx from the valley walls, support rock glacier formation via talus accumulation. A quartz-dominated subsurface composition and discontinuous, well-developed desert pavements suggest initial rock glacier formation occurred before the late Quaternary. Major ion data from soil leaching analyses show higher salt concentrations in the rock glacier and talus samples that are close to hypersaline DJP. These observations suggest that DJP acts as a local salt source to the rock glacier, as well as the surrounding talus slopes that host water track systems that deliver solutes back into the lake, suggesting a local feedback system. Finally, the lack of lacustrine sedimentation on the rock glacier is inconsistent with the advance of a glacially dammed lake into South Fork during the Last Glacial Maximum.

L.; Harrow, Aram W.; Lee, James R.; Peres, Yuval			Adversarial Hypothesis Testing and a Quantum Stein's Lemma for Restricted Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Hypothesis testing; quantum information theory; quantum Stein's Lemma; subadditivity; von Neumann entropy	RELATIVE ENTROPY; ASYMPTOTICS; CONVERSE; CAPACITY; BOUNDS	Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two sets of probability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a distribution p is an element of P or from a distribution q is an element of Q and wants to decide from which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood ratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q. We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p is an element of P and q is an element of Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on the previous samples. In other words, in the kth round, an adversary, having observed all the previous samples in rounds 1,..., k - 1, chooses p(k) is an element of P and q(k) is an element of Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in this case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q. We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis testing for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can be used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of all separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our setup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive classical adversary. We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the optimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum relative entropy between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an alternate proof of Li and Winter's recent strengthening of strong subadditivity for von Neumann entropy.	[Brandao, Fernando G. S.

However, its existence and biochemical nature remain enigmatic. Here, through combining several enrichment strategies, we are able to isolate an endogenous dimeric CMG-containing complex (designated as d-CMG) distinct from traditional single CMG (s-CMG) and in vitro reconstituted dimeric CMG. D-CMG is assembled upon entry into the S phase and shortly matures into s-CMG/replisome, leading to the fact that only ~ 5% of the total CMG-containing complexes can be detected as d-CMG in vivo. Mass spectra reveal that RPA and DNA Pol alpha/primase co-purify with s-CMG, but not with d-CMG. Consistently, the former fraction is able to catalyze DNA unwinding and de novo synthesis, while the latter catalyzes neither. The two CMGs in d-CMG display flexibly orientated conformations under an electronic microscope. When DNA Pol alpha-primase is inactivated, d-CMG % rose up to 29%, indicating an incomplete pre-IC/fork transition. These findings reveal biochemical properties of the d-CMG/pre-IC and provide in vivo evidence to support the pre-IC/fork transition as a bona fide step in replication initiation.

The software facilitates combined estimation of geodetic and geophysical parameters using a Kalman filter approach on real or simulated data in both post -processing and in real-time. The estimated parameters include station coordinates and velocities, satellite orbits and clocks, Earth orientation, ionospheric and tropospheric delays. The software is also capable of full realiza- tion of a dynamic terrestrial reference through analysis and combination of time series of ground station coordinates. Applying lessons learned from its predecessors, GIPSY -OASIS and Real Time GIPSY (RTG), GipsyX/RTGx was re -designed from the ground up to offer improved precision, accuracy, usability, and operational flexibility. We present some key aspects of its new archi- tecture, and describe some of its major applications, including Real-time orbit determination and ephemeris predictions in the U.S. Air Force Next Generation GPS Operational Control Segment (OCX), as well as in JPL?s Global Differential GPS (GDGPS) System, sup- porting User Range Error (URE) of <5 cm RMS; precision post -processing GNSS orbit determination, including JPL?s contributions to the International GNSS Service (IGS) with URE in the 2 cm RMS range; Precise point positioning (PPP) with ambiguity resolution, both statically and kinematically, for geodetic applications with 2 mm horizontal, and 6.5 mm vertical repeatability for static positioning; Operational orbit and clock determination for Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites, such as NASA?s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission with GRACE relative clock alignment at the 20 ps level; calibration of radio occultation data from LEO satellites for weather forecasting and climate studies; Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) to GNSS and LEO satellites, DORIS-based and multi -technique orbit determination for LEO; production of terrestrial reference frames and Earth rotation parameters in support of JPL?s contribution to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).

Silicon emissivity as a function of temperature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER			English	Article						LIGO; Silicon; Thermal emissivity; Gravitational waves		In this paper we present the temperature-dependent emissivity of a silicon sample, estimated from its cool-down curve in a constant low temperature environment (similar to 82K). The emissivity value follow a linear dependency in the 120-260 K temperature range. This result is of great interest to the LIGO Voyager gravitational wave interferometer project since it would mean that no extra high thermal emissivity coating on the test masses would be required in order to cool them down to 123 K. The results presented here indicate that bulk silicon itself can have sufficient thermal emissivity in order to cool the 200 kg LIGO Voyager test masses only by radiation in a reasonable short amount of time (less than a week). However, it is still not clear if the natural emissivity of silicon will be sufficient to maintain the LIGO Voyager test masses at the desired temperature (123 K) while removing power absorbed by the test masses. With the present results, a black coating on the barrel surface of the test masses would be necessary if power in excess of 6 W is delivered. However, the agreement we found between the hemispherical emissivity obtained by a theory of semi-transparent Silicon and the obtained experimental results makes us believe that the LIGO Voyager test masses, because of their dimensions, will have effective emissivities around 0.7, which would be enough to remove about 8.6 W (7.5 W) for a shield at 60 K (80 K). This hypothesis may be confirmed in the near future with new measurements. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Empirical rovibrational energy levels of ammonia up to 7500 cm(-1)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Ammonia ((NH3)-N-14); Rovibrational transitions; Empirical rovibrational energy levels; MARVEL; Database; Spectroscopic networks; Effective Hamiltonian fits	ROTATIONAL-VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA; IUPAC CRITICAL-EVALUATION; TRANSITION WAVE-NUMBERS; MICROWAVE 2-PHOTON SPECTROSCOPY; LASER HETERODYNE MEASUREMENTS; FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTRA; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRUM; MOLECULAR LINE LISTS; HYPERFINE-STRUCTURE; ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM	The most recent version of the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) protocol and code is used to update and extend the list of accurately known empirical rovibrational energy levels of (NH3)-N-14 falling in the range of 0 - 7500 cm(-1) . Compared to an earlier similar study covering all the measured transitions of (NH3)-N-14 [22], the present investigation is limited to transitions with an upper energy level below 7500 cm(-1) , considers 82 sources (28 new) of transitions data, corrects several older assignments, and utilizes an improved validation procedure based partially on high-quality first-principles rovibrational energies. This study yields 4936 uniquely labelled empirical rovibrational energy levels, the set is complete up to 2413 cm(-1). We confirm the overall high accuracy of the most recent "spectroscopic" (fitted) (NH3)-N-14 potential energy surface, C2018, up to 7500 cm(-1). Investigation of energy values resulting from previous effective-Hamiltonian fits forms an important part of this study. It is established that previous effective-Hamiltonian fits, using high expansion orders in the Hamiltonian, are inaccurate for certain high rotational excitations of all vibrational parents considered. Employing the ground vibrational state as a test case, it is shown that the origin of the problem is that the observed (NH3)-N-14 spectroscopic network formed by rotational transitions and used for the effective-Hamiltonian fit contains floating components. A much improved effective-Hamiltonian fit is presented whereby the floating components are connected to the principal components of the spectroscopic network by carefully selected first-principles links. It is recommended that for all molecules the experimental set of transitions employed for an effective Hamiltonian fit should be checked for floating components and extra care be exercised if they exist, as in these cases the adequate reproduction of the transitions does not automatically mean that the energies derived from the effective-Hamiltonian parameters are correct as well. The connectivity problem of measured spectroscopic networks becomes more and more pronounced as the order of the Hamiltonian is increased. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pseudoline parameters to represent n-butane (n-C4H10) cross-sections measured in the 7-15 mu m region for the Titan atmosphere	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						n-Butane; FT-IR spectrum; Cross section; Pseudolines; Balker 125HR; Cassini/CIRS; Titan; Hydrocarbons	PHOTOCHEMISTRY; NITROGEN; C3H8	We measured temperature-dependent cross-sections of n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3) in the mid-infrared (7-15 mu m) region in support of remote sensing for the Titan's atmosphere. For this, 28 pure and N-2-mixture spectra were obtained at 180-298 K using a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker IFS 125 HR) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spectral resolutions were selected to be between 0.0039 and 0.06 cm(-1), depending on the sample pressures. The observed spectra were fit simultaneously to generate one single set of pseudolines, which include line intensities and lower state energies at individual pseudoline positions. The observed spectra could be reproduced by the pseudolines to within 4% through line-by-line radiative transfer calculations. The integrated intensities at 296 K were measured to be 5.06(28), 7.18(27), 0.91(4), and 49.01(20) x 10(-19) cm(-1) /(molecule.cm(-2)) in the 660860, 860-1060, 1060-1200, and 1200-1538 cm(-1) regions, respectively, by summing up the pseudoline intensity parameters. These results are observed to be significantly lower than that of the PNNL (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) cross-sections obtained at low resolution. The pseudolines are electronically compiled in the HITRAN database format, which can be readily integrated with existing radiative transfer calculations. The measured cross-sections represented by the pseudolines could provide critical laboratory input in search of elusive species that might be captured in the Cassini/CIRS and the JWST/MIRI spectral observations.

Out of this sample, four stars (TYC 7443-1102-1, TYC 9340-437-1, GJ 784 and GJ 707) have infrared excesses above their stellar photospheres at either 100 or 160 mu m or both. At 100 microns TYC 9340-437-1 is spatially resolved with a shape that suggests it is surrounded by a face-on disk. The 100 mu m excess flux associated with GJ 707 is marginal at around 3 sigma. The excess flux associated with GJ 784 is most likely due to a background galaxy as the dust radius estimated from the spectral energy fit implies that any associated dust disk should have been resolved in the Herschel images but is not. TYC 7443-1102-1 has been observed with ALMA which resolves the emission at its location into two distinct sources making the Herschel excess most likely also due to a background galaxy. It is worth noting that this star is in the 23 Myr old beta Pic association. With a disk luminosity on the order of 10(-3)L(*), this system is an ideal follow-up target for high-contrast imaging and ALMA.

Elucidating the phenomenon's underlying mechanisms is relevant for the larger question of how the visual system makes photometric judgments in images. Accounts over the past century have spanned low-, mid- and high-level visual processes, but a definitive resolution has not emerged. We present three studies that collectively demonstrate that the computations underlying this phenomenon are low-level, instantiated prior to binocular fusion, and available innately, without need for inferential learning via an individual's visual experience. In our first two studies, we find that strong brightness induction is obtained even when observers are unaware of any luminance differences in the neighborhoods of the probe patches. Results with dichoptic displays reveal that eye of origin, although not evident consciously, has a marked influence on the eventual brightness percept of the probe patches, thereby localizing brightness estimation to a site preceding binocular fusion. The third study uses conventional simultaneous brightness contrast displays, but an unusual group of participants: Congenitally blind children whom we were able to treat surgically. The results demonstrate an immediate susceptibility to the simultaneous brightness illusion after sight onset. Together, these data strongly constrain the search for mechanisms underlying a fundamental brightness phenomenon.

Reducing Doppler noise with multi-station tracking: The Cassini test case	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Radio science; Cassini; Noise budget; Orbit determination	GRAVITY-FIELD; INTERIOR STRUCTURE	Doppler tracking of Solar System probes is used for spacecraft navigation, planetary geodesy, and tests of the theory of General Relativity. The spacecraft radial velocity is measured by observing the Doppler shift of a radio signal transmitted from an Earth station to the spacecraft and then re-transmitted back, while preserving phase coherence, to the same station (two-way link) or to a different station (three-way link). Specialized orbit determination software is then used to reconstruct the spacecraft trajectory and estimate planetary gravity field coefficients or relativistic parameters. The measurement noise is a crucial element for the accuracy of the final estimates, thus considerable effort has been devoted to improve the range rate accuracy by adopting higher frequency links to reduce the dispersive noise from interplanetary and ionospheric plasmas, and by calibrating the tropospheric path delays with microwave radiometers. While Ka-band radio links (32-34 GHz) allowed a successful suppression of plasma noise, reducing tropospheric noise and ground antenna mechanical noise has been more challenging. The Time-Delay Mechanical noise Cancellation (TDMC) technique is a promising method to reduce mechanical and tropospheric noises and to improve further the accuracy of Doppler measurements. The TDMC is a linear combination of simultaneous Doppler data from a main antenna providing the two-way link and a three-way antenna (generally smaller and stiffer). If the listen-only, three-way antenna is also located in a particularly dry site, the TDMC can considerably reduce both tropospheric and antenna mechanical noises, which are the leading disturbances in two-way Ka-band radio links. For an operational WA of this method, we applied the TDMC to Doppler data at X-band (7.2-8.4 GHz) from the Cassini spacecraft acquired during the Saturn tour phase of the mission. Although X-band links are generally dominated by the highly-variable interplanetary plasma noise and are not suitable for the TDMC, we found that, when local noises are particularly large at the two-way antenna, this technique may still lead to up to a factor-of-three noise reduction (at 60-s integration time) with respect to the two-way link. The TDMC can maximize the data quality during unique events, mainly planetary or satellite flybys (such as those considered in the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions), where the scientific results could be severely hampered by adverse conditions at the tracking station.

This mission will become the first interplanetary CubeSat to orbit the Moon. It uses a new green propulsion system as well as an instrument with spectrally tuned IR laser technology to search for volatiles in a specific region of the moon. The Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) system is crucial for delivering the spacecraft from Earth into Lunar orbit and supporting scientific measurements. Due to the challenging lunar orbit insertion and high tip off rate out of launch vehicle's dispenser, the initial design concept using solar sail propulsion accompanied with small commercial-on-the-shelf (COTS) reaction wheels was abandoned mid-course and replaced by a green propulsion system along with larger reaction wheels, both newly developed for LF. However, using thrusters for the small CubeSat created an additional challenge of controlling the spacecraft attitude. The story of the GNC system development, qualifications, technical challenges encountered, and lessons learned are discussed in this paper.

Particularly, the problem of estimating the displacement field in a soft shallow layer overlying rigid bedrock induced by simple shear wave excitation has been favored by engineers due to its simplicity combined with inherent relevance for practical scenarios. We here derive analytical estimates for both the fundamental frequency and the amplitude of the first resonant mode of such systems by applying an intuitive argument based on resonance of single-degree-of-freedom systems. Our estimates do not presuppose a continuous velocity distribution, and can be used for fast assessment of site response in seismic hazard assessment and engineering design. On the basis of the said estimates of fundamental frequency and amplitude, we next propose a novel definition of "equivalent homogeneous shear modulus'' of the inhomogeneous deposit, and we show that the response of the fundamental mode is controlled primarily by the properties of the layers contiguous to the bedrock. We finally discuss the validity of our argument, and evaluate the accuracy of our results by comparison with analytical and numerical solutions.

Assessment of magmatic versus post-magmatic processes in the Mueilha rare-metal granite, Eastern Desert of Egypt, Arabian-Nubian Shield	LITHOS			English	Article						Arabian-Nubian Shield; Highly fractionated granite; Nb-Ta oxide minerals; Magmatic-hydrothermal evolution	A-TYPE GRANITES; NB-TA FRACTIONATION; CALC-ALKALINE; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; ORIGIN; DISCRIMINATION; BEARING; MINERALIZATION; GEOCHEMISTRY	The Mueilha rare-metal granite, exposed in the central Eastern Desert of Egypt, is a post-collisional intrusion that formed in the final magmatic stage of the evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. The Mueilha intrusion was emplaced as a high-level magmatic cupola into metamorphic country rocks. It consists of two cogenetic intrusive bodies: an early phase emplaced at shallow depth and now penetratively altered to white albite granite and a later phase of red granites emplaced at greater depth that better preserve magmatic features. The albite granite is less common and represents the upper margin of the Mueilha intrusion, the apex of the magmatic cupola. The red granites are volumetrically dominant and appears to have crystallized from the margins inward, forming a composite pluton zoned from muscovite granite to alkali feldspar granite. All parts of the Mueilha pluton appear to have been emplaced within a short time interval, before complete crystallization of the earliest phase. The geochemistry of the Mueilha granites is typical of rare-metal granites, characterized by high SiO2, Na2O + K2O, Nb, Rb, Ta, Y, U, Th, Sn, and W with depletion in P, Mg, Ti, Sr and Ba. They are weakly peraluminous and highly fractionated with A-type character. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns have strongly negative Eu anomalies, typical of highly differentiated granites that evolved through a transitional magmatic-hydrothermal stage. The primary magma feeding the Mueilha intrusion was generated by partial melting of the juvenile crust of the Arabian-Nubian Shield; it subsequently underwent extensive fractional crystallization and metasomatism by late- to post-magmatic fluids. Separation of fluids from the oversaturated melt promoted both diffuse greisenization and focused segregation of pegmatite and fluorite and quartz veins. Alkalis liberated from feld-spars consumed by greisenization were redeposited during albitization in the uppermost part of the magma chamber. Despite penetration of the intrusion boundary by discrete dikes, veins, and aphophyses, diffuse alteration of the metamorphic country rocks is not apparent. Primary columbite-series minerals crystallized from the melt and were later partly replaced by secondary Nb and Ta minerals (fluorcalciomicrolite and wodginite) during hydrothermal alteration.

Enabling new exploration opportunities on planetary surfaces: In situ geochemical characterization in soils by dielectric spectroscopy onboard the AXEL rover system	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ICE; ROCKS; MODEL	In the work, we present dielectric spectroscopy (DS) is an analytical method capable of characterizing and quantifying electrochemically active materials (water/ice, ions, etc.) in planetary regoliths. Detection of these materials occurs when a small amount of energy is applied to an in situ sample, causing perturbation in the form of potential kinetic energy and inducing polarization and/or relaxation processes in materials of interest. The frequency dispersion on the electrical properties of impendences, relative permittivity, and conductivity spectra represents chemical and physical properties in association with inherent material properties. Therefore, measuring these energetic states can provide a unique fingerprint of the materials, depending on the frequencies that are scanned. In the case of water content in soils, the Debye equivalent circuit model can accurately predict its electrical properties and provide excellent quantification of the water content in soils. Use of DS is enabled by miniaturization of the key components and the low power requirements. DS is therefore capable of offering substantial scientific returns as an in situ sampling and non-destructive measurement technique, making it ideally suitable for deployment onboard many smaller space exploratory platforms. This work reports the first deployment use of DS from a field test for geochemical characterization of in situ soils, specifically on the quantification of water onboard the AXEL mobility system in the Mojave Desert. Laboratory testing has confirmed the sensitivity of DS with respect to particle size (fine vs coarse) determination as well as water content (down to 0.01 wt%) under a wide range of environmental conditions. Water content associated with bound and bulk water was uniquely identified in the soil mixture. We also describe a field demonstration using DS using two distinct insertion dielectric probes specifically design for sub-surface measurements, verifying their mechanical robustness and chemical stability. The field measurements are in good agreement with laboratory data and effectively quantified water content at about 3.0 wt% and 8.0 wt% for field test sites #1 and #2, respectively.

Fracture geometry and statistics of Ceres' floor fractures	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Ceres; Dwarf planet; Floor fractured craters	VISCOUS RELAXATION; CRATERS; ORIGIN; INTRUSIONS; FEATURES; SYSTEM; VESTA; VENUS; SHAPE; MARS	Floor-fractured craters are one of the most distinct features on Ceres. Most of the fractures are located on the crater floors. The floor-fractures are concentric, radial or polygonal and share similarities with the floor-fractured craters (FCC) of Class 1 and 4 on the Moon (e.g., Buczkowski et al., 2018; Schultz, 1976) In total we measured 2336 fractures in thirteen craters. We analyzed their width, length, orientation and density. Floor-fractures on Ceres do not show a global uniform sense of orientation. Nevertheless, two or more preferred orientations can be found in nearly every crater. The density map illustrates that there is typically no decrease of fracturing from the crater center to the crater rim and denotes formation mechanisms that are not necessarily impact driven. Because of the variation in these parameters, it is more likely that FFC on Ceres are globally independent and show different formation mechanisms. The geometry of the floor-fractures suggests an inhomogeneous, brittle surface material, in some cases with volatile components. We also propose that the formation mechanisms on Ceres are comparable to those on the Moon and Mars and such mechanisms include cooling/melting processes, degassing, and subsidence of the crater floor by up-doming of subsurface material as a result of absolute tensile stresses.

J	Peters, ST; Schroeder, DM; Romero-Wolf, A				Peters, Sean T.; Schroeder, Dustin M.; Romero-Wolf, Andrew			Passive radio sounding to correct for Europa's ionospheric distortion of VHF signals	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Europa; REASON; Passive radar; Jovian noise; Ionospheric distortion; TEC estimation	MARS IONOSPHERE; RADAR SOUNDER; THICKNESS; JUPITER; SUN	The dispersive effect of Europa's ionosphere on radio wave propagation is detrimental to the quality of radar observations for altimetry and geodesy of Europa's surface, as it creates pulse broadening and signal delay. While using the relative delay between two active radar channels of different center frequencies is a common method to correct for this ionospheric distortion, the High Frequency (HF) active band for a dual-frequency radar sounder like the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON) is susceptible to being dominated by the bursts of Jupiter's radio emissions when the radar is on the sub-Jovian side. At these times, the HF radar will be severely degraded or unusable alongside the slightly dispersed Very High Frequency (VHF) channel for performing radar sounding as well as reference-based radar corrections of ionospheric distortion for VHF altimetry. To address this, we assess the potential to use Jupiter's radio emissions to correct for ionospheric distortion with a passive radio sounding approach that has been developed on Earth to estimate the thickness of ice sheets using the Sun. With REASON as an interesting test case for the technique, we discuss in general the abilities and requirements for a dual-frequency radar system using a passive HF radar alongside an active VHF radar to correct for ionospheric distortion, and we compare the passive mode's performance to that of an active HF radar system. Finally, we show that even in the presence of the maximum expected total electron content (TEC) in Europa's ionosphere, the passive radar approach, using the REASON HF as a receive-only instrument, not only corrects for dispersion but also performs at a level similar to that of an active HF system in terms of TEC estimation and VHF range error reduction.

Retrievals of the column-averaged imaginary part of refractive index and single scattering albedo (SSA) in the UV-Vis range have been performed at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, since 2016 by combining co-located measurements from the NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Cimel sun-sky photometer, the Ultraviolet Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (UV-MFRSR), the SKYNET Prede sky radiometer, and the NASA Pandora sun spectrometer. We investigated the spectral variation of column-averaged imaginary part of refractive index for UV-Vis wavelengths to refine models used in our aerosol retrieval algorithm to process measurements from the upcoming Geostationary Environment Monitoring Satellite (GEMS). The retrieved imaginary part of refractive index for highly absorbing fine pollution particles (BC), dust (DS), and non-absorbing (NA) particles in the selected UV-Vis range (380-440 nm) showed 0-20%, 30%, and 0-40% of spectral dependence, respectively. Retrievals of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurement data using the improved aerosol model showed improved correlation with AERONET data compared to the old algorithm that did not properly account for aerosol absorption effects. These results corroborate the advantage of using local climatology derived from ground-based UV-Vis spectral aerosol absorption measurements for satellite GEMS aerosol retrievals over East Asia. Moreover, this study reveals that spectral variations in the UV column aerosol absorption in East Asia differ from those in other regions.

Previous work in the field has shown the ability of GNSS-R to observe the global surface water distribution by generating dynamic maps of wetlands and other inundated areas. These maps can be generated by leveraging the large difference in received power of the GNSS signals as they reflect from water surfaces compared to land. In this paper, we utilize a full-forward scattering model approach to evaluate the accuracy of these maps. The CYGNSS End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was extended to include the contributions from coherent surface scattering in heterogeneous regions where the area around the specular point contains both water and land in complex geometries. The simulator is then used to analyze the accuracy of a current approach to estimate the surface water content in the first Fresnel zone from a single measurement, called a fractional water in footprint approach. We find that contributions to the total received power by the scattering from outside the first Fresnel zone as well as CYGNSS instrument effects impact the accuracy of this approach. Furthermore, the measured signal from calibration scattering targets is compared to the results of simulation to validate the scattering model. The work shows that the variability of the peak reflected power over inland bodies of water due to the scene heterogeneities should be accounted for in designing retrieval algorithms to map wetland extent.

This study aims to (1) assess the cause of the dam breach, and (2) understand the hydrologic and geomorphic impact of the flood. Our analysis shows that the collapse of the dam occurred as the reservoir was nearly full, and the water level was rising against the inner slope of the earthen dam. As the water discharged through the breach, we calculate that the reservoir fell similar to 22 m and lost similar to 350 million m(3). more than a third of the total stored volume on July 23. Inspection of publicly available photographs of the failed dam confirms our interpretation that the failure was structural, involving both piping and rotational slumping, and not due to overtopping of the dam. Failure to properly process the local materials before construction of the earth-core of the dam is the likely cause of failure. Our analysis of satellite imagery, bolstered by field observations, reveals that the flooding inundated an area of similar to 46 km(2) of villages and rural land in the Vang Ngao River, a tributary of the Mekong River basin. By using 1D and 2D hydrological modeling, we calculate a peak flood discharge of similar to 8500 m(3)/s, about half the mean discharge of the Mississippi River. The dam failure and concomitant losses are consistent with common inadequacies in this region in assessing potential hazards, challenges of geomorphological-geotechnical engineering when using tropical materials for construction, and emergency planning and warning. Thus, this analysis has important implications for the safer design and construction of the myriad of other dams that are either operating or planned within the multi-national Mekong River basin.

An earlier study demonstrated that CRBN directly interacts with the catalytic alpha subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy homeostasis, down-regulating the enzymatic activity of AMPK. However, it is not clear how CRBN modulates AMPK activity. To investigate the mechanism of CRBN-dependent AMPK inhibition, we measured protein levels of each AMPK subunit in brains, livers, lungs, hearts, spleens, skeletal muscles, testes, kidneys, and embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and Crbn(-/-) mice. Protein levels and stability of the regulatory AMPK. subunit were increased in Crbn(-/-) mice. Increased stability of AMPK gamma in Crbn(-/-) MEFs was dramatically reduced by exogenous expression of Crbn. In wild-type MEFs, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 blocked degradation of AMPK gamma. We also found that CRL4(CRBN) directly ubiquitinated AMPK gamma. Taken together, these findings suggest that CRL4(CRBN) regulates AMPK through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of AMPK gamma.

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.

Copper is the only monometallic electrocatalyst capable of converting CO2 to value-added products, e.g., hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffers from poor selectivity and mediocre activity. Multiple oxidative treatments have shown improvements in the performance of copper catalysts. However, the fundamental underpinning for such enhancement remains controversial. Here, we combine reactivity, in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and computational investigations to demonstrate that the presence of surface hydroxyl species by co-electrolysis of CO2 with low concentrations of O-2 can dramatically enhance the activity of copper catalyzed CO2 electroreduction. Our results indicate that co-electrolysis of CO2 with an oxidant is a promising strategy to introduce catalytically active species in electrocatalysis.

High-frequency climate variability in the Holocene from a coastal-dome ice core in east-central Greenland	CLIMATE OF THE PAST			English	Article							STABLE WATER ISOTOPES; NORTH-ATLANTIC CLIMATE; SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; SEA-ICE; ARCTIC-OCEAN; DIFFUSION; SHEET; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; TRANSPORT	An ice core drilled on the Renland ice cap in eastcentral Greenland contains a continuous climate record dating through the last glacial period. The Renland record is valuable because the coastal environment is more likely to reflect regional sea surface conditions compared to inland Greenland ice cores that capture synoptic variability. Here we present the delta O-18 water isotope record for the Holocene, in which decadal-scale climate information is retained for the last 8 kyr, while the annual water isotope signal is preserved throughout the last 2.6 kyr. To investigate regional climate information preserved in the water isotope record, we apply spectral analysis techniques to a 300-year moving window to determine the mean strength of varying frequency bands through time. We find that the strength of 15-20-year delta O-18 variability exhibits a millennial-scale signal in line with the well-known Bond events. Comparison to other North Atlantic proxy records suggests that the 15-20-year variability may reflect fluctuating sea surface conditions throughout the Holocene, driven by changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Additional analysis of the seasonal signal over the last 2.6 kyr reveals that the winter delta O-18 signal has experienced a decreasing trend, while the summer signal has predominantly remained stable. The winter trend may correspond to an increase in Arctic sea ice cover, which is driven by a decrease in total annual insolation, and is also likely influenced by regional climate variables such as atmospheric and oceanic circulation. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the winter trend may have important implications for feedback processes as sea ice retreats in the Arctic.

The typical downsides are spatial and temporal gaps and potentially low data quality. Meaning-ful statistical inference from such data requires overcoming these problems and developing efficient and robust computational tools. We design and implement a computationally efficient multi-scale Gaussian process (GP) software pack-age, satGP, geared towards remote sensing applications. The software is able to handle problems of enormous sizes and to compute marginals and sample from the random field conditioning on at least hundreds of millions of observations. This is achieved by optimizing the computation by, e.g., randomization and splitting the problem into parallel local subproblems which aggressively discard uninformative data. We describe the mean function of the Gaussian process by approximating marginals of a Markov random field (MRF). Variability around the mean is modeled with a multi-scale covariance kernel, which consists of Matern, exponential, and periodic components. We also demonstrate how winds can be used to inform covariances locally. The covariance kernel parameters are learned by calculating an approximate marginal maximum likelihood estimate, and the validity of both the multi-scale approach and the method used to learn the kernel parameters is verified in synthetic experiments. We apply these techniques to a moderate size ozone data set produced by an atmospheric chemistry model and to the very large number of observations retrieved from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. The satGP software is released under an open-source license.

We train neural networks on single-particle shower data at the calorimeter-cell level, and show significant improvements for simulation and reconstruction when using these networks compared to methods which rely on currently-used state-of-the-art algorithms. We define two models: an end-to-end reconstruction network which performs simultaneous particle identification and energy regression of particles when given calorimeter shower data, and a generative network which can provide reasonable modeling of calorimeter showers for different particle types at specified angles and energies. We investigate the optimization of our models with hyperparameter scans. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the reconstruction model to shower inputs from other detector geometries, specifically ATLAS-like and CMS-like geometries. These networks can serve as fast and computationally light methods for particle shower simulation and reconstruction for current and future experiments at particle colliders.

Magnetic Field Fingerprinting of Integrated-Circuit Activity with a Quantum Diamond Microscope	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							MAGNETOMETER	Current density distributions in active integrated circuits result in patterns of magnetic fields that contain structural and functional information about the integrated circuit. Magnetic fields pass through standard materials used by the semiconductor industry and provide a powerful means to fingerprint integrated-circuit activity for security and failure analysis applications. Here, we demonstrate high spatial resolution, wide field-of-view, vector magnetic field imaging of static magnetic field emanations from an integrated circuit in different active states using a quantum diamond microscope (QDM). The QDM employs a dense layer of fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy (N- V) quantum defects near the surface of a transparent diamond substrate placed on the integrated circuit to image magnetic fields. We show that QDM imaging achieves a resolution of approximately 10 mu m simultaneously for all three vector magnetic field components over the 3.7 x 3.7 mm(2) field of view of the diamond. We study activity arising from spatially dependent current flow in both intact and decapsulated field-programmable gate arrays, and find that QDM images can determine preprogrammed integrated-circuit active states with high fidelity using machine learning classification methods.

Multifocal photoacoustic microscopy using a single-element ultrasonic transducer through an ergodic relay	LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS			English	Article							TIME-REVERSAL; TOMOGRAPHY	Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) has demonstrated high-spatial-resolution imaging of optical absorption in biological tissue. To date, most OR-PAM systems rely on mechanical scanning with confocally aligned optical excitation and ultrasonic detection, limiting the wide-field imaging speed of these systems. Although several multifocal OR-PA (MFOR-PA) systems have attempted to address this limitation, they are hindered by the complex design in a constrained physical space. Here, we present a two-dimensional (2D) MFOR-PAM system that utilizes a 2D microlens array and an acoustic ergodic relay. Using a single-element ultrasonic transducer, this system can detect PA signals generated from 400 optical foci in parallel and then raster scan the optical foci patterns to form an MFOR-PAM image. This system improves the imaging resolution of an acoustic ergodic relay system from 220 to 13 mu m and enables 400-folds shorter scanning time than that of a conventional OR-PAM system at the same resolution and laser repetition rate. We demonstrated the imaging ability of the system with both in vitro and in vivo experiments.	[Li, Yang; Wong, Terence T.

Surface Passivation and Positive Band-Edge Shift of p-Si(111) Surfaces Functionalized with Mixed Methyl/Trifluoromethylphenylacetylene Overlayers	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SI(111) SURFACES; MONOLAYERS; METHYL; ELECTRON; SILICON; DIPOLE; METAL; ALKYL; RECOMBINATION; SEMICONDUCTOR	Chemical functionalization of semiconductor surfaces can provide high-efficiency photoelectrochemical devices through molecular-level control of the energetics, surface dipole, surface electronic defects, and chemical reactivity at semiconductor/electrolyte junctions. We describe the covalent functionalization by nucleophilic addition chemistry of p-Si(111) surfaces to produce mixed overlayers of trifluoromethylphenylacetylene (TFMPA) and methyl moieties. Functionalization of Cl-terminated Si(111) surfaces with TFMPA moieties introduced a positive surface molecular dipole that in contact with CH3CN or Hg produced a positive band-edge shift of the semiconductor relative to junctions with CH3-Si(111) surfaces. Methylation of the Cl/TFMPA surfaces using methylmagnesium chloride resulted in the degradation of the TFMPA moieties, whereas methylation using methylzinc chloride allowed controlled production of mixed TFMPA/methyl-terminated surfaces and permitted reversal of the order of the functionalization steps so that nucleophilic addition of TFMPA could be accomplished after methylation of Cl-Si(111) surfaces. Mixed TFMPA/methyl functionalization resulted in a Si(111) surface with surface recombination velocities of 2 x 10(2) cm s(-1) that exhibited an similar to 150 mV positive band-edge shift relative to CH3-Si(111) surfaces.

Retrieval of cavity-generated atomic spin squeezing after free-space release	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							QUANTUM; ENTANGLEMENT; CLOCK; NOISE	We demonstrate that releasing atoms into free space from an optical lattice does not deteriorate cavity-generated spin squeezing for metrological purposes. In this work, an ensemble of 500 000 spin-squeezed atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity with near-uniform atom-cavity coupling is prepared, released into free space, recaptured in the cavity, and probed. Up to similar to 10 dB of metrologically relevant squeezing is retrieved for 700 mu s free-fall times, and decaying levels of squeezing are realized for up to 3 ms free-fall times. The degradation of squeezing results from loss of atom-cavity coupling homogeneity between the initial squeezed state generation and final collective state readout. A theoretical model is developed to quantify this degradation and this model is experimentally validated.

When low Earth-orbiting satellites reenter the atmosphere at end of mission, a measure to mitigate the generation of space debris, operators must limit the number of satellite components that reach the ground to ensure public safety. Inductively coupled plasma using an argon/air mixture to simulate reentry conditions is used to study ablation of BMG and conventional spacecraft alloys. Differential scanning calorimetry is used to determine the thermal properties of the alloys. BMGs are shown to ablate similarly to aluminum alloys (Al7075) and dramatically faster than titanium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V).

This is proposed on the basis of a direct effect on microglia-mediated frontocortical synaptic pruning (FSP) during adolescence, perhaps in genetically susceptible individuals harboring risk alleles in the complement component cascade that is involved in this normal process of CNS circuit refinement. In reviewing this field, it is argued that minocycline is actually probing and modulating a deeply evolved and intricate system wherein psychosocial stimuli sculpt the circuitry of the "social brain" underlying adult behavior and personality. Furthermore, this system can generate psychiatric morbidity that is not dependent on genetic variation. This view has important ramifications for understanding "pathologies" of human social behavior and cognition as well as providing long-sought potential mechanistic links between social experience and susceptibility to mental and physical disease.

A Super-Oxidized Radical Cationic Icosahedral Boron Cluster	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DODECABORATE; DERIVATIVES; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; BORANES; AGENTS; SALTS; ANION; ACIDS	While the icosahedral closo-[B12H12](2-) F cluster does not display reversible electrochemical behavior, perfunctionalization of this species via substitution of all 12 B-H vertices with alkoxy or benzyloxy (OR) substituents engenders reversible redox chemistry, providing access to clusters in the dianionic, monoanionic, and neutral forms. Here, we evaluated the electrochemical behavior of the electron-rich B-12(O-3-methylbutyl)(12) (1) cluster and discovered that a new reversible redox event that gives rise to a fourth electronic state is accessible through one-electron oxidation of the neutral species. Chemical oxidation of 1 with [N(2,4-Br2C6H3)(3)](center dot+) afforded the isolable [1](center dot+) cluster, which is the first example of an open-shell cationic B-12 cluster in which the unpaired electron is proposed to be delocalized throughout the boron cluster core. The oxidation of 1 is also chemically reversible, where treatment of [1](center dot+) with ferrocene resulted in its reduction back to 1. The identity of [1](center dot+ )is supported by EPR, UV-vis, multinuclear NMR (H-1, B-11), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic characterization.

Damage to the reservoir's spillway infrastructure necessitated evacuation of 188,000 people; subsequent infrastructure repairs cost $1 billion. We assess the atmospheric conditions, snowmelt, and runoff against major historical events. The event generated exceptional runoff volumes (second largest in a 30-yr record) partially at odds with the event precipitation totals (ninth largest). We explain the discrepancy with observed record melt of deep antecedent snowpack, heavy rainfall extending to unusually high elevations, and high water vapor transport during the atmospheric river storms. An analysis of distributed snow water equivalent indicates that snowmelt increased water available for runoff watershed-wide by 37% (25-52% at 90% confidence). The results highlight potential threats to public safety and infrastructure associated with a warmer and more variable climate.	[Henn, Brian; Ralph, F.

Wintertime Particulate Matter Decrease Buffered by Unfavorable Chemical Processes Despite Emissions Reductions in China	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SECONDARY AEROSOL CONTRIBUTION; PM2.5 AIR-QUALITY; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; METEOROLOGICAL MODES; INORGANIC AEROSOLS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; CMAQ MODEL; POLLUTION; NITRATE; OZONE	Extreme and persistent haze events frequently occur during wintertime China. While recent emissions reductions reduced annual mean fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations over eastern China, their effectiveness on wintertime PM2.5 trend remains uncertain. We use observations and model simulations to quantify seasonal differences in PM2.5 trends and investigate the underlying chemical mechanisms driving such differences. We find a much slower decrease in observed wintertime PM2.5 (-3.2% yr(-1)) since 2014, in contrast to a drastic summertime decrease (-10.3% yr(-1)). Simulations show two previously underappreciated mechanisms buffering wintertime PM2.5 decrease, including an increase in oxidation capacity due to nitrogen oxides (NOx) reductions under wintertime volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited chemistry, and an enhanced conversion of nitric acid to nitrate by ammonia due to sulfur dioxide reductions. Our findings suggest that control policies targeting VOC and deep NO(x)reductions are needed to improve wintertime PM2.5 air quality over China. Plain Language Summary Severe wintertime particulate matter (PM) pollution in China is an important environmental problem causing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Recent emissions reductions have gradually improved annual mean PM air quality in eastern China. However, our observational analysis unexpectedly shows a much weaker decrease in PM during winter compared with other seasons. State-of-the-art model simulations suggest that the weakened wintertime PM decline is mainly attributed to the increase in wintertime atmospheric oxidation capacity and the enhanced conversion of nitric acid to nitrate by ammonia, which are induced by anthropogenic emission reductions. Our findings indicate that previous pollution control policies did not effectively mitigate severe wintertime PM pollution due to these unfavored chemical processes. Stricter control policies targeting oxidants and wintertime emission sources are imperative to counteract the buffering chemical mechanisms over China.

Changes to these precipitation intensities,P, with long-term modes of climate variability have been hard to assess because they are not well represented in current climate models. Here we stratify a satellite climatology of convective systems by El Nino phase and cloud top temperature. We find that gains (losses) in high precipitation intensity (P & x2d9;> 10 mm hr(-1)) are largest for the deepest (least deep) systems during El Nino relative to La Nina. The surface temperature and wind changes that define El Nino manifest as surface flux changes but are not sufficient to explain theseP & x2d9;trends.

Midtropospheric drying in the vicinity of the deepest systems boosts instability and ascent rates during El Nino, while the strengthened large-scale ascent minimizes the drag force on their updrafts.

In this paper, we first discuss the expected noise sources in TKIDs and derive the limits where the phonon noise contribution dominates over the other detector noise terms: generation-recombination, amplifier, and two-level system noise. Second, we characterize aluminum TKIDs in a dark environment. We present measurements of TKID resonators with quality factors of about 10 5 at 80mK. We also discuss the bolometer thermal conductance, heat capacity, and time constants. These were measured by the use of a resistor on the thermal island to excite the bolometers. These dark aluminum TKIDs demonstrate a noise equivalent power, NEP = 2 x 10 - 17 W / Hz , with a 1 / f knee at 0.1Hz, which provides background noise limited performance for ground-based telescopes observing at 150GHz.

An agent, a stochastic model, propagates a continuous-time Monte Carlo trajectory and receives a reward conditioned upon the values of certain path-extensive quantities. Evolution produces progressively fitter agents, potentially allowing the calculation of a piece of a large-deviation rate function for a particular model and path-extensive quantity. For models with small state spaces, the evolutionary process acts directly on rates, and for models with large state spaces, the process acts on the weights of a neural network that parameterizes the model's rates. This approach shows how path-extensive physics problems can be considered within a framework widely used in machine learning.

In vivo anticancer activity of a rhodium metalloinsertor in the HCT116 tumor model	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						metal-DNA; DNA mismatch; cancer; metal therapeutic	MISMATCH REPAIR; SELECTIVE CYTOTOXICITY; MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; METAL-COMPLEXES; DNA-DAMAGE; CANCER; OXALIPLATIN; CISPLATIN; PHARMACOKINETICS	Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies are a hallmark of various cancers causing accumulation of DNA mutations and mismatches, which often results in chemotherapy resistance. Metalloinsertor complexes, including [Rh(chrysi)(phen)(PPO)]Cl2 (Rh-PPO), specifically target DNA mismatches and selectively induce cytotoxicity within MMR-deficient cells. Here, we present an in vivo analysis of Rh-PPO, our most potent metalloinsertor. Studies with HCT116 xenograft tumors revealed a 25% reduction in tumor volume and 12% increase in survival with metalloinsertor treatment (1 mg/kg; nine intraperitoneal doses over 20 d). When compared to oxaliplatin, Rh-PPO displays ninefold higher potency at tumor sites. Phar-macokinetic studies revealed rapid absorption of Rh-PPO in plasma with notable accumulation in the liver compared to tumors. Additionally, intratumoral metalloinsertor administration resulted in enhanced anticancer effects, pointing to a need for more selective delivery methods. Overall, these data show that Rh-PPO inhibits xenograft tumor growth, supporting the strategy of using Rh-PPO as a chemotherapeutic targeted to MMR-deficient cancers.

J	Chadwick, AJ; Lamb, MP; Ganti, V				Chadwick, Austin J.; Lamb, Michael P.; Ganti, Vamsi			Accelerated river avulsion frequency on lowland deltas due to sea-level rise	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						sea-level rise; river deltas; river avulsion	CHANNEL NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE; STRATIGRAPHY; PROGRADATION; AUTORETREAT; CONUNDRUM; DISCHARGE; SYSTEMS; STATE	Sea-level rise, subsidence, and reduced fluvial sediment supply are causing river deltas to drown worldwide, affecting ecosystems and billions of people. Abrupt changes in river course, called avulsions, naturally nourish sinking land with sediment; however, they also create catastrophic flood hazards. Existing observations and models conflict on whether the occurrence of avulsions will change due to relative sea-level rise, hampering the ability to forecast delta response to global climate change. Here, we combined theory, numerical modeling, and field observations to develop a mechanistic framework to predict avulsion frequency on deltas with multiple self-formed lobes that scale with backwater hydrodynamics. Results show that avulsion frequency is controlled by the competition between relative sea-level rise and sediment supply that drives lobe progradation. We find that most large deltas are experiencing sufficiently low progradation rates such that relative sea-level rise enhances aggradation rates-accelerating avulsion frequency and associated hazards compared to preindustrial conditions. Some deltas may face even greater risk; if relative sea-level rise significantly outpaces sediment supply, then avulsion frequency is maximized, delta plains drown, and avulsion locations shift inland, posing new hazards to upstream communities. Results indicate that managed deltas can support more frequent engineered avulsions to recover sinking land; however, there is a threshold beyond which coastal land will be lost, and mitigation efforts should shift upstream.

In a recent study, we have introduced a facile protocol for the preparation of corrole-protein nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs consist of a corrole-core coated with protein. We now report that a novel lipophilic corrole, (2)Ga, delivered as human serum albumin (HSA)-coated NPs, displayed antineoplastic activity towards human prostate cancer DU-145 cells. Cryo-TEM analysis of these NPs revealed an average diameter of 50.2 +/- 8.1 nm with a spherical architecture exhibiting low polydispersity. In vitro cellular uptake of (2)Ga/albumin NPs was attributable to rapid internalization of the corrole through ligand binding-dependent extracellular release and intercalation of the corrole cargo into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. This finding is in contrast with a previously reported study on corrole-protein NPs that displayed cellular uptake via endocytosis. Investigation of the non-light-induced mechanism of action of (2)Ga suggested the induction of necrosis through plasma membrane destabilization, impairment of calcium homeostasis, lysosomal stress and rupture, as well as formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). (2)Ga also exhibited potent light-induced cytotoxicity through ROS generation. These findings demonstrate a rapid cellular uptake of (2)Ga/protein NPs along with targeted induction of tumor cell necrosis.

Inspired by the card game blackjack, we focus on cooperative, two-party sequential games in which a single classical bit of communication is allowed from the player who moves first to the player who moves second. Within this setting, we explore the usage of quantum entanglement between the players and find analytic and numerical conditions for quantum advantage over classical strategies. Using these conditions, we study a family of blackjack-type games with varying numbers of card types, and find a range of parameters where quantum advantage is achieved.

Our latest global climate models (GCMs), however, have great difficulty in realistically simulating the MJO. This model inability is largely due to problems in representation of MJO's cumulus organization. This study, based on a series of idealized aqua-planet model experiments using an atmospheric-only GCM, clearly demonstrates that MJO propagation is strongly modulated by the large-scale background state in which the lower-tropospheric mean moisture gradient and zonal winds are critical. Therefore, when tuning climate models to achieve improved MJO simulations, particular attention needs to be placed on the model large-scale mean state that is also significantly affected by cumulus parameterizations. This study indicates that model biases in representing MJO propagation may be related to the widely reported double-ITCZ (intertropical convergence zone) problem in climate models.

Substrates possessing pendant aldehydes undergo decarboxylative enolate formation in the presence of a chiral Pd catalyst and subsequently participate in an enantio- and diastereoselective, intramolecular aldol reaction to furnish spirocyclic beta-hydroxy ketones which may be oxidized to the corresponding enantioenriched diketospiranes. Additionally, this chemistry has been extended to alpha-allylcarboxy lactam substrates leading to a formal synthesis of the natural product (-)-isonitramine.

Evaluation of sputtered nickel oxide, cobalt oxide and nickel-cobalt oxide on n-type silicon photoanodes for solar-driven O-2(g) evolution from water	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							OXYGEN-EVOLUTION; EFFICIENT; SI; ELECTROCATALYSTS; PERFORMANCE; PROTECTION; OXIDATION; LAYER; FILMS	Thin films of nickel oxide (NiOx), cobalt oxide (CoOx) and nickel-cobalt oxide (NiCoOx) were sputtered onto n-Si(111) surfaces to produce a series of integrated, protected Si photoanodes that did not require deposition of a separate heterogeneous electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The p-type transparent conductive oxides (p-TCOs) acted as multi-functional transparent, antireflective, electrically conductive, chemically stable coatings that also were active electrocatalysts for the oxidation of water to O-2(g). Relative to the formal potential for water oxidation to O-2,E-o '(O-2/H2O), under simulated Air Mass (AM)1.5 illumination the p-TCO-coated n-Si(111) photoanodes produced mutually similar open-circuit potentials of -270 +/- 20 mV, but different photocurrent densities atE(o)'(O-2/H2O), of 28 +/- 0.3 mA cm(-2)for NiOx, 18 +/- 0.3 mA cm(-2)for CoO(x)and 24 +/- 0.5 mA cm(-2)for NiCoOx. The p-TCOs all provided protection from oxide growth for extended time periods, and produced stable photocurrent densities from n-Si in 1.0 M KOH(aq) (ACS grade) under potential control atE(o)'(O-2/H2O) for >400 h of continuous operation under 100 mW cm(-2)of simulated AM1.5 illumination.

Unlike previous works, where crystal sizes demonstrated have been less than similar to 10 mu m, here, we show that by tuning the crystal growth conditions, crystals with dimensions greater than 100 mu m and of high electron mobility can be directly grown on oxides. Specifically, InAs-on-oxide with mobilities reaching 5100cm(2)/Vs at 100K, and similar to 3200cm(2)/Vs at room temperature has been demonstrated. The excellent electronic performance is due to the single crystallinity of the grown material and creates new avenues for the monolithic direct integration of high-performance materials on non-epitaxial substrates, including silicon, and amorphous substrates, such as glasses and metals.

Ultrafast hot-hole injection modifies hot-electron dynamics in Au/p-GaN heterostructures	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access							RELAXATION DYNAMICS; CARRIER; GOLD; NANOSTRUCTURES; CONVERSION; NANODOTS; SOLAR	A fundamental understanding of hot-carrier dynamics in photo-excited metal nanostructures is needed to unlock their potential for photodetection and photocatalysis. Despite numerous studies on the ultrafast dynamics of hot electrons, so far, the temporal evolution of hot holes in metal-semiconductor heterostructures remains unknown. Here, we report ultrafast (t < 200 fs) hot-hole injection from Au nanoparticles into the valence band of p-type GaN. The removal of hot holes from below the Au Fermi level is observed to substantially alter the thermalization dynamics of hot electrons, reducing the peak electronic temperature and the electron-phonon coupling time of the Au nanoparticles. First-principles calculations reveal that hot-hole injection modifies the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Au nanoparticles by modulating the electronic structure of the metal on timescales commensurate with electron-electron scattering. These results advance our understanding of hot-hole dynamics in metal-semiconductor heterostructures and offer additional strategies for manipulating the dynamics of hot carriers on ultrafast timescales. Photo-excited gold nanoparticles are shown to provide ultrafast and efficient hot-hole injection to the valence band of p-type GaN, substantially altering hot-electron dynamics in the nanoparticles and forming a basis to design hot-hole-based optoelectronics.

GPU-accelerated massive black hole binary parameter estimation with LISA	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DIRECT COLLAPSE; ACCRETION; SELECTION; WAVES	The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is slated for launch in the early 2030s. A main target of the mission is massive black hole binaries that have an expected detection rate of similar to 20 yr(-) (1). We present a parameter estimation analysis for a variety of massive black hole binaries. This analysis is performed with a graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation comprising the PhenomHM waveform with higher-order harmonic modes and aligned spins; a fast frequency-domain LISA detector response function; and a GPU-native likelihood computation. The computational performance achieved with the GPU is shown to be 500 times greater than with a similar CPU implementation, which allows us to analyze full noise-infused injections at a realistic Fourier bin width for the LISA mission in a tractable and efficient amount of time. With these fast likelihood computations, we study the effect of adding aligned spins to an analysis with higher-order modes by testing different configurations of spins in the injection, as well as the effect of varied and fixed spins during sampling. Within these tests, we examine three different binaries with varying mass ratios, redshifts, sky locations, and detector-frame total masses ranging over 3 orders of magnitude. We discuss varied correlations between the total masses and mass ratios; unique spin posteriors for the larger mass binaries; and the constraints on parameters when fixing spins during sampling, allowing us to compare to previous analyses that did not include aligned spins.

J	Wilson, EA; Wells, AJ; Hewitt, IJ; Cenedese, C				Wilson, Earle A.; Wells, Andrew J.; Hewitt, Ian J.; Cenedese, Claudia			The dynamics of a subglacial salt wedge	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						stratified flows; ocean processes	SUBMARINE MELT; TIDEWATER GLACIERS; 2-LAYER MODEL; SALINE WEDGE; DISCHARGE; IMPACT; DRIVEN; FJORDS; PLUMES; WALL	Marine-terminating glaciers, such as those along the coastline of Greenland, often release meltwater into the ocean in the form of subglacial discharge plumes. Though these plumes can dramatically alter the mass loss along the front of a glacier, the conditions surrounding their genesis remain poorly constrained. In particular, little is known about the geometry of subglacial outlets and the extent to which seawater may intrude into them. Here, the latter is addressed by exploring the dynamics of an arrested salt wedge - a steady-state, two-layer flow system where salty water partially intrudes a channel carrying fresh water. Building on existing theory, we formulate a model that predicts the length of a non-entraining salt wedge as a function of the Froude number, the slope of the channel and coefficients for interfacial and wall drag. In conjunction, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to observe a salt wedge within a rectangular channel. For experiments conducted with laminar flow (Reynolds number ), good agreement with theoretical predictions are obtained when the drag coefficients are modelled as being inversely proportional to . However, for fully turbulent flows on geophysical scales, these drag coefficients are expected to asymptote toward finite values. Adopting reasonable drag coefficient estimates for this flow regime, our theoretical model suggests that typical subglacial channels may permit seawater intrusions of the order of several kilometres. While crude, these results indicate that the ocean has a strong tendency to penetrate subglacial channels and potentially undercut the face of marine-terminating glaciers.

Climate change impacts on GWS (groundwater storage) could affect the sustainability of freshwater resources. Here, we used a fully-coupled climate model to investigate GWS changes over seven critical aquifers identified as significantly distressed by satellite observations. We assessed the potential climate-driven impacts on GWS changes throughout the 21(st) century under the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Results show that the climate-driven impacts on GWS changes do not necessarily reflect the long-term trend in precipitation; instead, the trend may result from enhancement of evapotranspiration, and reduction in snowmelt, which collectively lead to divergent responses of GWS changes across different aquifers. Finally, we compare the climate-driven and anthropogenic pumping impacts. The reduction in GWS is mainly due to the combined impacts of over-pumping and climate effects; however, the contribution of pumping could easily far exceed the natural replenishment. Climate change may impact groundwater storage and thus the availability of freshwater resources. Here the authors use climate models to examine seven aquifers and find that storage changes are primarily the result of enhancement of evapotranspiration, reduction in snowmelt, and over-pumping rather than long-term precipitation changes.

Structural basis for membrane insertion by the human ER membrane protein complex	SCIENCE			English	Article							CRYO-EM; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSLOCATION; MODULATION; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	A defining step in the biogenesis of a membrane protein is the insertion of its hydrophobic transmembrane helices into the lipid bilayer. The nine-subunit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC) is a conserved co- and posttranslational insertase at the ER. We determined the structure of the human EMC in a lipid nanodisc to an overall resolution of 3.4 angstroms by cryo-electron microscopy, permitting building of a nearly complete atomic model. We used structure-guided mutagenesis to demonstrate that substrate insertion requires a methionine-rich cytosolic loop and occurs via an enclosed hydrophilic vestibule within the membrane formed by the subunits EMC3 and EMC6. We propose that the EMC uses local membrane thinning and a positively charged patch to decrease the energetic barrier for insertion into the bilayer.

Odd-paired (Opa), a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed at cellularization, controls the transition of genes from pair-rule to segmental patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. Finding that Opa also regulates expression through enhancer sog_Distal along the dorso-ventral axis, we hypothesized Opa's role is more general. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) confirmed its in vivo binding to sog_Distal but also identified widespread binding throughout the genome, comparable to ZId. Furthermore, chromatin assays (ATAC-seq) demonstrate that Opa, like ZId, influences chromatin accessibility genome-wide at cellularization, suggesting both are pioneer factors with common as well as distinct targets. Lastly, embryos lacking opa exhibit widespread, late patterning defects spanning both axes. Collectively, these data suggest Opa is a general timing factor and likely late-acting pioneer factor that drives a secondary wave of zygotic gene expression.

This paper describes the experimental setup for process-based sea level change projections to be performed with stand-alone Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet models in the context of ISMIP6. The ISMIP6 protocol relies on a suite of polar atmospheric and oceanic CMIP-based forcing for ice sheet models, in order to explore the uncertainty in projected sea level change due to future emissions scenarios, CMIP models, ice sheet models, and parameterizations for ice-ocean interactions. We describe here the approach taken for defining the suite of ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, document the experimental framework and implementation, and present an overview of the ISMIP6 forcing to be used by participating ice sheet modeling groups.

This report summarizes the activities of the task group toward an IPPS ruby gauge. We have selected three different approaches to establishing the relation between pressure (P) and ruby R1-line shift (Delta lambda) with three groups of optimal reference materials for applying these approaches. Using a polynomial form of the second order, the recommended ruby gauge (referred as Ruby2020) is expressed by: P[GPa]=1.87(+/- 0.01) x 10(3) (Delta lambda/lambda(0))[1 + 5.63(+/- 0.03)(Delta lambda/lambda(0))], where lambda(0) is the wavelength of the R1-line near 694.25 nm at ambient condition. In June of 2020, the Executive Committee of AIRAPT endorsed the proposed Ruby2020. We encourage high-pressure practitioners to utilize Ruby2020 within its applicable pressure range (up to 150 GPa), so that pressure data can be directly compared across laboratories and amended consistently as better scales emerge in the future.

Utilizing aLIGO glitch classifications to validate gravitational-wave candidates	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY			English	Article						gravitational waves; detector characterization; LIGO		Advanced LIGO data contains numerous noise transients, or 'glitches', that have been shown to reduce the sensitivity of matched filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries. These glitches increase the rate at which random coincidences occur, which reduces the significance of identified gravitational-wave events. The presence of these transients has precipitated extensive work to establish that observed gravitational wave events are astrophysical in nature. We discuss the response of the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from stellar mass binaries to various common glitches that were observed during advanced LIGO's first and second observing runs. We show how these transients can mimic waveforms from compact binary coalescences and quantify the likelihood that a given class of glitches will create a trigger in the search pipeline. We explore the specific waveform parameters that are most similar to different glitch classes and demonstrate how knowledge of these similarities can be used when evaluating the significance of gravitational-wave candidates.

Electron tomography visualization of HIV-1 fusion with target cells using fusion inhibitors to trap the pre-hairpin intermediate	ELIFE			English	Article							IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN TRIMERS; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE; ENTRY INHIBITOR; MEMBRANE-FUSION; ENV; REVEALS; GP41; MATURATION; CD4	Fusion of HIV-1 with the membrane of its target cell, an obligate first step in virus infectivity, is mediated by binding of the viral envelope (Env) spike protein to its receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, on the cell surface. The process of viral fusion appears to be fast compared with viral egress and has not been visualized by EM. To capture fusion events, the process must be curtailed by trapping Env-receptor binding at an intermediate stage. We have used fusion inhibitors to trap HIV-1 virions attached to target cells by Envs in an extended pre-hairpin intermediate state. Electron tomography revealed HIV-1 virions bound to TZM-bl cells by 2-4 narrow spokes, with slightly more spokes present when evaluated with mutant virions that lacked the Env cytoplasmic tail. These results represent the first direct visualization of the hypothesized pre-hairpin intermediate of HIV-1 Env and improve our understanding of Env-mediated HIV-1 fusion and infection of host cells.

First, we initiate a systematic analysis and classification of classical and quantum A-polynomials associated to such q-series. These quantum quiver A-polynomials encode recursion relations satisfied by the above series, while classical A-polynomials encode asymptotic expansion of those series. Second, we postulate that those series, as well as their quantum quiver A-polynomials, can be reconstructed by means of the topological recursion. There is a large class of interesting quiver A-polynomials of genus zero, and for a number of them we confirm the above conjecture by explicit calculations. In view of recently found dualities, for an appropriate choice of quivers, these results have a direct interpretation in topological string theory, knot theory, counting of lattice paths, and related topics. In particular it follows, that various quantities characterizing those systems, such as motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants, various knot invariants, etc., have the structure compatible with the topological recursion and can be reconstructed by its means.

To date, nearly all map-level component separation in CMB analyses has been performed exclusively using satellite data. In this paper, we implement a component separation method based on the internal linear combination (ILC) approach which we have designed to optimally account for the anisotropic noise (in the 2D Fourier domain) often found in ground-based CMB experiments. Using this method, we combine multifrequency data from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) to construct the first wide-area (approximate to 2100 sq. deg.), arcminute-resolution component-separated maps of the CMB temperature anisotropy and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect sourced by the inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons off hot, ionized gas. Our ILC pipeline allows for explicit deprojection of various contaminating signals, including a modified blackbody approximation of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectral energy distribution. The cleaned CMB maps will be a useful resource for CMB lensing reconstruction, kinematic SZ cross-correlations, and primordial nonGaussianity studies. The tSZ maps will be used to study the pressure profiles of galaxies, groups, and clusters through cross-correlations with halo catalogs, with dust contamination controlled via CIB deprojection. The data products described in this paper are available on LAMBDA.

Impact of transforming to conformal Fermi coordinates on quasisingle field non-Gaussianity	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							INFLATIONARY UNIVERSE; FLATNESS; HORIZON	In general relativity, predictions for observable quantities can be expressed in a coordinate independent way. Nonetheless it may be inconvenient to do so. Using a particular frame may be the easiest way to connect theoretical predictions to measurable quantities. For the cosmological curvature bispectrum such frame is described by the conformal Fermi coordinates. In single field inflation it was shown that going to this frame cancels the squeezed limit of the density perturbation bispectrum calculated in global coordinates. We explore this issue in quasisingle field inflation when the curvaton mass and the curvaton-inflaton mixing are small. In this case, the contribution to the bispectrum from the coordinate transformation to conformal Fermi coordinates is of the same order as that from the inflaton-curvaton interaction term but does not cancel it.

Oxygenated Aromatic Compounds are Important Precursors of Secondary Organic Aerosol in Biomass-Burning Emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							STATISTICAL OXIDATION MODEL; RADICAL-INITIATED REACTIONS; GAS-PHASE OXIDATION; VAPOR WALL-LOSS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; HYDROXYL RADICALS; SMOKE; VOLATILITY; AIR; OH	Biomass burning is the largest combustion-related source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere. We describe the development of a state-of-the-science model to simulate the photochemical formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from biomass-burning emissions observed in dry (RH <20%) environmental chamber experiments. The modeling is supported by (i) new oxidation chamber measurements, (ii) detailed concurrent measurements of SOA precursors in biomass-burning emissions, and (iii) development of SOA parameters for heterocyclic and oxygenated aromatic compounds based on historical chamber experiments. We find that oxygenated aromatic compounds, including phenols and methoxyphenols, account for slightly less than 60% of the SOA formed and help our model explain the variability in the organic aerosol mass (R-2= 0.68) and O/C (R-2 = 0.69) enhancement ratios observed across 11 chamber experiments. Despite abundant emissions, heterocyclic compounds that included furans contribute to similar to 20% of the total SOA. The use of pyrolysis-temperature-based or averaged emission profiles to represent SOA precursors, rather than those specific to each fire, provide similar results to within 20%. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of accounting for oxygenated aromatics from biomass-burning emissions and their SOA formation in chemical mechanisms.

Following the TraCS of exoplanets with Pan-Planets: Wendelstein-1b and Wendelstein-2b	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planets and satellites: detection; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; stars: low-mass; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric; occultations	STELLAR; DESIGN; STARS	Hot Jupiters seem to get rarer with decreasing stellar mass. The goal of the Pan-Planets transit survey was the detection of such planets and a statistical characterization of their frequency. Here, we announce the discovery and validation of two planets found in that survey, Wendelstein-1b and Wendelstein-2b, which are two short-period hot Jupiters that orbit late K host stars. We validated them both by the traditional method of radial velocity measurements with the HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder instruments and then by their Transit Color Signature (TraCS). We observed the targets in the wavelength range of 4000 24 000 angstrom and performed a simultaneous multiband transit fit and additionally determined their thermal emission via secondary eclipse observations. Wendelstein-1b is a hot Jupiter with a radius of 1.0314(-0.0061)(+0.0061) R-J and mass of 0.592(-0.129)(+0.165) M-J, orbiting a K7V dwarf star at a period of 2.66 d, and has an estimated surface temperature of about 1727(-90)(+78) K. Wendelstein-2b is a hot Jupiter with a radius of 1.1592(-0.0210)(+0.0204) R-J and a mass of 0.731(-0.311)(+0.541) M-J, orbiting a K6V dwarf star at a period of 1.75 d, and has an estimated surface temperature of about 1852(-140)(+120) K. With this, we demonstrate that multiband photometry is an effective way of validating transiting exoplanets, in particular for fainter targets since radial velocity follow-up becomes more and more costly for those targets.

In animals, it is well established that cell shape can also influence cytoskeletal organization. Cytoskeletal proteins are well conserved between animal and plant kingdoms; nevertheless, because plant cells exhibit major structural differences to animal cells, the question arises whether the plant cytoskeleton also responds to geometrical cues. Recent numerical simulations predicted that a geometry-based rule is sufficient to explain the microtubule (MT) organization observed in cells. Due to their high flexural rigidity and persistence length of the order of a few millimeters, MTs are rigid over cellular dimensions and are thus expected to align along their long axis if constrained in specific geometries. This hypothesis remains to be tested in cellulo. Here, we explore the relative contribution of geometry to the final organization of actin and MT cytoskeletons in single plant cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the cytoskeleton aligns with the long axis of the cells. We find that actin organization relies on MTs but not the opposite. We develop a model of self-organizing MTs in three dimensions, which predicts the importance of MT severing, which we confirm experimentally. This work is a first step toward assessing quantitatively how cellular geometry contributes to the control of cytoskeletal organization in living plant cells.

The function of Nur77 in iNKT cells is unknown. Here we report that sustained Nur77 overexpression (Nur77(tg)) in mouse thymocytes abrogates iNKT cell development. Introgression of a rearranged V alpha 14-J alpha 18 TCR-alpha chain gene into the Nur77(tg) (Nur77(tg);V alpha 14(tg)) mouse rescued iNKT cell development up to the early precursor stage, stage 0. iNKT cells in bone marrow chimeras that reconstituted thymic cellularity developed beyond stage 0 pre-cursors and yielded IL-4-producing NKT2 cell subset but not IFN-gamma-producing NKT1 cell subset. Nonetheless, the developing thymic iNKT cells that emerged in these chimeras expressed the exhaustion marker PD1 and responded poorly to a strong glycolipid agonist. Thus, Nur77 integrates signals emanating from the TCR to control thymic iNKT cell tolerance induction, terminal differentiation, and effector functions.

MISMIP+ is intended to be a benchmark for ice-flow models which include fast sliding marine ice streams and floating ice shelves and in particular a treatment of viscous stress that is sufficient to model buttressing, where upstream ice flow is restrained by a downstream ice shelf. A set of idealized experiments first tests that models are able to maintain a steady state with the grounding line located on a retrograde slope due to buttressing and then explore scenarios where a reduction in that buttressing causes ice stream acceleration, thinning, and grounding line retreat. The majority of participating models passed the first test and then produced similar responses to the loss of buttressing. We find that the most important distinction between models in this particular type of simulation is in the treatment of sliding at the bed, with other distinctions - notably the difference between the simpler and more complete treatments of englacial stress but also the differences between numerical methods - taking a secondary role.

Redox priming promotes Aurora A activation during mitosis	SCIENCE SIGNALING			English	Article							DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS; CYSTEINE-SULFINIC ACID; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; STRUCTURAL BASIS; A KINASE; N-MYC; BINDING; DOMAIN; CYCLE	Cell cycle-dependent redox changes can mediate transient covalent modifications of cysteine thiols to modulate the activities of regulatory kinases and phosphatases. Our previously reported finding that protein cysteine oxidation is increased during mitosis relative to other cell cycle phases suggests that redox modifications could play prominent roles in regulating mitotic processes. The Aurora family of kinases and their downstream targets are key components of the cellular machinery that ensures the proper execution of mitosis and the accurate segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells. In this study, x-ray crystal structures of the Aurora A kinase domain delineate redox-sensitive cysteine residues that, upon covalent modification, can allosterically regulate kinase activity and oligomerization state. We showed in both Xenopus laevis egg extracts and mammalian cells that a conserved cysteine residue within the Aurora A activation loop is crucial for Aurora A activation by autophosphorylation. We further showed that covalent disulfide adducts of this residue promote autophosphorylation of the Aurora A kinase domain. These findings reveal a potential mechanistic link between Aurora A activation and changes in the intracellular redox state during mitosis and provide insights into how novel small-molecule inhibitors may be developed to target specific subpopulations of Aurora A.

Electron Microprobe/SIMS Determinations of Al in Olivine: Applications to Solar Wind, Pallasites and Trace Element Measurements	GEOSTANDARDS AND GEOANALYTICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						olivine; aluminium; Genesis; electron probe microanalysis; SIMS	ION MICROPROBE	Electron probe microanalyser measurements of trace elements with high accuracy are challenging. Accurate Al measurements in olivine are required to calibrate SIMS implant reference materials for measurement of Al in the solar wind. We adopt a combined EPMA/SIMS approach that is useful for producing SIMS reference materials as well as for EPMA at the similar to 100 mu g g(-1) level. Even for mounts not polished with alumina photoelectron spectroscopy shows high levels of Al surface contamination. In order to minimise electron beam current density, a rastered 50 x 100 mu m electron beam was adequate and minimised sensitivity to small Al-rich contaminants. Reproducible analyses of eleven SIMS-cleaned spots on San Carlos olivine agreed at 69.3 +/- 1.0 mu g g(-1). The known Al mass fraction was used to calibrate an Al implant into San Carlos. Accurate measurements of Al were made for olivines in the pallasites: Imilac, Eagle Station and Springwater. Our focus was on Al in olivine, but our technique could be refined to give accurate electron probe measurements for other contamination-sensitive trace elements. For solar wind, it is projected that the Al/Mg abundance ratio can be determined to 6%, a factor of 2 more precise than the solar spectroscopic ratio.

EREBUS: the EuRopean Extinction BUmp Survey	EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Dust; UV bump; Interstellar Medium	INTERSTELLAR DUST; ULTRAVIOLET; CURVES; SHAPES	Dust in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) is intimately linked to the life cycle of stars. Despite being of such fundamental importance to galaxy evolution, the dynamic behaviour and composition of the ISM are not yet fully understood. Observations of reddened Milky Way OB stars have revealed a strong UV extinction feature around 2175 angstrom and a precipitous extinction rise to the far UV along the lines of sight. Whilst the carrier(s) for this are at present still being debated, multiple laboratory studies suggest carbonate grains to be the key constituent.EREBUSis a mission concept being developed to study the composition of the ISM in both the Milky Way and Local Group Galaxies, primarily by mapping the spatial distribution of the UV extinction features. As these features are sensitive to the dust composition along the line of sight,EREBUSwill provide a wealth of information about the spatial distribution and dynamic behaviour of the carrier(s). The mission proposes to deploy a satellite observatory equipped with a coarse UV spectrograph to map the extinction curve variability in the Milky Way in 3 dimensions and in the Local Group in 2 dimensions. In this paper, we discuss the scientific goals for the project, discuss a proposed observation strategy using an iterative process to develop a hierarchical map, and finally outline the instrument requirements and preliminary spacecraft architecture.

Jeremy			High-contrast integral field spectrograph (HCIFS): multi-spectral wavefront control and reduced-dimensional system identification	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							ADAPTIVE OPTICS; 1ST LIGHT	Any high-contrast imaging instrument in a future large space-based telescope will include an integral field spectrograph (IFS) for measuring broadband starlight residuals and characterizing the exoplanet's atmospheric spectrum. In this paper, we report the development of a high-contrast integral field spectrograph (HCIFS) at Princeton University and demonstrate its application in multi-spectral wavefront control. Moreover, we propose and experimentally validate a new reduced-dimensional system identification algorithm for an IFS imaging system, which improves the system's wavefront control speed, contrast and computational and data storage efficiency.

J	Salahshoor, H; Shapiro, MG; Ortiz, M				Salahshoor, Hossein; Shapiro, Mikhail G.; Ortiz, Michael			Transcranial focused ultrasound generates skull-conducted shear waves: Computational model and implications for neuromodulation	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							IN-VIVO; BRAIN; ELASTICITY; NEUROSTIMULATION; PROPAGATION; REFLECTION	Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an established technique for non-invasive surgery and has recently attracted considerable attention as a potential method for non-invasive neuromodulation. While the pressure waves in FUS procedures have been extensively studied in this context, the accompanying shear waves are often neglected due to the relatively high shear compliance of soft tissues. However, in bony structures such as the skull, acoustic pressure can also induce significant shear waves that could propagate outside the ultrasound focus. Here, we investigate wave propagation in the human cranium by means of a finite-element model that accounts for the anatomy, elasticity, and viscoelasticity of the skull and brain. We show that, when a region on the scalp is subjected to FUS, the skull acts as a waveguide for shear waves that propagate with a speed close to 1500 m/s, reaching off-target structures such as the cochlea. In particular, when a sharp onset of FUS is introduced in a zone proximal to the intersection of the parietal and temporal cranium, the bone-propagated shear waves reach the inner ear in about 40 mu s, leading to cumulative displacements of about 1 mu m. We further quantify the effect of ramped and sharp application of FUS on the cumulative displacements in the inner ear. Our results help explain the off-target auditory responses observed during neuromodulation experiments and inform the development of mitigation and sham control strategies.

Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into a top and a bottom quark in the all-jet final state of pp collisions at root s=13 TeV	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Beyond Standard Model; Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Higgs physics	PAIR PRODUCTION; PLUS PLUS; PROGRAM; MASSES; MODEL; HDECAY; MSSM	A search for charged Higgs bosons (H-+/-) decaying into a top and a bottom quark in the all-jet final state is presented. The analysis uses LHC proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at root s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1). No significant excess is observed above the expected background. Model-independent upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the H-+/- production cross section and branching fraction in two scenarios. For production in association with a top quark, limits of 21.3 to 0.007 pb are obtained for H-+/- masses in the range of 0.2 to 3 TeV. Combining this with a search in leptonic final states results in improved limits of 9.25 to 0.005 pb. The complementary s-channel production of an H-+/- is investigated in the mass range of 0.8 to 3 TeV and the corresponding upper limits are 4.5 to 0.023 pb. These results are interpreted using different minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model.	[Sirunyan, A.

NMT1 sustains proliferation and/or survival of cancer cells through mechanisms that are not completely understood. We used genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NMT1 to further dissect the role of this enzyme in cancer, and found an unexpected essential role for NMT1 at promoting lysosomal metabolic functions. Lysosomes mediate enzymatic degradation of vesicle cargo, and also serve as functional platforms for mTORC1 activation. We show that NMT1 is required for both lysosomal functions in cancer cells. Inhibition of NMT1 impaired lysosomal degradation leading to autophagy flux blockade, and simultaneously caused the dissociation of mTOR from the surface of lysosomes leading to decreased mTORC1 activation. The regulation of lysosomal metabolic functions by NMT1 was largely mediated through the lysosomal adaptor LAMTOR1. Accordingly, genetic targeting of LAMTOR1 recapitulated most of the lysosomal defects of targeting NMT1, including defective lysosomal degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of NMT1 reduced tumor growth, and tumors from treated animals had increased apoptosis and displayed markers of lysosomal dysfunction. Our findings suggest that compounds targeting NMT1 may have therapeutic benefit in cancer by preventing mTORC1 activation and simultaneously blocking lysosomal degradation, leading to cancer cell death.

The Nature of the Mn(III) Color Centers in Elbaite Tourmalines	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ELECTRON-BEAM IRRADIATION; MN-RICH TOURMALINE; OPTICAL-SPECTRA; HEAT-TREATMENT; MANGANESE; SPECTROSCOPY; CHEMISTRY; AUSTRIA; ISLAND; MINE	The characteristic red color of many natural tourmalines is due to the presence of Mn(III) cations substituting for aluminum and lithium. These sites originate as Mn(II) and are oxidized by natural gamma-irradiation over geologic time as they sit in the Earth's crust. Presented here is a thorough analysis of the spin-allowed and spin-forbidden transitions which give rise to the color of these gemstones. Ligand field analysis, supplemented by time-dependent density functional theory, was used to correct the historical assignments of the symmetry-allowed transitions in the polarized UV-visible absorption spectrum. Heat-induced reduction of the oxidized manganese sites provided a probe of the relationship between the spin-allowed and spin-forbidden bands. Notably, the intensity of the spin-forbidden transition was highly dependent on the neighboring ions in the Y-site. Simulations and modeling showed that increased intensity was observed only when two Mn(III) ions occupied adjacent substitutions in the Y-site via a proposed exchange-coupling mechanism.

CMS Collaboration	Measurement of the cross section for t(t)over-bar production with additional jets and b jets in pp collisions at root s=13TeV	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Jets; Top physics	TOP-QUARK PAIR; PLUS PLUS; ASSOCIATION	Measurements of the cross section for the production of top quark pairs in association with a pair of jets from bottom quarks (sigma(t (t) over barb (b) over bar)) and in association with a pair of jets from quarks of any flavor or gluons (sigma(t (t) over bar jj)) and their ratio are presented. The data were collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1). The measurements are performed in a fiducial phase space and extrapolated to the full phase space, separately for the dilepton and lepton+jets channels, where lepton corresponds to either an electron or a muon. The results of the measurements in the fiducial phase space for the dilepton and lepton+jets channels, respectively, are sigma(t (t) over bar jj) = 2.36 +/- 0.02 (stat)+/- 0.20 (syst) pb and 31.0 +/- 0.2 (stat)+/- 2.9 (syst) pb, and for the cross section ratio 0.017 +/- 0.001 (stat)+/- 0.001 (syst) and 0.020 +/- 0.001 (stat)+/- 0.001 (syst). The values of sigma(t (t) over barb (b) over bar) are determined from the product of the sigma(t (t) over bar jj) and the cross section ratio, obtaining, respectively, 0.040 +/- 0.002 (stat)+/- 0.005 (syst) pb and 0.62 +/- 0.03 (stat)+/- 0.07 (syst) pb. These measurements are the most precise to date and are consistent, within the uncertainties, with the standard model expectations obtained using a matrix element calculation at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics matched to a parton shower.

Sensitivity of idealized mixed-phase stratocumulus to climate perturbations	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						Arctic stratocumulus; large-eddy simulation; mixed-layer model; mixed-phase clouds	LARGE-EDDY SIMULATIONS; CLOUD-TOP ENTRAINMENT; ARCTIC AIR FORMATION; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; LAYER MODEL; SURFACE; PARAMETERIZATION; FEEDBACKS; MOISTURE; TRANSPORT	Large-eddy simulations (LESs) that explicitly resolve boundary layer (BL) turbulence and clouds are used to explore the sensitivity of idealized Arctic BL clouds to climate perturbations. The LESs focus on conditions resembling springtime, when surface heat fluxes over sea ice are weak, and the cloud radiative effect is dominated by the long-wave effect. In the LES, the condensed water path increases with BL temperature and free-tropospheric relative humidity, but it decreases with inversion strength. The dependencies of cloud properties on environmental variables exhibited by the LES can largely be reproduced by a mixed-layer model. Mixed-layer model analysis shows that the liquid water path increases with warming because the liquid water gradient increase under warming overcompensates for geometric cloud thinning. This response contrasts with the response of subtropical stratocumulus to warming, whose liquid water path decreases as the clouds thin geometrically under warming. The results suggest that methods used to explain the response of lower-latitude BL clouds to climate change can also elucidate changes in idealized Arctic BL clouds, although subtropical and Arctic clouds occupy different thermodynamic regimes.

We prove that ifMis not anFp-homology sphere, thenN approximately equal to MxKfor a homology manifoldKsuch that the action ofHomeo0(M)onMis natural and onKis trivial. We also prove that whenM=Sna sphere, any nontrivial action is a generalization of the 'coning-off' construction.

In many of these problem domains, the row-column space structure of a low rank matrix carries information about some underlying phenomenon, and it is of interest in inferential settings to evaluate the extent to which the row-column spaces of an estimated low rank matrix signify discoveries about the phenomenon. However, in contrast with variable selection, we lack a formal framework to assess true or false discoveries in low rank estimation; in particular, the key source of difficulty is that the standard notion of a discovery is a discrete notion that is ill suited to the smooth structure underlying low rank matrices. We address this challenge via ageometricreformulation of the concept of a discovery, which then enables a natural definition in the low rank case. We describe and analyse a generalization of the stability selection method of Meinshausen and Buhlmann to control for false discoveries in low rank estimation, and we demonstrate its utility compared with previous approaches via numerical experiments.

Epidemiological parameters for assessing the stage of the outbreak, such as the Effective Reproduction Number (R-t), are not always straightforward to calculate, raising barriers between the scientific community and non-scientific decision-making actors. The combination of estimators ofR(t)with elaborated Machine Learning-based forecasting techniques provides a way to support decision-making when assessing governmental plans of action. In this work, we develop forecast models applying logistic growth strategies and auto-regression techniques based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for each country that records information about the COVID-19 outbreak. Using the forecast for the main variables of the outbreak, namely the number of infected (I), recovered (R), and dead (D) individuals, we provide a real-time estimation ofR(t)and its temporal evolution within a timeframe. With such models, we evaluateR(t)trends at the continental and country levels, providing a clear picture of the effect governmental actions have had on the spread. We expect this methodology of combining forecast models for raw data to calculateR(t)to serve as valuable input to support decision-making related to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

This paper, in contrast, demonstrates that a regional understanding of palaeoriver kinematics, depositional setting and sedimentation rates can be interpreted from local sedimentological measurements of bedform and barform strata. Dune and bar strata, channel planform geometry and bed topography are measured within exhumed fluvial strata exposed as ridges in the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah, USA. The ridges are composed of lithified stacked channel belts, representing at least five or six re-occupations of a single-strand channel. Lateral sections reveal well-preserved barforms constructed of subaqueous dune cross-sets. The topography of palaeobarforms is preserved along the top surface of the outcrops. Comparisons of the channel-belt centreline to local palaeotransport directions indicate that channel planform geometry was preserved through the re-occupations, rather than being obscured by lateral migration. Rapid avulsions preserved the state of the active channel bed and its individual bars at the time of abandonment. Inferred minimum sedimentation durations for the preserved elements, inferred from cross-set thickness distributions and assumed bedform migration rates, vary within a belt from one to ten days. Using only these local sedimentological measurements, the depositional setting is interpreted as a fluvial megafan, given the similarity in river kinematics. This paper provides a systematic methodology for the future synthesis of vertical and planview data, including the drone-equipped 2020 Mars Rover mission, to exhumed fluvial and deltaic strata.

CMS Collaboration	The production of isolated photons in PbPb and pp collisions at root s(NN)=5.02 TeV	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Heavy-ion collision; Photon production		The transverse energy (ET gamma) spectra of photons isolated from other particles are measured using proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at the LHC at root s(NN) = 5.02 TeV with integrated luminosities of 27.4 pb(-1) and 404 mu b(-1) for pp and PbPb data, respectively. The results are presented for photons with 25 < E-T(gamma)< 200 GeV in the pseudorapidity range vertical bar eta vertical bar < 1.44, and for different centrality intervals for PbPb collisions. Photon production in PbPb collisions is consistent with that in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, demonstrating that photons do not interact with the quark-gluon plasma. Therefore, isolated photons can provide information about the initial energy of the associated parton in photon+jet measurements. The results are compared with predictions from the next-to-leading-order jetphox generator for different parton distribution functions (PDFs) and nuclear PDFs (nPDFs). The comparisons can help to constrain the nPDFs global fits.	[Sirunyan, A.

While the cancellation of parametric temperature dependencies has been shown to improve the temperature robustness of the period in a synthetic oscillator design, the performance of other biomolecular circuit designs in different temperature conditions is relatively unclear. Using a combination of experimental measurements and mathematical models, we assessed the temperature robustness of two biomolecular circuit motifs-a negative feedback loop and a feedforward loop. We found that the measured responses of both the circuits changed with temperature, both in the amplitude and in the transient response. We also found that, in addition to the cancellation of parametric temperature dependencies, certain parameter regimes could facilitate the temperature robustness of the negative feedback loop, although at a performance cost We discuss these parameter regimes in the context of the measured data for the negative feedback loop. These results should help develop a framework for assessing and designing temperature robustness in biomolecular circuits.

The selection of species analysed contained a range of geometric isomers and differing functionalities, allowing for the impacts of these factors on saturation vapour pressure (P-sat) to be probed. Three subsets of nitroaromatics were investigated: nitrophenols, nitrobenzaldehydes and nitrobenzoic acids. The P-S(sat) values were converted to subcooled liquid saturation vapour pressure (P-L(sat)) values using experimental enthalpy of fusion and melting point values measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The P-L(sat) at values were compared to those estimated by predictive techniques and, with a few exceptions, were found to be up to 7 orders of magnitude lower. The large differences between the estimated P(L)(sat )and the experimental values can be attributed to the predictive techniques not containing parameters to adequately account for functional group positioning around an aromatic ring, or the interactions between said groups. When comparing the experimental P-S(sat) at of the measured compounds, the ability to hydrogen bond (H bond) and the strength of the H bond formed appear to have the strongest influence on the magnitude of the P-sat, with steric effects and molecular weight also being major factors. Comparisons were made between the KEMS system and data from diffusion-controlled evaporation rates of single partides in an electrodynamic balance (EDB). The KEMS and the EDB showed good agreement with each other for the compounds investigated.	[Shelley, Petroc D.; Bannan, Thomas J.; Alfarra, M.

Chemical characterization of secondary organic aerosol at a rural site in the southeastern US: insights from simultaneous high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and FIGAERO chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ALPHA-PINENE PHOTOOXIDATION; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; UNITED-STATES; ISOPRENE EPOXYDIOLS; REACTIVE NITROGEN; EPOXIDE FORMATION; MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPOUNDS; COLLECTION EFFICIENCIES; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; PHASE PHOTOOXIDATION	The formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) were investigated at Yorkville, GA, in late summer (mid-August to mid-October 2016). The organic aerosol (OA) composition was measured using two online mass spectrometry instruments, the high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and the Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight iodide-adduct chemical ionization mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-CIMS). Through analysis of speciated organics data from FIGAERO-CIMS and factorization analysis of data obtained from both instruments, we observed notable SOA formation from isoprene and monoterpenes during both day and night. Specifically, in addition to isoprene epoxydiol (IEPDX) uptake, we identified isoprene SOA formation from non-IEPDX pathways and isoprene organic nitrate formation via photooxidation in the presence of NOx and nitrate radical oxidation. Monoterpenes were found to be the most important SOA precursors at night. We observed significant contributions from highly oxidized acid-like compounds to the aged OA factor from FIGAERO-CIMS. Taken together, our results showed that FIGAERO-CIMS measurements are highly complementary to the extensively used AMS factorization analysis, and together they provide more comprehensive insights into OA sources and composition.

CMS Collaboration	Measurement of quark- and gluon-like jet fractions using jet charge in PbPb and pp collisions at 5.02 TeV	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Heavy-ion collision; Jets	RETENTION	The momentum-weighted sum of the electric charges of particles inside a jet, known as jet charge, is sensitive to the electric charge of the particle initiating the parton shower. This paper presents jet charge distributions in root sNN = 5.02 TeV lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. These data correspond to integrated luminosities of 404 mu b(-1)and 27.4 pb(-1)for PbPb and pp collisions, respectively. Leveraging the sensitivity of the jet charge to fundamental differences in the electric charges of quarks and gluons, the jet charge distributions from simulated events are used as templates to extract the quark- and gluon-like jet fractions from data. The modification of these jet fractions is examined by comparing pp and PbPb data as a function of the overlap of the colliding Pb nuclei (centrality). This measurement tests the color charge dependence of jet energy loss due to interactions with the quark-gluon plasma. No significant modification between different centrality classes and with respect to pp results is observed in the extracted quark- and gluon-like jet fractions.	[Sirunyan, A.

Although most biometric methods require direct contact between a device and a subject, gait recognition has unique characteristics whereby interaction with the subjects is not required and can be performed from a distance. Cameras are commonly used for gait recognition, and a number of researchers have used depth information obtained using an RGB-D camera, such as the Microsoft Kinect. Although depth-based gait recognition has advantages, such as robustness against light conditions or appearance variations, there are also limitations. For instance, the RGB-D camera cannot be used outdoors and the measurement distance is limited to approximately 10 meters. The present paper describes a long short-term memory-based method for gait recognition using a real-time multi-line LiDAR. Very few studies have dealt with LiDAR-based gait recognition, and the present study is the first attempt that combines LiDAR data and long short-term memory for gait recognition and focuses on dealing with different appearances. We collect the first gait recognition dataset that consists of time-series range data for 30 people with clothing variations and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Although the platform is a good Mott insulator, we propose experiments that electrically probe the spin liquid's hallmark chiral Majorana edge state and bulk anyons, including their exotic exchange statistics. We specifically introduce circuits that exploit interfaces between electrically active systems and Kitaev materials to "perfectly" convert electrons from the former into emergent fermions in the latter-thereby enabling variations of transport probes invented for topological superconductors and fractional quantum-Hall states. Along the way, we resolve puzzles in the literature concerning interacting Majorana fermions, and also develop an anyon-interferometry framework that incorporates nontrivial energy-partitioning effects. Our results illuminate a partial pathway toward topological quantum computation with Kitaev materials.

Mixed Hydrocarbon and Cyanide Ice Compositions for Titan's Atmospheric Aerosols: A Ternary-Phase Co-crystal Predicted by Density Functional Theory	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Titan aerosols; astrochemistry; molecular co-crystal; periodic DFT; hydrocarbon; hydrogen cyanide; IR spectroscopy; Raman spectroscopy	VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES; BENZENE; ACETONITRILE; ACETYLENE; DIFFRACTION; NAPHTHALENE; ETHANE	A benzene/acetylene/hydrogen cyanide co-crystal has been predicted using a periodic density functional theory approach based on the empirical structure of the 1:1 benzene and acetylene co-crystal. This example of a stable ternary-phase system-a three-component co-crystal comprising small neutral molecules-finds relevance as a possible Titan aerosol composition formed by the condensation of abundant volatile photoproducts in the lower stratosphere. Calculated thermochemical data confirm the 2C(6)H(6):C2H2:HCN co-crystal as a viable laboratory target, with free and cohesive energies competitive with those of binary-phase ices. Harmonic vibrational frequencies computed for the periodic system indicate that the co-crystal can be identified using low-frequency far-infrared or Raman spectroscopy, where distinctive intermolecular lattice signatures are predicted to lie. The geometry of the individual components within the unit cell appears optimal to promote ring-expansion chemistry upon ultraviolet or fast particle irradiation of the molecular co-crystal surface. Such co-crystal systems are unexplored in laboratory simulations of astrophysical ices and may have important implications for the solid-state formation of complex organic molecules in Titan's atmosphere.

Investigating the Impacts of Nonacyl Peroxy Nitrates on the Global Composition of the Troposphere Using a 3-D Chemical Transport Model, STOCHEM-CRI	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						upper troposphere; chemical transport model; surface distribution; zonal distribution; global budget; oxidation cycle; atmospheric lifetime; global fluxes; greenhouse gases	REACTIVE NITROGEN; RATE COEFFICIENTS; LAGRANGIAN MODEL; BRANCHING RATIOS; LIGHTNING NOX; OZONE; MECHANISM; PART; CH3O2NO2; PAN	Nonacyl peroxy nitrates, RO2NO2, act as a reservoir species for NOx in the upper troposphere. The low thermal stability of these compounds means that they only become a significant sink of NOx at the low temperatures observed in the upper troposphere. The chemical processes involved with the formation and degradation of methyl peroxy nitrate (CH3O2NO2) and an additional 44 RO2NO2 have been incorporated into the global three-dimensional chemical transport model, STOCHEM-CRI. The study investigates the effect of the addition of RO2NO2 chemistry on the budget of NOx, which in turn impacts the ozone, hydroxyl radical (OH), and nitrate radical (NO3) formation. This investigation found that the addition of CH3O2NO2 led to an increase in the tropospheric burdens of NOx (+3.0%), ozone (+2.0%), OH (+4.0%), and NO3 (+8.8%). However, the other 44 RO2NO2 contribute a significant increment of tropospheric global burdens of NQ (+4.4%), ozone (+3.4%), OH (+5.5%), and NO3 (+11.1%) with the largest mixing ratios of NOx of up to 25%, ozone up to 14%, OH up to 20%, and NO3 up to 50%. The increase in the global burden of oxidizing species such as OH due to the addition of 44 other RO2NO2 led to a significant decrease in the lifetimes of greenhouse gases such as methane (similar to 6%). The modeled mixing ratios of CH3O2NO2 were in reasonable agreement with measurements, the only extensive data set available.	[Khan, M.

The scan included firn and glacial ice and demonstrated that the instrument is able to determine small (mm) and large (cm) scale regions of organic matter concentration and discriminate spectral types of organic matter at high resolution. Both a linear point cloud scanning mode and a raster mapping mode were used to detect and localize microbial and organic matter "hotspots" embedded in the ice. Our instrument revealed diverse spectral signatures. Most hotspots were <20 mm in diameter, clearly isolated from other hotspots, and distributed stochastically; there was no evidence of layering in the ice at the fine scales examined (100 mu m per pixel). The spectral signatures were consistent with organic matter fluorescence from microbes, lignins, fused-ring aromatic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and biologically derived materials such as fulvic acids.In situdetection of organic matter hotspots in ice prevents loss of spatial information and signal dilution when compared with traditional bulk analysis of ice core meltwaters.

Correlated insulators and superconductivity have been previously observed only for angles within 0.1 degree of the magic angle and occur in adjacent or overlapping electron-density ranges; nevertheless, the origins of these states and the relation between them remain unclear, owing to their sensitivity to microscopic details. Beyond twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase diagram on the alignment(4,6)and thickness of the insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)(7,8)used to encapsulate the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the microscopic dielectric environment. Here we show that adding an insulating tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer between the hBN and the TBG stabilizes superconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the magic angle. For the smallest twist angle of 0.79 degrees, superconductivity is still observed despite the TBG exhibiting metallic behaviour across the whole range of electron densities. Finite-magnetic-field measurements further reveal weak antilocalization signatures as well as breaking of fourfold spin-valley symmetry, consistent with spin-orbit coupling induced in the TBG via its proximity to WSe2. Our results constrain theoretical explanations for the emergence of superconductivity in TBG and open up avenues towards engineering quantum phases in moire systems. Placing a single layer of tungsten diselenide in contact with twisted bilayer graphene enables superconductivity even for non-magic twist angles where insulating behavior is absent.

Bacterial chemolithoautotrophy via manganese oxidation	NATURE			English	Article							NITRITE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA; TARGETED OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES; PHOTOTROPHIC FE(II) OXIDATION; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; GEN-NOV-SP; COMPLETE NITRIFICATION; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; IRON OXIDATION; REDUCTION; GROWTH	Manganese is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The oxidation of manganese has long been theorized(1)-yet has not been demonstrated(2-4)-to fuel the growth of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Here we refine an enrichment culture that exhibits exponential growth dependent on Mn(II) oxidation to a co-culture of two microbial species. Oxidation required viable bacteria at permissive temperatures, which resulted in the generation of small nodules of manganese oxide with which the cells associated. The majority member of the culture-which we designate 'CandidatusManganitrophus noduliformans'-is affiliated to the phylum Nitrospirae (also known as Nitrospirota), but is distantly related to known species ofNitrospiraandLeptospirillum. We isolated the minority member, a betaproteobacterium that does not oxidize Mn(II) alone, and designate itRamlibacter lithotrophicus. Stable-isotope probing revealed(13)CO(2)fixation into cellular biomass that was dependent upon Mn(II) oxidation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed candidate pathways for coupling extracellular manganese oxidation to aerobic energy conservation and autotrophic CO(2)fixation. These findings expand the known diversity of inorganic metabolisms that support life, and complete a biogeochemical energy cycle for manganese(5,6)that may interface with other major global elemental cycles. A co-culture of two newly identified microorganisms-'CandidatusManganitrophus noduliformans' andRamlibacter lithotrophicus-exhibits exponential growth that is dependent on manganese(II) oxidation, demonstrating the viability of this metabolism for supporting life.

Erythemal Radiation, Column Ozone, and the North American Monsoon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						erythemal; convection; monsoon	EXTRATROPICAL LOWER STRATOSPHERE; CONTINENTAL UNITED-STATES; WATER-VAPOR; CONVECTION; PRECIPITATION; LAYER; HCL	Recently, Anderson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1222978, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619318114) and Anderson and Clapp (2018, https://doi.org/10.1039/C7CP08331A) proposed that summertime convectively injected water vapor over North America could lead to stratospheric ozone depletion through halogenic catalytic reactions. Such ozone loss would reduce the ozone column and increase erythemal daily dose (EDD). Using 10 years of observations over the North American monsoon region from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument, we find that the column ozone and EDD has a similar to 0.8-0.9 spatial correlation with lower stratospheric water vapor measured by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. We show that this correlation appears to be due to the elevation of the monsoonal tropopause and associated monsoonal convection. The increase in tropopause altitude reduces the ozone column and increases EDD. We see no apparent evidence of substantial heterogeneous chemical ozone loss in lower stratospheric ozone coincident with the stratospheric monsoonal water vapor enhancement. Plain Language Summary Anomalously high surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation is present over southwest United States during the July-August North American monsoon. This elevated radiation results from the lifting of the tropopause and subsequent reduction of the ozone column. Simultaneously, water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) increases as a result of the monsoon convection. Thus, summer monsoon increases in UV radiation and the erythemal daily dosage are correlated with enhanced UTLS water vapor, but this correlation does not appear to be a signal of unusual stratospheric chemical ozone loss.

The interaction of fluorescence with photochemistry at the leaf and canopy scales provides opportunities to diagnose and constrain model simulations of photosynthesis and related processes, through direct comparison to and assimilation of tower, airborne, and satellite data. TBMs describe key processes related to the absorption of sunlight, leaf-level fluorescence emission, scattering, and reabsorption throughout the canopy. Here, we analyze simulations from an ensemble of process-based TBM-SIF models (SiB3 - Simple Bio-sphere Model, SiB4, CLM4.5 - Community Land Model, CLM5.0, BETHY - Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology, ORCHIDEE - Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems, and BEPS - Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator) and the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy) canopy radiation and vegetation model at a subalpine evergreen needleleaf forest near Niwot Ridge, Colorado. These models are forced with local meteorology and analyzed against tower-based continuous far-red SIF and gross-primary-productivity-partitioned (GPP) eddy covariance data at diurnal and synoptic scales during the growing season (July-August 2017). Our primary objective is to summarize the site-level state of the art in TBM-SIF modeling over a relatively short time period (summer) when light, canopy structure, and pigments are similar, setting the stage for regional- to global-scale analyses. We find that these models are generally well constrained in simulating photosynthetic yield but show strongly divergent patterns in the simulation of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), absolute GPP and fluorescence, quantum yields, and light response at the leaf and canopy scales. This study highlights the need for mechanistic modeling of non-photochemical quenching in stressed and unstressed environments and improved the representation of light absorption (APAR), distribution of light across sunlit and shaded leaves, and radiative transfer from the leaf to the canopy scale.

Recent work has shown evidence for an Arctic sea ice spring predictability barrier, which may impose a sharp limit on regional forecasts initialized prior to spring. However, the physical mechanism for this barrier has remained elusive. In this work, we perform a daily sea ice mass (SIM) budget analysis in large ensemble experiments from two global climate models to investigate the mechanisms that underpin the spring predictability barrier. We find that predictability is limited in winter months by synoptically driven SIM export and negative feedbacks from sea ice growth. The spring barrier results from a sharp increase in predictability at melt onset, when ice-albedo feedbacks act to enhance and persist the preexisting export-generated mass anomaly. These results imply that ice thickness observations collected after melt onset are particularly critical for summer Arctic sea ice predictions.

High-fidelity models of the dynamics of impacts in such material are needed to help with the interpretation of seismic signals that are now recorded by SEIS, the seismometer of InSight. We developed a numerical model for impacts on regolith, using the novel Hybrid Optimization Software Suite (HOSS), which is a Lagrangian code mixing finite and discrete element formulations. We use data from hypervelocity impact experiments performed on pumice sand at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range to identify and calibrate key model parameters. The model provides insight into the plastic-elastic transition observed in the data and it also demonstrates that gravity plays a key role in the material response. Waveforms for receivers situated vertically below the impact point are correctly modeled, while more research is needed to explain the shallow receivers' signals.

Here we present a very similar WACC pattern over the NA sector on both interannual and subseasonal time scales. Lead-lag regression analyses on the shorter time scale indicate that an anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Alaska/Yukon in conjunction with the downward surface turbulent heat flux and long-wave radiation anomalies over CBS leads the formation of the WACC pattern by about 1-2 days, while the latter further leads CBS sea ice reduction by about 3 days. These results indicate that atmospheric variability may play an active role in driving both the WACC pattern over NA and CBS sea ice variability.

J	Kalousova, K; Sotin, C				Kalousova, Klara; Sotin, Christophe			The Insulating Effect of Methane Clathrate Crust on Titan's Thermal Evolution	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Titan</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; clathrates</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; thermal evolution</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; ocean</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>	GRAVITY-FIELD; ICE SHELL; LIQUID; DEFORMATION; CONVECTION; SATELLITES; ATMOSPHERE; CHEMISTRY; ORIGIN; IMPACT	Saturn's largest moon Titan is unique for its dense, methane-rich atmosphere, with ongoing complex organics chemistry, and the hydrocarbon lakes and seas on its frigid surface. Titan also harbors a subsurface water ocean, and its ice shell is likely capped by a thick crust of low-conductivity methane clathrates that are very stable under Titan's surface conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of this insulating clathrate crust on convection in the ice shell. Without the clathrate crust, convection occurs below a stagnant lid that is a few tens of kilometers thick and limits the exchange between the surface and the deep ocean. We show that a 5-10 km thick clathrate crust reduces the stagnant lid thickness about threefold thus increasing the potential for the ocean-surface exchange. Moreover, the insulating effect of clathrates dramatically decreases the amount of extracted heat thus limiting the freezing rate of Titan's ocean.

We present a new bathymetry of its sub-ice shelf cavity using a three-dimensional inversion of airborne gravity data constrained by multibeam bathymetry at sea and a reconstruction of the bedrock from mass conservation on land. The new bathymetry is deeper than previously estimated with differences exceeding 500 m in a number of regions. When incorporated into an ocean model, it yields a better description of the spatial distribution of ice shelf melt, specifically along glacier grounding lines. While the melt intensity is overestimated because of a positive bias in ocean thermal forcing, the study reveals the main pathways along which warm oceanic water enters the cavity and corroborates the observed rapid retreat of Berry Glacier along a deep channel with a retrograde bed slope.

In particular, this approach provides observation-constrained quantification of the dust's dry and wet deposition along its transport pathways and is validated against multiple satellite observations. The current large ensemble trajectory simulations identify favorable transport pathways from the El Djouf across the Atlantic Ocean with respect to seasonal rain belts. The limited potential for long-range transport of dust from the Bodele depression is attributed to the currently identified extensive near-source dust removal primarily by dry and wet deposition during boreal winter and summer, respectively.

While it has been addressed and studied in the literature, the lack of practically feasible approaches to calculate the bearing capacity of soil in such a condition is tangible. In this study, simple analytical equations have been proposed to calculate the bearing capacity of liquefiable soils under shallow foundations. The equations have been developed for two cases, separated based on the thickness of liquefiable soils and width of foundation, each of which acting with different mechanisms. The proposed approach was evaluated versus field observations from the 1964 Niigata, the 1990 Luzon, and the 1999 Adapazari earthquakes, in addition to an assessment against numerical simulations. It was shown that the methodology is capable of estimating the bearing capacity of liquefiable soils under shallow foundations. The obtained results reveal that decreasing the thickness of the liquefiable layer as well as increasing foundation width leads to a higher bearing capacity. Finally, an easy to use design charts and simple equations have been derived for use in engineering practice.

Old growth Afrotropical forests critical for maintaining forest carbon	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						aboveground biomass; carbon; Central Africa; climate change; Gabon; large trees; tree height; tropical forest; wood density	ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; INCREASE; DENSITY; STOCKS; LAND; AREA	Aim Large trees [>= 70 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)] contribute disproportionately to aboveground carbon stock (AGC) across the tropics but may be vulnerable to changing climate and human activities. Here we determine the distribution, drivers and threats to large trees and high carbon forest. Location Central Africa. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods Using Gabon's new National Resource Inventory of 104 field sites, AGC was calculated from 67,466 trees from 578 species and 97 genera. Power and Michaelis-Menten models assessed the contribution of large trees to AGC. Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of AGC, large trees, and stand variables were modelled using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) weights to calculate average regression coefficients for all p ossible models. Results Mean AGC for trees >= 10 cm DBH in Gabonese forestlands was 141.7 Mg C/ha, with averages of 166.6, 171.3 and 96.6 Mg C/ha in old growth, concession and secondary forest. High carbon forests occurred where large trees are most abundant: 31% of AGC was stored in large trees (2.3% of all stems). Human activities largely drove variation in AGC and large trees, but climate and edaphic conditions also determined stand variables (basal area, tree height, wood density, stem density). AGC and large trees increased with distance from human settlements; AGC was 40% lower in secondary than primary and concession forests and 33% higher in protected than non-managed areas. Main conclusions AGC and large trees were negatively associated with human activities, highlighting the importance of forest management. Redefining large trees as >= 50 cm DBH (4.3% more stems) would account for 20% more AGC. This study demonstrates that protecting relatively undisturbed forests can be disproportionately effective in conserving carbon and suggests that including sustainable forestry in programs like reduced emissions for deforestation and forest degradation could maintain carbon dense forests in logging concessions that are a large proportion of remaining Central African forests.

However, the high resolution causes a drawback in fabricating large-scale structures due to unacceptably long processing times. To solve this problem, we applied the patterned focus as the basic element for scanning processing. Theoretically, the relationship between patterned-focus scanning parameters and the uniformity of scanned light field was analyzed and optimized. Experimentally, we quantitatively investigated the relationship between the microstructure surface quality and the parameters of patterned-focus scanning. Based on above, we put forward a hybrid method that combines the femtosecond. laser patterned exposure with direct-writing fabrication to rapidly fabricate large-scale microfluidic devices for various practical applications.

Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 continue to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative importance of CH4 compared to CO2 depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). For the 2008-2017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (range 550-594, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble). Of this total, 359 Tg CH4 yr(-1) or similar to 60 % is attributed to anthropogenic sources, that is emissions caused by direct human activity (i.e. anthropogenic emissions; range 336-376 Tg CH4 yr(-1) or 50 %-65 %). The mean annual total emission for the new decade (2008-2017) is 29 Tg CH4 yr(-1) larger than our estimate for the previous decade (2000-2009), and 24 Tg CH4 yr(-1) larger than the one reported in the previous budget for 2003-2012 (Saunois et al., 2016). Since 2012, global CH4 emissions have been tracking the warmest scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Bottom-up methods suggest almost 30 % larger global emissions (737 Tg CH4 yr(-1), range 594-881) than top-down inversion methods. Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates. The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions (similar to 65 % of the global budget, < 30 degrees N) compared to mid-latitudes (similar to 30 %, 30-60 degrees N) and high northern latitudes (similar to 4 %, 60-90 degrees N). The most important source of uncertainty in the methane budget is attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and other inland waters. Some of our global source estimates are smaller than those in previously published budgets (Saunois et al., 2016; Kirschke et al., 2013). In particular wetland emissions are about 35 Tg CH4 yr(-1) lower due to improved partition wetlands and other inland waters. Emissions from geological sources and wild animals are also found to be smaller by 7 Tg CH4 yr(-1) by 8 Tg CH4 yr(-1), respectively. However, the overall discrepancy between bottomup and top-down estimates has been reduced by only 5 % compared to Saunois et al. (2016), due to a higher estimate of emissions from inland waters, highlighting the need for more detailed research on emissions factors. Priorities for improving the methane budget include (i) a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting methane based on a robust classification of different types of emitting habitats; (ii) further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii) intensification of methane observations at local scales (e.g., FLUXNET-CH4 measurements) and urban-scale monitoring to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scales (surface networks and satellites) to constrain atmospheric inversions; (iv) improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v) development of a 3D variational inversion system using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane to improve source partitioning.

Here we present a decade-plus analysis that integrates, for the first time, time series of satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface deformation and satellite thermal infrared edifice-scale surface warming at a large silicic system: Domuyo volcano, in Argentina. We find that deformation and warming are highly correlated, and depending on the sign and lag between the time series, either shallow sealing or magma influx could drive Domuyo's ongoing inflation (similar to 0.15 m/year; from an InSAR-derived tabular source, similar to 11x8x1 km; similar to 6.5 km depth; similar to 0.037 km(3)/year volume-change rate) and warming (0.3-0.4 degrees C/year). This study shows the potential that combined satellite surface deformation and edifice-scale surface warming time series have on assessing the physical mechanisms of silicic volcanic systems and for constraining deterministic models.

Emergent Hydrodynamics in Nonequilibrium Quantum Systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							MANY-BODY SYSTEM; PERIODICALLY DRIVEN; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; THERMALIZATION; CHAOS	A tremendous amount of recent attention has focused on characterizing the dynamical properties of periodically driven many-body systems. Here, we use a novel numerical tool termed "density matrix truncation" (DMT) to investigate the late-time dynamics of large-scale Floquet systems. We find that DMT accurately captures two essential pieces of Floquet physics, namely, prethermalization and late-time heating to infinite temperature. Moreover, by implementing a spatially inhomogeneous drive, we demonstrate that an interplay between Floquet heating and diffusive transport is crucial to understanding the system's dynamics. Finally, we show that DMT also provides a powerful method for quantitatively capturing the emergence of hydrodynamics in static (undriven) Hamiltonians; in particular, by simulating the dynamics of generic, large-scale quantum spin chains (up to L = 100), we are able to directly extract the energy diffusion coefficient.

Spatial structure in Neptune's 7.90-mu m stratospheric CH4 emission, as measured by VLT-VISIR	ICARUS			English	Article						Atmospheres, dynamics; Atmospheres, chemistry; Infrared observations; Neptune, atmosphere; Abundances, atmospheres	GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS; CLOUD STRUCTURE; SPACE-TELESCOPE; RESOLUTION; ATMOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; URANUS; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION	We present a comparison of VLT-VISIR images and Keck-NIRC2 images of Neptune, which highlight the coupling between its troposphere and stratosphere. VLT-VISIR images were obtained on September 16th 2008 (UT) at 7.90 mu m and 12.27 mu m, which are primarily sensitive to 1-mbar CH4 and C2H6 emission, respectively. NIRC2 images in the H band were obtained on October 5th, 6th and 9th 2008 (UT) and sense clouds and haze in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (from approximately 600 to 20 mbar). At 7.90 mu m, we observe enhancements of CH4 emission in latitude bands centered at approximately 25 degrees S and 48 degrees S (planetocentric). Within these zonal bands, tentative detections (< 2 sigma) of discrete hotspots of CH4 emission are also evident at 24 degrees S, 181 degrees W and 42 degrees S, 170 degrees W. The longitudinal-mean enhancements in the CH4 emission are also latitudinallycoincident with bands of bright (presumably CH4 ice) clouds in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere evidenced in the H-band images. This suggests the Neptunian troposphere and stratosphere are coupled in these specific regions. This could be in the form of (1) 'overshoot' of strong, upwelling plumes and advection of CH4 ice into the lower stratosphere, which subsequently sublimates into CH4 gas and/or (2) generation of waves by plumes impinging from the tropopause below, which impart their energy and heat the lower stratosphere. We favor the former process since there is no evidence of similar smaller-scale morphology in the C2H6 emission, which probes a similar atmospheric level. However, we cannot exclude temperature variations as the source of the morphology observed in CH4 emission. Future, near-infrared imaging of Neptune performed near-simultaneously with future mid-infrared spectral observations of Neptune by the James Webb Space Telescope would allow the coupling of Neptune's troposphere and stratosphere to be confirmed and studied in greater detail.

J	Tan, W; Liu, B				Tan, Wei; Liu, Burigede			A physically-based constitutive model for the shear-dominated response and strain rate effect of carbon fibre reinforced composites	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Plastic deformation; Micro-mechanics; Computational modelling	FAILURE CRITERIA; POLYMER COMPOSITES; PART I; THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE; INELASTIC DEFORMATION; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; HYDROSTATIC-PRESSURE; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR; PSEUDO-DUCTILITY	A significant hardening response is often observed for the shear-dominated deformation of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP). This non-linear response is typically modelled by fitting a strain hardening law against experimental stress-strain curves. Inspired by crystal plasticity framework, we develop a micro-mechanically motivated constitutive model to capture the matrix shearing and fibre rotation of CFRP under finite strain deformation and different strain rates. Strain rate dependency of the shear modulus and yield strength of the matrix was modelled through scaling functions. This physically-based constitutive model is first verified by simple shear and transverse compression tests, followed by comprehensive validations against the measured stress-strain responses of unidirectional (UD) and cross-ply composite laminates subjected to quasi-static and dynamic off-axis loading. The finite element predictions and analytical models of CFRP lamina under simple shear loading confirms that the initial yielding is governed by the shear yield strength of matrix, while the hardening behaviour is dependent on the modulus and rotation of carbon fibres. This model accurately predicts the non-linear behaviour of CFRP under off-axis loading at different strain rates, without the need of a curvefitted strain hardening law.

J	Mafi, A; Kim, SK; Goddard, WA				Mafi, Amirhossein; Kim, Soo-Kyung; Goddard, William A., III			Mechanism of beta-arrestin recruitment by the mu-opioid G protein-coupled receptor	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						biased agonists; nonbiased agonists; molecular dynamics	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MONTE-CARLO; FREE-ENERGY; PHOSPHORYLATION; MEMBRANE; DYNAMICS; BINDING; KINASE; DESENSITIZATION; VISUALIZATION	Agonists to the mu-opioid G protein-coupled receptor (mu OR) can alleviate pain through activation of G protein signaling, but they can also induce beta-arrestin activation, leading to such side effects as respiratory depression. Biased ligands to mu OR that induce G protein signaling without inducing beta-arrestin signaling can alleviate pain while reducing side effects. However, the mechanism for stimulating beta-arrestin signaling is not known, making it difficult to design optimum biased ligands. We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to determine three-dimensional (3D) structures of activated beta-arrestin2 stabilized by phosphorylated mu OR bound to the morphine and D-Ala2, N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) nonbiased agonists and to the TRV130 biased agonist. For nonbiased agonists, we find that the beta-arrestin2 couples to the phosphorylated mu OR by forming strong polar interactions with intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) and either the ICL3 or cytoplasmic region of transmembrane (TM6). Strikingly, Gi protein makes identical strong bonds with these same ICLs. Thus, the Gi protein and beta-arrestin2 compete for the same binding site even though their recruitment leads to much different outcomes. On the other hand, we find that TRV130 has a greater tendency to bind the extracellular portion of TM2 and TM3, which repositions TM6 in the cytoplasmic region of mu OR, hindering beta-arrestin2 from making polar anchors to the ICL3 or to the cytosolic end of TM6. This dramatically reduces the affinity between mu OR and beta-arrestin2.

Here, we report sta-ble NiPbOx films that are able to perform oxygen evolution reac-tion (OER) catalysis for extended periods of operation (>20 h) in acidic solutions of pH 2.5; conversely, native NiOx catalyst films dissolve immediately. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that PbO2 is un-perturbed after addition of Ni and/or Fe into the lattice, which serves as an acid-stable, conductive framework for embedded OER active centers. The ability to perform OER in acid allows the mechanism of Fe doping on Ni catalysts to be further probed. Catalyst activity with Fe doping of oxidic Ni OEC under acid con-ditions, as compared to neutral or basic conditions, supports the contention that role of Fe3+ in enhancing catalytic activity in Ni oxide catalysts arises from its Lewis acid properties.

This paper explains the design and philosophy behind PySCF that enables it to meet these twin objectives. With several case studies, we show how users can easily implement their own methods using PySCF as a development environment. We then summarize the capabilities of PySCF for molecular and solid-state simulations. Finally, we describe the growing ecosystem of projects that use PySCF across the domains of quantum chemistry, materials science, machine learning, and quantum information science.

Atomic force microscopy: Emerging illuminated and operando techniques for solar fuel research	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPY; HYDROGEN-EVOLUTION; CHARGE SEPARATION; OXYGEN-EVOLUTION; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; WATER OXIDATION; H-2 EVOLUTION; SI; PHOTOANODES; CATALYST	Integrated photoelectrochemical devices rely on the synergy between components to efficiently generate sustainable fuels from sunlight. The micro- and/or nanoscale characteristics of the components and their interfaces often control critical processes of the device, such as charge-carrier generation, electron and ion transport, surface potentials, and electrocatalysis. Understanding the spatial properties and structure-property relationships of these components can provide insight into designing scalable and efficient solar fuel components and systems. These processes can be probed ex situ or in situ with nanometer-scale spatial resolution using emerging scanning-probe techniques based on atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this Perspective, we summarize recent developments of AFM-based techniques relevant to solar fuel research. We review recent progress in AFM for (1) steady-state and dynamic light-induced surface photovoltage measurements; (2) nanoelectrical conductive measurements to resolve charge-carrier heterogeneity and junction energetics; (3) operando investigations of morphological changes, as well as surface electrochemical potentials, currents, and photovoltages in liquids. Opportunities for research include: (1) control of ambient conditions for performing AFM measurements; (2) in situ visualization of corrosion and morphological evolution of electrodes; (3) operando AFM techniques to allow nanoscale mapping of local catalytic activities and photo-induced currents and potentials.

Three short-period Jupiters from TESS: HIP 65Ab, TOI-157b, and TOI-169b	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planets and satellites: detection; planets and satellites: individual: TOI-129; planets and satellites: individual: HIP 65A; planets and satellites: individual: TOI-157	HOT-JUPITER; PLANET MIGRATION; ERROR-CORRECTION; ALL-SKY; STARS; BINARY; EVOLUTION; ORBITS; PERTURBATIONS; SPECTROSCOPY	We report the confirmation and mass determination of three hot Jupiters discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission: HIP 65Ab (TOI-129, TIC-201248411) is an ultra-short-period Jupiter orbiting a bright (V = 11.1 mag) K4-dwarf every 0.98 days. It is a massive 3.213 +/- 0.078 M-J planet in a grazing transit configuration with an impact parameter of b = 1.17(-0.08)(+0.10) b=1.17-0.08+0.10 . As a result the radius is poorly constrained, 2.03(-0.49)(+0.61)R(J) 2.03-0.49+0.61 RJ . The planet's distance to its host star is less than twice the separation at which it would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow. It is expected to spiral into HIP 65A on a timescale ranging from 80 Myr to a few gigayears, assuming a reduced tidal dissipation quality factor of Q(s)(') = 10(7) - 10(9) Qs ' =107-109 . We performed a full phase-curve analysis of the TESS data and detected both illumination- and ellipsoidal variations as well as Doppler boosting. HIP 65A is part of a binary stellar system, with HIP 65B separated by 269 AU (3.95 arcsec on sky). TOI-157b (TIC 140691463) is a typical hot Jupiter with a mass of 1.18 +/- 0.13 M-J and a radius of 1.29 +/- 0.02 R-J. It has a period of 2.08 days, which corresponds to a separation of just 0.03 AU. This makes TOI-157 an interesting system, as the host star is an evolved G9 sub-giant star (V = 12.7). TOI-169b (TIC 183120439) is a bloated Jupiter orbiting a V = 12.4 G-type star. It has a mass of 0.79 +/- 0.06 M-J and a radius of 1.09(-0.05)(+0.08)R(J) 1.09-0.05+0.08<mml:msub>RJ . Despite having the longest orbital period (P = 2.26 days) of the three planets, TOI-169b receives the most irradiation and is situated on the edge of the Neptune desert. All three host stars are metal rich with [Fe / H] ranging from 0.18 to0.24.	[Nielsen, L. D.; Bouchy, F.; Turner, O.; dos Santos, L.

Convenient removal of the coordinated Lewis acid was accomplished using polymer-supported 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The effects of borane Lewis acid coordination on the physical and spectroscopic properties of the pincer complexes were also assessed.

The time period from 10 January to 20 February 2017, when an international radar network observation campaign was performed, is focused on. The model resolution is T42L124, which can resolve phenomena at synoptic and larger scales. A conventional observation dataset provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, PREPBUFR, and satellite temperature data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) for the stratosphere and mesosphere are assimilated. First, the performance of the forecast model is improved by modifying the vertical profile of the horizontal diffusion coefficient and modifying the source intensity in the non-orographic gravity wave parameterization by comparing it with radar wind observations in the mesosphere. Second, the MLS observational bias is estimated as a function of the month and latitude and removed before the data assimilation. Third, data assimilation parameters, such as the degree of gross error check, localization length, inflation factor, and assimilation window, are optimized based on a series of sensitivity tests. The effect of increasing the ensemble member size is also examined. The obtained global data are evaluated by comparison with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data covering pressure levels up to 0.1 hPa and by the radar mesospheric observations, which are not assimilated.

Acoustic biosensors for ultrasound imaging of enzyme activity	NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; AAA+ PROTEASES; GAS; NANOSTRUCTURES; EXPRESSION; PRINCIPLES; BACTERIA; GENES; MODEL	Visualizing biomolecular and cellular processes inside intact living organisms is a major goal of chemical biology. However, existing molecular biosensors, based primarily on fluorescent emission, have limited utility in this context due to the scattering of light by tissue. In contrast, ultrasound can easily image deep tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution, but lacks the biosensors needed to connect its contrast to the activity of specific biomolecules such as enzymes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first genetically encodable acoustic biosensors-molecules that 'light up' in ultrasound imaging in response to protease activity. These biosensors are based on a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles, which we engineered to produce nonlinear ultrasound signals in response to the activity of three different protease enzymes. We demonstrate the ability of these biosensors to be imaged in vitro, inside engineered probiotic bacteria, and in vivo in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.

Van der Waals heterostructures obtained via stacking and twisting have been used to create moire superlattices(1), enabling new optical and electronic properties in solid-state systems. Moire lattices in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) result in exciton trapping(2-5), host Mott insulating and superconducting states(6)and act as unique Hubbard systems(7-9)whose correlated electronic states can be detected and manipulated optically. Structurally, these twisted heterostructures feature atomic reconstruction and domain formation(10-14). However, due to the nanoscale size of moire domains, the effects of atomic reconstruction on the electronic and excitonic properties have not been systematically investigated. Here we use near-0 degrees-twist-angle MoSe2/MoSe(2)bilayers with large rhombohedral AB/BA domains(15)to directly probe the excitonic properties of individual domains with far-field optics. We show that this system features broken mirror/inversion symmetry, with the AB and BA domains supporting interlayer excitons with out-of-plane electric dipole moments in opposite directions. The dipole orientation of ground-state Gamma-K interlayer excitons can be flipped with electric fields, while higher-energy K-K interlayer excitons undergo field-asymmetric hybridization with intralayer K-K excitons. Our study reveals the impact of crystal symmetry on TMD excitons and points to new avenues for realizing topologically non-trivial systems(16,17), exotic metasurfaces(18), collective excitonic phases(19)and quantum emitter arrays(20,21)via domain-pattern engineering.

Optimization of Laser Stabilization via Self-Injection Locking to a Whispering-Gallery-Mode Microresonator	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							NARROW-LINEWIDTH; FREQUENCY STABILIZATION; SEMICONDUCTOR-LASERS; OPTICAL FEEDBACK; DIODE-LASER; EXTERNAL-CAVITY; NOISE-REDUCTION; PHASE NOISE; RESONATORS; SCATTERING	Self-injection locking is a dynamic phenomenon representing stabilization of the emission frequency of an oscillator with a passive cavity enabling frequency-filtered coherent feedback to the oscillator cavity. For instance, self-injection locking of a semiconductor laser to a high-quality-factor (high-Q) whispering-gallery-mode microresonator can result in reduction of the laser linewidth by multiple orders of magnitude. The phenomenon was broadly studied in experiments, but there was no detailed theoretical model allowing improvement of the stabilization performance. In this paper we develop such a theory. We introduce five parameters identifying the efficiency of the self-injection locking in an experiment, comprising backscat-tering efficiency, phase delay between the laser and the high-Q cavities, frequency detuning between the laser and the high-Q cavities, the pump coupling efficiency, and the optical path length between the laser and the microresonator. Our calculations show that the laser linewidth can be reduced by 2 orders of magnitude compared with the case of nonoptimal self-injection locking. We present recommen-dations for experimental realization of the optimal self-injection-locking regime. The theoretical model provides deeper understanding of self-injection locking and benefits multiple practical applications of self-injection-locked oscillators.

These catalysts may be fine-tuned to account for the inevitable variability of different chemicals and impurities in the feedstocks. The latter may include, among others, different blends of shale gases, with different ratios of the C1-C3 alkanes and impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, etc. In this article, we review the recent progress achieved in our understanding of the crystal structures and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction mechanisms of the multi-metal oxide (MMO) M1 catalyst. Firstly, the complex crystal structure of the M1 phases has been examined using quantum mechanics (QM), reactive force field (ReaxFF), and machine learning (ML) approaches. Secondly, we discussed the ODH mechanism on the M1 phase based on the QM simulations including the finite cluster model and the periodic slab model. Finally, we proposed a catalyst design approach to improve the selectivity of the M1 phase based upon the ODH reaction mechanism. We also briefly discuss the concept of the CE ("Concurrent Engineering", introduced by the European Space Agency). The development of the CE concepts may be applied to the M1 catalytic systems in the future allowing businesses to be agile and react fast to the changing production conditions, thereby making them uniquely competitive in the ODH of alkanes and other areas.

This model intercomparison focuses on the very stable stratification encountered over the Antarctic Plateau in 2009. Here, we analyze results from 10 large-eddy-simulation (LES) codes for different spatial resolutions over 24 consecutive hours, and compare them with observations acquired at the Concordia Research Station during summer. This is a challenging exercise for such simulations since they need to reproduce both the 300-m-deep convective boundary layer and the very thin stable boundary layer characterized by a strong vertical temperature gradient (10 K difference over the lowest 20 m) when the sun is low over the horizon. A large variability in surface fluxes among the different models is highlighted. The LES models correctly reproduce the convective boundary layer in terms of mean profiles and turbulent characteristics but display more spread during stable conditions, which is largely reduced by increasing the horizontal and vertical resolutions in additional simulations focusing only on the stable period. This highlights the fact that very fine resolution is needed to represent such conditions. Complementary sensitivity studies are conducted regarding the roughness length, the subgrid-scale turbulence closure as well as the resolution and domain size. While we find little dependence on the surface-flux parametrization, the results indicate a pronounced sensitivity to both the roughness length and the turbulence closure.

Image formation for extended sources with the solar gravitational lens	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC DIFFRACTION; OPTICAL SYSTEMS	We study the image formation process with the solar gravitational lens (SGL) in the case of an extended, resolved source. An imaging telescope, modeled as a convex lens, is positioned within the image cylinder formed by the light received from the source. In the strong interference region of the SGL, this light is greatly amplified, forming the Einstein ring around the Sun, representing a distorted image of the extended source. We study the intensity distribution within the Einstein ring observed in the focal plane of the convex lens. For any particular telescope position in the image plane, we model light received from the resolved source as a combination of two signals: light received from the directly imaged region of the source and light from the rest of the source. We also consider the case when the telescope points away from the extended source or, equivalently, it observes light from sources in sky positions that are some distance away from the extended source but still in its proximity. At even larger distances from the optical axis, in the weak interference or geometric optics regions, our approach recovers known models related to micro-lensing but now obtained via the wave-optical treatment. We then derive the power of the signal and related photon fluxes within the annulus that contains the Einstein ring of the extended source, as seen by the imaging telescope. We discuss the properties of the deconvolution process, especially its effects on noise in the recovered image. We compare anticipated signals from realistic exoplanetary targets against estimates of noise from the solar corona and estimate integration times needed for the recovery of high-quality images of faint sources. The results demonstrate that the SGL offers a unique, realistic capability to obtain resolved images of exoplanets in our Galactic neighborhood.

Local operations at sufficiently separated spacetime points approximately commute-given a many-body state vertical bar psi >, O-x(t)O-y vertical bar psi > approximate to OyOx(t)vertical bar psi > with arbitrarily small errors-so long as vertical bar x -y vertical bar greater than or similar to vt, where v is finite. Yet, most nonrelativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions: Two degrees of freedom separated by a distance r interact with potential energy V(r) proportional to 1/r(alpha). In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy of linear light cones: At the same a, some quantum information processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone, while others are not. In one spatial dimension, this linear light cone exists for every many-body state vertical bar psi > when alpha > 3 (Lieb-Robinson light cone); for a typical state vertical bar psi > chosen uniformly at random from the Hilbert space when alpha > 5/2 (Frobenius light cone); and for every state of a noninteracting system when alpha > 2 (free light cone). These bounds apply to time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones-and their tightness-also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems with long-range interactions. In addition, we show that universal quantum state transfer, as well as many-body quantum chaos, is bounded by the Frobenius light cone and, therefore, is poorly constrained by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.

However, the genetic basis in evolution and development of this unique transformation remains to be clarified. Here we report newly sequenced genomes, developmental transcriptomes, and proteomes of diverse echinoderms including the green sea urchin (L. variegatus), a sea cucumber (A. japonicus), and with particular emphasis on a sister group of the earliest-diverged echinoderms, the feather star (A. japonica). We learned that the last common ancestor of echinoderms retained a well-organized Hox cluster reminiscent of the hemichordate, and had gene sets involved in endoskeleton development. Further, unlike in other animal groups, the most conserved developmental stages were not at the body plan establishing phase, and genes normally involved in bilaterality appear to function in pentameric axis development. These results enhance our understanding of the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes almost 500 Mya. Li et al. investigate the evolution and genetic basis of the adult pentameral body plan in echinoderms using genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. They determine that the last common ancestor of echinoderms contained an organized Hox cluster and endoskeleton genes, and suggest that cooption of bilateral development genes was involved in evolution of the pentameric body plan.

The impact of a simple representation of non-structural carbohydrates on the simulated response of tropical forests to drought	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							RESPIRATION PHOTOSYNTHESIS RATIO; PLANT RESPIRATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAIN-FOREST; SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; CARBON LIMITATION; MODEL DESCRIPTION; LONG-TERM; GROWTH; DYNAMICS	Accurately representing the response of ecosystems to environmental change in land surface models (LSMs) is crucial to making accurate predictions of future climate. Many LSMs do not correctly capture plant respiration and growth fluxes, particularly in response to extreme climatic events. This is in part due to the unrealistic assumption that total plant carbon expenditure (PCE) is always equal to gross carbon accumulation by photosynthesis. We present and evaluate a simple model of labile carbon storage and utilisation (SUGAR) designed to be integrated into an LSM, which allows simulated plant respiration and growth to vary independent of photosynthesis. SUGAR buffers simulated PCE against seasonal variation in photosynthesis, producing more constant (less variable) predictions of plant growth and respiration relative to an LSM that does not represent labile carbon storage. This allows the model to more accurately capture observed carbon fluxes at a large-scale drought experiment in a tropical moist forest in the Amazon, relative to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator LSM (JULES). SUGAR is designed to improve the representation of carbon storage in LSMs and provides a simple framework that allows new processes to be integrated as the empirical understanding of carbon storage in plants improves. The study highlights the need for future research into carbon storage and allocation in plants, particularly in response to extreme climate events such as drought.

J	Coladangelo, A; Sattath, O				Coladangelo, Andrea; Sattath, Or			A Quantum Money Solution to the Blockchain Scalability Problem	QUANTUM			English	Article								We put forward the idea that classical blockchains and smart contracts are potentially useful primitives not only for classical cryptography, but for quantum cryptography as well. Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool to enforce monetary incentives. In this work, we give the first example of the use of smart contracts in a quantum setting. We describe a simple hybrid classical-quantum payment system whose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful smart contracts, and quantum lightning, a strengthening of public-key quantum money introduced by Zhandry [Zha19]. Our hybrid payment system employs quantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and to keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties: it is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as quick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a quantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost value.

J	Martyn, J; Kato, K; Lucia, A				Martyn, John; Kato, Kohtaro; Lucia, Angelo			Deformations of the boundary theory of the square-lattice AKLT model	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							MATRIX PRODUCT STATES; BOND GROUND-STATES	The one-dimensional (1D) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model is a paradigm of antiferromagnetism, and its ground state exhibits symmetry-protected topological order. On a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, the AKLT model has recently gained attention because it too displays symmetry-protected topological order, and its ground state can act as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation. While the 1D model has been shown to be gapped, it remains an open problem to prove the existence of a spectral gap on the 2D square lattice, which would guarantee the robustness of the resource state. Recently, it has been shown that one can deduce this spectral gap by analyzing the model's boundary theory via a tensor network representation of the ground state. In this work, we express the boundary state of the 2D AKLT model in terms of a classical loop model, where loops, vertices, and crossings are each given a weight. We use numerical techniques to sample configurations of loops and subsequently evaluate the boundary state and boundary Hamiltonian on a square lattice. As a result, we evidence a spectral gap in the square-lattice AKLT model. In addition, by varying the weights of the loops, vertices, and crossings, we indicate the presence of three distinct phases exhibited by the classical loop model.

Effects of shear-thinning viscosity and viscoelastic stresses on flagellated bacteria motility	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TORQUE; SPEED; MOTOR; MODEL	The behavior of flagellated bacteria swimming in non-Newtonian media remains an area with contradictory and conflicting results. We report on the behavior of wild-type and smooth-swimming E. coli in Newtonian, shear-thinning, and viscoelastic media, measuring their trajectories and swimming speed using a three-dimensional real-time tracking microscope. We conclude that the speed enhancement in Methocel solution at higher concentrations is due to shear thinning and an analytical model is used to support our experimental result. We argue that shear-induced normal stresses reduce wobbling behavior during cell swimming but do not significantly affect swimming speed. However, the normal stresses play an important role in decreasing the flagellar bundling time, which changes the swimming-speed distribution. A dimensionless number, the "strangulation number" (Str) is proposed and used to characterize this effect.

J	Han, YT; Adolphs, R				Han, Yanting; Adolphs, Ralph			Estimating the heritability of psychological measures in the Human Connectome Project dataset	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FINGERPRINTING IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; GENETIC INFLUENCE; TWIN; METAANALYSIS; TRAITS; CONNECTIVITY; INSIGHTS; MODELS	The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a large structural and functional MRI dataset with a rich array of behavioral and genotypic measures, as well as a biologically verified family structure. This makes it a valuable resource for investigating questions about individual differences, including questions about heritability. While its MRI data have been analyzed extensively in this regard, to our knowledge a comprehensive estimation of the heritability of the behavioral dataset has never been conducted. Using a set of behavioral measures of personality, emotion and cognition, we show that it is possible to re-identify the same individual across two testing times (fingerprinting), and to identify identical twins significantly above chance. Standard heritability estimates of 37 behavioral measures were derived from twin correlations, and machine-learning models (univariate linear model, Ridge classifier and Random Forest model) were trained to classify monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins. Correlations between the standard heritability metric and each set of model weights ranged from 0.36 to 0.7, and questionnaire-based and task-based measures did not differ significantly in their heritability. We further explored the heritability of a smaller number of latent factors extracted from the 37 measures and repeated the heritability estimation; in this case, the correlations between the standard heritability and each set of model weights were lower, ranging from 0.05 to 0.43. One specific discrepancy arose for the general intelligence factor, which all models assigned high importance, but the standard heritability calculation did not. We present a thorough investigation of the heritabilities of the behavioral measures in the HCP as a resource for other investigators, and illustrate the utility of machine-learning methods for qualitative characterization of the differential heritability across diverse measures.

The International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean Version 4.0	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							RESOLUTION AIRBORNE GRAVITY; ICE-SHEET FLOW; WEST GREENLAND; SUBMARINE LANDFORMS; MELTING GREENLAND; LOMONOSOV RIDGE; SEA-ICE; GLACIERS; TROUGH; SHELF	Bathymetry (seafloor depth), is a critical parameter providing the geospatial context for a multitude of marine scientific studies. Since 1997, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) has been the authoritative source of bathymetry for the Arctic Ocean. IBCAO has merged its efforts with the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO-Seabed 2030 Project, with the goal of mapping all of the oceans by 2030. Here we present the latest version (IBCAO Ver. 4.0), with more than twice the resolution (200 x 200m versus 500 x 500m) and with individual depth soundings constraining three times more area of the Arctic Ocean (similar to 19.8% versus 6.7%), than the previous IBCAO Ver. 3.0 released in 2012. Modern multibeam bathymetry comprises similar to 14.3% in Ver. 4.0 compared to similar to 5.4% in Ver. 3.0. Thus, the new IBCAO Ver. 4.0 has substantially more seafloor morphological information that offers new insights into a range of submarine features and processes; for example, the improved portrayal of Greenland fjords better serves predictive modelling of the fate of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

J	Burungale, A; Sun, HS				Burungale, Ashay; Sun, Hae-Sang			Quantitative non-vanishing of DirichletL-values modulop	MATHEMATISCHE ANNALEN			English	Article; Early Access							CLASS NUMBER; INVARIANT; TRANSFORM	Let p be an odd prime and k a non-negative integer. Let N be a positive integer such that p inverted iota N and lambda a Dirichlet character modulo N. We obtain quantitative lower bounds for the number of Dirichlet character chi modulo F with the critical Dirichlet L-value L(-k, lambda chi) being p-indivisible. Here F -> infinity with ( N, F) = 1 and p inverted iota F phi(F). We explore the indivisibility via an algebraic and a homological approach. The latter leads to a bound of the form F-1/2. The p-indivisibility yields results on the distribution of the associated p-Selmer ranks. We also consider an Iwasawa variant. It leads to an explicit upper bound on the lowest conductor of the characters factoring through the Iwasawa Z(l)-extension of Q for an odd prime l not equal p with the corresponding critical L-value twists being p-indivisible.

NOvA Collaboration	Measurement of neutrino-induced neutral-current coherent pi(0) production in the NOvA near detector	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PION-PRODUCTION; HIGH-ENERGY; LEPTON SCATTERING; PCAC	The cross section of neutrino-induced neutral-current coherent pi(0) production on a carbon-dominated target is measured in the NOvA near detector. This measurement uses a narrow-band neutrino beam with an average neutrino energy of 2.7 GeV, which is of interest to ongoing and future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The measured, flux-averaged cross section is sigma = 13.8 +/- 0.9(stat) +/- 2.3(syst) x 10(-40) cm(2)/nucleus, consistent with model prediction. This result is the most precise measurement of neutral-current coherent pi(0) production in the few-GeV neutrino energy region.	[Djurcic, Z.; Goodman, M. C.; Magill, S.; Talaga, R.

Modeling this signal could be done with numerical-relativity simulations, but these are too computationally expensive for many applications. Analytic post-Newtonian treatments are limited by unknown higher-order nontidal terms. This paper further builds upon the "tidal splicing" model in which post-Newtonian tidal terms are "spliced" onto numerical relativity simulations of black-hole binaries. We improve on previous treatments of tidal splicing by including spherical harmonic modes beyond the (2,2) mode, expanding the post-Newtonian expressions for tidal effects to 2.5 order, including dynamical tide corrections, and adding a partial treatment of the spin-tidal dynamics. Furthermore, instead of numerical relativity simulations, we use the spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) surrogate model "NRHybSur3dq8" to provide the BBH waveforms that are input into the tidal slicing procedure. This allows us to construct spin-aligned, inspiraling TaylorT2 and TaylorT4 splicing waveform models that can be evaluated quickly. These models are tested against existing binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star simulations. We implement the TaylorT2 splicing model as an extension to "NRHybSur3dq8," creating a model that we call "NRHybSur3dq8Tidal."

Forecasts, constraints and measurement bounds can now too perhaps be estimated from accurate numerical simulations of the fifth force and its Laplacian field at solar system scales. The cubic Galileon gravity scalar field model (CGG), which arises in various massive gravity models including the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld model, describes modified gravity incorporating a Vainshtein screening mechanism. The nonlinear derivative interactions in the CGG equation suppress the field near regions of high density, thereby restoring general relativity (GR) while far from such regions, field enhancement is comparable to GR and the equation is dominated by a linear term. This feature of the governing equation poses some numerical challenges for computation of the scalar potential, force and Laplacian fields even under stationary conditions. Here we present a numerical method based on finite differences for solution of the static CGG scalar field for a 2D axisymmetric Sun-Earth system and a 3D Cartesian Sun-Earth-Moon system. The method relies on gradient descent of an integrated residual based on the normal attractive branch of the CGG equation. The algorithm is shown to be stable, accurate and rapidly convergent toward the global minimum state. We hope this numerical study, which can easily be extended to include smaller bodies such as detection satellites, will prove useful to future measurement of modified gravity force fields at solar system scales.

Framework for assessing land-management effects on at-risk species: Example of SE USA wood pellet production and gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Early Access						biodiversity; bioenergy; forest management; keystone species; renewable fuel; sustainability	RESPIRATORY-TRACT DISEASE; BIODIVERSITY OFFSETS; BIOENERGY PRODUCTION; COMMUNITY RESPONSE; BIOMASS; DEBRIS; CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; POLICY; CONSEQUENCES	Land-management choices made for economic and societal gains intrinsically influence landscapes and species that are dependent upon them. We propose a simple analysis framework to examine critical intersections between land-management choices and the life-history conditions of selected species of concern, thereby facilitating the identification of mitigation practices that can reduce negative impacts on species at risk. We test the proposed framework through application to gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a keystone species that is the focus of conservation efforts across the southeastern region of United States of America, where wood pellets are being produced for bioenergy. Production of these wood pellets for export to Europe and Asia has drastically increased in the past decade, raising concerns about potential harm to biodiversity since many species in the forests sourcing pellet production were already at risk prior to the development of this new commodity. Identifying the mechanisms of potential impacts of wood pellet production on species of concern is essential to establishing meaningful management recommendations that can enhance conservation efforts while supporting sustainable bioenergy. By considering the intersections between life-history conditions of gopher tortoise and forest-management practices related to woody biomass extraction for pellet production, we identify several mechanisms by which the wood-pellet industry might affect this species of concern, both positively and negatively. We then identify mitigation practices that can help offset the potential impacts of logging, thinning, and dead wood removal on gopher tortoise. Our analysis framework may be transferable to other species of concern and land-management practices across diverse landscapes.

The electrochemical switching of the bistable [2]rotaxane induces changes in the ground-state coconformation and in the corresponding excited-state properties of the BODIPY rotor. In the starting redox state, when no external potential is applied, the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT(4+)) ring component encircles the tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit on the dumbbell component, leaving the BODIPY rotor unhindered and exhibiting low fluorescence. Upon oxidation of the TTF unit to a TTF2+ dication, the CBPQT(4+) ring is forced toward the molecular rotor, leading to an increased energy barrier for the excited state to rotate the rotor into the state with a high nonradiative rate constant, resulting in an overall 3.4-fold fluorescence enhancement. On the other hand, when the solvent polarity is high enough to stabilize the excited charge-transfer state between the BODIPY rotor and the CBPQT(4+) ring, movement of the ring toward the BODIPY rotor produces an unexpectedly strong fluorescence signal decrease as the result of photoinduced electron transfer from the BODIPY rotor to the CBPQT(4+) ring. The nanoconfinement effect introduced by mechanical bonding can effectively lead to modulation of the physicochemical properties as observed in this bistable [2]rotaxane. On account of the straightforward synthetic strategy and the facile modulation of switchable electrochromic behavior, our approach could pave the way for the development of new stimuli-responsive materials based on mechanically interlocked molecules for future electro-optical applications, such as sensors, molecular memories, and molecular logic gates.

J	Peng, ZW; Brady, JE				Peng, Zhiwei; Brady, John E.			Upstream swimming and Taylor dispersion of active Brownian particles	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article							BACTERIAL MOTILITY; LAMINAR-FLOW; MICROORGANISMS; SUSPENSIONS; MOTION; FORCE; MODEL	Locomotion of self-propelled particles such as motile bacteria or phoretic swimmers often takes place in the presence of applied flows and confining boundaries. Interactions of these active swimmers with the flow environment are important for the understanding of many biological processes, including infection by motile bacteria and the formation of biofilms. Recent experimental and theoretical works have shown that active particles in a Poiseuille flow exhibit interesting dynamics including accumulation at the wall and upstream swimming. Compared to the well-studied Taylor dispersion of passive Brownian particles, a theoretical understanding of the transport of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a pressure-driven flow is relatively less developed. In this paper, employing a small wave-number expansion of the Smoluchowski equation describing the particle distribution, we explicitly derive an effective advection-diffusion equation for the cross-sectional average of the particle number density in Fourier space. We characterize the average drift (specifically upstream swimming) and effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient of active particles in relation to the flow speed, the intrinsic swimming speed of the active particles, their Brownian diffusion, and the degree of confinement. In contrast to passive Brownian particles, both the average drift and the longitudinal dispersivity of ABPs exhibit a nonmonotonic variation as a function of the flow speed. In particular, the dispersion of ABPs includes the classical shear-enhanced (Taylor) dispersion and an active contribution called the swim diffusivity. In the absence of translational diffusion, the classical Taylor dispersion is absent and we observe a giant longitudinal dispersion in the strong flow limit. Our continuum theory is corroborated by a direct Brownian dynamics simulation of the Langevin equations governing the motion of each ABP.

Adults with AgCC (N= 27) and matched healthy volunteers (N= 30) were compared on defense mechanism use across increasing levels of developmental maturity (denial, least; projection, intermediate; identification, most). Narratives generated in response to Thematic Apperception Test images were scored according to the Defense Mechanism Manual. Greater use of denial and less identification was found in persons with AgCC, compared to healthy comparisons. This difference emerged after age 18 when full maturation of defenses among healthy individuals was expected. The findings provide clinically important characterization of social and emotional processing in persons with AgCC. More broadly, the results support the hypothesis that functional integration across the hemispheres is important for the development of defense mechanisms.

Simultaneous observations of the blazar PKS 2155-304 from ultra-violet to TeV energies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						BL Lacertae objects: individual: PKS 2155-304; astroparticle physics	SYNCHROTRON-RADIATION; GAMMA-RAYS; VARIABILITY; PKS-2155-304; FERMI; HESS; TELESCOPE; OBJECTS; SYSTEM	Here we report the results of the first ever contemporaneous multi-wavelength observation campaign on the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 involving Swift, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, and H.E.S.S. The use of these instruments allows us to cover a broad energy range, which is important for disentangling the different radiative mechanisms. The source, observed from June 2013 to October 2013, was found in a low flux state with respect to previous observations but exhibited highly significant flux variability in the X-rays. The high-energy end of the synchrotron spectrum can be traced up to 40 keV without significant contamination by high-energy emission. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was used to reproduce the broadband flux of the source for all the observations presented here but failed for previous observations made in April 2013. A lepto-hadronic solution was then explored to explain these earlier observational results.

On-sky verification of Fast and Furious focal-plane wavefront sensing: Moving forward toward controlling the island effect at Subaru/SCExAO	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: high angular resolution	SPECTROSCOPY; ASTROMETRY; PHOTOMETRY	Context. High-contrast imaging (HCI) observations of exoplanets can be limited by the island effect (IE). The IE occurs when the main wavefront sensor (WFS) cannot measure sharp phase discontinuities across the telescope's secondary mirror support structures (also known as spiders). On the current generation of telescopes, the IE becomes a severe problem when the ground wind speed is below a few meters per second. During these conditions, the air that is in close contact with the spiders cools down and is not blown away. This can create a sharp optical path length difference between light passing on opposite sides of the spiders. Such an IE aberration is not measured by the WFS and is therefore left uncorrected. This is referred to as the low-wind effect (LWE). The LWE severely distorts the point spread function (PSF), significantly lowering the Strehl ratio and degrading the contrast. Aims. In this article, we aim to show that the focal-plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) algorithm, Fast and Furious (F&F), can be used to measure and correct the IE/LWE. The F&F algorithm is a sequential phase diversity algorithm and a software-only solution to FPWFS that only requires access to images of non-coronagraphic PSFs and control of the deformable mirror. Methods. We deployed the algorithm on the SCExAO HCI instrument at the Subaru Telescope using the internal near-infrared camera in H-band. We tested with the internal source to verify that F&F can correct a wide variety of LWE phase screens. Subsequently, F&F was deployed on-sky to test its performance with the full end-to-end system and atmospheric turbulence. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by two metrics based on the PSF quality: (1) the Strehl ratio approximation (SRA), and (2) variance of the normalized first Airy ring (VAR). The VAR measures the distortion of the first Airy ring, and is used to quantify PSF improvements that do not or barely affect the PSF core (e.g., during challenging atmospheric conditions). Results. The internal source results show that F&F can correct a wide range of LWE phase screens. Random LWE phase screens with a peak-to-valley wavefront error between 0.4 mu m and 2 mu m were all corrected to a SRA > 90% and an VAR less than or similar to 0.05. Furthermore, the on-sky results show that F&F is able to improve the PSF quality during very challenging atmospheric conditions (1.3-1.4 '' seeing at 500 nm). Closed-loop tests show that F&F is able to improve the VAR from 0.27-0.03 and therefore significantly improve the symmetry of the PSF. Simultaneous observations of the PSF in the optical (lambda=750 nm, Delta lambda=50 nm) show that during these tests we were correcting aberrations common to the optical and NIR paths within SCExAO. We could not conclusively determine if we were correcting the LWE and/or (quasi-)static aberrations upstream of SCExAO. Conclusions. The F&F algorithm is a promising focal-plane wavefront sensing technique that has now been successfully tested on-sky. Going forward, the algorithm is suitable for incorporation into observing modes, which will enable PSFs of higher quality and stability during science observations.	[Bos, S. P.; Wilby, M.

X-shooter survey of disk accretion in Upper Scorpius I. Very high accretion rates at age > 5 Myr	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						accretion; accretion disks; protoplanetary disks; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: T Tauri; Herbig Ae/Be	T-TAURI; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; EVOLUTION; STARS; PHOTOEVAPORATION; ORIGIN; CENSUS	Determining the mechanisms that drive the evolution of protoplanetary disks is a necessary step toward understanding how planets form. For this work, we measured the mass accretion rate for young stellar objects with disks at age > 5 Myr, a critical test for the current models of disk evolution. We present the analysis of the spectra of 36 targets in the similar to 5-10 Myr old Upper Scorpius star-forming region for which disk masses were measured with ALMA. We find that the mass accretion rates in this sample of old but still surviving disks are similarly high as those of the younger (similar to 1-3 Myr old) star-forming regions of Lupus and Chamaeleon I, when considering the dependence on stellar and disk mass. In particular, several disks show high mass accretion rates greater than or similar to 10(-9) M-circle dot yr(-1) while having low disk masses. Furthermore, the median values of the measured mass accretion rates in the disk mass ranges where our sample is complete at a level similar to 60-80% are compatible in these three regions. At the same time, the spread of mass accretion rates at any given disk mass is still > 0.9 dex, even at age > 5 Myr. These results are in contrast with simple models of viscous evolution, which would predict that the values of the mass accretion rate diminish with time, and a tighter correlation with disk mass at age > 5 Myr. Similarly, simple models of internal photoevaporation cannot reproduce the observed mass accretion rates, while external photoevaporation might explain the low disk masses and high accretion rates. A possible partial solution to the discrepancy with the viscous models is that the gas-to-dust ratio of the disks at similar to 5-10 Myr is significantly different and higher than the canonical 100, as suggested by some dust and gas disk evolution models. The results shown here require the presence of several interplaying processes, such as detailed dust evolution, external photoevaporation, and possibly MHD winds, to explain the secular evolution of protoplanetary disks.

We develop global estimates of annual PM2.5 concentrations and trends for 1998-2018 using advances in satellite observations, chemical transport modeling, and ground-based monitoring. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) from advanced satellite products including finer resolution, increased global coverage, and improved long-term stability are combined and related to surface PM2.5 concentrations using geophysical relationships between surface PM2.5 and AOD simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model with updated algorithms. The resultant annual mean geophysical PM2.5 estimates are highly consistent with globally distributed ground monitors (R-2 = 0.81; slope = 0.90). Geographically weighted regression is applied to the geophysical PM2.5 estimates to predict and account for the residual bias with PM2.5 monitors, yielding even higher cross validated agreement (R-2 = 0.90-0.92; slope = 0.90-0.97) with ground monitors and improved agreement compared to all earlier global estimates. The consistent long-term satellite AOD and simulation enable trend assessment over a 21 year period, identifying significant trends for eastern North America (-0.28 +/- 0.03 mu g/m(3)/yr), Europe (-0.15 +/- 0.03 mu g/m(3)/yr), India (1.13 +/- 0.15 mu g/m(3)/yr), and globally (0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g/m(3)/yr). The positive trend (2.44 +/- 0.44 mu g/m(3)/yr) for India over 2005-2013 and the negative trend (-3.37 +/- 0.38 mu g/m(3)/yr) for China over 2011-2018 are remarkable, with implications for the health of billions of people.

Photo-oxidation of Aromatic Hydrocarbons Produces Low-Volatility Organic Compounds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC OXIDATION MECHANISM; MULTIFUNCTIONAL PRODUCTS; VAPOR-PRESSURES; PARTICLE GROWTH; SULFURIC-ACID; AEROSOL; MOLECULES; EMISSIONS; RADICALS; TOLUENE	To better understand the role of aromatic hydrocarbons in new-particle formation, we measured the particle-phase abundance and volatility of oxidation products following the reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons with OH radicals. For this we used thermal desorption in an iodide-adduct Time-of-Flight Chemical-Ionization Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO-ToF-CIMS). The particle-phase volatility measurements confirm that oxidation products of toluene and naphthalene can contribute to the initial growth of newly formed particles. Toluene-derived (C-7) oxidation products have a similar volatility distribution to that of alpha-pinene-derived (C-10) oxidation products, while naphthalene-derived (C-10) oxidation products are much less volatile than those from toluene or alpha-pinene; they are thus stronger contributors to growth. Rapid progression through multiple generations of oxidation is more pronounced in toluene and naphthalene than in alpha-pinene, resulting in more oxidation but also favoring functional groups with much lower volatility per added oxygen atom, such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups instead of hydroperoxide groups. Under conditions typical of polluted urban settings, naphthalene may well contribute to nucleation and the growth of the smallest particles, whereas the more abundant alkyl benzenes may overtake naphthalene once the particles have grown beyond the point where the Kelvin effect strongly influences the condensation driving force.

To this end, Obs4MIPs (1) targets observed variables that can be compared to CMIP model variables; (2) utilizes dataset formatting specifications and metadata requirements closely aligned with CMIP model output; (3) provides brief technical documentation for each dataset, designed for nonexperts and tailored towards relevance for model evaluation, including information on uncertainty, dataset merits, and limitations; and (4) disseminates the data through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) platforms, making the observations searchable and acces- sible via the same portals as the model output. Taken together, these characteristics of the organization and structure of obs4MIPs should entice a more diverse community of researchers to engage in the comparison of model output with observations and to contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the climate models. At present, the number of obs4MIPs datasets has grown to about 80; many are undergoing updates, with another 20 or so in preparation, and more than 100 are proposed and under consideration. A partial list of current global satellite-based datasets includes humidity and temperature profiles; a wide range of cloud and aerosol observations; ocean surface wind, temperature, height, and sea ice fraction; surface and top-of-atmosphere longwave and shortwave radiation; and ozone (O-3), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide CO2) products. A partial list of proposed products expected to be useful in analyzing CMIP6 results includes the following: alternative products for the above quantities, additional products for ocean surface flux and chlorophyll products, a number of vegetation products (e.g., FAPAR, LAI, burned area fraction), ice sheet mass and height, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). While most existing obs4MIPs datasets consist of monthly-mean gridded data over the global domain, products with higher time resolution (e.g., daily) and/or regional products are now receiving more attention. Along with an increasing number of datasets, obs4MIPs has implemented a number of capability upgrades including (1) an updated obs4MIPs data specifications document that provides additional search facets and generally improves congruence with CMIP6 specifications for model datasets, (2) a set of six easily understood indicators that help guide users as to a dataset's maturity and suitability for application, and (3) an option to supply supplemental information about a dataset beyond what can be found in the standard metadata. With the maturation of the obs4MIPs framework, the dataset inclusion process, and the dataset formatting guidelines and resources, the scope of the observations being considered is expected to grow to include gridded in situ datasets as well as datasets with a regional focus, and the ultimate intent is to judiciously expand this scope to any observation dataset that has applicability for evaluation of the types of Earth system models used in CMIP.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Cosmological constraints from cluster abundances and weak lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							HALO MASS FUNCTION; GALAXY FORMATION; ASSEMBLY BIAS; CALIBRATION; REDMAPPER; SDSS; IMPACT; SAMPLE; MODEL; PARAMETERS	We perform a joint analysis of the counts and weak lensing signal of redMaPPer clusters selected from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 dataset. Our analysis uses the same shear and source photometric redshifts estimates as were used in the DES combined probes analysis. Our analysis results in surprisingly low values for S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.65 0.04, driven by a low matter density parameter, Omega(m) = 0.179(-0.038)(+0.031), with sigma(8) - Omega(m) posteriors in 2.4 sigma tension with the DES Y1 3x2pt results, and in 5.6 sigma with the Planck CMB analysis. These results include the impact of post-unblinding changes to the analysis, which did not improve the level of consistency with other data sets compared to the results obtained at the unblinding. The fact that multiple cosmological probes (supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and CMB anisotropies), and other galaxy cluster analyses all favor significantly higher matter densities suggests the presence of systematic errors in the data or an incomplete modeling of the relevant physics. Cross checks with x-ray and microwave data, as well as independent constraints on the observable -mass relation from Sunyaev-Zeldovich selected clusters, suggest that the discrepancy resides in our modeling of the weak lensing signal rather than the cluster abundance. Repeating our analysis using a higher richness threshold (lambda >= 30) significantly reduces the tension with other probes, and points to one or more richness -dependent effects not captured by our model.

J	Santos, MSF; Noell, AC; Mora, MF				Santos, Mauro Sergio Ferreira; Noell, Aaron Craig; Mora, Maria Fernanda			Methods for onboard monitoring of silver biocide during future human space exploration missions	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							CONTACTLESS CONDUCTIVITY DETECTION; MICROCHIP ELECTROPHORESIS; CAPILLARY; SEPARATION	Silver ions (Ag+) have been proposed as a biocide to treat the water in NASA's next generation of human space exploration vehicles/habitats. One advantage of Ag+ is that it is effective as a biocide in a range (200 to 500 ppb) safe for human consumption. So, monitoring Ag+ is essential to ensure the safety and health of the crew. Here we present two analytical methods based on capillary electrophoresis and capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-(CD)-D-4) to address the need to monitor Ag+ levels in water. Using 5 M acetic acid as a background electrolyte (BGE), 100 ppb of Ag+ could be detected in a simulant of the International Space Station (ISS) water. In addition to Ag+, other inorganic cations (K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) frequently found in the ISS potable water can be detected simultaneously using this BGE in less than 4.5 min. By using a BGE composed of 0.5 M acetic acid, levels of Ag+ as low as 25 ppb could be detected in the ISS water simulant in less than 2.5 min. Although in this condition none of the other cations interfered with the detection of Ag+, some of them co-migrated, which could prevent obtaining additional information about the sample composition.

Understanding the role of crystallographic shear on the electrochemical behavior of niobium oxyfluorides	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MIXED OXIDES; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; METAL-OXIDES; HIGH-POWER; LITHIUM; INSERTION; TITANIUM; NBO2F; INTERCALATION	The effects of shear planes in perovskite materials have been studied in order to identify their role in the electrochemical behavior of Li(+)intercalation hosts. These planes modulate the structural stability and ionic transport pathways and therefore play an intimate role in the characteristics and performance of shear compounds. Herein, two Nb-based compounds, NbO2F and Nb3O7F, were chosen as representative perovskite and shear derivatives respectively to investigate the role of crystallographic shear. A series ofoperandomeasurements, including X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in conjunction with structural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and detailed electrochemical studies identified the effect of shear planes. It was found that shear planes led to increased structural stability during Li+(de)intercalation with shear layers being maintained, while perovskite layers were seen to degrade rapidly. However, disordering in the shear plane stacking introduced during delithiation ultimately led to poor capacity retention despite structural maintenance as Li(+)diffusion channels are disrupted.

Many solid-state quantum devices operate at millikelvin temperatures-however, it has proven challenging to operate nanoscale optomechanical devices at these ultralow temperatures due to their limited thermal conductance and parasitic optical absorption. Here, we present a two-dimensional optomechanical crystal resonator capable of achieving large cooperativity C and small effective bath occupancy n(b), resulting in a quantum cooperativity C-eff equivalent to C/n(b) > 1 under continuous-wave optical driving. This is realized using a two-dimensional phononic bandgap structure to host the optomechanical cavity, simultaneously isolating the acoustic mode of interest in the bandgap while allowing heat to be removed by phonon modes outside of the bandgap. This achievement paves the way for a variety of applications requiring quantum-coherent optomechanical interactions, such as transducers capable of bi-directional conversion of quantum states between microwave frequency superconducting quantum circuits and optical photons in a fiber optic network.

Multireference Ground and Excited State Electronic Structures of Free- versus Iron Porphyrin-Carbenes	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PERTURBATION-THEORY; BASIS-SETS; CORRELATION-ENERGY; ATOM TRANSFER; H INSERTION; APPROXIMATION; CYCLOPROPANATION; IMPLEMENTATION; FORMULATION; RESOLUTION	Iron porphyrin carbenes (IPCs) are important reaction intermediates in engineered carbene transferase enzymes and homogeneous catalysis. However, discrepancies between theory and experiment complicate the understanding of IPC electronic structure. In the literature, this has been framed as whether the ground state is an open-vs closed-shell singlet (OSS vs CSS). Here we investigate the structurally dependent ground and excited spin-state energetics of a free carbene and its IPC analogs with variable trans axial ligands. In particular, for IPCs, multireference ab initio wave function methods are more consistent with experiment and predict a mixed singlet ground state that is dominated by the CSS (Fe(II) <- {:C(X)Y}(0)) configuration (i.e., electrophilic carbene) but that also has a small, non-negligible contribution from an Fe(III)-{C(X)Y}(-center dot) configuration (hole in d(xz), i.e., radical carbene). In the multireference approach, the "OSS-like" excited states are metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in nature and are energetically well above the CSS-dominated ground state. The first, lowest energy of these "OSS-like" excited states is predicted to be heavily weighted toward the Fe(III)-{C(X)Y}(-center dot) (hole in d(yz)) configuration. As expected from exchange considerations, this state falls energetically above a triplet of the same configuration. Furthermore, potential energy surfaces (PESs) along the IPC Fe-C(carbene) bond elongation exhibit increasingly strong mixings between CSS/OSS characters, with the Fe(III)-{C(X)Y}(-center dot) configuration (hole in d(xz)) growing in weight in the ground state during bond elongation. The relative degree of electrophilic/radical carbene character along this structurally relevant PES can potentially play a role in reactivity and selectivity patterns in catalysis. Future studies on IPC reaction coordinates should evaluate contributions from ground and excited state multireference character.

To illustrate the applicability of the system, an extended Dicke model is developed for atoms undergoing Raman transitions between the ground states in the presence of laser fields and considering dipole-dipole interactions; the latter has been neglected in many previous works. We have studied the effect of a ferroelectric and an antiferroelectric arrangement on the phase transition for both a finite and an infinite number of dipoles. An additional superradiant phase is observed in the deep-strong-coupling regime due to influence of the dipole-dipole interaction term. A high degree of dipole-dipole entanglement occurs for the antiferroelectric arrangement in the deep-strong regime, whereas it gets disentangled quite rapidly for the ferroelectric arrangement. A sharp transition of system parameters is observed in the ultrastrong-coupling regime and beyond. The dipole-dipole interaction also influences the spectra of the system, inducing a significant shift in the peaks, and modifies the average number of photons emitted.

Such mergers can contribute to an accreted stellar disk and a dark matter disk. Here we present Nyx, a vast stellar stream in the vicinity of the Sun, which provides the first indication that such an event occurred in the Milky Way. We identify about 200 stars that have coherent radial and prograde motion in this stream using a catalogue of accreted stars built by applying deep learning methods to the Gaia data. Taken together with chemical abundance and orbital information, these results strongly favour the interpretation that Nyx is the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. Further justified by FIRE hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that prograde streams like Nyx can be found in the disk plane of galaxies and identified using our methods. Analysis of a catalogue of accreted stars by their radial and prograde motions has identified a 200-plus-member coherent stellar stream (called Nyx) that is likely to be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way.

Visualizing image content to explain novel image discovery	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article; Early Access						Novelty detection; Explanations; Image analysis	FEATURES; SCALE	The initial analysis of any large data set can be divided into two phases: (1) the identification of common trends or patterns and (2) the identification of anomalies or outliers that deviate from those trends. We focus on the goal of detecting observations with novel content, which can alert us to artifacts in the data set or, potentially, the discovery of previously unknown phenomena. To aid in interpreting and diagnosing the novel aspect of these selected observations, we recommend the use of novelty detection methods that generate explanations. In the context of large image data sets, these explanations should highlight what aspect of a given image is new (color, shape, texture, content) in a human-comprehensible form. We propose DEMUD-VIS, the first method for providing visual explanations of novel image content by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features, a method that uses reconstruction error to detect novel content, and an up-convolutional network to convert CNN feature representations back into image space. We demonstrate this approach on diverse images from ImageNet, freshwater streams, and the surface of Mars. Finally, we evaluate the utility of the visual explanations with a user study.

Riverine transport of silt and clay particles-or mud-builds continental landscapes and dominates the fluxes of sediment and organic carbon across Earth's surface. Compared with fluxes of sand-sized grains, mud fluxes are difficult to predict. Yet, understanding the fate of muddy river sediment is fundamental to the global carbon cycle, coastal landscape resilience to sea-level rise, river restoration and river-floodplain morphodynamics on Earth and Mars. Mechanistic theories exist for suspended sand transport, but mud in rivers is often thought to constitute washload-sediment with settling velocities so slow that it does not interact with the bed, such that it depends only on upstream supply and is impossible to predict from local hydraulics. To test this hypothesis, we compiled sediment concentration profiles from the literature from eight rivers and used an inversion technique to determine settling rates of suspended mud. We found that mud in rivers is largely flocculated in aggregates that have near-constant settling velocities, independent of grain size, of approximately 0.34 mm s(-1), which is 100-fold faster than rates for individual particles. Our findings indicate that flocculated mud is part of suspended bed-material load, not washload, and thus can be physically described by bed-material entrainment theory.

Tropical tree size-frequency distributions from airborne lidar	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						airborne lidar; crown area; individual tree crown; plot-level aboveground biomass; size-classes-level basal area; tree diameter; tree height; tree size frequency	GENERAL QUANTITATIVE THEORY; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; FOREST STRUCTURE; METABOLIC ECOLOGY; CARBON STOCKS; ADULT STATURE; HEIGHT; ALLOMETRY; DENSITY; REGENERATION	In tropical rainforests, tree size and number density are influenced by disturbance history, soil, topography, climate, and biological factors that are difficult to predict without detailed and widespread forest inventory data. Here, we quantify tree size-frequency distributions over an old-growth wet tropical forest at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica by using an individual tree crown (ITC) algorithm on airborne lidar measurements. The ITC provided tree height, crown area, the number of trees >10 m height and, predicted tree diameter, and aboveground biomass from field allometry. The number density showed strong agreement with field observations at the plot- (97.4%; 3% bias) and tree-height-classes level (97.4%; 3% bias). The lidar trees size spectra of tree diameter and height closely follow the distributions measured on the ground but showed less agreement with crown area observations. The model to convert lidar-derived tree height and crown area to tree diameter produced unbiased (0.8%) estimates of plot-level basal area and with low uncertainty (6%). Predictions on basal area for tree height classes were also unbiased (1.3%) but with larger uncertainties (22%). The biomass estimates had no significant bias at the plot- and tree-height-classes level (-5.2% and 2.1%). Our ITC method provides a powerful tool for tree- to landscape-level tropical forest inventory and biomass estimation by overcoming the limitations of lidar area-based approaches that require local calibration using a large number of inventory plots.

Optimal design of an electrochemical reactor for blackwater treatment	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						blackwater treatment; electrode cleaning; mineral deposits; reverse polarity; uniform mixing	WASTE-WATER; OXIDATION	Electrolysis of blackwater for disinfection and nutrient removal is a portable and scalable technology that can lessen the need for cities to construct large-scale wastewater treatment infrastructure and enable the safe onsite reuse of blackwater. Several systems for treating wastewater from single toilets are described in the literature, but there are few examples of systems designed to use electrolysis to treat blackwater from nearby toilets, which is a situation more common in densely packed urban living environments. In order to scale a single toilet electrolysis system to one that could service multiple toilets, computational fluid dynamic analysis was used to optimize the electrochemical reactor design, and laboratory and field-testing were used to confirm results. Design efforts included optimization of the reactor shape and mixing to improve treatment efficiency, as well as automated cleaning and salt injection to reduce maintenance and service requirements. Practitioner points Design of a reverse polarity mechanism to enable in situ electrode cleaning and improve long-term electrode performance. Optimization of a hopper design and drainpipe location to collect and remove flaking precipitates and mitigate maintenance issues. Design of an automated salt injection system to guarantee sufficient chloride levels for producing adequate chlorine residuals for consistent disinfection.

The surveys cover approximately 500 x 500 m areas just south of Highway 178 with an average ground sample distance of 1.5 cm. The first survey took place five days after the M-w 6.4 foreshock on 9 July 2019. The final survey took place on 27 September 2019. The time between surveys increased over time, with the first five surveys taking place in the first month after the earthquake. Comparison of imagery from before and after the M-w 7.1 earthquake shows variation in slip on the main rupture and a small amount of distributed slip across the scene. Cracks can be observed and mapped in the high-resolution imagery, which show en echelon cracking, fault splays, and a northeast-striking conjugate fault at the M-w 7.1 rupture south of Highway 178 and near the dirt road. Initial postseismic results show little fault afterslip, but possible subsidence in the first 7-10 days after the earthquake, followed by uplift.

Models tend to underestimate the methane lifetime and CO concentrations throughout the troposphere, which is consistent with excessive OH. Approximately half of the oxidation of methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is thought to occur over the oceans where oxidant chemistry has received little validation due to a lack of observational constraints. We use observations from the first two deployments of the NASA ATom aircraft campaign during July-August 2016 and January-February 2017 to evaluate the oxidation capacity over the remote oceans and its representation by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. The model successfully simulates the magnitude and vertical profile of remote OH within the measurement uncertainties. Comparisons against the drivers of OH production (water vapor, ozone, and NOy concentrations, ozone photolysis frequencies) also show minimal bias, with the exception of wintertime NOy. The severe model overestimate of NOy during this period may indicate insufficient wet scavenging and/or missing loss on sea-salt aerosols. Large uncertainties in these processes require further study to improve simulated NOy partitioning and removal in the troposphere, but preliminary tests suggest that their overall impact could marginally reduce the model bias in tropospheric OH. During the ATom-1 deployment, OH reactivity (OHR) below 3 km is significantly enhanced, and this is not captured by the sum of its measured components (cOHR(obs)) or by the model (cOHR(mod)). This enhancement could suggest missing reactive VOCs but cannot be explained by a comprehensive simulation of both biotic and abiotic ocean sources of VOCs. Additional sources of VOC reactivity in this region are difficult to reconcile with the full suite of ATom measurement constraints. The model generally reproduces the magnitude and seasonality of cOHR(obs) but underestimates the contribution of oxygenated VOCs, mainly acetaldehyde, which is severely underestimated throughout the troposphere despite its calculated lifetime of less than a day. Missing model acetaldehyde in previous studies was attributed to measurement uncertainties that have been largely resolved. Observations of peroxyacetic acid (PAA) provide new support for remote levels of acetaldehyde. The underestimate in both model acetaldehyde and PAA is present throughout the year in both hemispheres and peaks during Northern Hemisphere summer. The addition of ocean sources of VOCs in the model increases cOHR(mod) by 3 % to 9 % and improves model-measurement agreement for acetaldehyde, particularly in winter, but cannot resolve the model summertime bias. Doing so would require 100 Tg yr(-1) of a long-lived unknown precursor throughout the year with significant additional emissions in the Northern Hemisphere summer. Improving the model bias for remote acetaldehyde and PAA is unlikely to fully resolve previously reported model global biases in OH and methane lifetime, suggesting that future work should examine the sources and sinks of OH over land.

J	Coladangelo, A; Stark, J				Coladangelo, Andrea; Stark, Jalex			An inherently infinite-dimensional quantum correlation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Bell's theorem, a landmark result in the foundations of physics, establishes that quantum mechanics is a non-local theory. It asserts, in particular, that two spatially separated, but entangled, quantum systems can be correlated in a way that cannot be mimicked by classical systems. A direct operational consequence of Bell's theorem is the existence of statistical tests which can detect the presence of entanglement. Remarkably, certain correlations not only witness entanglement, but they give quantitative bounds on the minimum dimension of quantum systems attaining them. In this work, we show that there exists a correlation which is not attainable by quantum systems of any arbitrary finite dimension, but is attained exclusively by infinite-dimensional quantum systems (such as infinite-level systems arising from quantum harmonic oscillators). This answers the long-standing open question about the existence of a finite correlation witnessing infinite entanglement. The existence of nonlocal correlations which cannot be attained exactly by finite-dimensional systems, but can be attained by infinite-dimensional ones, has been the subject of several theoretical efforts. Here, Coladangelo and Stark exhibit such a correlation, in a form that requires only two players.

J	Duque, R; Beniamini, P; Daigne, F; Mochkovitch, R				Duque, Raphael; Beniamini, Paz; Daigne, Frederic; Mochkovitch, Robert			Probing binary neutron star mergers in dense environments using afterglow counterparts	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational waves; gamma-ray burst: general; stars: neutron; galaxies: ISM	GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; CORE-COLLAPSE; LIGHT CURVES; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS; WAVES; DETECTABILITY; LUMINOSITY; DYNAMICS; POINTS	The only binary neutron star merger gravitational wave event with detected electromagnetic counterparts recorded to date is GRB170817A. This merger occurred in a rarefied medium with a density smaller than 10(-3)-10(-2) cm(-3). Since kicks are imparted to neutron star binaries upon formation, and due to their long delay times before merger, such low-density circum-merger media are generally expected. However, there is some indirect evidence for fast-merging or low-kick binaries, which would coalesce in denser environments. Nonetheless, present astronomical data are largely inconclusive on the possibility of these high-density mergers. We describe a method to directly probe this hypothetical population of high-density mergers through multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger afterglows, exploiting the high sensitivity of these signals to the density of the merger environment. This method is based on a sample of merger afterglows that has yet to be collected. Its constraining power is large, even with a small sample of events. We discuss the method's limitations and applicability. In the upcoming era of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, this method's potential will be fully realized as it will allow us to probe mergers that occurred soon after the peak of cosmic star formation, provided the follow-up campaigns are able to locate the sources.

Ongoing flyby in the young multiple system UX Tauri	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; circumstellar matter; stars: pre-main sequence; binaries: general	SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; PROTOPLANETARY DISCS; DIVERSITY	We present observations of the young multiple system UX Tauri to look for circumstellar disks and for signs of dynamical interactions. We obtained SPHERE/IRDIS deep differential polarization images in the J and H bands. We also used ALMA archival CO data. Large extended spirals are well detected in scattered light coming out of the disk of UX Tau A. The southern spiral forms a bridge between UX Tau A and C. These spirals, including the bridge connecting the two stars, all have a CO (3-2) counterpart seen by ALMA. The disk of UX Tau C is detected in scattered light. It is much smaller than the disk of UX Tau A and has a major axis along a different position angle, suggesting a misalignment. We performed PHANTOM SPH hydrodynamical models to interpret the data. The scattered light spirals, CO emission spirals and velocity patterns of the rotating disks, and the compactness of the disk of UX Tau C all point to a scenario in which UX Tau A has been perturbed very recently (similar to 1000 years) by the close passage of UX Tau C.

The large uncertainty is, in part, due to the difficulty of predicting cloud microphysical parameters, such as the cloud droplet number concentration (N-d). Even though rigorous first-principle approaches exist to calculate Nd, the cloud and aerosol research community also relies on empirical approaches such as relating N-d to aerosol mass concentration. Here we analyze relationships between N-d and cloud water chemical composition, in addition to the effect of environmental factors on the degree of the relationships. Warm, marine, stratocumulus clouds off the California coast were sampled throughout four summer campaigns between 2011 and 2016. A total of 385 cloud water samples were collected and analyzed for 80 chemical species. Single- and multispecies log-log linear regressions were performed to predict N-d using chemical composition. Single-species regressions reveal that the species that best predicts N-d is total sulfate (R-adj(2) = 0.40). Multispecies regressions reveal that adding more species does not necessarily produce a better model, as six or more species yield regressions that are statistically insignificant. A commonality among the multispecies regressions that produce the highest correlation with Nd was that most included sulfate (either total or non-sea-salt), an ocean emissions tracer (such as sodium), and an organic tracer (such as oxalate). Binning the data according to turbulence, smoke influence, and in-cloud height allowed for examination of the effect of these environmental factors on the composition-N-d correlation. Accounting for turbulence, quantified as the standard deviation of vertical wind speed, showed that the correlation between N-d with both total sulfate and sodium increased at higher turbulence conditions, consistent with turbulence promoting the mixing between ocean surface and cloud base. Considering the influence of smoke significantly improved the correlation with N-d for two biomass burning tracer species in the study region, specifically oxalate and iron. When binning by in-cloud height, non-sea-salt sulfate and sodium correlated best with N-d at cloud top, whereas iron and oxalate correlated best with N-d at cloud base.

Even for the planets in the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in the properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors. Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune 'desert'(1,2)(a region in mass-radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly valuable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b(3), which is thought to have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b(4)and NGTS-4b(5), on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their outer atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which has a radius smaller than Neptune's but an anomalously large mass of39.1-2.6+2.7Earth masses and a density of5.2-0.8+0.7grams per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth's. Interior-structure models suggest that any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than3.9-0.9+0.8 per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided substantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation(6). Although photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses) hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying that any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or other volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the remnant core of a giant planet. Observations of TOI-849b reveal a radius smaller than Neptune's but a large mass of about 40 Earth masses, indicating that the planet is the remnant core of a gas giant.

DES Collaboration	OzDES multi-object fibre spectroscopy for the Dark Energy Survey: results and second data release	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						transients: supernovae; quasars: supermassive black holes; cosmology: dark energy; surveys; catalogues; techniques: spectroscopic	LEGACY SURVEY; SUPERNOVAE	We present a description of the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) and summarize the results from its 6 years of operations. Using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, OzDES has monitored 771 active galactic nuclei, classified hundreds of supernovae, and obtained redshifts for thousands of galaxies that hosted a transient within the 10 deep fields of the Dark Energy Survey. We also present the second OzDES data release, containing the redshifts of almost 30 000 sources, some as faint as r(AB) = 24 mag, and 375 000 individual spectra. These data, in combination with the time-series photometry from the Dark Energy Survey, will be used to measure the expansion history of the Universe out to z similar to 1.2 and the masses of hundreds of black holes out to z similar to 4. OzDES is a template for future surveys that combine simultaneous monitoring of targets with wide-field imaging cameras and wide-field multi-object spectrographs.	[Lidman, C.; Tucker, B.

DES Collaboration	DES16C3cje: A low-luminosity, long-lived supernova	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual: (DES16C3cje)	TIDAL DISRUPTION; PAIR-INSTABILITY; STAR-FORMATION; LIGHT CURVES; LATE TIMES; SN 2005CS; EVOLUTION; FALLBACK; TRANSIENTS; PHOTOMETRY	We present DES16C3cje, a low-luminosity, long-lived type II supernova (SN II) at redshift 0.0618, detected by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). DES16C3cje is a unique SN. The spectra are characterized by extremely narrow photospheric lines corresponding to very low expansion velocities of less than or similar to 1500 km s(-1), and the light curve shows an initial peak that fades after 50 d before slowly rebrightening over a further 100 d to reach an absolute brightness of M-r similar to 15.5 mag. The decline rate of the late-time light curve is then slower than that expected from the powering by radioactive decay of Co-56, but is comparable to that expected from accretion power. Comparing the bolometric light curve with hydrodynamical models, we find that DES16C3cje can be explained by either (i) a low explosion energy (0.11 foe) and relatively large Ni-56 production of 0.075 M-circle dot from an similar to 15 M-circle dot red supergiant progenitor typical of other SNe II, or (ii) a relatively compact similar to 40 M-circle dot star, explosion energy of 1 foe, and 0.08 M-circle dot of Ni-56. Both scenarios require additional energy input to explain the late-time light curve, which is consistent with fallback accretion at a rate of similar to 0.5 x 10(-)(8) M-circle dot s(-1).

The ALPINE ALMA [C II] Survey: on the nature of an extremely obscured serendipitous galaxy	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift	FAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; DUST CONTENT; EMISSION; STELLAR; COSMOS; MASS	We report the serendipitous discovery of a dust-obscured galaxy observed as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program to INvestigate [C II] at Early times (ALPINE). While this galaxy is detected both in line and continuum emissions in ALMA Band 7, it is completely dark in the observed optical/near-infrared bands and only shows a significant detection in the UltraVISTA K-s band. We discuss the nature of the observed ALMA line, that is [C II] at z similar to 4.6 or high-J CO transitions at z similar to 2.2. In the first case, we find a [C II]/FIR luminosity ratio of log(L-[C II]/L-FIR) similar to -2.5, consistent with the average value for local star-forming galaxies (SFGs). In the second case instead, the source would lie at larger CO luminosities than those expected for local SFGs and high-z submillimetre galaxies. At both redshifts, we derive the star formation rate (SFR) from the ALMA continuum and the physical parameters of the galaxy, such as the stellar mass (M-*), by fitting its spectral energy distribution. Exploiting the results of this work, we believe that our source is a 'main-sequence', dusty SFG at z = 4.6 (i.e. [C II] emitter) with log(SFR/M-circle dot yr(-1)) similar to 1.4 and log(M-*/M-circle dot) similar to 9.9. As a support to this scenario our galaxy, if at this redshift, lies in a massive protocluster recently discovered at z similar to 4.57, at only similar to 1 proper Mpc from its centre. This work underlines the crucial role of the ALPINE survey in making a census of this class of objects, in order to unveil their contribution to the global SFR density at the end of the Reionization epoch.

The universal acceleration scale from stellar feedback	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; cosmology: dark matter	REGULATED STAR-FORMATION; GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS; COLD DARK-MATTER; NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS; RADIATION PRESSURE; SPIRAL GALAXIES; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; SUPERNOVA FEEDBACK; ROTATION CURVES; DWARF GALAXIES	It has been established for decades that rotation curves deviate from the Newtonian gravity expectation given baryons alone below a characteristic acceleration scale g(dagger) similar to 10(-8) cm s(-2), a scale promoted to a new fundamental constant in MOND. In recent years, theoretical and observational studies have shown that the star formation efficiency (SFE) of dense gas scales with surface density, SFE similar to Sigma/Sigma(crit) with Sigma(crit) similar to <(p) over dot /m(*)>/(pi G) similar to 1000M(circle dot) pc(-2) (where <(p) over dot /m(*)> is the momentum flux output by stellar feedback per unit stellar mass in a young stellar population). We argue that the SFE, more generally, should scale with the local gravitational acceleration, i.e. that SFE similar to g(tot) /g(crit) (G M-tot/R-2)/<(p) over dot /m(*)>, where M-tot is the total gravitating mass and g(crit) = <(p) over dot /m(*)> = pi G Sigma(crit) approximate to 10(-8) cm s(-2) g(dagger). Hence, the observed gt may correspond to the characteristic acceleration scale above which stellar feedback cannot prevent efficient star formation, and baryons will eventually come to dominate. We further show how this may give rise to the observed acceleration scaling g(obs) similar to (g(baryon) g(dagger))(1/2) (where g(baryon) is the acceleration due to baryons alone) and flat rotation curves. The derived characteristic acceleration g(dagger) can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants (gravitational constant, proton mass, and Thomson cross-section): g(dagger) similar to 0.1 G m(p)/sigma(T).

We define the ratio between the standard deviation of the galaxy brightness and the mean value of the standard deviation as a measure of a galaxy's optical variability. A sample of 814 Virgo galaxies with 230 263 observations shows a monotonically decreasing trend of optical variability with increasing clustercentric distance. The variability level inside the cluster is 3.2 sigma higher than the level outside. We fit the variability with a linear function and find that the data reject a distance-independent model. We examine 217 background galaxies for comparison and find no significant trend in galaxy variability. We assess the relation with Monte Carlo simulation by rebuilding the brightness of each galaxy. The simulation shows a monotonically decreasing relation for member galaxy variability and a distance-independent relation for background galaxies. Our result is consistent with the theory that the cold gas flowing inwards the cluster centre fuels AGN activity. This work is a new implementation of the method using optical variability to investigate the relation between galaxies evolution and their environment.

The paucity of in situ salinity measurements in the Arctic Ocean has limited our ability to study Arctic-Ocean freshwater variability. Although satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH) and ocean bottom pressure (OBP) have been used together to infer depth-integrated freshwater content changes, these measurements are limited in sampling and resolution. Motivated by the recent development of sea surface salinity (SSS) remote sensing, we explore the use of SSS as a proxy for Arctic freshwater changes. As a first step, here we conduct a proof-of-concept study by analyzing the output of an ocean-ice state estimation product. We find that SSS variations are coherent with those of SSH-minus-OBP across the Arctic basin (with R similar to -0.8) except for those in the center of the Beaufort Gyre and the region affected by the subpolar North Atlantic inflow. On Arctic shelves, the linear regression coefficient between SSS and SSH-minus-OBP is -0.3 pss/cm or larger in magnitude. The results suggest that SSS is a good proxy for Arctic freshwater changes, and satellite SSH-minus-OBP can be used to evaluate satellite SSS quality.

J	Iverson, JK; Preskill, J				Iverson, Joseph K.; Preskill, John			Coherence in logical quantum channels	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						quantum error correcting codes; coherent noise; toric code; surface code; quantum computing	COMPUTATION	We study the effectiveness of quantum error correction against coherent noise. Coherent errors (for example, unitary noise) can interfere constructively, so that in some cases the average infidelity of a quantum circuit subjected to coherent errors may increase quadratically with the circuit size; in contrast, when errors are incoherent (for example, depolarizing noise), the average infidelity increases at worst linearly with circuit size. We consider the performance of quantum stabilizer codes against a noise model in which a unitary rotation is applied to each qubit, where the axes and angles of rotation are nearly the same for all qubits. In particular, we show that for the toric code subject to such independent coherent noise, and for minimal-weight decoding, the logical channel after error correction becomes increasingly incoherent as the length of the code increases, provided the noise strength decays inversely with the code distance. A similar conclusion holds for weakly correlated coherent noise. Our methods can also be used for analyzing the performance of other codes and fault-tolerant protocols against coherent noise. However, our result does not show that the coherence of the logical channel is suppressed in the more physically relevant case where the noise strength is held constant as the code block grows, and we recount the difficulties that prevented us from extending the result to that case. Nevertheless our work supports the idea that fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes will work effectively against coherent noise, providing encouraging news for quantum hardware builders who worry about the damaging effects of control errors and coherent interactions with the environment.

Many of these transitions are achieved by spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanisms, allowing cells and tissues to acquire pattern and polarity by virtue of local interactions without an upstream supply of information. The combined work of theory and experiment has elucidated how these systems break symmetry during developmental transitions. Given that such transitions are multiple and their temporal ordering is crucial, an equally important question is how these developmental transitions are coordinated in time. Using a minimal mass-conserved substrate-depletion model for symmetry breaking as our case study, we elucidate mechanisms by which cells and tissues can couple reaction-diffusion-driven symmetry breaking to the timing of developmental transitions, arguing that the dependence of patterning mode on system size may be a generic principle by which developing organisms measure time. By analysing different regimes of our model, simulated on growing domains, we elaborate three distinct behaviours, allowing for clock-, timer- or switch-like dynamics. Relating these behaviours to experimentally documented case studies of developmental timing, we provide a minimal conceptual framework to interrogate how developing organisms coordinate developmental transitions.

MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Oligopolistic competition; Firm entry; Managerial incentives	PERFORMANCE; PRECOMMITMENT; EFFICIENCY; CONTRACTS; BANKING; PAY	Motivated by empirical evidence, we develop an incentive contracting model under oligopolistic competition to study how incumbent firms adjust managerial incentives following deregulation policies that enhance competition. We show that firms elicit higher managerial effort by offering stronger incentives as an optimal response to entry, as long as incumbent firms act as production leaders. Our model draws a link between an industry-specific feature, the time needed to build production capacity, and the effect that product market competition has on executive compensation. We offer novel testable implications regarding how this industry-specific feature shapes the incentive structure of executive pay. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rising Trends in Heatwave Metrics Across Southern California	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						heatwave; severity; California; trends; temperature; urbanization	ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; HUMAN HEALTH; WAVE EVENTS; SHADE TREES; ENERGY USE; MORTALITY; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE; DROUGHT; RISK	Research on heatwaves has gained significant impetus over the past decade due to a warming planet and rapid 21st century urbanization. This study examines driving factors influencing heatwave trends and interannual variability across Southern California (SoCal) from 1950-2020. Inland urban areas of Los Angeles county are the most susceptible to heatwaves with strong increasing trends in frequency, duration, and intensity that are closely tied to nighttime warming. Coastal and rural areas are less impacted but show a significant increase in heatwave frequency over the past two decades. Heatwave nighttime temperatures combined with high humidity have been increasing at a rapid rate of similar to 1 degrees C/decade since the 1980s-elevating heat stress and mortality risk to vulnerable urban communities. The increased nighttime humidity is associated with an anomalous moisture source off the coast of Baja California that has intensified over the past decade and is linked to ocean warming trends and changes in the California current system. Heatwaves are starting earlier and ending later in the year for urban regions. This augments public health risks and sets the stage for more intense fall wildfires by enhancing the drying of fuels. Droughts and heatwaves are strongly linked, particularly in inland urban and rural areas that have a high statistical probability of heatwaves increasing in frequency (42%), duration (26%), and daily mean temperature (2.2%) during severe drought conditions. Better understanding of heatwave climate drivers and underlying physical processes could help with prediction skill, in addition to providing effective data-driven recommendations for mitigation efforts in SoCal's vulnerable urban regions.

Break detection and outlier removal have been automated so that decades of daily measurements from thousands of stations can be processed in a few hours. New measurements are added, and parameters are updated every week. Model parameters allow separation of interseismic, annual, coseismic, and postseismic signals. Tools available through GeoGateway (http://geo-gateway.org) allow rapid visualization and analysis of these terms for results that can be subsetted in time or space. Results show highly variable and nonlinear motion for GPS stations in southern California. The variable motion is related to seasonal motions, distributed tectonic motion, earthquakes, and postseismic motions that can continue for years. In some areas results suggest that additional processes are responsible for the observed motions. In general, following earthquakes, stations return to their long-term motions after 2-3 years, though some exceptions occur. The use of the tools shows nonlinear motion in the Salton Trough of southern California related to the 2010 M7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, 2012 Brawley earthquake swarm, and a creep event on the Superstition Hills fault in 2017.

Characterization of Aerosol Hygroscopicity Over the Northeast Pacific Ocean: Impacts on Prediction of CCN and Stratocumulus Cloud Droplet Number Concentrations	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						aerosols</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; hygroscopicity</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; marine stratocumulus</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>	MARINE BOUNDARY-LAYER; SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; ENTRAINMENT INTERFACE LAYER; SIZE-RESOLVED MEASUREMENTS; BIOMASS BURNING SMOKE; MEGA-CITY GUANGZHOU; CONDENSATION NUCLEI; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; MIXING STATE	During the Marine Aerosol Cloud and Wildfire Study (MACAWS) in June and July of 2018, aerosol composition and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties were measured over the N.E. Pacific to characterize the influence of aerosol hygroscopicity on predictions of ambient CCN and stratocumulus cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). Three vertical regions were characterized, corresponding to the marine boundary layer (MBL), an above-cloud organic aerosol layer (AC-OAL), and the free troposphere (FT) above the AC-OAL. The aerosol hygroscopicity parameter (kappa) was calculated from CCN measurements (kappa(CCN)) and bulk aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements (kappa(AMS)). Within the MBL, measured hygroscopicities varied between values typical of both continental environments (similar to 0.2) and remote marine locations (similar to 0.7). For most flights, CCN closure was achieved within 20% in the MBL. For five of the seven flights, assuming a constant aerosol size distribution produced similar or better CCN closure than assuming a constant "marine" hygroscopicity (kappa = 0.72). An aerosol-cloud parcel model was used to characterize the sensitivity of predicted stratocumulus CDNC to aerosol hygroscopicity, size distribution properties, and updraft velocity. Average CDNC sensitivity to accumulation mode aerosol hygroscopicity is 39% as large as the sensitivity to the geometric median diameter in this environment. Simulations suggest CDNC sensitivity to hygroscopicity is largest in marine stratocumulus with low updraft velocities (<0.2 m s(-1)), where accumulation mode particles are most relevant to CDNC, and in marine stratocumulus or cumulus with large updraft velocities (>0.6 m s(-1)), where hygroscopic properties of the Aitken mode dominate hygroscopicity sensitivity.

Many retrieval methods have been developed to estimate top-of-canopy SIF using ground-based spectroscopy. However, inconsistencies among methods may confound interpretation of SIF dynamics, eco-physiological/environmental drivers, and its relationship with photosynthesis. Using high temporal- and spectral resolution ground-based spectroscopy, we aimed to (1) evaluate performance of SIF retrieval methods under diverse sky conditions using continuous field measurements; (2) assess method sensitivity to fluctuating light, reflectance, and fluorescence emission spectra; and (3) inform users for optimal ground-based SIF retrieval. Analysis included field measurements from bi-hemispherical and hemispherical-conical systems and synthetic upwelling radiance constructed from measured downwelling radiance, simulated reflectance, and simulated fluorescence for benchmarking. Fraunhofer-based differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) and singular vector decomposition (SVD) retrievals exhibit convergent SIF-PAR relationships and diurnal consistency across different sky conditions, while O(2)A-based spectral fitting method (SFM), SVD, and modified Fraunhofer line discrimination (3FLD) exhibit divergent SIF-PAR relationships across sky conditions. Such behavior holds across system configurations, though hemispherical-conical systems diverge less across sky conditions. O(2)A retrieval accuracy, influenced by atmospheric distortion, improves with a narrower fitting window and when training SVD with temporally local spectra. This may impact SIF-photosynthesis relationships interpreted by previous studies using O(2)A-based retrievals with standard (759-767.76 nm) fitting windows. Fraunhofer-based retrievals resist atmospheric impacts but are noisier and more sensitive to assumed SIF spectral shape than O(2)A-based retrievals. We recommend SVD or SFM using reduced fitting window (759.5-761.5 nm) for robust far-red SIF retrievals across sky conditions.

Revisiting the Impact of Dust Production from Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet Binaries	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Circumstellar dust; Wolf-Rayet stars; Infrared astronomy; WC stars; Interstellar dust	INNER GALACTIC PLANE; MASS-LOSS RATES; PINWHEEL NEBULA; MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; INFRARED SURVEY; WIND COLLISION; LONG-PERIOD; X-RAY; STARS; EMISSION	We present a dust spectral energy distribution (SED) and binary stellar population analysis revisiting the dust production rates (DPRs) in the winds of carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) binaries and their impact on galactic dust budgets.DustEM SED models of 19 Galactic WC "dustars" reveal DPRs ofMyr(-1)and carbon dust condensation fractions,chi(C), between 0.002% and 40%. A large (0.1-1.0 mu m) dust grain size composition is favored for efficient dustars where chi(C) greater than or similar to 1%. Results for dustars with known orbital periods verify a power-law relation between chi(C), orbital period, WC mass-loss rate, and wind velocity consistent with predictions from theoretical models of dust formation in colliding-wind binaries. We incorporated dust production into Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models to analyze dust production rates from WC dustars, asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and core-collapse supernovae (SNe). BPASS models assuming constant star formation (SF) and a coeval 10(6)M(circle dot) population were performed at low, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like, and solar metallicities (Z = 0.001, 0.008, and 0.020). Both constant SF and coeval models indicate that SNe are net dust destroyers at all metallicities. Constant SF models at LMC-like metallicities show that AGB stars slightly outproduce WC binaries and RSGs by factors of 2-3, whereas at solar metallicities WC binaries are the dominant source of dust for similar to 60 Myr until the onset of AGBs, which match the dust input of WC binaries. Coeval population models show that, for "bursty" SF, AGB stars dominate dust production at late times (t greater than or similar to 70 Myr).

Dynamical analysis of these systems imposes important constraints on formation mechanisms of these wide-orbit companions. As part of the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey we report the detection of a second planetary-mass companion around the 17 Myr-old, solar-type star TYC 8998-760-1 that is located in the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. The companion has a projected physical separation of 320 au and several individual photometric measurements from 1.1 to 3.8 microns constrain a companion mass of 6 1M(Jup), which is equivalent to a mass ratio ofq = 0.57 0.10% with respect to the primary. With the previously detected 14 3M(Jup)companion that is orbiting the primary at 160 au, TYC 8998-760-1 is the first directly imaged multiplanet system that is detected around a young, solar analog. We show that circular orbits are stable, but that mildly eccentric orbits for either/both components (e > 0.1) are chaotic on gigayear timescales, implying in situ formation or a very specific ejection by an unseen third companion. Due to the wide separations of the companions TYC 8998-760-1 is an excellent system for spectroscopic and photometric follow-up with space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope.

More recently it has been suggested that it might be involved in the time averaging of synaptic signals, which can then lead to the high precision of information stored at a single synapse. However, the role of the scaffolding molecule, neurogranin (Ng), in governing the dynamics of CaMKII is not yet fully understood. In this work, we adopt a rule-based modeling approach through the Monte Carlo method to study the effect of Ca2+ signals on the dynamics of CaMKII phosphorylation in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Calcium surges are observed in synaptic spines during an EPSP and back-propagating action potential due to the opening of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. Using agent-based models, we computationally investigate the dynamics of phosphorylation of CaMKII monomers and dodecameric holoenzymes. The scaffolding molecule, Ng, when present in significant concentration, limits the availability of free calmodulin (CaM), the protein which activates CaMKII in the presence of calcium. We show that Ng plays an important modulatory role in CaMKII phosphorylation following a surge of high calcium concentration. We find a non-intuitive dependence of this effect on CaM concentration that results from the different affinities of CaM for CaMKII depending on the number of calcium ions bound to the former. It has been shown previously that in the absence of phosphatase, CaMKII monomers integrate over Ca2+ signals of certain frequencies through autophosphorylation (Pepke et al, Plos Comp. Bio., 2010). We also study the effect of multiple calcium spikes on CaMKII holoenzyme autophosphorylation, and show that in the presence of phosphatase, CaMKII behaves as a leaky integrator of calcium signals, a result that has been recently observed in vivo. Our models predict that the parameters of this leaky integrator are finely tuned through the interactions of Ng, CaM, CaMKII, and PP1, providing a mechanism to precisely control the sensitivity of synapses to calcium signals.

They are commonly thought of as being analogs of high-redshift Ly alpha-emitting galaxies. The defining characteristic of GP galaxies is a high-excitation nebular spectrum with very large equivalent width lines, leading to the recognition that GP-like galaxies can also be identified in samples of emission-line galaxies. Here we compare the properties a sample of [Oiii]-selected SFGs (z = 0.29-0.41) from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS) with the color-selected GPs. We find that the KISS [Oiii]-selected galaxies overlap with the parameter space defined by the color-selected GPs; the two samples appear to be drawn from the same population of objects. We compare the KISS GPs with the full H alpha-selected KISS SFG sample (z< 0.1) and find that they are extreme systems. Many appear to be young systems at their observed look-back times (3-4 Gyr), with more than 90% of their rest-frameB-band luminosity coming from the starburst population. We compute the volume density of the KISS red (KISSR) GPs atz = 0.29-0.41 and find that they are extremely rare objects. We do not see galaxies as extreme as the KISSR GPs in the local universe, although we recognize several lower-luminosity systems atz< 0.1.

We applied several point-spread function (PSF) subtraction techniques to the observations (Mask-and-Interpolate, RDI-NMF, RDI-KLIP, and ADI-KLIP) to measure the geometric parameters and the scattering phase function for the disk. To understand the systematic errors associated with PSF subtraction, we also forward-modeled the observations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and a simple model for the disk. We found that measurements of the disk geometric parameters were robust, with all of our analyses yielding consistent results; however, measurements of the scattering phase function were challenging to reconstruct from PSF-subtracted images, despite extensive testing. As a result, we estimated the scattering phase function using disk modeling. We searched for a dependence of the scattering phase function with respect to the GPI filters but found none. We compared theH-band scattering phase function with that measured by Hubble Space Telescope STIS at visual wavelengths and discovered a blue color at small scattering angles and a red color at large scattering angles, consistent with predictions and laboratory measurements of large grains. Finally, we successfully modeled the SPHEREH2HR 4796A scattered phase function using a distribution of hollow spheres composed of silicates, carbon, and metallic iron.

Unresolved Binary Exoplanet Host Stars Fit as Single Stars: Effects on the Stellar Parameters	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Stellar spectral lines; Stellar properties; Fundamental parameters of stars; High resolution spectroscopy; Binary stars; Planet hosting stars		In this work, we quantify the effect of an unresolved companion star on the derived stellar parameters of the primary star if a blended spectrum is fit assuming the star is single. Fitting tools that determine stellar parameters from spectra typically fit for a single star, but we know that up to half of all exoplanet host stars may have one or more companion stars. We use high-resolution spectra of planet host stars in the Kepler field from the California-Kepler Survey to create simulated binaries; we select eight stellar pairs and vary the contribution of the secondary star, then determine stellar parameters withSpecMatch-Empand compare them to the parameters derived for the primary star alone. We find that, in most cases, the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and stellar radius derived from the composite spectrum are within 2-3 sigma of the values determined from the unblended spectrum, but the deviations depend on the properties of the two stars. Relatively bright companion stars that are similar to the primary star have the largest effect on the derived parameters; in these cases, the stellar radii can be overestimated by up to 60%. We find that metallicities are generally underestimated, with values up to eight times smaller than the typical uncertainty in [Fe/H]. Our study shows that follow-up observations are necessary to detect or set limits on stellar companions of planetary host stars so that stellar (and planet) parameters are as accurate as possible.

The Spectacular Ultraviolet Flash from the Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2019yvq	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							BOLOMETRIC LIGHT CURVES; WHITE-DWARF MODELS; SYNTHETIC OBSERVABLES; BRIGHT SUPERNOVA; LOW-RESOLUTION; SN 2011FE; SPECTRA; PROGENITORS; CONSTRAINTS; LUMINOSITY	Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide essential clues for understanding the progenitor system that gave rise to the terminal thermonuclear explosion. We present exquisite observations of SN 2019yvq, the second observed SN Ia, after iPTF 14atg, to display an early flash of emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that SN 2019yvq was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was moderately underluminous for an SN Ia (M-g approximate to -18.5 mag at peak) yet featured very high absorption velocities (v approximate to 15,000 km s(-1) for Si II lambda 6355 at peak). We find that many of the observational features of SN 2019yvq, aside from the flash, can be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive Ni-56 is relatively low (we measure M-56Ni = 0.31 +/- 0.05 M-circle dot) and it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of the ejecta. To explain both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of SN 2019yvq we consider four different models: interaction between the SN ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of Ni-56 in the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two white dwarfs. Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the observations; it is clear additional tuning is required to better match SN 2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra of SN 2019yvq will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion, strong [Ca II] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O I] emission, if it was due to a violent merger.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ALL-SKY SURVEY; LOW-MASS STARS; BROWN DWARFS; DISCOVERY; LUMINOSITY; CLASSIFICATION; KINEMATICS; PRIMEVAL; HYDROGEN; SAMPLE	We present the discoveries of WISEA J041451.67-585456.7 and WISEA J181006.18-101000.5, two low-temperature (1200-1400 K), high proper motion T-type subdwarfs. Both objects were discovered via their high proper motion (>0 ''.5 yr(-1)); WISEA J181006.18-101000.5 as part of the NEOWISE proper motion survey and WISEA J041451.67-585456.7 as part of the citizen science project Backyard Worlds; Planet 9. We have confirmed both as brown dwarfs with follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy. Their spectra and near-infrared colors are unique among known brown dwarfs, with some colors consistent with L-type brown dwarfs and other colors resembling those of the latest-type T dwarfs. While no forward model consistently reproduces the features seen in their near-infrared spectra, the closest matches suggest very low metallicities ([Fe/H] <= -1), making these objects likely the first examples of extreme subdwarfs of the T spectral class (esdT). WISEA J041451.67-585456.7 and WISEA J181006.18-101000.5 are found to be part of a small population of objects that occupy the "substellar transition zone," and have the lowest masses and effective temperatures of all objects in this group.

A New Class of Roche Lobe-filling Hot Subdwarf Binaries	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						B subdwarf stars; Stellar evolution; White dwarf stars; Compact binary stars; Stellar accretion	WHITE-DWARFS; B STARS; X-RAY; EVOLUTION; PROGENITORS; MODEL	We present the discovery of the second binary with a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf transferring mass to a white dwarf (WD) companion. This 56 minute binary was discovered using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Spectroscopic observations reveal an He-sdOB star with an effective temperature ofT(eff) = 33,700 1000 K and a surface gravity of log(g) = 5.54 0.11. The GTC+HiPERCAM light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the He-sdOB star and shows an eclipse of the He-sdOB by an accretion disk as well as a weak eclipse of the WD. We infer a He-sdOB mass ofM(sdOB) = 0.41 0.04Mand a WD mass ofM(WD) = 0.68 0.05M. The weak eclipses imply a WD blackbody temperature of 63,000 10,000 K and a radiusR(WD) = 0.0148 0.0020Ras expected for a WD of such high temperature. The He-sdOB star is likely undergoing hydrogen shell burning and will continue transferring mass for 1 Myr at a rate of 10(-9)Myr(-1), which is consistent with the high WD temperature. The hot subdwarf will then turn into a WD and the system will merge in 30 Myr. We suggest that Galactic reddening could bias discoveries toward preferentially finding Roche lobe-filling systems during the short-lived shell-burning phase. Studies using reddening-corrected samples should reveal a large population of helium core-burning hot subdwarfs withT(eff) 25,000 K in binaries of 60-90 minutes with WDs. Though not yet in contact, these binaries would eventually come into contact through gravitational-wave emission and explode as a subluminous thermonuclear supernova or evolve into a massive single WD.

Ooid Cortical Stratigraphy Reveals Common Histories of Individual Co-occurring Sedimentary Grains	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						ooids</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; sediment transport</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; carbonate chemistry</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; cortical stratigraphy</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>	GREAT-SALT-LAKE; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; SIZE; TRANSPORT; SEAWATER; PRECIPITATION; ABRASION; UTAH	Ooids are a common type of carbonate sand grain that form through a combination of constructive and destructive mechanisms: growth via precipitation and diminution via physical abrasion. Because growth and abrasion obey distinct morphometric rules, we developed an approach to quantitatively constrain the history of growth and abrasion of individual ooid grains using the record of evolving particle shape preserved by their cortical layers. We designed a model to simulate >10(6)possible growth-abrasion histories for each pair of cortical layer bounding surfaces in an individual ooid. Estimates for the durations of growth and abrasion of each cortical layer were obtained by identifying the simulated history that best fit the observed particle shape. We applied this approach to thin sections of "modern" lacustrine ooids collected from several locations in the Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT, to assess the spatial and temporal variability of environmental conditions from the perspective of individual grains within a single deposit. We found that GSL ooids do not all share the same histories: Clustering ooid histories by a Frechet distance metric revealed commonalities between grains found together locally within a deposit but distinct differences between subpopulations shared among localities across the GSL. These results support the tacit view that carbonate sedimentary grains found together in the environment do reflect a common history of sediment transport. This general approach to invert ooid cortical stratigraphy can be applied to characterize environmental variability over <1,000 year timescales in both marine and lacustrine ooid grainstones of any geologic age.

Intraspecific genetic variation of a Fagus sylvatica population in a temperate forest derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy time series	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						imaging spectroscopy; intraspecific variation; partial least squares regression; population genetics; temperate forest	PHOTOSYNTHETIC TRAITS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; BIODIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; IMAGERY; CONDUCTANCE; REGRESSION; PROTECTION; DIVERSITY; DEFENSE	The growing pace of environmental change has increased the need for large-scale monitoring of biodiversity. Declining intraspecific genetic variation is likely a critical factor in biodiversity loss, but is especially difficult to monitor: assessments of genetic variation are commonly based on measuring allele pools, which requires sampling of individuals and extensive sample processing, limiting spatial coverage. Alternatively, imaging spectroscopy data from remote platforms may hold the potential to reveal genetic structure of populations. In this study, we investigated how differences detected in an airborne imaging spectroscopy time series correspond to genetic variation within a population ofFagus sylvaticaunder natural conditions. We used multi-annual APEX (Airborne Prism Experiment) imaging spectrometer data from a temperate forest located in the Swiss midlands (Laegern, 47 degrees 28'N, 8 degrees 21'E), along with microsatellite data fromF. sylvaticaindividuals collected at the site. We identified variation in foliar reflectance independent of annual and seasonal changes which we hypothesize is more likely to correspond to stable genetic differences. We established a direct connection between the spectroscopy and genetics data by using partial least squares (PLS) regression to predict the probability of belonging to a genetic cluster from spectral data. We achieved the best genetic structure prediction by using derivatives of reflectance and a subset of wavebands rather than full-analyzed spectra. Our model indicates that spectral regions related to leaf water content, phenols, pigments, and wax composition contribute most to the ability of this approach to predict genetic structure ofF. sylvaticapopulation in natural conditions. This study advances the use of airborne imaging spectroscopy to assess tree genetic diversity at canopy level under natural conditions, which could overcome current spatiotemporal limitations on monitoring, understanding, and preventing genetic biodiversity loss imposed by requirements for extensive in situ sampling.

Dissecting the regulatory activity and sequence content of loci with exceptional numbers of transcription factor associations	GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article							HUMAN GENOME; BINDING; CELLS; OCCUPANCY; ENHANCERS; FEATURES; ELEMENTS; COMPLEX; ENCODE; SVM	DNA-associated proteins (DAPs) classically regulate gene expression by binding to regulatory loci such as enhancers or pro-moters. As expanding catalogs of genome-wide DAP binding maps reveal thousands of loci that, unlike the majority of con-ventional enhancers and promoters, associate with dozens of different DAPs with apparently little regard for motif preference, an understanding of DAP association and coordination at such regulatory loci is essential to deciphering how these regions contribute to normal development and disease. In this study, we aggregated publicly available ChIP-seq data from 469 human DAPs assayed in three cell lines and integrated these data with an orthogonal data set of 352 non -redundant, in vitro-derived motifs mapped to the genome within DNase I hypersensitivity footprints to characterize re-gions with high numbers of DAP associations. We establish a generalizable definition for high occupancy target (HOT) loci and identify putative driver DAP motifs in HepG2 cells, including HNF4A, SP1, SP5, and ETV4, that are highly prevalent and show sequence conservation at HOT loci. The number of different DAPs associated with an element is positively asso-ciated with evidence of regulatory activity, and by systematically mutating 245 HOT loci with a massively parallel muta-genesis assay, we localized regulatory activity to a central core region that depends on the motif sequences of our previously nominated driver DAPs. In sum, this work leverages the increasingly large number of DAP motif and ChIP-seq data publicly available to explore how DAP associations contribute to genome-wide transcriptional regulation.

To date, however, the availability of such sources around 2 mu m has been scarce. Here, we present a frequency-modulated OFC operating around 2060 nm of wavelength exploiting the inherent gain nonlinearity of single-section GaSb-based quantum well diode lasers. A 2 mm long device operating as a self-starting comb outputs 50 mW of optical power over more than 10 nm of bandwidth while consuming <1 W of electrical power. Using the shifted-wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy technique, we characterize the generated frequency-modulated waveform and demonstrate a linearly chirped intermodal phase relationship among the entire emission optical bandwidth. Furthermore, by compensating for the linear chirp using a single-mode optical fiber with opposite dispersion, 6 ps long optical pulses are generated. The frequency stability of the devices with similar to 19.3 GHz repetition rates allows us to perform mode-resolved free-running dual-comb spectroscopy. All rights reserved. (c) 2020 Author(s).

J	Bilal, OR; Foehr, A; Daraio, C				Bilal, Osama R.; Foehr, Andre; Daraio, Chiara			Enhancement of Deep-Subwavelength Band Gaps in Flat Spiral-Based Phononic Metamaterials Using the Trampoline Phenomena	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						dynamics; mechanical properties of materials; structures; vibration; wave propagation	PLATES; SOUND	Elastic and acoustic metamaterials can sculpt dispersion of waves through resonances. In turn, resonances can give rise to negative effective properties, usually localized around the resonance frequencies, which support band gaps at subwavelength frequencies (i.e., below the Bragg-scattering limit). However, the band gaps width correlates strongly with the resonators' mass and volume, which limits their functionality in applications. Trampoline phenomena have been numerically and experimentally shown to broaden the operational frequency ranges of two-dimensional, pillar-based metamaterials through perforation. In this work, we demonstrate trampoline phenomena in lightweight and planar lattices consisting of arrays of Archimedean spirals in unit cells. Spiral-based metamaterials have been shown to support different band gap opening mechanisms, namely, Bragg-scattering, local resonances and inertia amplification. Here, we numerically analyze and experimentally realize trampoline phenomena in planar metasurfaces for different lattice tessellations. Finally, we carry out a comparative study between trampoline pillars and spirals and show that trampoline spirals outperform the pillars in lightweight, compactness and operational bandwidth.

In this regime hydrodynamical instabilities may become important. In this work we investigate the gas and dust structure and dynamics for a typical T Tauri system under the influence of the vertical shear instability (VSI). We use global 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations covering all 360 degrees of azimuth with embedded particles of 0.1 and 1 mm size, evolved for 400 orbits. Stellar irradiation heating is included with opacities for 0.1-10 mu m sized dust. Saturated VSI turbulence produces a stress-to-pressure ratio of alpha is lowest within 30 au of the star, where thermal relaxation is slower relative to the orbital period and approaches the rate below which VSI is cut off. The rise in alpha from 20 to 30 au causes a dip in the surface density near 35 au, leading to Rossby wave instability and the generation of a stationary, long-lived vortex spanning about 4 au in radius and 40 au in azimuth. Our results confirm previous findings that millimeter-sized grains are strongly vertically mixed by the VSI. The scale height aspect ratio for 1 mm grains is determined to be 0.037, much higher than the valueH/r = 0.007 obtained from millimeter-wave observations of the HL Tau system. The measured aspect ratio is better fit by nonideal MHD models. In our VSI turbulence model, the millimeter grains drift radially inwards and many are trapped and concentrated inside the vortex. The turbulence induces a velocity dispersion of similar to 12 m s(-1)for the millimeter grains, indicating that grain-grain collisions could lead to fragmentation.

DES Collaboration	Chemical Analysis of the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Grus II. Signature of High-mass Stellar Nucleosynthesis	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Chemical abundances; Dwarf galaxies; Chemically peculiar stars; Stellar abundances	METAL-POOR STARS; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; ABUNDANCE RATIOS; NEUTRON-CAPTURE; EVOLUTION; ENRICHMENT; ELEMENTS; CARBON	We present a detailed abundance analysis of the three brightest member stars at the top of the giant branch of the ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Grus II. All stars exhibit a higher than expected [Mg/Ca] ratio compared to metal-poor stars in other UFD galaxies and in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Nucleosynthesis in high-mass (M) core-collapse supernovae has been shown to create this signature. The abundances of this small sample (three) stars suggests the chemical enrichment of Grus II could have occurred through substantial high-mass stellar evolution, and is consistent with the framework of a top-heavy initial mass function. However, with only three stars it cannot be ruled out that the abundance pattern is the result of a stochastic chemical enrichment at early times in the galaxy. The most metal-rich of the three stars also possesses a small enhancement in rapid neutron-capture (r-process) elements. The abundance pattern of ther-process elements in this star matches the scaledr-process pattern of the solar system andr-process enhanced stars in other dwarf galaxies and in the MW halo, hinting at a common origin for these elements across a range of environments. All current proposed astrophysical sites ofr-process element production are associated with high-mass stars, thus the possible top-heavy initial mass function of Grus II would increase the likelihood of any of these events occurring. The time delay between the alpha andr-process element enrichment of the galaxy favors a neutron star merger as the origin of ther-process elements in Grus II.	[Hansen, T. T.; Marshall, J.

We measure the microlens parallax vector pi(E) using Spitzer and ground-based light curves with constraints on the direction of lens-source relative proper motion derived from Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) GRAVITY observations. Combining this pi(E) determination with the angular Einstein radius theta(E) measured by VLTI-GRAVITY observations, we find that the lens is a star with mass M-L = 0.495 +/- 0.063 M-circle dot at a distance D-L = 429 +/- 21 pc. We find that the blended light basically all comes from the lens. The lens-source proper motion is mu(rel, hel) = 26.55 +/- 0.36 mas yr(-1), so with currently available adaptive-optics instruments, the lens and source can be resolved in 2021. This is the first microlensing event whose lens mass is unambiguously measured by interferometry + satellite-parallax observations, which opens a new window for mass measurements of isolated objects such as stellar-mass black holes.

Hydroxylated Mg-rich Amorphous Silicates: A New Component of the 3.2 mu m Absorption Band of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Astrochemistry; Comets; Laboratory astrophysics	EXPOSED WATER ICE; CRYSTALLINE OLIVINE; INTERPLANETARY DUST; ION IRRADIATION; ENERGY; EVOLUTION; AMORPHIZATION; MINERALOGY; ENSTATITE; INSIGHTS	The VIRTIS imaging spectrometer on board Rosetta has shown that the nucleus surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/CG) is characterized by a broad absorption band at around 3.2 mu m. The feature is ubiquitous across the surface and its attribution to (a) specific material(s) has been challenging. In the present Letter, we report an experimental investigation showing that the interaction of hydrogen atoms with Mg-rich amorphous silicates determines the formation of hydroxyl groups. The resulting IR spectrum exhibits a broad feature around 3.2 mu m similar to that of comet 67P/CG. Hapke's radiative transfer model was employed to estimate an upper limit contribution of 65% of hydroxylated silicates to the observed cometary band intensity. The presence of a hydroxylated fraction in silicates on the cometary surface would represent an evolutionary link between primitive objects of the solar system and dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), where silicate grains can be hydroxylated after having interacted with hydrogen atoms. This link is consistent with the detection of the aliphatic organics in 67P/CG that also originate in the ISM.

Carbon-grain Sublimation: A New Top-down Component of Protostellar Chemistry	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Astrochemistry; Protostars	SPECTRAL-LINE SURVEY; STAR-FORMING REGION; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; COMPLEX ORGANIC-MOLECULES; HOT-CORE; ORION-KL; CHEMICAL DIFFERENTIATION; SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; GHZ; ABUNDANCES	Earth's carbon deficit has been an persistent problem in our understanding of the formation of our solar system. A possible solution would be the sublimation of carbon grains at the so-called soot line (similar to 300 K) early in the planet-formation process. Here, we argue that the most likely signatures of this process are an excess of hydrocarbons and nitriles inside the soot line, and a higher excitation temperature for these molecules compared to oxygen-bearing complex organics that desorb around the water snowline (similar to 100 K). Such characteristics have been reported in the literature, for example, in Orion KL, although not uniformly, potentially due to differences in the observational settings and analysis methods of different studies or the episodic nature of protostellar accretion. If this process is active, this would mean that there is a heretofore unknown component to the carbon chemistry during the protostellar phase that is acting from the top down-starting from the destruction of larger species-instead of from the bottom up from atoms. In the presence of such a top-down component, the origin of organic molecules needs to be re-explored.	[van 't Hoff, Merel L.

Minimum-Mass Limits for Streamlined Venus Atmospheric Probes	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article								Small, expendable drop probes are an attractive method for making measurements in the lower atmosphere of Venus, augmenting the capabilities of orbiters or aerial platforms that must remain in the benign temperature region above 50 km altitude. However, probe miniaturization is impeded by the need to provide thermal and pressure protection for conventional payloads. This paper determines the minimum mass limits for an insulated pressure vessel probe that operates all the way to the Venusian surface. Scaling laws for the probe performance and mass of major system components are explicitly derived using a simple model that captures the relevant physics. Streamlining the probe is found to be a highly effective strategy for lowering the system mass, but it also reduces the time available for data collection and transmission. Tradeoffs, guidelines, and design charts are presented for an array of miniaturized probes. Total system masses on the order of 5 kg are plausible with streamlined probes if the desired science measurements can be performed faster than a standard Venus descent timeline.

An investigation of autonav across the solar system is continued here by assessing optical-only navigation performance in cislunar space using simulated observations of the center of the moon, lunar landmarks, artificial satellites, and asteroids. It is shown that autonav in cislunar space is feasible and effective within current technological capabilities, and that artificial satellites, the moon center, and lunar landmarks are effective targets for navigation in this region.

J	Chen, G; Ravi, V; Lu, WB				Chen, Ge; Ravi, Vikram; Lu, Wenbin			The Multiwavelength Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radio bursts; Radio transient sources; Neutron stars	FAST TRANSIENT SKY; MODEL; TELESCOPE; ENGINES; SCIENCE; SEARCH; COLORS	The engines that produce extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs), and the mechanism by which the emission is generated, remain unknown. Many FRB models predict prompt multiwavelength counterparts, which can be used to refine our knowledge of these fundamentals of the FRB phenomenon. However, several previous targeted searches for prompt FRB counterparts have yielded no detections and have additionally not reached sufficient sensitivity with respect to the predictions. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to estimate the ratio,eta, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission. Our technique combines the fluence distribution of the FRB population with results from several wide-field blind surveys for fast transients from the optical to the TeV bands. We present constraints on eta that improve upon previous observations even in the case where all unclassified transient events in existing surveys are FRB counterparts. In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for eta. However, it is possible that FRB counterparts are lurking among catalogs of unclassified transient events. Although our technique is robust to the present uncertainty in the FRB fluence distribution, its ultimate application to accurately estimate or bound eta will require the careful analysis of all candidate fast transient events in multiwavelength survey data sets.

Here we report on tests of the consistency and accuracy of the general relativistic radiative transfer codes used within the collaboration to model M87* and Sgr A*. We compare and evaluate (1) deflection angles for equatorial null geodesics in a Kerr spacetime; (2) images calculated from a series of simple, parameterized matter distributions in the Kerr metric using simplified emissivities and absorptivities; (3) for a subset of codes, images calculated from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations using different realistic synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities; (4) observables for the 2017 configuration of EHT, including visibility amplitudes and closure phases. The error in total flux is of order 1% when the codes are run with production numerical parameters. The dominant source of discrepancies for small camera distances is the location and detailed setup of the software "camera" that each code uses to produce synthetic images. We find that when numerical parameters are suitably chosen and the camera is sufficiently far away the images converge and that for given transfer coefficients, numerical uncertainties are unlikely to limit parameter estimation for the current generation of EHT observations. The purpose of this paper is to describe a verification and comparison of EHT radiative transfer codes. It is not to verify EHT models more generally.

Owing to the difficulty in conducting high-cadence observations of the Galactic plane over its vast area, which are necessary for the detection of microlensing events, their global properties were hitherto unknown. Here, we present results of the first comprehensive search for microlensing events in the Galactic plane. We searched an area of almost 3000 square degrees along the Galactic plane (vertical bar b vertical bar < 7 degrees, 0 degrees < l < 50 degrees, 190 degrees l < 360 degrees) observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) during 2013-2019 and detected 630 events. We demonstrate that the mean Einstein timescales of Galactic plane microlensing events are on average three times longer than those of Galactic bulge events, with little dependence on the Galactic longitude. We also measure the microlensing optical depth and event rate as a function of Galactic longitude and demonstrate that they exponentially decrease with the angular distance from the Galactic Center (with the characteristic angular scale length of 32 degrees). The average optical depth decreases from 0.5 x 10(-6) at l = 10 degrees to 1.5 x 10(-8) in the Galactic anticenter. We also find that the optical depth in the longitude range 240 degrees l < 330 degrees is asymmetric about the Galactic equator, which we interpret as a signature of the Galactic warp.

In this paper, we revisit this data vector and examine its stability under different cosmological models. We find that the CMB distance priors are an accurate substitute for the full CMB data when probing dark energy dynamics. This is true when the primordial power spectrum model is directly generalized from the power spectrum of the model used in the derivation of the distance priors from the CMB data. We discover a difference when a non-flat model with the untilted primordial inflation power spectrum is used to measure the distance priors. This power spectrum is a radical change from the more conventional tilted primordial power spectrum and violates fundamental assumptions for the reliability of the CMB shift parameters. We also investigate the performance of CMB distance priors when the sum of neutrino masses Sigma(m nu), and the effective number of relativistic species N(eff )are allowed to vary. Our findings are consistent with earlier results: the neutrino parameters can change the measurement of the sound horizon from CMB data, and thus the CMB distance priors. We find that when the neutrino model is allowed to vary, the cold dark matter density omega(c) and N-eff need to be included in the set of parameters that summarize CMB data, in order to reproduce the constraints from the full CMB data. We present an updated and expanded set of CMB distance priors which can reproduce constraints from the full CMB data within 1 sigma, and are applicable to models with massive neutrinos, as well as non-standard cosmologies.

Hot Dust-obscured Galaxies with Excess Blue Light	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Active galaxies; Galaxy evolution; High-redshift galaxies; Quasars; Infrared galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; QUASARS; STARBURST99; MORPHOLOGY; SCATTERING; EVOLUTION; MERGERS; GROWTH; GRAINS	Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are among the most luminous galaxies in the universe. Powered by highly obscured, possibly Compton-thick, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), Hot DOGs are characterized by spectral energy distributions that are very red in the mid-infrared yet dominated by the host galaxy stellar emission in the UV and optical. An earlier study identified a subsample of Hot DOGs with significantly enhanced UV emission. One target, W0204-0506, was studied in detail and, based on Chandra observations, it was concluded that the enhanced emission was most likely due to either extreme unobscured star formation (star formation rate > 1000Myr(-1)) or to light from the highly obscured AGN scattered by gas or dust into our line of sight. Here, we present a follow-up study of W0204-0506 as well as two more Hot DOGs with excess UV emission. For the two new objects we obtained Chandra/ACIS-S observations, and for all three targets we obtained Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 F555W and F160W imaging. The analysis of these observations, combined with multiwavelength photometry and UV/optical spectroscopy suggests that UV emission is most likely dominated by light from the central highly obscured, hyperluminous AGN that has been scattered into our line of sight, by either gas or dust. We cannot decisively rule out, however, that star formation or a second AGN in the system may significantly contribute to the UV excess of these targets.	[Assef, R.

This has the potential to critically probe the mechanisms by which black holes accrete and launch outflows, and the structure of supermassive black hole spacetimes. However, accessing this information is a formidable analysis challenge for two reasons. First, the EHT natively produces a variety of data types that encode information about the image structure in nontrivial ways; these are subject to a variety of systematic effects associated with very long baseline interferometry and are supplemented by a wide variety of auxiliary data on the primary EHT targets from decades of other observations. Second, models of the emission regions and their interaction with the black hole are complex, highly uncertain, and computationally expensive to construct. As a result, the scientific utilization of EHT observations requires a flexible, extensible, and powerful analysis framework. We present such a framework,Themis, which defines a set of interfaces between models, data, and sampling algorithms that facilitates future development. We describe the design and currently existing components ofThemis, howThemishas been validated thus far, and present additional analyses made possible byThemisthat illustrate its capabilities. Importantly, we demonstrate thatThemisis able to reproduce prior EHT analyses, extend these, and do so in a computationally efficient manner that can efficiently exploit modern high-performance computing facilities.Themishas already been used extensively in the scientific analysis and interpretation of the first EHT observations of M87.

Persistent Starspot Signals on M Dwarfs: Multiwavelength Doppler Observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and Keck/HIRES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						M dwarf stars; Radial velocity; Stellar photometry; High resolution spectroscopy; Exoplanets; Starspots; Time series analysis; Gaussian Processes regression	LOW MASS STARS; STELLAR ROTATION; EXOPLANET-SURVEY; AD LEONIS; PHOTOMETRY; PRECISION; FREQUENCY; FLARES; FIELD	Young, rapidly rotating M dwarfs exhibit prominent starspots, which create quasiperiodic signals in their photometric and Doppler spectroscopic measurements. The periodic Doppler signals can mimic radial velocity (RV) changes expected from orbiting exoplanets. Exoplanets can be distinguished from activity-induced false positives by the chromaticity and long-term incoherence of starspot signals, but these qualities are poorly constrained for fully convective M stars. Coherent photometric starspot signals on M dwarfs may persist for hundreds of rotations, and the wavelength dependence of starspot RV signals may not be consistent between stars due to differences in their magnetic fields and active regions. We obtained precise multiwavelength RVs of four rapidly rotating M dwarfs (AD Leo, G227-22, GJ 1245B, GJ 3959) using the near-infrared (NIR) Habitable-zone Planet Finder and the optical Keck/HIRES spectrometer. Our RVs are complemented by photometry from Kepler, TESS, and the Las Cumbres Observatory network of telescopes. We found that all four stars exhibit large spot-induced Doppler signals at their rotation periods, and investigated the longevity and optical-to-NIR chromaticity for these signals. The phase curves remain coherent much longer than is typical for Sunlike stars. Their chromaticity varies, and one star (GJ 3959) exhibits optical and NIR RV modulation consistent in both phase and amplitude. In general, though, we find that the NIR amplitudes are lower than their optical counterparts. We conclude that starspot modulation for rapidly rotating M stars frequently remains coherent for hundreds of stellar rotations and gives rise to Doppler signals that, due to this coherence, may be mistaken for exoplanets.

These surveys will detect a large number of galaxies that will have only one emission line in the covered spectral range. In order to maximize the scientific return of these missions, it is imperative that single emission lines are correctly identified. Using a supervised machine-learning approach, we classified a sample of single emission lines extracted from the WFC3 IR Spectroscopic Parallel survey, one of the closest existing analogs to future slitless surveys. Our automatic software integrates a spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting strategy with additional independent sources of information. We calibrated it and tested it on a "gold" sample of securely identified objects with multiple lines detected. The algorithm correctly classifies real emission lines with an accuracy of 82.6%, whereas the accuracy of the SED-fitting technique alone is low (similar to 50%) due to the limited amount of photometric data available (<= 6 bands). While not specifically designed for the Euclid and WFIRST surveys, the algorithm represents an important precursor of similar algorithms to be used in these future missions.

IV. The Birth of Radio-loud Quasar 013815+00	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Active galactic nuclei; Radio active galactic nuclei	COMPACT STEEP-SPECTRUM; AGN; GALAXIES	It is believed that the gas accretion onto supermassive black holes is the main process of powering this quasar's luminous emission, which occurs in optical, UV, and X-ray regimes and less frequently in radio waves. The observational fact that only a few percent of quasars are radio-loud is still an unresolved issue concerning the understanding of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) population. Here we present a detection of a rapid transition from the radio-quiet to the radio-loud mode in quasar 013815+00 (z = 0.94) which coincides with changes of its UV-optical continuum and the low ionization Mgiibroadline. We interpret this as an enhancement of accretion onto a central black hole of about 10(9)solar masses. As a consequence a new radio-loud AGN was born. Its spectral and morphological properties indicate that it went through the short gigahertz-peaked spectrum phase at the beginning of its activity and has now stabilized its flux density at the level of a few millijansky. The radio morphology of 013815+00 is very compact and we predict that with such short-term jet activity its development will be very slow. The observed luminosity changes of the accretion disk are shorter than the lifetime of the new radio phase in 013815+00.

However, the extent of material exchange between these reservoirs, and how this affected the composition of the inner disk, are not known. Here we show that NC meteorites display broadly correlated isotopic variations for Mo, Ti, Cr, and Ni, indicating the addition of isotopically distinct material to the inner disk. The added material resembles bulk CC meteorites and Ca-Al-rich inclusions in terms of its enrichment in neutron-rich isotopes, but unlike the latter materials is also enriched ins-process nuclides. The comparison of the isotopic composition of NC meteorites with the accretion ages of their parent bodies reveals that the isotopic variations within the inner disk do not reflect a continuous compositional change through the addition of CC dust, indicating an efficient separation of the NC and CC reservoirs and limited exchange of material between the inner and outer disk. Instead, the isotopic variations among NC meteorites more likely record a rapidly changing composition of the disk during infall from the Sun's parental molecular cloud, where each planetesimal locks the instant composition of the disk when it forms. A corollary of this model is that late-formed planetesimals in the inner disk predominantly accreted from secondary dust that was produced by collisions among pre-existing NC planetesimals.

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics.

Lipid Biomarker Record of the Serpentinite-Hosted Ecosystem of the Samail Ophiolite, Oman and Implications for the Search for Biosignatures on Mars	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Lipid biomarkers-Ophiolite-Serpentinization; Biosignatures-Mars	HYPERALKALINE PERIDOTITE AQUIFERS; MODERN WATER/ROCK REACTIONS; LOW-TEMPERATURE ALTERATION; CITY HYDROTHERMAL FIELD; FATTY-ACIDS; EARLY DIAGENESIS; TETRAETHER LIPIDS; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIA; ALIPHATIC-HYDROCARBONS	Serpentinization is a weathering process in which ultramafic rocks react with water, generating a range of products, including serpentine and other minerals, in addition to H(2)and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons that are capable of sustaining microbial life. Lipid biomarker analyses of serpentinite-hosted ecosystems hold promise as tools for investigating microbial activity in ancient Earth environments and other terrestrial planets such as Mars because lipids have the potential for longer term preservation relative to DNA, proteins, and other more labile organic molecules. Here, we report the first lipid biomarker record of microbial activity in the mantle section of the Samail Ophiolite, in the Sultanate of Oman, a site undergoing active serpentinization. We detected isoprenoidal (archaeal) and branched (bacterial) glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids, including those with 0-3 cyclopentane moieties, and crenarchaeol, an isoprenoidal GDGT containing four cyclopentane and one cyclohexane moieties, as well as monoether lipids and fatty acids indicative of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Comparison of our geochemical data and 16S rRNA data from the Samail Ophiolite with those from other serpentinite-hosted sites identifies the existence of a common core serpentinization microbiome. In light of these findings, we also discuss the preservation potential of serpentinite lipid biomarker assemblages on Earth and Mars. Continuing investigations of the Samail Ophiolite and other terrestrial analogues will enhance our understanding of microbial habitability and diversity in serpentinite-hosted environments on Earth and elsewhere in the Solar System.

The mutually complementary Euclid and Roman galaxy redshift surveys will use H alpha- and [Oiii]-selected emission-line galaxies (ELGs) as tracers of the large-scale structure at 0.9 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 1.9 (H alpha) and 1.5 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 2.7 ([Oiii]). It is essential to have a reliable and sufficiently precise knowledge of the expected numbers of H alpha-emitting galaxies in the survey volume in order to optimize these redshift surveys for the study of dark energy. Additionally, these future samples of ELGs will, like all slitless spectroscopy surveys, be affected by a complex selection function that depends on galaxy size and luminosity, line equivalent width (EW), and redshift errors arising from the misidentification of single ELGs. Focusing on the specifics of the Euclid survey, we combine two slitless spectroscopic WFC3-IR data sets-3D-HST+AGHAST and the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey-to construct a Euclid-like sample that covers an area of 0.56 deg(2)and includes 1277 ELGs. We detect 1091 (similar to 3270 deg(-2)) H alpha+[Nii]-emitting galaxies in the range 0.9 <= z <= 1.6 and 162 (similar to 440 deg(-2)) [Oiii] lambda 5007 emitters over 1.5 <= z <= 2.3 with line fluxes >= 2 x 10(-16)erg s(-1)cm(-2). The median of the H alpha+[Nii] EW distribution is similar to 250 A, and the effective radii of the continuum and H alpha+[Nii] emission are correlated with a median of similar to 038 and significant scatter (sigma similar to 02-035). Finally, we explore the prevalence of redshift misidentification in future Euclid samples, finding potential contamination rates of similar to 14%-20% and similar to 6% down to 2 x 10(-16)erg s(-1)cm(-2)and 6 x 10(-17)erg s(-1)cm(-2), respectively, although with increased wavelength coverage these percentages drop to nearly zero.

Patterns of population displacement during mega-fires in California detected using Facebook Disaster Maps	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Facebook disaster maps; crowdsourced data; social media; Mann-Kendall trend; anomaly analysis; wildfires; California	SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER; MANAGEMENT; HAZARDS	The Facebook Disaster Maps (FBDM) work presented here is the first time this platform has been used to provide analysis-ready population change products derived from crowdsourced data targeting disaster relief practices. We evaluate the representativeness of FBDM data using the Mann-Kendall test and emerging hot and cold spots in an anomaly analysis to reveal the trend, magnitude, and agglommeration of population displacement during the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires in California, USA. Our results show that the distribution of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total population from different sources. Due to usage habits, the elder population is underrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California, FBDM data effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the placing and lifting of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the fall and rise of cold and hot spots of population revealed the areas with the greatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced residents. A comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a densely populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one, possibly due to better access to transportation. In sparsely populated fire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized to move people to shelters as the displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while their counterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to seek temporary stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with an assessment on underrepresented communities, FBDM data and the derivatives can provide much needed information of near real-time population displacement for crisis response and disaster relief. As applications and data generation mature, FBDM will harness crowdsourced data and aid first responder decision-making.

Hsp70 plays a major role in many Hsp90 functions by interacting and modulating conformation of its substrates before being transferred to Hsp90s for final maturation. Each eukaryote contains multiple members of the Hsp70 family. However, the role of different Hsp70 isoforms in Hsp90 chaperoning actions remains unknown. Using v-Src as an Hsp90 substrate, we examined the role of each of the four yeast cytosolic Ssa Hsp70s in regulating Hsp90 functions. We show that the strain expressing stress-inducible or, and the not constitutively expressed or, as the sole Ssa Hsp70 isoform reduces v-Src-mediated growth defects. The study shows that although different Hsp70 isoforms interact similarly with Hsp90s, v-Src maturation is less efficient in strains expressing as the sole Hsp70. We further show that the functional distinction between and is regulated by its C-terminal domain. Further studies reveal that, which is known to assist substrate transfer to Hsp70s, interacts relatively weakly with compared with, which could be the basis for poor maturation of the Hsp90 client in cells expressing stress-inducible as the sole Ssa Hsp70. The study thus reveals a novel role of in determining the functional distinction among Hsp70 isoforms with respect to the Hsp90 chaperoning action.

While tectonic plate motions provide evidence for this relation, the mechanism by which mantle processes influence near-surface tectonics remains elusive. Here, we present an azimuthal anisotropy model for the Pacific Northwest crust that strongly correlates with high-velocity structures in the underlying mantle but shows no association with the regional mantle flow field. We suggest that the crustal anisotropy is decoupled from horizontal basal tractions and, instead, created by upper mantle vertical loading, which generates pressure gradients that drive channelized flow in the mid-lower crust. We then demonstrate the interplay between mantle heterogeneities and lithosphere dynamics by predicting the viscous crustal flow that is driven by local buoyancy sources within the upper mantle. Our findings reveal how mantle vertical load distribution can actively control crustal deformation on a scale of several hundred kilometers.

The predictable chaos of slow earthquakes	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; DIMENSION; SLIP; MODEL; CALIFORNIA; FRICTION; SEQUENCE; SYSTEM; FAULT	Slow earthquakes, like regular earthquakes, result from unstable frictional slip. They produce little slip and can therefore repeat frequently. We assess their predictability using the slip history of the Cascadia subduction between 2007 and 2017, during which slow earthquakes have repeatedly ruptured multiple segments. We characterize the system dynamics using embedding theory and extreme value theory. The analysis reveals a low-dimensional (<5) nonlinear chaotic system rather than a stochastic system. We calculate properties of the underlying attractor like its correlation and instantaneous dimension, instantaneous persistence, and metric entropy. We infer that the system has a predictability horizon of the order of days weeks. For the better resolved segments, the onset of large slip events can be correctly forecasted by high values of the instantaneous dimension. Longer-term deterministic prediction seems intrinsically impossible. Regular earthquakes might similarly be predictable but with a limited predictable horizon of the order of their durations.

The main hallmarks of X-ray reflection include fluorescent K-shell emission lines from iron (similar to 6.4-6.9 keV), the absorption iron K-edge (similar to 7-9 keV), and a broad featureless component known as the Compton hump (similar to 20-40 keV). This Compton hump is produced as the result of the scattering of high-energy photons (E greater than or similar to 10 keV) of the relatively colder electrons (T-e similar to 10(5)-10(7)K) in the accretion disk, in combination with photoelectric absorption from iron. The treatment of this process in most current models of ionized X-ray reflection has been done using an approximated Gaussian redistribution kernel. This approach works sufficiently well up to similar to 100 keV, but it becomes largely inaccurate at higher energies and at relativistic temperatures (T-e similar to 10(9)K). We present new calculations of X-ray reflection using a modified version of our codexillver, including an accurate solution for Compton scattering of the reflected unpolarized photons in the disk atmosphere. This solution takes into account quantum electrodynamic and relativistic effects allowing the correct treatment of high photon energies and electron temperatures. We show new reflection spectra computed with this model, and discuss the improvements achieved in reproducing the correct shape of the Compton hump, the discrepancies with previous calculations, and the expected impact of these new models in the interpretation of observational data.

We quantify a measure of how much confidence we should have for each candidate galaxy from different selections and what the conservative error estimates propagated into our selection are. Then we compare the evolution of the corresponding number densities and their stellar mass density with numerical simulations, semianalytical models, and previous observational estimates, which shows slight tension at higher redshifts as the models tend to underestimate the number and mass densities. By estimating the average halo masses of the candidates (M-h 4.2, 1.9, and 1.3 x 10(12)Mfor redshift bins centered atz = 3.4, 4.1, and 4.7), we find them to be consistent with halos that were efficient in turning baryons to stars, relatively immune to the feedback effects, and on the verge of transition into hot-mode accretion. This can suggest the relative cosmological starvation of the cold gas followed by an overconsumption phase in which the galaxy rapidly consumes the available cold gas as one of the possible drivers for the quenching of the massive evolved population at high redshift.

Structure and morphology of low mechanical loss TiO2-doped Ta2O5	OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS			English	Article							AMORPHOUS TANTALUM OXIDE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; THERMAL-EXPANSION; ION; FILMS; COATINGS; NOISE	The exceptional stability required from high finesse optical cavities and high precision interferometers is fundamentally limited by Brownian motion noise in the interference coatings of the cavity mirrors. In amorphous oxide coatings these thermally driven fluctuations are dominant in the high index layer compared to those in the low index SiO2 layer in the stack. We present a systematic study of the evolution of the structural and optical properties of ion beam sputtered TiO2-doped Ta2O5 films with annealing temperature. We show that low mechanical loss in TiO2-doped Ta2O5 with a Ti cation ratio = 0.27 is associated with a material that consists of a homogeneous titanium-tantalum-oxygen mixture containing a low density of nanometer sized Ar-filled voids. When the Ti cation ratio is 0.53, phase separation occurs leading to increased mechanical loss. These results suggest that amorphous mixed oxides with low mechanical loss could be identified by considering the thermodynamics of ternary phase formation.

A light-regulated protein degradation system was used to assay temporal dependence of the transcription factor Dorsal in dorsal-ventral axis patterning of Drosophila embryos. Surprisingly, the high-threshold target gene snail only requires Dorsal input early but not late when Dorsal levels peak. Instead, late snail expression can be supported by action of the Twist transcription factor, specifically, through one enhancer, sna.distal. This study demonstrates that continuous input is not required for some Dorsal targets and downstream responses, such as twist, function as molecular ratchets.

For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture theauthoritarian-conservatism motivationand thedominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N-1= 3,132;N-2= 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world.

Our submilliarcsecond-resolution CHARA Array observations are supplemented with shorter baseline, archival data from PTI, KI, and VLTI/GRAVITY and modeled using an axisymmetric Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. TheK-band visibilities are well fit by models incorporating a central star illuminating a disk with an inner edge shaped by dust sublimation at 0.210 0.005 au, assuming a viewing geometry adopted from millimeter interferometry (65 degrees inclined with a disk major axis position angle of 23 degrees). This sublimation radius is consistent with that expected of silicate grains with a maximum size of 0.36-0.40 mu m contributing to the opacity, and is an order of magnitude further from the star than the theoretical magnetospheric truncation radius. The visibilities on the longest baselines probed by CHARA indicate that we lack a clear line of sight to the stellar photosphere. Instead, our analysis shows that the central star is occulted by the disk surface layers close to the sublimation rim. While we do not see direct evidence of temporal variability in our multiepoch CHARA observations, we suggest the aperiodic photometric variability of RY Tau is likely related temporal and/or azimuthal variations in the structure of the disk surface layers.

DES Collaboration	Supernova host galaxies in the dark energy survey: I. Deep coadds, photometry, and stellar masses	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: image processing; catalogues; supernovae: general	IA SUPERNOVAE; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; DATA RELEASE; SPECTROSCOPY; CLUSTERS; PEGASE; STARS	The 5-yr Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme (DES-SN) is one of the largest and deepest transient surveys to date in terms of volume and number of supernovae. Identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their classification, the study of their formation mechanisms, and the cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy properties, we create depth-optimized coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other four seasons such that each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order similar to 27 in g band, and have a much smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates, particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting multiband photometry of host galaxies for samples of spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe Ia), core-collapse (CCSNe), and superluminous (SLSNe) as well as rapidly evolving transients (RETs) discovered by DES-SN. We derive host galaxy stellar masses and probabilistically compare stellar-mass distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the DES spectroscopically confirmed sample of SNe Ia selects preferentially fewer high-mass hosts at high-redshift compared to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts are similar to other samples, while RET hosts are unlike the hosts of any other transients, although these differences have not been disentangled from selection effects.

We model the variability of each light curve as due to a combination of two relativistic effects: the orbital relativistic Doppler boost and gravitational binary self-lensing. In order to model each system, we extend previous Doppler plus self-lensing models to include eccentricity. The first quasar is identified in optical data as a binary candidate with a 20-yr period (Ark 120), and shows a prominent spike. For this source, we rule out the lensing hypothesis and disfavour the Doppler-boost hypothesis due to discrepancies in the measured versus recovered values of the binary mass and optical spectral slope. The second source, which we nickname Spikey, is the rare case of an active galactic nucleus identified in Kepler's high-quality, high-cadence photometric data. For this source, we find a model, consisting of a combination of Doppler modulation and a narrow symmetric lensing spike, consistent with an eccentric SMBHB with a mass of M-tot = 3 x 10(7) M-circle dot, rest-frame orbital period T = 418 d, eccentricity e = 0.5, and seen at an inclination of 8 degrees from edge-on. This interpretation can be tested by monitoring Spikey for periodic behaviour and recurring flares in the next few years. In preparation for such monitoring, we present the first X-ray observations of this object taken by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.

ALMA reveals the coherence of the magnetic field geometry in OH 231.8+4.2	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						magnetic fields; polarization; stars: AGB and post-AGB; ISM: individual objects: OH231.8+4.2; ISM: jets and outflows	RADIATIVE TORQUES; NEBULA; ALIGNMENT; POLARIZATION; DUST	In a continuing effort to investigate the role of magnetic fields in evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars (principally regarding the shaping of their envelopes), we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high-resolution polarization data obtained for the nebula OH 231.8+4.2. We found that the polarized emission likely arises from aligned grains in the presence of magnetic fields rather than radiative alignment and self-scattering. The ALMA data show well organized electric field orientations in most of the nebula and the inferred magnetic field vectors (rotated by 90 degrees) trace an hourglass morphology centred on the central system of the nebula. One region in the southern part of OH 231.8+4.2 shows a less organized distribution probably due to the shocked environment. These findings, in conjunction with earlier investigations (maser studies and dust emission analysis at other scales and wavelengths) suggest an overall magnetic hourglass located inside a toroidal field. We propose the idea that the magnetic field structure is closely related to the architecture of a magnetic tower and that the outflows were therefore magnetically launched. While the current dynamical effect of the fields might be weak in the equatorial plane principally due to the evolution of the envelope, it would still be affecting the outflows. In that regard, the measurement of the magnetic field at the stellar surface, which is still missing, combined with a full magnetohydrodynamic treatment are required to better understand and constrain the events occurring in OH 231.8+4.2.

J	Grudic, MY; Hopkins, PF				Grudic, Michael Y.; Hopkins, Philip F.			A general-purpose time-step criterion for simulations with gravity	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitation; hydrodynamics; methods: numerical	ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT; CODE; HYDRODYNAMICS; GALAXIES; FEEDBACK	We describe a new adaptive time-step criterion for integrating gravitational motion, which uses the tidal tensor to estimate the local dynamical time-scale and scales the time-step proportionally. This provides a better candidate for a truly general-purpose gravitational time-step criterion than the usual prescription derived from the gravitational acceleration, which does not respect the equivalence principle, breaks down when a = 0, and does not obey the same dimensional scaling as the true time-scale of orbital motion. We implement the tidal time-step criterion in the simulation code Gizmo, and examine controlled tests of collisionless galaxy and star cluster models, as well as galaxy merger simulations. The tidal criterion estimates the dynamical time faithfully, and generally provides a more efficient time-stepping scheme compared to an acceleration criterion. Specifically, the tidal criterion achieves order-of-magnitude smaller energy errors for the same number of force evaluations in potentials with inner profiles shallower than rho proportional to r(-1) (i.e. where a -> 0), such as star clusters and cored galaxies. For a given problem these advantages must be weighed against the additional overhead of computing the tidal tensor on-the-fly, but in many cases this overhead is small.

Dynamic scheduling: target of opportunity observations of gravitational wave events	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational waves; telescopes; methods: observational	IDENTIFICATION; KILONOVA	The simultaneous detection of electromagnetic and gravitational waves from the coalescence of two neutron stars (GW170817 and GRB170817A) has ushered in a new era of 'multimessenger' astronomy, with electromagnetic detections spanning from gamma to radio. This great opportunity for new scientific investigations raises the issue of how the available multimessenger tools can hest he integrated to constitute a powerful method to study the transient Universe in particular. To facilitate the classification of possible optical counterparts to gravitational wave events, it is important to optimize the scheduling of observations and the filtering of transients, both key elements of the follow-up process, In this work, we describe the existing workflow whereby telescope networks such as GRANDMA and GROWTH are currently scheduled; we then present modifications we have developed for the scheduling process specifically, so as to face the relevant challenges that have appeared during the latest. observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, We address issues with scheduling more than one epoch for multiple fields within a skymap, especially for large and disjointed localizations. This is done in two ways: by optimizing the maximum number of fields that can be scheduled and by splitting up the lobes within the skymap by right ascension to be scheduled individually. In addition, we implement the ability to take previously observed fields into consideration when rescheduling. We show the improvements that these modifications produce in making the search for optical counterparts more efficient, and we point to areas needing further improvement.

Assuming a plausible discovery strategy, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) will discover similar to 110 and similar to 1 systems per year before the supernova (SN) explosion in the final image, respectively. Systems will be identified 11.7(-9.3)(+29.8) d before the final explosion. We then explore the possibility of performing early-time observations for Type HP and Type Ia SNe in LSST-discovered systems. Using a simulated Type HP explosion, we predict that the shock breakout in one trailing image per year will peak at less than or similar to 24.1 mag (less than or similar to 23.3) in the B-band (F218 W), however evolving over a time-scale of similar to 30 min. Using an analytic model of Type Ia companion interaction, we find that in the B-band we should observe at least one shock cooling emission event per year that peaks at less than or similar to 26.3 mag (less than or similar to 29.6) assuming all Type Ia gLSNe have a 1 M-circle dot red giant (main sequence) companion. We perform Bayesian analysis to investigate how well deep observations with 1 h exposures on the European Extremely Large Telescope would discriminate between Type Ia progenitor populations. We find that if all Type Ia SNe evolved from the double-degenerate channel, then observations of the lack of early blue flux in 10 (50) trailing images would rule out more than 27 per cent (19 per cent) of the population having 1 M-circle dot main sequence companions at 95 per cent confidence.

Galaxy line and continuum spectral indices and dust attenuation curves	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; galaxies: high redshift; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; ultraviolet: galaxies	LYMAN-BREAK GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION RATE; ULTRA-DEEP FIELD; STARBURST INTENSITY LIMIT; 1ST BILLION YEARS; H-ALPHA EMITTERS; SIMILAR-TO 2; PLUS O III; STELLAR MASS; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION	We present predictions for high redshift (z = 2-10) galaxy populations based on the BlustrisTNG simulation suite and a full Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer post-processing. Specifically, we discuss the H alpha and H beta [O III] luminosity functions up to z = 8. The predicted H beta + [O III] luminosity functions are consistent with present observations at z less than or similar to 3 with less than or similar to 0.1 dex differences in luminosities. However, the predicted H alpha luminosity function is similar to 0.3 dex dimmer than the observed one at z similar or equal to 2. Furthermore, we explore continuum spectral indices, the Balmer break at 4000 angstrom; (D4000) and the UV continuum slope beta. The median D4000 versus specific star formation rate relation predicted at z = 2 is in agreement with the local calibration despite a different distribution pattern of galaxies in this plane. In addition, we reproduce the observed A(UV) versus beta relation and explore its dependence on galaxy stellar mass, providing an explanation for the observed complexity of this relation. We also find a deficiency in heavily attenuated, UV red galaxies in the simulations. Finally, we provide predictions for the dust attenuation curves of galaxies at z = 2-6 and investigate their dependence on galaxy colours and stellar masses. The attenuation curves arc steeper in galaxies at higher redshifts, with bluer colours, or with lower stellar masses. We attribute these predicted trends to dust geometry. Overall, our results are consistent with present observations of high-redshift galaxies. Future James Webb Space Telecope observations will further test these predictions.

J	O'Connor, B; Beniamini, P; Kouveliotou, C				O'Connor, Brendan; Beniamini, Paz; Kouveliotou, Chryssa			Constraints on the circumburst environments of short gamma-ray bursts	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: jet; gamma-ray bursts; neutron star mergers	HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; X-RAY; LIGHT CURVES; HOST GALAXIES; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; AFTERGLOW EMISSION; TIME DISTRIBUTION; STAR-FORMATION; DARK-MATTER; SHORT GRBS	Observational follow up of well localized short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) has left 20-30 per cent of the population without a coincident host galaxy association to deep optical and NIR limits (greater than or similar to 26 mag). These SGRBs have been classified as observationally hostless due to their lack of strong host associations. It has been argued that these hostless SGRBs could be an indication of the large distances traversed by the binary neutron star system (due to natal kicks) between its formation and its merger (leading to an SGRB). The distances of GRBs from their host galaxies can be indirectly probed by the surrounding circumburst densities. We show that a lower limit on those densities can be obtained from early afterglow light curves. We find that less than or similar to 16 per cent of short GRBs in our sample took place at densities less than or similar to 10(-4) cm(-3). These densities represent the expected range of values at distances greater than the host galaxy's virial radii. We find that out of the five SGRBs in our sample that have been found to be observationally hostless, none are consistent with having occurred beyond the virial radius of their birth galaxies. This implies one of two scenarios. Either these observationally hostless SGRBs occurred outside of the half-light radius of their host galaxy, but well within the galactic halo, or in host galaxies at moderate to high redshifts (z greater than or similar to 2) that were missed by follow-up observations.

DES Collaboration	Studying Type II supernovae as cosmological standard candles using the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						(stars:) supernovae: general; galaxies: distances and redshifts; (cosmology:) distance scale	PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; K-CORRECTIONS; IA SUPERNOVA; P SUPERNOVAE; HUBBLE DIAGRAM; LIGHT CURVES; MASSIVE STARS; LEGACY SURVEY; REDSHIFT; LAMBDA	Despite vast improvements in the measurement of the cosmological parameters, the nature of dark energy and an accurate value of the Hubble constant (H-0) in the Hubble-Lemaitre law remain unknown. To break the current impasse, it is necessary to develop as many independent techniques as possible, such as the use of Type II supernovae (SNe II). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of SNe II for deriving accurate extragalactic distances, which will be an asset for the next generation of telescopes where more-distant SNe II will be discovered. More specifically, we present a sample from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisting of 15 SNe II with photometric and spectroscopic information spanning a redshift range up to 0.35. Combining our DES SNe with publicly available samples, and using the standard candle method (SCM), we construct the largest available Hubble diagram with SNe II in the Hubble flow (70 SNe II) and find an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag. We demonstrate that adding a colour term to the SN II standardization does not reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram. Although SNe II are viable as distance indicators, this work points out important issues for improving their utility as independent extragalactic beacons: find new correlations, define a more standard subclass of SNe II, construct new SN II templates, and dedicate more observing time to high-redshift SNe II. Finally, for the first time, we perform simulations to estimate the redshift-dependent distance-modulus bias due to selection effects.	[de Jaeger, T.; Filippenko, A.

Resolving the Status of the Lithium-rich M Dwarfs HHJ 339 and HHJ 430	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Moving clusters; Star clusters; Open star clusters	T-TAURI STARS; DEPLETION BOUNDARY AGE; CLUSTER; ABUNDANCES; NEARBY; MYR	Oppenheimer et al. discovered two M5 dwarfs in the Pleiades with nearly primordial lithium. These stars are not low enough in mass to represent the leading edge of the lithium depletion boundary at Pleiades age (similar to 125 Myr). A possible explanation for the enhanced lithium in these stars is that they are actually not members of the Pleiades but instead are members of a younger moving group seen in projection toward the Pleiades. We have used data from Gaia DR2 to confirm that these two stars, HHJ 339 and HHJ 430, are indeed not members of the Pleiades. Based on their space motions, parallaxes, and positions in a Gaia-based color-magnitude diagram, it is probable that these two stars are about 40 parsecs foreground to the Pleiades and have ages of similar to 25 Myr. Kinematically they are best matched to the 32 Ori moving group.

We used Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to precisely track the radio emission over seven epochs in 2010-2017, and found both components to be radio emitters-the first such system identified-with the secondary component as the dominant source of emission in all epochs. The previously identified 2.07 hr periodic bursts were confirmed to originate from the secondary component, although an isolated burst was also identified from the primary component. We additionally fitted the VLBI absolute astrometric positions jointly with existing relative orbital astrometry derived from optical/infrared observations with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to determine the orbital parameters of the two components. We found the masses of the primary and secondary optical components to be 0.0795 0.0003 M, and 0.0756 0.0003 M, respectively, representing the most precise mass estimates of any UCDs to date. Finally, we place a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.9 M(jup)au on the mass and separation of planets orbiting either of the two components.

J	Milliner, C; Donnellan, A				Milliner, Chris; Donnellan, Andrea			Using Daily Observations from Planet Labs Satellite Imagery to Separate the Surface Deformation between the 4 July M-w 6.4 Foreshock and 5 July M-w 7.1 Mainshock during the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article								On 4 July 2019, the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence began with a series of foreshocks including an M-w 6.4 event near Searles Valley, California. This was then followed 34 hr later by an M-w 7.1 mainshock located just 15 km to the north, with the earthquake sequence resulting in a complex array of intersecting faults. This earthquake sequence poses several interesting questions including, did the stress changes induced by the M-w 6.4 foreshock trigger the M-w 7.1 mainshock and what possible mechanism(s) could explain the occurrence of widespread secondary faulting surrounding both surface ruptures? However, most of the geodetic data (such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, light detection and ranging, and optical satellite imagery) were acquired after both events had occurred making it difficult to discern which surface fractures happened when and their possible triggering mechanism. Here, we provide a dataset composed of high-resolution optical imagery, pixel-value difference maps, .kmz fracturing mapping, and horizontal deformation maps derived from subpixel image correlation, which can uniquely separate the surface fracturing and deformation between the foreshock and mainshock events that can help answer these questions. Separate imaging of the events is made possible by the daily acquisition of optical imagery by the Planet Labs cubesat constellation, which acquired data between the two earthquakes, in the morning of 4 and 5 July, at 11.13 a.m. and 05.12 p.m. PST, respectively, with the images acquired just 40 min after the foreshock and 56 min before the mainshock, respectively. Analysis from this optical imagery reveals the location of surface faulting that allows us to map their spatial extent and determine their timing. These data which we provide here can help guide and validate field survey observations to help understand which faults ruptured when, and constrain slip inversion models for more accurate estimates of stress changes induced by the foreshock imposed on the surrounding faults.

We integrated geodetic measurements for the 3D vector field of coseismic surface deformation for the two events, using SAR data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites. We combined less precise large-scale displacements from SAR images by pixel offset tracking or matching, including the along-track component, with the more precise SAR interferometry (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar [InSAR]) measurements in the radar line of sight (LoS) direction and intermediate-precision along-track InSAR to estimate all three components of the surface displacement for the two events together. We also estimated the coseismic deformation for the two earthquakes from time-series processing of continuous Global Navigation Satellite System data stations in the area. InSAR coherence and coherence change maps the surface disruptions due to fault ruptures reaching the surface. Large slip in the M-w 6.4 earthquake was on a NE-striking fault that intersects with the NW-striking fault that was the main rupture in the M-w 7.1 earthquake. The main fault bifurcates towards the southeast ending 3 km from the Garlock Fault. The Garlock fault had triggered slip of about 20 mm in the radar LoS along a short section directly south of the main rupture. About 3 km northwest of the M-w 7.1 epicenter, the surface fault separates into two strands that form a pull-apart with about 1 m of downdrop. Further northwest is a wide zone of complex deformation.

Cascading Partial Rupture of the Flores Thrust during the 2018 Lombok Earthquake Sequence, Indonesia	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							7.8 GORKHA EARTHQUAKE; EASTERN SUNDA ARC; STRESS CHANGES; MAGMA PATHWAY; ERUPTIONS; GRAVITY; VOLCANO; RADAR; DEFORMATION; STRAIN	A series of four M w 6 earthquakes struck the northern region of Lombok, eastern Indonesia, in a span of three weeks from late July to mid -August 2018. The series was thought to be associated with the Flores thrust, but the exact mechanism causing the unusual earthquake series has remained elusive. Our Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar analysis, combined with insights from seismology, indicates that the events originated at different hypocenter depths with differing fault geometries, which may explain the cascading behavior of the events, and indicates that better imaging of active fault geometry might provide some insight into future rupture behavior on other similar thrust systems. Our static stress change calculations suggest that the earlier events in the sequence played a role in promoting the later events. In addition, the second event brought the most significant impact on a nearby volcano, by causing volumetric expan- sion at its shallow magma plumbing system and unclamping its magma ascent zone, which may potentially have an impact on its future eruptive activity. However, no volcanic activity has so far occurred after the earthquakes. Finally, our damage proxy maps suggest that the second event caused the greatest damage to buildings.

J	Millholland, S; Petigura, E; Batygin, K				Millholland, Sarah; Petigura, Erik; Batygin, Konstantin			Tidal Inflation Reconciles Low-density Sub-Saturns with Core Accretion	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanets; Extrasolar gas giants; Exoplanet atmospheres; Exoplanet structure; Exoplanet tides	CLOSE-IN SATELLITES; LONG-TERM EVOLUTION; GIANT PLANETS; CHAOTIC OBLIQUITY; HOT JUPITERS; MASS-LOSS; SPIN; DISSIPATION; ORBIT; ECCENTRICITY	While the solar system contains no planets between the sizes of Uranus and Saturn, our current exoplanet census includes several dozen such planets with well-measured masses and radii. These sub-Saturns exhibit a diversity of bulk densities, ranging from similar to 0.1 to 3 g cm(-3). When modeled simply as hydrogen/helium envelopes atop rocky cores, this diversity in densities translates to a diversity in planetary envelope fractions,f(env) = M-env/M-p, ranging from similar to 10% to similar to 50%. Planets withf(env) 50% pose a challenge to traditional models of giant planet formation by core-nucleated accretion, which predict the onset of runaway gas accretion whenM(env) similar to M-core. Here, we show that many of these apparentf(env) 50% planets are less envelope-rich than they seem, after accounting for tidal heating. We present a new framework for modeling sub-Saturn interiors that incorporates envelope inflation due to tides, which are driven by the observed nonzero eccentricities, as well as potential obliquities. Consequently, when we apply our models to known sub-Saturns, we infer lowerf(env)than tides-free estimates. We present a case study of K2-19 b, a moderately eccentric sub-Saturn. Neglecting tides, K2-19 b appears to havef(env) 50%, poised precariously near the runaway threshold; by including tides, however, we findf(env) 10%, resolving the tension. Through a systematic analysis of 4-8R(circle plus)planets, we find that most (but not all) of the similarly envelope-rich planets have more modest envelopes off(env) 10%-20%. Thus, many sub-Saturns may be understood as sub-Neptunes that have undergone significant radius inflation, rather than a separate class of objects. Tidally induced radius inflation likely plays an important role in other size classes of planets including ultra-low-density Jupiter-size planets like WASP-107 b.

Characterization of the Nucleus, Morphology, and Activity of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov by Optical and Near-infrared GROWTH, Apache Point, IRTF, ZTF, and Keck Observations	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Comets; Minor planets	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES; ASTEROIDS; DUST; SCATTERING; TELESCOPE; COLOR; SIZE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; SPECTROSCOPY	We present visible and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of interstellar object (ISO) 2I/Borisov taken from 2019 September 10 to 2019 December 20 using the GROWTH, the Apache Point Observatory Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m, and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility 3.0 m combined with pre- and postdiscovery observations of 2I obtained by the Zwicky Transient Facility from 2019 March 17 to 2019 May 5. Comparison with imaging of distant solar system comets shows an object very similar to mildly active solar system comets with an outgassing rate of similar to 10(27)mol s(-1). The photometry, taken in filters spanning the visible and NIR range, shows a gradual brightening trend of similar to 0.03 mag day(-1)since 2019 September 10 UTC for a reddish object becoming neutral in the NIR. The light curve from recent and prediscovery data reveals a brightness trend suggesting the recent onset of significant H2O sublimation with the comet being active with super volatiles such as CO at heliocentric distances >6 au consistent with its extended morphology. Using the advanced capability to significantly reduce the scattered light from the coma enabled by high-resolution NIR images from Keck adaptive optics taken on 2019 October 4, we estimate a diameter for 2I's nucleus of less than or similar to 1.4 km. We use the size estimates of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov to roughly estimate the slope of the ISO size distribution, resulting in a slope of similar to 3.4 1.2, similar to solar system comets and bodies produced from collisional equilibrium.

Elemental Abundances in M31: Iron and Alpha Element Abundances in M31's Outer Halo*	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxies; Local Group; Andromeda Galaxy; Galaxy stellar halos; Stellar abundances	TRACING GALAXY FORMATION; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; RED GIANT STARS; CA II TRIPLET; STELLAR HALOES; MINOR-AXIS; METALLICITY; ISOCHRONES; SPACE; SUBSTRUCTURE	We present [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] abundances, derived using spectral synthesis techniques, for stars in M31's outer stellar halo. The 21 [Fe/H] measurements and 7 [alpha/Fe] measurements are drawn from fields ranging from 43 to 165 kpc in projected distance from M31. We combine our measurements with existing literature measurements, and compare the resulting sample of 23 stars with [Fe/H] and 9 stars with [alpha/Fe] measurements in M31's outer halo with [alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements, also derived from spectral synthesis, in M31's inner stellar halo (r < 26 kpc) and dSph galaxies. The stars in M31's outer halo have [alpha/Fe] patterns that are consistent with the largest of M31's dSph satellites (And I and And VII). These abundances provide tentative evidence that the [alpha/Fe] abundances of stars in M31's outer halo are more similar to the abundances of Milky Way halo stars than to the abundances of stars in M31's inner halo. We also compare the spectral synthesis-based [Fe/H] measurements of stars in M31's halo with previous photometric [Fe/H] estimates, as a function of projected distance from M31. The spectral synthesis-based [Fe/H] measurements are consistent with a large-scale metallicity gradient previously observed in M31's stellar halo to projected distances as large as 100 kpc.

Radio Observations of Two Intermittent Pulsars: PSRs J1832+0029 and J1841-0500	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radio pulsars; Pulsars; Pulsar timing method		We present long-term observations of two intermittent pulsars, PSRs J1832+0029 and J1841-0500, using the Parkes 64 m radio telescope. The radio emission for these pulsars switches off for year-long durations. Our new observations have enabled us to improve the determination of the on-off timescales and the spin-down rates during those emission states. In general our results agree with previous studies of these pulsars, but we now have significantly longer data spans. We have identified two unexpected signatures in the data. Weak emission was detected in a single observation of PSR J1832+0029 during an off emission state. For PSR J1841-0500, we identified a quasi-periodic fluctuation in the intensities of the detectable single pulses, with a modulation period between 21 and 36 pulse periods.	[Wang, S. Q.; Wang, J.

T.; Prince, Thomas A.; Naudet, Charles J.; Kocz, Jonathon; Horiuchi, Shinji			A Dual-band Radio Observation of FRB 121102 with the Deep Space Network and the Detection of Multiple Bursts	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Radio transient sources		The spectra of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are complex and time-variable, sometimes peaking within the observing band and showing a fractional emission bandwidth of about 10%-30%. These spectral features may provide insight into the emission mechanism of repeating FRBs, or they could possibly be explained by extrinsic propagation effects in the local environment. Broadband observations can better quantify this behavior and help to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects. We present results from a simultaneous 2.25 and 8.36 GHz observation of the repeating FRB 121102 using the 70 m Deep Space Network radio telescope, DSS-43. During the 5.7 hr continuous observing session, we detected six bursts from FRB 121102, which were visible in the 2.25 GHz frequency band. However, none of these bursts were detected in the 8.36 GHz band, despite the larger bandwidth and greater sensitivity in the higher-frequency band. This effect is not explainable by Galactic scintillation and, along with previous multi-band experiments, clearly demonstrates that apparent burst activity depends strongly on the radio frequency band that is being observed.

Opposite-Side Ambiguities in Radar Sounding Interferometry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Interferometry; Radar tracking; Airborne radar; Radar antennas; Clutter; Radar clutter; Clutter discrimination; interferometry; Polarimetric Airborne Radar Ice Sounder (POLARIS); radar; radar sounders; radar sounding	ANTARCTICA	We report the analysis of opposite-side ambiguities in single-pass radar sounding interferometry. Nadir pointing radar sounders suffer inherent cross track ambiguities that cannot be separated with the power image alone. Interferometry can be used to interpret these ambiguities when data are collected with multichannel receivers. However, opposite-side surface clutter, volume scattering, and cross track range misalignment create unique interferometric phase and correlation signatures. Such signatures are observed experimentally in data collected by the Polarimetric Airborne Radar Ice Sounder (POLARIS) P-band multichannel radar sounder. We derive analytic expressions to predict the observations and validate them with simulation. In addition, we observe and explain a correlation dropout feature that is due to volume scattering competing with surface clutter in the null of the cross track antenna pattern. The purpose of this article is to explain opposite-side ambiguity signatures in radar sounder interferometry and provide models and techniques for scientific interpretation of interferograms.

The new algorithms improve spectral convergence both at the poles of the spherical-polar grid and at future null infinity, as well as increase the temporal resolution of the code. The key to the success of these algorithms is a new set of high-accuracy tests, which we present here. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code and compare with the existing PITTNULL implementation.

Thus, these stars can serve as benchmarks for seismological studies of the interiors of massive stars. We conducted the search by performing a frequency analysis on the optical light curves of known O- and B-type stars with data from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope exoplanet survey. We identify 113 beta Cephei stars, of which 86 are new discoveries, which altogether represent a 70% increase in the number currently known. An additional 97 candidates are identified. Among our targets, we find five new eclipsing binaries and 22 stars with equal frequency spacings suggestive of rotational splitting of nonradial pulsation modes. Candidates for runaway stars among our targets and a number of interesting individual objects are discussed. Most of the known and newly discovered beta Cephei stars will be observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission, providing by far the most comprehensive observational data set of massive main-sequence pulsating stars of sufficient quality for detailed asteroseismic studies. Future analysis of these light curves has the potential to dramatically increase our understanding of the structure of stellar interiors and the physical processes taking place therein.

In fact, four of them were instead known members of a nearby globular cluster NGC 5053. The status of the remaining extra-tidal RR Lyrae is controversial depending on the adopted tidal radius of NGC 5024. We have also searched for additional extra-tidal RR Lyrae within an area of similar to 8 deg(2)covering both globular clusters. This includes other known RR Lyrae within the search area, as well as stars that fall within the expected range of magnitudes and colors for RR Lyrae (and yet outside the cutoff of two-thirds of the tidal radii of each globular cluster for something to be called extra-tidal) if they were extra-tidal RR Lyrae candidates for NGC 5024 or NGC 5053. Based on the the proper-motion information and their locations on the color-magnitude diagram, none of the known RR Lyrae belong to the extra-tidal RR Lyrae of either globular clusters. In the cases where the stars satisfied the magnitude and color ranges of RR Lyrae, analysis of time series data taken from the Zwicky Transient Facility do not reveal periodicities, suggesting that none of these stars are RR Lyrae. We conclude that there are no extra-tidal RR Lyrae associated with either NGC 5024 or NGC 5053 located within our search area.

In this paper, we design distributed feedback control algorithms where each bus can inject both active and reactive power into the grid to regulate the voltages. The control law on each bus is only based on local voltage measurements and communication to its physical neighbors. Moreover, the buses can perform their updates asynchronously without receiving information from their neighbors for periods of time. The algorithm enforces hard upper and lower limits on the active and reactive powers at every iteration. We prove that the algorithm converges to the optimal feasible voltage profile, assuming linear power flows. This provable convergence is maintained under bounded communication delays and asynchronous communications. We further numerically test the performance of the algorithm using the full nonlinear AC power flow model. Our simulations show the effectiveness of our algorithm on realistic networks with both static and fluctuating loads, even in the presence of communication delays.

Nearby, low-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxies, in particular, can offer detailed insight into the metal-dependent processes that may have occurred within galaxies in the early Universe. Here, we present VLT/MUSE observations of one such system, JKB 18, a blue diffuse dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of only 12 + log(O/H)=7.6 +/- 0.2 (similar to 0.08 Z(circle dot)). Using high spatial resolution integral-field spectroscopy of the entire system, we calculate chemical abundances for individual H?ii regions using the direct method and derive oxygen abundance maps using strong-line metallicity diagnostics. With large-scale dispersions in O/H, N/H, and N/O of similar to 0.5-0.6 dex and regions harbouring chemical abundances outside this 1 sigma distribution, we deem JKB 18 to be chemically inhomogeneous. We explore this finding in the context of other chemically inhomogeneous dwarf galaxies and conclude that neither the accretion of metal-poor gas, short mixing time-scales or self-enrichment from WolfRayet stars are accountable. Using a galaxy-scale, multiphase, hydrodynamical simulation of a low-mass dwarf galaxy, we find that chemical inhomogeneities of this level may be attributable to the removal of gas via supernovae and the specific timing of the observations with respect to star formation activity. This study not only draws attention to the fact that dwarf galaxies can be chemically inhomogeneous, but also that the methods used in the assessment of this characteristic can be subject to bias.

We identify 892 likely members, making this the largest UMi sample with line-of-sight velocity and metallicity measurements. Our Bayesian method detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance (in logarithmic Bayes factor, ln B similar to 33). The metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -2.05 +/- 0.03) population is kinematically colder (radial velocity dispersion of sigma(v) =4.9(-1.0)(+0.8)km s(-1)) and more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.29(-0.06)(+0.05)) and kinematically hotter population (sigma(v)=11.5(-0.8)(+0.9)km s(-1)). Furthermore, we apply the same analysis to an independent Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)/Hectochelle data set and confirm the existence of two chemodynamic populations in UMi. In both data sets, the metal-rich population is significantly flattened (epsilon = 0.75 +/- 0.03) and the metal-poor population is closer to spherical (epsilon=0.33(-0.09)(+0.12)). Despite the presence of two populations, we are able to robustly estimate the slope of the dynamical mass profile. We found hints for prolate rotation of order similar to 2 km s(-1) in the MMT data set, but further observations are required to verify this. The flattened metal-rich population invalidates assumptions built into simple dynamical mass estimators, so we computed new astrophysical dark matter annihilation (J) and decay profiles based on the rounder, hotter metal-poor population and inferred log(10)(J(0 degrees.5)/GeV(2)cm(-5))approximate to 19.1 for the Keck data set. Our results paint a more complex picture of the evolution of UMi than previously discussed.

The bolometric quasar luminosity function at z=0-7	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general; cosmology: observations; infrared: galaxies; ultraviolet: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; SOFT-X-RAY; SIMILAR-TO 6; HIGH-REDSHIFT QUASARS; LESS-THAN 5; FAINT-END; COOLING FLOWS; COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION	In this paper, we provide updated constraints on the bolometric quasar luminosity function (QLF) from z = 0 to z = 7. The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame IR, B band, UV, soft, and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows Hopkins et al. with an updated quasar SED model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fitting bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the old Hopkins model at high redshift. Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at z greater than or similar to 2. Due to the paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at z greater than or similar to 5 is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow faint-end slope at z greater than or similar to 5. Further multiband observations of the faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH mass density, and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at z less than or similar to 3. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH mass density, and SMBH mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.

Here, we present 4.5 arcmin observations with CBI 2 that confirm 31 GHz emission from rho Oph W, the PDR exposed to B-type star HD 147889, and highlight the absence of signal from Si, the brightest IR nebula in the complex. In order to quantify an association with dust-related emission mechanisms, we calculated correlations at different angular resolutions between the 31 GHz map and proxies for the column density of IR emitters, dust radiance, and optical depth templates. We found that the 31 GHz emission correlates best with the PAH column density tracers, while the correlation with the dust radiance improves when considering emission that is more extended (from the shorter baselines), suggesting that the angular resolution of the observations affects the correlation results. A proxy for the spinning dust emissivity reveals large variations within the complex, with a dynamic range of 25 at 3 sigma and a variation by a factor of at least 23, at 3 sigma, between the peak in rho Oph W and the location of S1, which means that environmental factors are responsible for boosting spinning dust emissivities locally.

Interpreting the Cratering Histories of Bennu, Ryugu, and Other Spacecraft-explored Asteroids	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Main belt asteroids; Near-Earth objects	SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS; INDUCED SEISMIC ACTIVITY; MAIN-BELT; 21 LUTETIA; 433 EROS; COLLISIONAL HISTORY; MAGNITUDE DISTRIBUTION; ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION; DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION; IMPACT CRATERS	Asteroid crater retention ages have unknown accuracy because projectile-crater scaling laws are difficult to verify. At the same time, our knowledge of asteroid and crater size-frequency distributions has increased substantially over the past few decades. These advances make it possible to empirically derive asteroid crater scaling laws by fitting model asteroid size distributions to crater size distributions from asteroids observed by spacecraft. ForD > 10 km diameter asteroids like Ceres, Vesta, Lutetia, Mathilde, Ida, Eros, and Gaspra, the best matches occur when the ratio of crater to projectile sizes isf similar to 10. The same scaling law applied to 0.3 D < 2.5 km near-Earth asteroids such as Bennu, Ryugu, Itokawa, and Toutatis yield intriguing yet perplexing results. When applied to the largest craters on these asteroids, we obtain crater retention ages of similar to 1 billion years for Bennu, Ryugu, and Itokawa and similar to 2.5 billion years for Toutatis. These ages agree with the estimated formation ages of their source families and could suggest that the near-Earth asteroid population is dominated by bodies that avoided disruption during their traverse across the main asteroid belt. An alternative interpretation is thatf >> 10, which would make their crater retention ages much younger. If true, crater scaling laws need to change in a substantial way betweenD > 10 km asteroids, wheref similar to 10, and 0.3 D < 2.5 km asteroids, wheref >> 10.	[Bottke, W. F.; Marchi, S.; Walsh, K.

Akana			TOI-1235 b: A Keystone Super-Earth for Testing Radius Valley Emergence Models around Early M Dwarfs	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radial velocity; M dwarf stars; Transit photometry; Exoplanet formation; Exoplanet structure	POWERED MASS-LOSS; ERROR-CORRECTION; PLANETS; STARS; TEMPERATURES; ATMOSPHERES; DEPENDENCE; ROTATION; CATALOG; SEARCH	Small planets on close-in orbits tend to exhibit envelope mass fractions of either effectively zero or up to a few percent depending on their size and orbital period. Models of thermally driven atmospheric mass loss and of terrestrial planet formation in a gas-poor environment make distinct predictions regarding the location of this rocky/ nonrocky transition in period-radius space. Here we present the confirmation of TOI-1235 b (P.=.3.44 days, = r 1.738+ p 0.0760.087 RA), a planet whose size and period are intermediate between the competing model predictions, thus making the system an important test case for emergence models of the rocky/nonrocky transition around early M dwarfs (Rs.=.0.630.+/-.0.015 R., Ms.=.0.640.+/-.0.016 M.). We confirm the TESS planet discovery using reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging, and a set of 38 precise radial velocities (RVs) from HARPS-N and HIRES. We measure a planet mass of 6.91+ 0.850.75 MA, which implies an iron core mass fraction of 20+ 1215% in the absence of a gaseous envelope. The bulk composition of TOI-1235 b is therefore consistent with being Earth-like, and we constrain an H/He envelope mass fraction to be <0.5% at 90% confidence. Our results are consistent with model predictions from thermally driven atmospheric mass loss but not with gas-poor formation, suggesting that the former class of processes remains efficient at sculpting close-in planets around early M dwarfs. Our RV analysis also reveals a strong periodicity close to the first harmonic of the photometrically determined stellar rotation period that we treat as stellar activity, despite other lines of evidence favoring a planetary origin ( = P 21.8+ 0.80.9 days, = m sin i 13.0+ p 5.33.8 MA) that cannot be firmly ruled out by our data.

We targeted nearby (less than or similar to 150 pc), young (less than or similar to 500 Myr) stars with high infrared (IR) excesses (L-IR/L-* > 10(-5)), including 38 with previously resolved disks. Observations were made using the GPI high-contrast integral field spectrograph inH-band (1.6 mu m) coronagraphic polarimetry mode to measure both polarized and total intensities. We resolved 26 debris disks and 3 protoplanetary/transitional disks. Seven debris disks were resolved in scattered light for the first time, including newly presented HD 117214 and HD 156623, and we quantified basic morphologies of five of them using radiative transfer models. All of our detected debris disks except HD 156623 have dust-poor inner holes, and their scattered-light radii are generally larger than corresponding radii measured from resolved thermal emission and those inferred from spectral energy distributions. To assess sensitivity, we report contrasts and consider causes of nondetections. Detections were strongly correlated with high IR excess and high inclination, although polarimetry outperformed total intensity angular differential imaging for detecting low-inclination disks (less than or similar to 70 degrees). Based on postsurvey statistics, we improved upon our presurvey target prioritization metric predicting polarimetric disk detectability. We also examined scattered-light disks in the contexts of gas, far-IR, and millimeter detections. ComparingH-band and ALMA fluxes for two disks revealed tentative evidence for differing grain properties. Finally, we found no preference for debris disks to be detected in scattered light if wide-separation substellar companions were present.

Funneled angle landscapes for helical proteins	JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Protein folding; Cytochromes; Myoglobin	ENERGY LANDSCAPE; FOLDING KINETICS; STATISTICAL POTENTIALS; INTERMEDIATE; B(562); APOCYTOCHROME-B5; THERMODYNAMICS; STABILITY; PATHWAY; STATE	We use crystallographic data for four helical iron proteins (cytochrome c-b(562), cytochrome c', sperm whale myoglobin, human cytoglobin) to calculate radial and angular signatures as each unfolds from the native state stepwise though four unfolded states. From these data we construct an angle phase diagram to display the evolution of each protein from its native state; and, in turn, the phase diagram is used to construct a funneled angle landscape for comparison with the topography of its folding energy landscape. We quantify the departure of individual helical and turning regions from the areal, angular profile of corresponding regions of the native state. This procedure allows us to identify the similarities and differences among individual helical and turning regions in the early stages of unfolding of the four helical heme proteins.

However, at present, developing and studying algorithms for these problems can be difficult due to the prohibitive amount of domain knowledge required in both the area of chemistry and quantum algorithms. To help bridge this gap and open the field to more researchers, we have developed the OpenFermion software package (). OpenFermion is an open-source software library written largely in Python under an Apache 2.0 license, aimed at enabling the simulation of fermionic and bosonic models and quantum chemistry problems on quantum hardware. Beginning with an interface to common electronic structure packages, it simplifies the translation between a molecular specification and a quantum circuit for solving or studying the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer, minimizing the amount of domain expertise required to enter the field. The package is designed to be extensible and robust, maintaining high software standards in documentation and testing. This release paper outlines the key motivations behind design choices in OpenFermion and discusses some basic OpenFermion functionality which we believe will aid the community in the development of better quantum algorithms and tools for this exciting area of research.

ASTERIA's primary mission objective was demonstrating two key technologies for reducing systematic noise in photometric observations: high-precision pointing control and high-stability thermal control. ASTERIA demonstrated 05 rms pointing stability and 10 mK thermal control of its camera payload during its primary mission, a significant improvement in pointing and thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size and mass class. ASTERIA launched in 2017 August and deployed from the International Space Station in 2017 November. During the prime mission (2017 November-2018 February) and the first extended mission that followed (2018 March-2018 May), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations, which included the collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with a super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom pipeline to correct complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to simultaneously detrend the photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e (similar to 2R(circle plus)), measuring a transit depth of 374 +/- 170 ppm. This is the first detection of an exoplanet transit by a CubeSat. The successful detection of super-Earth 55 Cancri e demonstrates that small, inexpensive spacecraft can deliver high-precision photometric measurements.

Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we incorporate planet radius uncertainties into an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model. We demonstrate that this model captures the general features of the outcome of the planet formation and evolution around GK stars and provides an infrastructure to use the Kepler results to constrain analytic planet distribution models. We report an increased mean and variance in the marginal posterior distributions for the number of planets per GK star when including planet radius measurement uncertainties. We estimate the number of planets per GK star between 0.75 and 2.5R(circle plus)and with orbital periods of 50-300 days to have a 68% credible interval of 0.49-0.77 and a posterior mean of 0.63. This posterior has a smaller mean and a larger variance than the occurrence rate calculated in this work and in Burke et al. for the same parameter space using theQ1-Q16 (previous Kepler planet candidate and stellar catalog). We attribute the smaller mean to many of the instrumental false positives at longer orbital periods being removed from the DR25 catalog. We find that the accuracy and precision of our hierarchical Bayesian model posterior distributions are less sensitive to the total number of planets in the sample, and more so for the characteristics of the catalog completeness and reliability and the span of the planet parameter space.

The landscape of Saturn's internal magnetic field from the Cassini Grand Finale	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Saturn; Magnetic fields; Geophysics; Interior	PLANETARY PERIOD OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETOMETER OBSERVATIONS; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PHASE-SEPARATION; NORTHERN SUMMER; DYNAMO; MAGNETOSPHERE; HYDROGEN; CORE; ROTATION	The Cassini mission entered the Grand Finale phase in April 2017 and executed 22.5 highly inclined, close-in orbits around Saturn before diving into the planet on September 15th 2017. Here we present our analysis of the Cassini Grand Finale magnetometer (MAG) dataset, focusing on Saturn's internal magnetic field. These measurements demonstrate that Saturn's internal magnetic field is exceptionally axisymmetric, with a dipole tilt less than 0.007 degrees (25.2 arcsecs). Saturn's magnetic equator was directly measured to be shifted northward by similar to 0.0468 +/- 0.00043 (1 sigma) R-S, 2820 +/- 26 km, at cylindrical radial distances between 1.034 and 1.069 R-S from the spin-axis. Although almost perfectly axisymmetric, Saturn's internal magnetic field exhibits features on many characteristic length scales in the latitudinal direction. Examining B-r at the a = 0.75 R-S, c = 0.6993 R-S isobaric surface, the degree 4 to 11 contributions correspond to latitudinally banded magnetic perturbations with characteristic width similar to 15 degrees, similar to that of the off-equatorial zonal jets observed in the atmosphere of Saturn. Saturn's internal magnetic field beyond 60 degrees, in particular the small-scale features, are less well constrained by the available measurements, mainly due to incomplete spatial coverage in the polar region. Magnetic fields associated with the ionospheric Hall currents were estimated and found to contribute less than 2.5 nT to Gauss coefficients beyond degree 3. The magneto-disk field features orbit-to-orbit variations between 12 nT and 15.4 nT along the close-in part of Grand Finale orbits, offering an opportunity to measure the electromagnetic induction response from the interior of Saturn. A stably stratified layer thicker than 2500 km likely exists above Saturn's deep dynamo to filter out the non-axisymmetric internal magnetic field. A heat transport mechanism other than pure conduction, e.g. double diffusive convection, must be operating within this layer to be compatible with Saturn's observed luminosity. The latitudinally banded magnetic perturbations likely arise from a shallow secondary dynamo action with latitudinally banded differential rotation in the semi-conducting layer.

Titan's impact crater population after Cassini	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Titan, surface; Impact processes; Radar observations; Geological processes	CENTRAL PEAK; RADAR; MORPHOLOGY; SURFACE; TOPOGRAPHY; SATELLITES; GANYMEDE; EROSION; EJECTA; SAR	Titan is Saturn's largest moon and has a dynamic surface with methane rivers carved by an active hydrological cycle and sand seas shaped by aeolian processes. One way to study the rates of these processes is by examining Titan's impact craters, because they provide quantitative constraints on the level of degradation. With the end of the Cassini Mission in September 2017, we have reassessed the crater population using the entire Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset, including 30 additional craters since the last assessment in 2012, for a total of 90 certain to possible impact craters on Titan. We adjust for incomplete coverage (similar to 69%) of the moon by SAR imaging using a Monte-Carlo approach, and find no major change in Titan's inferred surface age from prior studies. We then used the SARTopo and stereo topography data sets to measure crater depths and diameters. For the first time, rim heights for twelve craters were also reported. On average, Titan's craters are shown to be shallower, with lower rims, than those observed on similarly sized icy moons (e.g. Ganymede). This suggests that the observed modification is due to a combination of sand and sediment infilling onto the crater floor and fluvial erosion of the rims with fluvial erosion playing a larger role than previously thought in crater degradation on Titan.

Time variability of the Enceladus plumes: Orbital periods, decadal periods, and aperiodic change	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Enceladus; Saturn satellites; Tides; Solid body	SOUTH-POLE; CASSINI; ERUPTIONS; VAPOR; MODEL; DUST	The Enceladus plumes vary on a number of timescales. Tidal stresses as Enceladus revolves in its eccentric orbit lead to a periodic diurnal variation in the mass and velocity of solid particles in the plume. Tidal stresses associated with an orbital resonance with Dione lead to a periodic decadal variation. Aperiodic variations occur on time scales of months, and may be due to ice buildup and flow of the walls of the fissures that connect the ocean to the surface. We document these variations using all the relevant data taken by the ISS instrument from 2005 to 2017. Key questions now include how a 5% peak-to-peak variation in orbital eccentricity, which itself is only 0.0045, could lead to a 2-fold decadal variation in plume properties. Another question is how the plumes stay open if ice builds up every month and clogs the vents. Other questions include why the solid particles exit the vents several times slower than the gas, and why the speeds vary inversely with the mass of the plumes. The Cassini data are in, but the modeling has just begun.

Cassini RADAR Team	Labyrinth terrain on Titan	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Titan; Geological processes; Titan surface	CASSINI VIMS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ONTARIO LACUS; SURFACE; RADAR; ATMOSPHERE; DUNE; BATHYMETRY; MORPHOLOGY; SAR	The Cassini/Huygens mission revealed a terrain type on Saturn's moon Titan of dissected, elevated plateaux with a high density of valleys named labyrinth terrain. We define four subtypes of labyrinth terrains: valleyed, polygonal, finely-dissected, and the possible outlier Kronin Labyrinth. We mapped the locations of all labyrinths imaged by Cassini and found they are distributed preferentially at high latitudes. We characterize the labyrinths by morphometric parameters such as intervalley width, valley width, and percent valleys. We find many labyrinths contain closed valleys, which constrains their formation and evolution. We also examine their low microwave emissivity spectral characteristics and find that the labyrinths are consistent with a bulk composition of dominantly organic materials, with some component of water ice - characteristics similar to Titan's undifferentiated plains. Our analyses show that labyrinths are ancient terrains - only the mountains and hummocky terrains are older. This implies that significant organic production occurred early in Titan's history. The organic inventory represented by the labyrinths is estimated to be 15-42% of the solid organic inventory of Titan (or 14-35% of the total surface organics, if the hydrocarbons of the lakes and seas are also included). Our preferred formation of the labyrinth terrains is erosion through dissolution and fluvial processes that dissect the plateaux in a manner similar to dissolution geology (karst) on Earth. This scenario requires that the organics that make up the labyrinth terrain be soluble in methane and/or ethane liquids. It also suggests that the origin of the plateaux may have derived from Titan's past chemical production and subsequent depositional record.	[Malaska, Michael J.; Lopes, Rosaly M.

Spectral and emissivity analysis of the raised ramparts around Titan's northern lakes	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Titan surface; Titan hydrology; Radar observations; Spectroscopy; Radiative transfer	SURFACE; RADAR; BATHYMETRY; ATMOSPHERE; ETHANE; VIMS	Some of Titan's small northern hemisphere lakes show raised rampart features (which are distinct from raised rims), and appear as SAR-bright mound-like annuli extending away from the lake for up to tens of kilometers from the shoreline. We investigate the infrared and microwave characteristics of these features using Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and RADAR data. A spectral comparative analysis is performed among the lakes, their ramparts, and the surrounding regions. We overcome the profound difference in spatial resolution between VIMS and SAR data by using a method that provides overlays between the spectral images and SAR, thus enabling the correct selection of VIMS pixels. The surface properties of the selected areas are obtained using a radiative transfer analysis on the selected VIMS pixels, in addition to emissivity obtained from the RADAR in radiometry mode. Analysis of these combined and co-registered data provides constraints for the formation mechanism(s) of raised ramparts. The results show that the emissivity of the raised ramparts is close to that of Titan's labyrinthic terrains and to that of empty lake floors in the northern polar regions. This is confirmed by the VIMS analysis that also shows that the infrared spectral response of the raised ramparts is very similar to that of some empty lake floors. This suggests that both areas are made from or are covered by a similar material. In addition, two out of the eight lakes with raised ramparts show spectral differences at three specific wavelengths, 1.6, 2.0, and 5.0 mu m, between the ramparts and the surrounding terrain. We hypothesize that this could be due to some component, or mixture of components in the ramparts that is less absorbent at these specific wavelengths, or it could be an effect of different grain sizes. These observations provide first insights into the possible mechanisms leading to the formation of the raised ramparts that are discussed here.

Our approach combines the advantage of centralized planning of avoiding local minima with the advantage of decentralized controllers of scalability and distributed computation. In particular, our synthesized policies only require relative state information of nearby neighbors and obstacles, and compute a provably-safe action. Our approach has three major components: i) we generate demonstration trajectories using a global planner and extract local observations from them, ii) we use deep imitation learning to learn a decentralized policy that can run efficiently online, and iii) we introduce a novel differentiable safety module to ensure collision-free operation, thereby allowing for end-to-end policy training. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our policies have a 20%; higher success rate than optimal reciprocal collision avoidance, ORCA, across a wide range of robot and obstacle densities. We demonstrate our method on an aerial swarm, executing the policy on low-end microcontrollers in real-time.

In this study, we examine the similarities and differences between the dynamics governing these events in these two regions. In the Ohio Valley, extreme precipitation events are associated with midlatitude synoptic-scale convergence northeast of cyclones and a southwestward oriented ridge near the Atlantic coast that drives strong water vapor transport from the Gulf of Mexico into the Ohio Valley. In the northwestern United States, extreme precipitation events are associated with a cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation pair aligned northwest to southeast, which together drive a long and strong moisture transport corridor from the lower latitude of the central Pacific Ocean toward the northwestern United States. Moisture budget analysis shows that moisture convergence due to dynamical convergence dominates in the Ohio Valley, whereas moisture advection dominates over the Pacific Northwest. Differences between the cases in the same region are examined by an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis conducted on the vertically integrated moisture flux. Different EOFs highlight shifts in spatial location, orientation, and intensity of the moisture flux but demonstrate consistent roles of dynamics in the two regions. Composites based on these EOFs highlight the range of likely synoptic scenarios that can give rise to precipitation extremes over these two regions.	[Ma, Chen-Geng; Chang, Edmund K.

JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Empirical orthogonal functions; Climate variability; Multidecadal variability; Oscillations; Pacific decadal oscillation	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; 20TH-CENTURY CLIMATE SIMULATIONS; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; NORTH PACIFIC; SALINITY ANOMALIES; SAHEL RAINFALL; GLOBAL MODES; FREQUENCY; ENSO	The Atlantic and Pacific basin are found linked in the context of multidecadal SST variability from analyses of 118 years of observational data. Recurrent spatiotemporal variability, including multidecadal modes, was identified using the extended-EOF technique in a longitudinally global domain, allowing unfettered expression of interbasin interactions. The physicality of the obtained decadal modes was assessed using fishery records and analog counts. A three-mode structure withbi-directional interbasin links frames the new perspective on the cycling of multidecadal SST variability. The three modes are the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), low-frequency North Atlantic Oscillation (LF-NAO), and North Pacific decadal variability [PDV-NP; resembling negative (-ve) PDO]. The two previously documented links AMO -> PDV-NP (with similar to 12.5-yr lead) and LF-NAO -> AMO (with 16-yr lead) are corroborated, while a third one, PDV-NP ->(-LF-NAO) with similar to 6.5-yr lead, is uncovered. The interaction triad closes the loop on the cycling of multidecadal SST variability, generating AMO's phase reversal in similar to 35 years, consistent with its widely noted similar to 70-yr time scale. The two previously noted links-one intrabasin and one interbasin-were unsuccessful in this regard. Other findings include the deeper subsurface extensions of Atlantic multidecadal SST variability, and the hitherto unrecognized similarity of Pan-Pacific decadal variability and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Instrumental records, albeit short in the context of multidecadal variability, must continue to be mined for insights into the functioning of the climate system as its model representations while improving, remain inadequate.

J	Ghosh, S; Bhattacharya, K				Ghosh, Swarnava; Bhattacharya, Kaushik			Influence of thermomechanical loads on the energetics of precipitation in magnesium aluminum alloys	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article							FINITE-DIFFERENCE FORMULATION; MG-AL; PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SPARC ACCURATE; ELECTRON-GAS; MICROSTRUCTURE	We use first principles calculations to study the influence of thermomechanical loads on the energetics of precipitation in magnesium-aluminum alloys. Using Density Functional Theory simulations, we present expressions of the energy of magnesium-aluminum binary solid solutions as a function of concentration, strain and temperature. Additionally, from these calculations, we observe an increase in equilibrium volume (and hence the equilibrium lattice constants) with the increase in concentration of magnesium. We also observe an increase in the cohesive energy of solutions with increase in concentration, and also present their dependence on strain. Calculations also show that the formation enthalpy of beta phase solutions to be strongly influenced by hydrostatic stress, however the formation enthalpy of alpha phase solutions remain unaffected by hydrostatic stress. We present an expression of the free energy of any magnesium aluminum solid solution, that takes into account the contributions of strain and temperature. We note that these expressions can serve as input to process models of magnesium-aluminum alloys. We use these expressions to report the influence of strains and temperature on the solubility limits and equilibrium chemical potential in Mg-Al alloys. Finally, we report the influence of thermomechanical loads on the growth of precipitates, where we observe compressive strains along the c axis promotes growth of precipiates with a (0001)(alpha) habit plane, whereas strains along the a and b directions do not influence the growth of precipitates.

Fusion rules from entanglement	ANNALS OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Anyon; Fusion rule; Quantum entanglement; Quantum phases; Topological order; Topological entanglement entropy	STRONG SUBADDITIVITY; ENTROPY; STATES	We derive some of the axioms of the algebraic theory of anyon (Kitaev, 2006) from a conjectured form of entanglement area law for two-dimensional gapped systems. We derive the fusion rules of topological charges and show that the multiplicities of the fusion rules satisfy these axioms. Moreover, even though we make no assumption about the exact value of the constant sub-leading term of the entanglement entropy of a disk-like region, this term is shown to be equal to in D, where D is the total quantum dimension of the underlying anyon theory. These derivations are rigorous and follow from the entanglement area law alone. More precisely, our framework starts from two local entropic constraints which are implied by the area law. From these constraints, we prove what we refer to as the "isomorphism theorem." The existence of superselection sectors and fusion multiplicities follow from this theorem, even without assuming anything about the parent Hamiltonian. These objects and the axioms of the anyon theory are shown to emerge from the structure and the internal self-consistency relations of the information convex sets. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Simulating the Multi-epoch Direct Detection Technique to Isolate the Thermal Emission of the Non-transiting Hot Jupiter HD187123b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ORBITAL MOTION; COOL STARS; PLANET; EXOPLANET; PROFILES; SPOCS; MASS; KECK	We report the 6.5 sigma detection of water from the hot Jupiter HD187123b with a Keplerian orbital velocity K-p of 53 +/- 13 km s(-1). This high-confidence detection is made using a multi-epoch, high-resolution, cross-correlation technique, and corresponds to a planetary mass of 1.4(-0.3)(1.05) M-J and an orbital inclination of 21 degrees +/- 5 degrees. The technique works by treating the planet/star system as a spectroscopic binary and obtaining high signal-to-noise, high-resolution observations at multiple points across the planet's orbit to constrain the system's binary dynamical motion. All together, seven epochs of Keck/NIRSPEC L-band observations were obtained, with five before the instrument upgrade and two after. Using high-resolution SCARLET planetary and PHOENIX stellar spectral models, we were able to drastically increase the confidence of the detection by running simulations that could reproduce, and thus remove, the nonrandom structured noise in the final likelihood space well. The ability to predict multi-epoch results will be extremely useful for furthering the technique. Here, we use these simulations to compare three different approaches to combining the cross correlations of high-resolution spectra and find that the Zucker log(L) approach is least affected by unwanted planet/star correlation for our HD187123 data set. Furthermore, we find that the same total signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spread across an orbit in many, lower S/N epochs rather than fewer, higher S/N epochs could provide a more efficient detection. This work provides a necessary validation of multi-epoch simulations, which can be used to guide future observations and will be key to studying the atmospheres of farther separated, non-transiting exoplanets.

A Pair of TESS Planets Spanning the Radius Valley around the Nearby Mid-M Dwarf LTT 3780	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radial velocity; M dwarf stars; Exoplanet systems; Transit photometry	POWERED MASS-LOSS; ERROR-CORRECTION; PHOTOMETRY; DEPENDENCE	We present the confirmation of two new planets transiting the nearby mid-M dwarf LTT 3780 (TIC 36724087, TOI-732, V = 13.07, K-s = 8.204, R-s = 0.374 R<sub, M-s = 0.401 M-circle dot, d = 22 pc). The two planet candidates are identified in a single Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite sector and validated with reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometric follow-up, and high-resolution imaging. With measured orbital periods of P-b = 0.77, P-c = 12.25 days and sizes r(p,b) = 1.33 0.07, r(p,c) = 2.30 0.16 R-circle plus, the two planets span the radius valley in period-radius space around low-mass stars, thus making the system a laboratory to test competing theories of the emergence of the radius valley in that stellar mass regime. By combining 63 precise radial velocity measurements from the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) and HARPS-N, we measure planet masses of M-circle plus, which indicates that LTT 3780b has a bulk composition consistent with being Earth-like, while LTT 3780c likely hosts an extended H/He envelope. We show that the recovered planetary masses are consistent with predictions from both photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss models. The brightness and small size of LTT 3780, along with the measured planetary parameters, render LTT 3780b and c as accessible targets for atmospheric characterization of planets within the same planetary system and spanning the radius valley.

J	Zhong, MY; Zhan, ZW				Zhong, Minyan; Zhan, Zhongwen			An array-based receiver function deconvolution method: methodology and application	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Joint inversion; Time-series analysis; Computational seismology	ITERATIVE DECONVOLUTION; NEIGHBORHOOD ALGORITHM; GEOPHYSICAL INVERSION; JOINT INVERSION; PLATEAU; CRUSTAL; WAVES	Receiver functions (RFs) estimated on dense arrays have been widely used for the study of Earth structures across multiple scales. However, due to the ill-posedness of deconvolution, RF estimation faces challenges such as non-uniqueness and data overfitting. In this paper, we present an array-based RF deconvolution method in the context of emerging dense arrays. We propose to exploit the wavefield coherency along a dense array by joint inversions of waveforms from multiple events and stations for RFs with a minimum number of phases required by data. The new method can effectively reduce the instability of deconvolution and help retrieve RFs with higher fidelity. We test the algorithm on synthetic waveforms and show that it produces RFs with higher interpretability than those by the conventional RF estimation practice. Then we apply the method to real data from the 2016 Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) community wavefield experiment in Oklahoma and are able to generate high-resolution RF profiles with only three teleseismic earthquakes recorded by the temporary deployment. This new method should help enhance RF images derived from short-term high-density seismic profiles.

Activation of optimally and unfavourably oriented faults in a uniform local stress field during the 2011 Prague, Oklahoma, sequence	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Induced seismicity; Rheology and friction of fault zones; Seismic anisotropy	SAN-ANDREAS FAULT; INDUCED EARTHQUAKES; VELOCITY ANISOTROPY; CRUSTAL ANISOTROPY; INDUCED SEISMICITY; FOCAL MECHANISMS; FLUID PRESSURE; INJECTION; NUCLEATION; PERMEABILITY	The orientations of faults activated relative to the local principal stress directions can provide insights into the role of pore pressure changes in induced earthquake sequences. Here, we examine the 2011 M5.7 Prague earthquake sequence that was induced by nearby wastewater disposal. We estimate the local principal compressive stress direction near the rupture as inferred from shear wave splitting measurements at spatial resolutions as small as 750 m. We find that the dominant azimuth observed is parallel to previous estimates of the regional compressive stress with some secondary azimuths oriented subparallel to the strike of the major fault structures. From an extended catalogue, we map ten distinct fault segments activated during the sequence that exhibit a wide array of orientations. We assess whether the five near-vertical fault planes are optimally oriented to fail in the determined stress field. We find that only two of the fault planes, including the M5.7 main shock fault, are optimally oriented. Both the M4.8 foreshock and M4.8 aftershock occur on fault planes that deviate 20-29 degrees from the optimal orientation for slip. Our results confirm that induced event sequences can occur on faults not optimally oriented for failure in the local stress field. The results suggest elevated pore fluid pressures likely induced failure along several of the faults activated in the 2011 Prague sequence.

J	Smith, JD; White, RS; Avouac, JP; Bourne, S				Smith, Jonathan D.; White, Robert S.; Avouac, Jean-Philippe; Bourne, Stephen			Probabilistic earthquake locations of induced seismicity in the Groningen region, the Netherlands	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Earthquake hazards; Earthquake source observations; Induced seismicity	HAZARD ASSESSMENT; GAS-FIELD; COMPACTION	The Groningen gas reservoir, situated in the northeast of the Netherlands, is western Europe's largest producing gas field and has been in production since 1963. The gas production has induced both subsidence and seismicity. Seismicity is detected and located using the Konin-klijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut shallow-borehole array for the period 2015-2017, incorporating the back projection techniques of QuakeMigrate and the nonlinear location procedure to constrain earthquake locations and depths. The uncertainties on the estimated depths are estimated taking into account velocity model, changes in station array geometry and uncertainties in the measurement of arrival times of the P and S waves. We show that the depth distribution of seismicity is consistent with nucleation within the reservoir (28 per cent) or in the overburden (60 per cent) within similar to 500m from the top of the reservoir. Earthquakes with hypocentres in the overburden likely originate from overlying Zechstein anhydrite caprock. Based on their depth distribution, it seems like the earthquakes are primarily driven by the elastic strain in the reservoir and overburden, induced by the reservoir compaction. We estimate the probability of earthquakes nucleating beneath the reservoir in the underlying Carboniferous limestone and basement, to be no more than 12 per cent.

Efficient microwave frequency conversion mediated by a photonics compatible silicon nitride nanobeam oscillator	QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						superconducting circuits; electromechanics; optomechanics; MEMS; frequency conversion; hybrid devices; silicon nitride membranes	QUANTUM; MOTION; WAVES	Microelectromechanical systems and integrated photonics provide the basis for many reliable and compact circuit elements in modern communication systems. Electro-opto-mechanical devices are currently one of the leading approaches to realize ultra-sensitive, low-loss transducers for an emerging quantum information technology. Here we present an on-chip microwave frequency converter based on a planar aluminum on silicon nitride platform that is compatible with slot-mode coupled photonic crystal cavities. We show efficient frequency conversion between two propagating microwave modes mediated by the radiation pressure interaction with a metalized dielectric nanobeam oscillator. We achieve bidirectional coherent conversion with a total device efficiency of up to similar to 60%, a dynamic range of 2 x 10(9) photons/s and an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 1.7 kHz. A high fidelity quantum state transfer would be possible if the drive dependent output noise of currently similar to 14 photons s(-1) Hz(-1) is further reduced. Such a silicon nitride based transducer is in situ reconfigurable and could be used for on-chip classical and quantum signal routing and filtering, both for microwave and hybrid microwave-optical applications.

J	Barkan, Y; Paris, G; Webb, SM; Adkins, JF; Halevy, I				Barkan, Yigal; Paris, Guillaume; Webb, Samuel M.; Adkins, Jess F.; Halevy, Itay			Sulfur isotope fractionation between aqueous and carbonate-associated sulfate in abiotic calcite and aragonite	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Sulfur cycle; Partition coefficient; Ion substitution; Sulfur XANES; Experimental mineral precipitation	ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPY; EQUILIBRIUM FRACTIONATION; AUTHIGENIC CARBONATE; CA ISOTOPES; SEAWATER; CORAL; MAGNESIUM; GROWTH; CACO3; PHASE	Sulfate (SO42-) incorporated into calcium carbonate minerals enables measurements of sulfur (S) isotope ratios in carbonate rocks. This Carbonate Associated Sulfate (CAS) in marine carbonate minerals is thought to faithfully represent the S isotope composition of the seawater sulfate incorporated into the mineral, with little or no S isotope fractionation in the process. However, comparison between different calcifying species reveals both positive and negative S isotope fractionation between CAS and seawater sulfate, and a large range of S isotope ratios can be found within a single rock sample, depending on the component measured. To better understand the isotopic effects associated with sulfate incorporation into carbonate minerals, we precipitated inorganic calcite and aragonite over a range covering more than two orders of magnitude of sulfate concentration and precipitation rate. Coupled measurements of CAS concentration, S isotope composition and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) permit characterization and explanation of the observed dependence of S isotope fractionation between CAS and aqueous sulfate (CAS-SO42- isotope fractionation) on sulfate concentration and precipitation rate. In aragonite, the CAS-SO42- isotope fractionation is 1.0 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand and independent of the sulfate (and CAS) concentration. In contrast, the CAS-SO42- isotope fractionation in calcite covaries strongly with the sulfate concentration and weakly with the precipitation rate, between values of 1.3 +/- 0.1 and 3.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand. We suggest that the correlation between aqueous sulfate concentration and CAS-SO42- isotope fractionation in calcite reflects a dependence of the equilibrium S isotope fractionation on the concentration of CAS, through the effect of the sulfate impurity on the carbonate mineral's energetic state.
