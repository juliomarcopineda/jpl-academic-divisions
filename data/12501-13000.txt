The test has constant robustness: any strategy achieving success probability within an additive epsilon of the optimal must be poly(epsilon)-close, in the appropriate distance measure, to the honest n-qubit strategy. The test involves 2n-bit questions and 2-bit answers. The key technical ingredient is a quantum version of the classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld. As applications of our result we give (i) the first robust self-test for n EPR pairs; (ii) a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem with a constant number of provers and classical questions and answers, and a constant completeness-soundness gap independent of system size; (iii) a robust protocol for verifiable delegated quantum computation with a constant number of quantum polynomial-time provers sharing entanglement.

By storing data of syntactic structures of world languages in a Kanerva network and checking recoverability of corrupted data from the network, we identify two different effects: an overall underlying relation between the prevalence of parameters across languages and their degree of recoverability, and a finer effect that makes some parameters more easily recoverable beyond what their prevalence would indicate. The latter can be seen as an indication of the existence of dependence relations, through which a given parameter can be determined using the remaining uncorrupted data.

FtsZ filaments are tethered to the membrane by anchors such as FtsA and SepF and are regulated by accessory proteins. One such set of proteins is responsible for Z-ring's spatiotemporal regulation, essential for the production of two equal sized daughter cells. Here, we describe how our still partial understanding of the FtsZ-based cell division process has been progressed by visualising near-atomic structures of Z-rings and complexes that control Z-ring positioning in cells, most notably the MinCDE and Noc systems that act by negatively regulating FtsZ filaments. We stunmarise available data and how they inform mechanistic models for the cell division process.

This similarity is seen in the machineries for a number of essential cellular processes, including DNA replication and gene transcription.

Automated Breast Ultrasound for Ductal Pattern Reconstruction: Ground Truth File Generation and CADe Evaluation	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-MEDICAL INSTRUMENTATION AND RELATED ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES (BIOMEP 2017)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Bio-Medical Instrumentation and related Engineering and Physical Sciences (BIOMEP)	OCT 12-13, 2017	Technological Educ Inst, Athens, GREECE	Dept Biomedical Engn	Technological Educ Inst		WOMEN	The purpose of this study was the generation of ground truth files (GTFs) of the breast ducts from 3D images of the Invenia (TM) Automated Breast Ultrasound System (ABUS) system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and the application of these GTFs for the optimization of the imaging protocol and the evaluation of a computer aided detection (CADe) algorithm developed for automated duct detection. Six lactating, nursing volunteers were scanned with the ABUS before and right after breastfeeding their infants. An expert in breast ultrasound generated rough outlines of the milk-filled ducts in the transaxial slices of all image volumes and the final GTFs were created by using thresholding and smoothing tools in ImageJ. In addition, a CADe algorithm automatically segmented duct like areas and its results were compared to the expert's GTFs by estimating true positive fraction (TPF) or % overlap. The CADe output differed significantly from the expert's but both detected a smaller than expected volume of the ducts due to insufficient contrast (ducts were partially filled with milk), discontinuities, and artifacts. GTFs were used to modify the imaging protocol and improve the CADe method. In conclusion, electronic GTFs provide a valuable tool in the optimization of a tomographic imaging system, the imaging protocol, and the CADe algorithms. Their generation, however, is an extremely time consuming, strenuous process, particularly for multi-slice examinations, and alternatives based on phantoms or simulations are highly desirable.

Fourier transform absorption spectra of the 2-0 band of (CO)-C-12-O-16 mixed with CO2 have been recorded at total pressures from 156 to 1212 hPa and at 4 different temperatures between 240 K and 283 K. CO2 pressure-induced line broadening and line shift coefficients, and the associated temperature dependence have been measured in an multispectrum non-linear least squares analysis using Voigt profiles with an asymmetric profile due to line mixing. The measured CO2-broadening and CO2-shift parameters were compared with theoretical values, calculated by collaborators. In addition, the CO2-broadening and shift coefficients have been calculated for individual temperatures using the Exponential Power Gap (EPG) semi-empirical method. We also discuss the retrieved line shape parameters for Methane transitions in the spectral range known as the Methane Octad. We used high resolution spectra of pure methane and of dilute mixtures of methane in dry air, recorded with high signal to noise ratio at temperatures between 148 K and room temperature using the Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. Theoretical calculations for line parameters have been performed and the results are compared with the previously published values and with the line parameters available in the GEISA2015 [1] and HITRAN2012 [2] databases.

J	Chen, YX; Hassani, SH; Krause, A				Chen, Yuxin; Hassani, S. Hamed; Krause, Andreas			Near-optimal Bayesian active learning with correlated and noisy tests	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian active learning; information gathering; decision making; noisy observation; approximation algorithms		We consider the Bayesian active learning and experimental design problem, where the goal is to learn the value of some unknown target variable through a sequence of informative, noisy tests. In contrast to prior work, we focus on the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly. We propose ECED, a novel, efficient active learning algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated, noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective, which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the approximation bound. We demonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on three problem instances, including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish among economic theories of how people make risky decisions, an active preference learning task via pairwise comparisons, and a third application on pool-based active learning.

Fabricating with crystalline Si to improve superconducting detector performance	12TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LOW TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Workshop on Low Temperature Electronics	SEP 18-21, 2016	Tempe, AZ	Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Lake Shore Cryotron, Arizona State Univ NewSpace, IRA A				We built and measured radio-frequency (RF) loss tangent, tan delta, evaluation structures using float-zone quality silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with 5 mu m thick device layers. Superconducting Nb components were fabricated on both sides of the SOI Si device layer. Our main goals were to develop a robust fabrication for using crystalline Si (c-Si) dielectric layers with superconducting Nb components in a wafer bonding process and to confirm that tan delta with c-Si dielectric layers was reduced at RF frequencies compared to devices fabricated with amorphous dielectrics, such as SiO2 and SixNy, where tan delta similar to 10(-3). Our primary test structure used a Nb coplanar waveguide (CPW) readout structure capacitively coupled to LC resonators, where the capacitors were defined as parallel-plate capacitors on both sides of a c-Si device layer using a wafer bonding process with benzocyclobutene (BCB) wafer bonding adhesive. Our control experiment, to determine the intrinsic tan delta in the SOI device layer without wafer bonding, also used Nb CPW readout coupled to LC resonators; however, the parallel-plate capacitors were fabricated on both sides of the Si device layer using a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) to access the c-Si underside through the buried oxide and handle Si layers in the SOI wafers. We found that our wafer bonded devices demonstrated F center dot delta = (8 +/- 2) x 10(-5), where F is the filling fraction of two-level states (TLS). For the control experiment, F center dot delta = (2.0 +/- 0.6) x 10(-5), and we discuss what may be degrading the performance in the wafer bonded devices as compared to the control devices.

This paper focuses on the completed LRI Laser Ranging Processor (LRP), which includes heterodyne signal phase tracking at mu cycle/root Hz precision, differential wavefront sensing, offset frequency phase locking and Pound-Drever-Hall laser stabilization. The LRI design has characteristics that are similar to those for LISA: 1064nm NPRO laser source, science bandwidth in the mHz range, MHz-range intermediate frequency and Doppler shift, detected optical power of tens of picoWatts. Laser frequency stabilization has been demonstrated at a level below 30 Hz/root Hz, better than the LISA requirement of 300 Hz/root Hz. The LRP has completed all performance testing and environmental qualification and has been delivered to the GRACE Follow-On spacecraft.

S	Tinto, M			IOP	Tinto, Massimo			Enhanced Gravitational Wave Science with LISA and gLISA.	11TH INTERNATIONAL LISA SYMPOSIUM	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International LISA Symposium	SEP 05-09, 2016	Univ Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	LISA	Univ Zurich			The geosynchronous Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (gLISA) is a space-based gravitational wave (GW) mission that, for the past five years, has been under joint study at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford University, the National Institute for Space Research (I.N.P.E., Brazil), and Space Systems Loral. With an arm length of 73,000 km, gLISA will display optimal sensitivity over a frequency region that is exactly in between those accessible by LISA and LIGO. Such a GW frequency band is characterized by the presence of a very large ensemble of coalescing black-hole binaries (BHBs) similar to those first observed by LIGO and with masses that are 10 to 100 times the mass of the Sun. gLISA will detect thousands of such signals with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enhance the LIGO science by measuring with high precision the parameters characterizing such signals (source direction, chirp parameter, time to coalescence, etc.) well before they will enter the LIGO band. This valuable information will improve LIGO's ability to detect these signals and facilitate its study of the merger and ring-down phases not observable by space-based detectors. If flown at the same time as the LISA mission, the two arrays will deliver a joint sensitivity that accounts for the best performance of both missions in their respective parts of the milliHertz band. This simultaneous operation will result in an optimally combined sensitivity curve that is "white" from about 3 x 10(-3) Hz to 1 Hz, making the two antennas capable of detecting, with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), BHBs with masses in the range (10 - 10(7))M-circle dot. Their ability of jointly tracking, with enhanced SNR, signals similar to that observed by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) on September 14, 2015 (the GW150914 event) will result in a larger number of observable small-mass binary black-holes and an improved precision of the parameters characterizing these sources. Together, LISA, gLISA and aLIGO will cover, with good sensitivity, the (10(-4) - 10(3)) Hz frequency band.

In addition to the profound impacts on human health and ecosystems, fine PM interacts directly and indirectly with the Earth's radiation budget, influencing weather and climate. An understanding of the PM formation mechanism is critical in the development of efficient mitigation policies to minimize the local, regional, and global impacts. The formation mechanisms leading to severe haze episodes with exceedingly high PM2.5 levels in China remain uncertain, and the abundance and chemical constituents of PM2.5 depend on the complex interplay between meteorology, emission sources, and atmospheric chemical processes. This paper discusses the various aspects relevant to persistent haze in China, including the fundamental chemistry and meteorological conditions.

Just as important in the TDI scheme is the ability to suppress the rf local oscillator noises in the optical heterodyne measurements. We show that the local oscillator noises can be effectively and elegantly cancelled by employing optical frequency combs in which the rf signal phases are coherent with the optical phases. In addition, the deployment of optical combs eliminates the need for separate ultra-stable oscillators. This is a simpler and more reliable approach than the modulation scheme, and it can be applied to the most generalized TDI combinations.

The number of laser units required makes the achievable minimum size and power of the instrument challenging, especially for space applications. We demonstrate a compact cesium atom interferometer operated by only a single laser. This is achieved by dynamically changing the laser output frequency while maintaining spectroscopic reference to an atomic transition. We are able to generate cold atoms and obtain atom interferometer fringes all with the same laser.

It utilizes a set of interior gravity field spherical harmonics expansions to place constraints on the likely distribution of the density inhomogeneities inside a body of mass. An interior spherical harmonics expansion is defined within the interior Brillouin sphere that extends down to the surface of a body of mass allowing it to be closer and more sensitive to the regional density dispersions. Furthermore, due to the way the interior expansion is constructed, using multiple expansion fields provides added geometry advantage to the problem.

After successfully completing its Vesta and Ceres prime missions, Dawn is now in its extended mission, continuously exploring Ceres. After losing the second reaction wheel assembly at the end of the Vesta mission, the feasibility of the Ceres mission was at risk due to the potentially significant increase in hydrazine consumption from using only the reaction control system thrusters. This paper summarizes the intense, collaborative efforts undertaken by the project to conserve hydrazine prior to Vesta departure, during cruise to Ceres, and throughout the Ceres mission. The project's efforts in minimizing the number of turns are discussed. A special emphasis is given to describing various efforts taken by the Attitude Control Subsystem team in an attempt to reduce hydrazine consumption. These efforts include: changing default slew rates, control gain tuning, changing nadir pointing strategy with Ahead Cross Nadir pointing, hybrid control implementation using hydrazine based thrusters and two remaining reaction wheels, optimal science turn location analysis, and reaction wheel angular momentum management strategies for reducing the number of momentum unloadings. In addition to the Attitude Control Subsystem team's efforts, the Mission Design and Navigation team's efforts taken in designing hydrazine friendly orbit transfers are discussed. The trade study performed collaboratively by the Attitude Control Subsystem team and the Science Operations Support Team in choosing hydrazine friendly off-nadir targets is also discussed. Various simulation results are presented and compared against actual flight data obtained. Lastly, remaining hydrazine status at the end of the prime Ceres mission and the hydrazine management planning for the extended mission are discussed.

On Earth, asteroid impacts have produced several near extinction level events. We tend to visualize these collisions as billiard balls hitting one another. But how, exactly, do they occur? The actual dynamics is much more complex and subtle because it is highly nonlinear and involves chaos in the Three-Body Problem. In this paper we investigate the effects of Lyapunov orbits, halo orbits, and their associated invariant manifolds, on the orbital motion of SL9. We demonstrate that periodic orbits act as gateways to Jupiter, and their invariant manifolds control the dynamics of SL9 during the Initial Capture Phase.

In that study, periodic orbits generated in simplified dynamical models were examined, leading to the identification of attractive characterization orbits. This paper furthers that study by analyzing the sensitivity of these periodic orbits when exposed to various perturbations. In particular, the issue of transferring the initial conditions to higher fidelity models and the characterization of the resulting behavior is explored in light of the underlying dynamics. The asteroid 2008 EV5 is selected as a test case.

ATMOSPHERIC MODELING USING ACCELEROMETER DATA DURING MARS ATMOSPHERE AND VOLATILE EVOLUTION (MAVEN) FLIGHT OPERATIONS	SPACEFLIGHT MECHANICS 2017, PTS I - IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	27th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting	FEB 05-09, 2017	San Antonio, TX	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft is a NASA orbiter designed to explore the Mars upper atmosphere, typically from 140 to 160 km altitude. MAVEN has performed several Deep Dip campaigns in which the orbit periapsis was lowered to an altitude range of 115 to 135 km. MAVEN accelerometer data were used during mission operations to estimate atmospheric parameters such as density, scale height, along-track gradients, and wave structures. These estimates were used to aid the MAVEN navigation team in planning maneuvers to raise and lower periapsis during Deep Dip operations. This paper describes the processes used to reconstruct atmosphere parameters from accelerometer data and presents comparisons between model and navigation-derived values.

These events potentially involve a propellant reducing flyby, a capture maneuver, and a subsequent set of flybys which reduce energy and set the orbital conditions necessary for a science campaign. This paper addresses the optimality, robustness, and flexibility of a design in the Jovian system with target conditions set by NASA's planned Europa Clipper Mission Concept. Robustness to spacecraft anomalies is achieved through the orbital design and not through propellant margin. The theoretical limits of the design space are derived before performing a broad trajectory search.

The spacecraft was set en route to Jupiter, and its Jupiter Orbit Insertion occurred on 2016-07-04 PST after a five-year cruise in deep space. The mission phase just prior to this large maneuver is called approach. As navigation team, we were responsible for precise orbit determination of the Juno spacecraft to ensure a successful orbit insertion. To evaluate the navigation performance, we employed the B-plane mapping, where the incoming hyperbolic velocity defines the plane perpendicular to it, and the time to go to hit the plane will directly map into the uncertainties of the target point. The B-plane is a convenient tool when assessing the navigation performance as it is not affected by non-linearities due to the gravitational pull of the targeted body. However, as the Jupiter Orbit Insertion approached we started to realize that the B-plane mapping uncertainties were significantly larger than expected. We found that the B-plane mapping time had tremendous influence on the covariance inflation in the B-plane. Because of the close approach distance during the Jupiter Orbit Insertion and the strong interaction with J(2) spherical harmonic coefficient, the Juno dynamics were too far from a Keplerian one assumed for the B-plane mapping. We first discuss the analytical approach of the B-plane mapping uncertainty and perform a numerical analysis to isolate the components of the Juno dynamics that cause the B-plane covariance inflation.

Thanks to a dynamically well-behaved spacecraft, the delivery of Juno to JOI was done largely with only a maneuver to setup an Earth gravity assist (EGA), an EGA, an EGA clean-up maneuver, and a JOI targeting maneuver. During the last several weeks of the approach to JOI, the dominant uncertainties in the predicted trajectory were from the Jupiter barycenter ephemeris. In this paper, we discuss the maneuver and orbit determination (OD) strategy for successfully arriving at JOI, the challenges of calculating a correction to the Jupiter barycenter ephemeris using only radiometric data types, and how the ephemeris estimates during approach to JOI compare to a post-JOI trajectory reconstruction.

Wein-berg's soft photon theorem is recast as Ward identities for infinitely many new nontrivial symmetries of the massless QED S-matrix, with one such identity arising for each propagation direction of the soft photon. These symmetries are identified as large gauge transformations with angle-dependent gauge parameters that are constant along the null generators of null infinity. Almost all of the symmetries are spontaneously broken in the standard vacuum and the soft photons are the corresponding Goldstone bosons. Our result establishes a relationship between soft theorems and asymptotic symmetry groups in any even dimension.

We study a challenging constrained matrix factorization problem in materials discovery, the so-called phase mapping problem. We introduce a novel "lazy" Iterative Agile Factor Decomposition (IAFD) approach that relaxes and postpones non-convex constraint sets (the lazy constraints), iteratively enforcing them when violations are detected. IAFD interleaves multiplicative gradient-based updates with efficient modular algorithms that detect and repair constraint violations, while still ensuring fast run times. Experimental results show that IAFD is several orders of magnitude faster and its solutions are also in general considerably better than previous approaches. IAFD solves a key problem in materials discovery while also paving the way towards tackling constrained matrix factorization problems in general, with broader implications for data science.

These applications include both links between spacecraft and links between spacecraft and ground. The Interagency Operation Advisory Group (IOAG) has stated that there is a strong business case for international cross support of spacecraft optical links. It further concluded that in order to enable cross support the links must be standardized. This paper will overview the history and structure of the space communications international standards body, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), that will develop the standards and provide an update on the proceedings of the Optical Communications Working Group within CCSDS. This paper will also describe the set of optical communications standards being developed and outline some of the issues that must be addressed in the next few years. The paper will address, in particular, the ongoing work on application scenarios for deep space to ground called High Photon Efficiency, for LEO to ground called Low Complexity, for inter-satellite and near Earth to ground called High Data Rate, as well as associated atmospheric measurement techniques and link operations concepts.

A 22 cm diameter flight laser transceiver (FLT) is being developed for space flight. The FLT will be designed to transmit an average laser power of 4W at 1550 nm and receive a weak 1064 nm laser signal (>100 femtowatts). Use of the Hale telescope at Palomar Mountain, CA, retrofitted with a photon-counting receiver to detect the downlink from space, is planned. The Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) at Table Mountain, CA will transmit a 1064 nm laser beacon to serve as a pointing reference for the FLT and support low-rate uplink data-rates. The DSOC FLT is part of the baseline payload for the Psyche mission spacecraft recently selected for flight by NASA, providing link demonstration opportunities during the mission cruise phase. Link demonstration opportunities at distances of approximately 0.1 to 2 astronomical units (AU) are expected. The DSOC system is being designed to support downlink data-rates of 0.2 to > 200 Mb/s and uplink data rates of approximately 1.6 kb/s. A status update of DSOC Project activities on flight and ground development will be summarized in this paper.

Several hundreds of CubeSats have already been successfully launched in the past few years and the number of announced launches grows every year. These platforms provide an easy access to space for universities and organizations which otherwise could not afford it. However, these spacecraft still rely on RF communications, where the spectrum is already crowded and cannot support the growing demand for data transmission to the ground. Lasercom holds the promise to be the solution to this problem, with a potential improvement of several orders of magnitude in the transmission capacity, while keeping a low size, weight and power. Between 2016 and 2017, The Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS), a joint institute of the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, brought together a group of space scientists and lasercom engineers to address the current challenges that this technology faces, in order to enable it to compete with RF and eventually replace it when high-data rate is needed. After two one-week workshops, the working group started developing a report addressing three study cases: low Earth orbit, crosslinks and deep space. This paper presents the main points and conclusions of these KISS workshops.

A two-way optical communications system could be modified to support ranging, and the laser signal emitted by a spacecraft could be tracked against background stars to perform plane-of-sky observables. We have been analyzing a number of deep-space navigation scenarios to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using optical communication systems for navigation. Our objectives were to evaluate the performance achievable with optical systems, and to study under what circumstances these systems could be sufficient to navigate the mission, reducing the requirements for radio systems to perhaps just to be a backup for emergency communications.

The traditional purpose is to detect the lack of conformance with respect to a formal specification. Numerous efforts in the field have focused on monitoring so-called parametric specifications, where events carry data, and formulas can refer to such. Since a monitor for such specifications has to store observed data, the challenge is to have an efficient representation and manipulation of Boolean operators, quantification, and lookup of data. The fundamental problem is that the actual values of the data are not necessarily bounded or provided in advance. In this work we explore the use of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) for representing observed data. Our experiments show a substantial improvement in performance compared to related work.

Versatile, ultra-low sample volume gas analyzer using a rapid, broad tuning ECQCL and a hollow fiber gas cell	NEXT-GENERATION SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGIES X	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Next-Generation Spectroscopic Technologies X	APR 10-11, 2017	Anaheim, CA	SPIE		Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR); spectroscopy; quantum cascade laser (QCL); hollow fiber optic waveguide; gas analysis; volatile organic compound (VOC)	SPECTROSCOPY	We describe a versatile mid-infrared (Mid-IR) spectroscopy system developed to measure the concentration of a wide range of gases with an ultra-low sample size. The system combines a rapidly-swept external cavity quantum cascade laser (ECQCL) with a hollow fiber gas cell. The ECQCL has sufficient spectral resolution and reproducibility to measure gases with narrow features (e.g., water, methane, ammonia, etc.), and also the spectral tuning range needed to measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs), (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons), sulfur compounds, chlorine compounds, etc. The hollow fiber is a capillary tube having an internal reflective coating optimized for transmitting the Mid-IR laser beam to a detector. Sample gas introduced into the fiber (e.g., internal volume = 0.6 ml) interacts strongly with the laser beam, and despite relatively modest path lengths (e.g., L similar to 3 m), the requisite quantity of sample needed for sensitive measurements can be significantly less than what is required using conventional IR laser spectroscopy systems. Example measurements are presented including quantification of VOCs relevant for human breath analysis with a sensitivity of similar to 2 picomoles at a 1 Hz data rate.

To this end, the variational time discretization for the geodesic interpolation proposed in [2] is picked up to define a discrete exponential map. For a given weakly differentiable initial image and a sufficiently small initial image variation it is shown how to compute a discrete geodesic extrapolation path in the space of images. The resulting discrete paths are indeed local minimizers of the corresponding discrete path energy. A spatial Galerkin discretization with cubic splines on coarse meshes for image deformations and piecewise bilinear finite elements on fine meshes for image intensity functions is used to derive a fully practical algorithm. The method is applied to real images and image variations recorded with a digital camera.

Within Sri Lanka alone, CKDu infections have led to the deaths of over 20,000 rural inhabitants over the last decade, and have caused a serious public health crisis. A likely cause of CKDu is water that is polluted with contaminants such as Arsenic, Cadmium and Lead. Evaporative techniques, such as Warka Water and Watercone generate potable water in the Sub- Saharan regions of Africa and have been proven to be cost effective. In the proposed device we plan to accelerate the evaporative process via sunlight with the use of a solar focus lens. The device consists of a water storage container, transparent conical lid, condensation surface and a collector for the purified water. To reduce the manufacturing cost, we have opted for the use of a vertical tank with integrated valves as our container. The device has been designed also with an emphasis on user friendliness; CKDu patients are physically weak and can't reach out to their relatives daily. In the testing stage, the proposed device was able to generate a sufficient amount of potable water. We have used a mathematical model and CFD analysis to validate the working concept of the device. The efficiency of the device is still to be improved. Key steps of the humanitarian mission were identified and will be carried out during the next phase of the project.

We compared biomarkers reconstructed from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP)-MRI in the hippocampus, cingulate cortex and corpus callosum using multi-shell dMRI. We found that NODDI's dispersion and MAP-MRI's anisotropy markers consistently changed over time, possibly indicating that these measures are sensitive to age-dependent neuronal demise due to amyloid accumulation. Conversely, we found that DTI's mean diffusivity, NODDI's isotropic volume fraction and MAP-MRI's restriction-related metrics all followed a two-step progression from 10 to 15 months, and from 15 to 24 months. This two-step pattern might be linked with a neuroinflammatory response that may be occurring prior to, or during microstructural breakdown. Using our approach, we are able to provide- for the first time-preliminary and valuable insight on relevant biomarkers that may directly describe the underlying pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease.

The TQFT can be formulated both in the continuum and on the lattice and generalizes Dijkgraaf-Witten theory by replacing a finite group by a finite 2-group. The basic field in this TQFT is a 2-connection on a principal 2-bundle. We classify topological actions for such theories as well as loop and surface observables. When the topological action is trivial, the TQFT is related to a Dijkgraaf-Witten theory by electric-magnetic duality, but in general it is distinct. We propose the existence of new phases of matter protected by higher symmetry.

Convergence of Incentive-Driven Dynamics in Fisher Markets	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL ACM-SIAM SYMPOSIUM ON DISCRETE ALGORITHMS			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)	JAN 16-19, 2017	Barcelona, SPAIN	ACM, SIAM, ACM Special Interest Grp Algorithms & Computat Theory, SIAM Activ Grp Discrete Math			PLAYERS MODELS; GUESSING GAMES; EQUILIBRIUM; STABILITY; COGNITION; BEHAVIOR	In both general equilibrium theory and game theory, the dominant mathematical models rest on a fully rational solution concept in which every player's action is a best-response to the actions of the other players. In both theories there is less agreement on suitable out of -equilibrium modeling, but one attractive approach is the level k model in which a level 0 player adopts a very simple response to current conditions, a level 1 player best-responds to a model in which others take level 0 actions, and so forth. (This is analogous to k-ply exploration of game trees in AI, and to receding-horizon control in control theory.) If players have deterministic mental models with this kind of finite-level response, there is obviously no way their mental models can all be consistent. Nevertheless, there is experimental evidence that people act this way in many situations, motivating the question of what the dynamics of such interactions lead to. We address the problem of out-of-equilibrium price dynamics in the setting of Fisher markets. We develop a general framework in which sellers have (a) a set of atomic price update rules which are simple responses to a price vector; (b) a belief-formation procedure that simulates actions of other sellers (themselves using the atomic price updates) to some finite horizon in the future. In this framework, sellers use an atomic price update rule to respond to a price vector they generate with the belief formation procedure. The framework is general and allows sellers to have inconsistent and time varying beliefs about each other. Under certain assumptions on the atomic update rules, we show that despite the inconsistent and time-varying nature of beliefs, the market converges to a unique equilibrium. (If the price updates are driven by weak-gross substitutes demands, this is the same equilibrium point predicted by those demands.) This result holds for both synchronous and asynchronous discrete-time updates. Moreover, the result is computationally feasible in the sense that the convergence rate is linear, i.e., the distance to equilibrium decays exponentially fast. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that demonstrates, in Fisher markets, convergence at any rate for dynamics driven by a plausible model of seller incentives. We then specialize our results to Fisher markets with elastic demands (a further special case corresponds to demand generated by buyers with constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utilities, in the weak gross substitutes (WGS) regime) and show that the atomic update rule in which a seller uses the best-response (=profit maximizing) update given the prices of all other sellers, satisfies the assumptions required on atomic price update rules in our framework. We can even characterize the convergence rate (as a function of elasticity parameters of the demand function). Our results apply also to settings where, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no previous demonstration of efficient convergence of any discrete dynamic of price updates. Even for the simple case of (level 0) best response dynamics, our result is the first to demonstrate a linear rate of convergence.

This work studies the benefit of cooperation in the multiple access channel with a cooperation facilitator, distributed state information at the encoders, and full state information available at the decoder. Under various causality constraints, sufficient conditions are obtained such that encoder cooperation through the facilitator results in a gain in sum-capacity that has infinite slope in the information rate shared with the encoders.

We apply our bound to study the rate distortion function under distortion measure vertical bar x - (x) over cap vertical bar(r) for sources that follow a log-concave probability distribution. In particular, we establish that the difference between the rate distortion function and the Shannon lower bound is at most log(root 2e) approximate to 1.9 bits, independently of r and the target distortion d. For mean-square error distortion, the difference is at most log root pi e approximate to 1.55 bits, regardless of d. Our results generalize to the case of vector X.

Polyanskiy's normal approximation combined with a linear model for the information gap of a rate-compatible code family provides a simple and accurate characterization of the behavior of feedback systems employing practical codes, such as convolutional or low-density parity-check codes. Especially for short message lengths on the order of k < 50 message bits, the newly proposed model is more accurate than Vakilinia's model in which the rate of first successful decoding has a Gaussian probability density function.

The main conceptual development builds firmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum method for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local operations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum privacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach has previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates, including the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here we use this approach along with a "privacy test" to establish a general meta-converse bound for private communication.

The shortening technique allows us to obtain secure EVENODD schemes of arbitrary lengths, which is important for practical application. We also construct a new secure RAID scheme from the STAR code. The scheme can tolerate 3 node failures and 3 eavesdropping nodes with optimal encoding/decoding and random access complexity.

In this work we propose a novel blind communication and deconvolution scheme by using Huffman sequences, which allows to solve three important tasks at once: (i) determination of the transmit power (ii) identification of the instantaneous discrete-time FIR channel if the channel delay is less than L/2 and (iii) simultaneously communicating L-1 bits of information. Our signal reconstruction uses a recent semi-definite program that can recover two unknown signals from their auto-correlations and cross-correlations. This convex algorithm shows numerical stability and operates fully deterministic without any further channel assumptions.

More specifically, for a cyclic Tamo-Barg code of length n, dimension k and locality r, we show how to deterministically construct a generator matrix where the number of nonzeros in any two columns differs by at most one, and where the weight of every row is d + r - 1, where d is the minimum distance of the code. Since LRCs are designed mainly for distributed storage systems, the results presented in this work provide a computationally balanced and efficient encoding scheme for these codes. The balanced property ensures that the computational effort exerted by any storage node is essentially the same, whilst the sparse property ensures that this effort is minimal. The work presented in this paper extends a similar result previously established for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, where it is now known that any cyclic RS code possesses a generator matrix that is balanced as described, but is sparsest, meaning that each row has d nonzeros.

We propose its use as a decoder in modern Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication systems with modulation methods such as the Generalized Space Shift Keying (GSSK) modulation, which produces constellation vectors that are inherently sparse and with bounded elements. In that direction, we prove novel explicit asymptotic characterizations of the squared-error and of the per-element error rate of the BOX-LASSO, under iid Gaussian measurements. In particular. the theoretical predictions can be used to quantity the improved performance of the BOX-LASSO, when compared to the previously used standard LASSO. We include simulation results that validate both these premises and our theoretical predictions.

Design of Improved Quasi-Cyclic Protograph-Based Raptor-Like LDPC Codes for Short Block-Lengths	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Aachen, GERMANY	IEEE			PARITY-CHECK CODES	Protograph-based Raptor-like low-density parity check codes (PBRL codes) are a recently proposed family of easily encodable and decodable rate-compatible LDPC (RC-LDPC) codes. These codes have an excellent iterative decoding threshold and performance across all design rates. PBRL codes designed thus far, for both long and short block-lengths, have been based on optimizing the iterative decoding threshold of the protograph of the RC code family at various design rates. In this work, we propose a design method to obtain better quasi-cyclic (QC) RC-LDPC codes with PBRL structure for short block-lengths (of a few hundred bits). We achieve this by maximizing an upper bound on the minimum distance of any QC-LDPC code that can be obtained from the protograph of a PBRL ensemble. The obtained codes outperform the original PBRL codes at short block-lengths by significantly improving the error floor behavior at all design rates. Furthermore, we identify a reduction in complexity of the design procedure, facilitated by the general structure of a PBRL ensemble.	[Ranganathan, Sudarsan V.

We recently proposed a novel framework called entropic causality that works in a very general functional model but makes the assumption that the unobserved exogenous variable has small entropy in the true causal direction. This framework requires the solution of a minimum entropy coupling problem: Given marginal distributions of m discrete random variables, each on n states, find the joint distribution with minimum entropy, that respects the given marginals. This corresponds to minimizing a concave function of n(m) variables over a convex polytope defined by n m linear constraints, called a transportation polytope. Unfortunately, it was recently shown that this minimum entropy coupling problem is NP-hard, even for 2 variables with n states. Even representing points (joint distributions) over this space can require exponential complexity (in n, m) if done naively. In our recent work we introduced an efficient greedy algorithm to find an approximate solution for this problem. In this paper we analyze this algorithm and establish two results: that our algorithm always finds a local minimum and also is within an additive approximation error from the unknown global optimum.

This reduction holds even for network coding instances that contain cycles, thereby proving the first known reduction from cyclic to finite acyclic network coding networks.

This study allows the application of tools from one area to the other. Furthermore, it leads to an information-theoretic formulation of the birthday problem, which is concerned with the probability that in a given population, a fixed number of people have the same birthday. Due to the lack of a closed-form expression for this probability when the distribution of birthdays is not uniform, the resulting computation is not feasible in some applications; the information-theoretic formulation, however, can be analyzed for all distributions.

More generally, an approximate Markov chain rho(ABC) is a state whose distance to the closest recovered state R-B -> BC (rho(AB)) is small. Recently it has been shown that this distance can be bounded from above by the conditional mutual information I(A : C vertical bar B)(rho) of the state. We improve on this connection by deriving the first hound that is tight in the commutative case and features an explicit recovery map that only depends on the reduced state rho(BC). The key tool in our proof is a multivariate extension of the Golden-Thompson inequality, which allows us to extend logarithmic trace inequalities from two to arbitrarily many matrices.

The estimator can be seen as a regularized maximum likelihood estimator for an exponential family where the natural parameter is assumed to be structured. For all such Bregman denoising estimators, we provide an error bound for a natural associated error measure. Our error bound makes it possible to analyze a wide range of estimators, such as those in proximal denoising and inverse covariance matrix estimation, in a unified manner. In the case of proximal denoising, we exactly recover the existing tight normalized mean squared error bounds. In sparse precision matrix estimation, our bounds provide optimal scaling with interpretable constants in terms of the associated error measure.

Currently deployed random access protocols attempt to avoid collisions, and target the performance of a scheduled multiple access system (a strategy known to be only suboptimal from the information-theoretic perspective). In contrast, in this paper, we allow collisions among the transmissions of different users. We consider code design for random access channels with erasures in which the number of users in each frame is unknown at the transmitters but known at the receiver, and we present. a two-layer coding architecture for joint contention resolution and erasure correction. For random LDPC codes based on this scheme, the density evolution is asymptotically analyzed, which enables optimized code design for maximized throughput with constrained outage. The results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity scheme approaches the outage capacity of the random access channel with erasures when the average number of active users is small.

Simultaneously, they have a deleterious effect on data stored using in-vivo DNA data storage. While duplications have been studied both as a sequence-generation mechanism and in the context of error correction, for simplicity these studies have not taken into account the presence of other types of mutations. In this work, we consider the capacity of duplication mutations in the presence of point-mutation noise, and so quantify the generation power of these mutations. We show that if the number of point mutations is vanishingly small compared to the number of duplication mutations of a constant length, the generation capacity of these mutations is zero. However, if the number of point mutations increases to a constant fraction of the number of duplications, then the capacity is nonzero. Lower and upper bounds for this capacity are also presented. Another problem that we study is concerned with the mismatch between code design and channel in data storage in the DNA of living organisms with respect to duplication mutations. In this context, we consider the uncertainty of such a mismatched coding scheme measured as the maximum number of input codewords that can lead to the same output.

They enable researchers and practitioners to transport information reliably, to apply a variety of tools to their problems, and to reproduce scientific results. Over the past two decades, a range of standards have been developed to facilitate the exchange and reuse of information in the domain of representation and modeling of biological systems. These standards are complementary, so the interactions between their developers increased over time. By the end of the last decade, the community of researchers decided that more interoperability is required between the standards, and that common development is needed to make better use of effort, time, and money devoted to this activity. The COmputational MOdeling in Biology NEtwork (COMBINE) was created to enable the sharing of resources, tools, and other infrastructure. This paper provides a brief history of this endeavor and the challenges that remain.

Reducing the thickness of this protective layer can result in additional performance gains by minimizing absorption losses, and provides a path toward high Al reflectance in the challenging wavelength range of 90 to 110 nm. We have pursued the development of new atomic layer deposition processes (ALD) for the metal fluoride materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. Using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as a reactant, these films can be deposited at the low temperatures required for large-area surface-finished optics and polymeric diffraction gratings. We also report on the development and application of an atomic layer etching (ALE) procedure to controllably etch native aluminum oxide. Our ALE process utilizes the same chemistry used in the ALD of AlF3 thin films, allowing for a combination of high-performance evaporated Al layers and ultrathin ALD encapsulation without requiring vacuum transfer. Progress in demonstrating the scalability of this approach, as well as the environmental stability of ALD/ALE Al mirrors are discussed in the context of possible future applications for NASA LUVOIR and HabEx mission concepts.

Long-period comet impact risk mitigation with Earth-based laser arrays	ASTRONOMICAL OPTICS: DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND TEST OF SPACE AND GROUND SYSTEMS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Astronomical Optics - Design, Manufacture, and Test of Space and Ground Systems	AUG 08-11, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		comets; high-powered lasers; phased-array optics; planetary defense	ASTEROIDS	Long-period comets (LPCs) frequently transit the inner solar system, and like near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), pose a continued risk of impact with Earth. Unlike NEAs, LPCs follow nearly parabolic trajectories and approach from the distant outer solar system where they cannot be observed. An LPC on an Earth-impact trajectory is unlikely to be discovered more than a few years in advance of its arrival, even with significant advancements in sky survey detection capabilities, likely leaving insufficient time to develop and deliver an interception mission to deflect the comet. However, recent proposals have called for the development of one or more large 1 km laser arrays placed on or near Earth primarily as a means for photon propulsion of low-mass spacecraft at delta-v above what would be feasible by traditional chemical or ion propulsion methods. Such a laser array can also be directed to target and heat a threatening comet, sublimating its ices and activating jets of dust and vapor which alter the comet's trajectory in a manner similar to rocket propulsion. Simulations of directed energy comet deflection were previously developed from astrometric models of nongravitational orbital perturbations from solar heating, an analogous process that has been observed in numerous comets. These simulations are used together with the distribution of known LPC trajectories to evaluate the effect of an operational Earth-based laser array on the LPC impact risk.

SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases have been developed to meet these demands and each offers unique benefits. SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases also rely on different underlying mathematical models. Polystores seek to provide a mechanism to allow applications to transparently achieve the benefits of diverse databases while insulating applications from the details of these databases. Integrating the underlying mathematics of these diverse databases can be an important enabler for polystores as it enables effective reasoning across different databases. Associative arrays provide a common approach for the mathematics of polystores by encompassing the mathematics found in different databases: sets (SQL), graphs (NoSQL), and matrices (NewSQL). Prior work presented the SQL relational model in terms of associative arrays and identified key mathematical properties that are preserved within SQL. This work provides the rigorous mathematical definitions, lemmas, and theorems underlying these properties. Specifically, SQL Relational Algebra deals primarily with relations - multisets of tuples - and operations on and between those relations. These relations can be modeled as associative arrays by treating tuples as non-zero rows in an array. Operations in relational algebra are built as compositions of standard operations on associative arrays which mirror their matrix counterparts. These constructions provide insight into how relational algebra can be handled via array operations. As an example application, the composition of two projection operations is shown to also be a projection, and the projection of a union is shown to be equal to the union of the projections.

Towards a Distributed Infrastructure for Data-Driven Discoveries & Analysis	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)	IEEE International Conference on Big Data		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data)	DEC 11-14, 2017	Boston, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ELSEVIER, CISCO				Big data analytics traditionally involves download of massive amounts of datasets to common server/cluster for processing. Analytic process gets slower with increasing size of required data and network conditions. Data scientists also need explicit access to data locations to download required data. Explicit access to required data may not always be granted due to security reasons. To simplify and accelerate the analytics process on distributed big data with security considerations, we proposed the Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI) for data driven discoveries. Instead of moving large amounts of data to a common place of processing, VIFI allows automatic transfer of required analytics programs to the distributed data locations for in-place processing of relevant data. VIFI allows data scientists to conduct and coordinate complex analytics processes on distributed data repositories using containerization technology and open-source workflow design tools.

Historically, data analysis required an analyst to move the data to the system computing the analysis. As the volume of data available increases, the storage, CPU, and memory requirements for this type of traditional analysis increases to a point that makes it impractical. The NEXUS approach is to remove this data movement, transform the data into a format convenient for analysis, and provide analytic functions that can be massively parallelized.

We propose an efficient massively-parallel implementation for selecting such optimal feature subsets in a brute-force fashion for small k. By exploiting the enormous compute power provided by modern parallel devices such as graphics processing units, it can deal with thousands of input dimensions even using standard commodity hardware only. We evaluate the practical runtime using artificial datasets and sketch the applicability of our framework in the context of astronomy.

As a result standard time series methods regularly used for financial and similar datasets are of little help and astronomers are usually left to their own instruments and techniques to classify light curves. A common approach is to derive statistical features from the time series and to use machine learning methods, generally supervised, to separate objects into a few of the standard classes. In this work, we transform the time series to two-dimensional light curve representations in order to classify them using modern deep learning techniques. In particular, we show that convolutional neural networks based classifiers work well for broad characterization and classification. We use labeled datasets of periodic variables from CRTS survey and show how this opens doors for a quick classification of diverse classes with several possible exciting extensions.

The hybrid method includes three steps: (1) calculating the generalized T matrix of every single object, (2) wave transformations and (3) solving Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations (FL). We utilize the commercial software HFSS to extract the T matrix of a single object. HFSS enables us to perform full wave simulations of single objects with complicated structures. To validate the T matrix extraction method, a sphere is used since it has analytical solutions for the T matrix. For wave transformations, we develop the robust numerical method, which is verified by the analytical solutions of spherical wave transformations. In solving FL, the wave interactions of the singles objects are taken into account. The results of the hybrid method agree with those of the HFSS brute force method. In comparison, the hybrid method is much more efficient than HFSS for vegetation scattering and applicable to large problems such as full wave simulations of a tree.

For these studies to be meaningful, the proteomics assays need to be sensitive, selective, accurate, and reproducible. This is often accomplished through a targeted approach, either using single or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) or, more recently, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). In PRM, the parallel detection of all product ions in a high-resolution mass spectrometer affords higher selectivity than SRM/MRM. PRM is thus better suited to analyze peptides larger than 2 kDa. Similar to SRM/MRM, PRM provides sensitive, accurate, and reproducible quantitative data. Here, we present a specific PRM method to characterize the effects of histone modifying enzyme drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC) on the posttranslational modifications of histones, in a quantitative manner. More specifically, we characterize the heavily modified N-terminal tail of histone H3 after treatment with the HDAC inhibitor butyric acid, and monitor the acetylation and methylation events after treatment. To take most advantage of the multiply charged N-terminal histone peptides that are generated by an endoproteinase GluC-digestion, we use electron transfer dissociation (ETD) as the method of MS/MS fragmentation. This provides high sequence coverage for the modified peptides. The methodology is not limited to HDAC inhibitors, and can be used for any modifying enzyme. In fact, it can even be expanded beyond histone analyses. To give guidance for the development of a PRM assay, we present here HDAC inhibited H3 histone N-terminal tails as an example.

Toward Benchmarking Locomotion Economy Across Design Configurations on the Modular Robot: AMBER-3M	2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS (CCTA 2017)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st Annual IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications	AUG 27-30, 2017	HI	IEEE, CSS, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, SICE			BIPEDAL WALKING; EFFICIENT; COST; SPEED; GAIT	Making conclusive performance comparisons of bipedal locomotion behaviors can be difficult when working with different robots. This is particularly true in the case of comparing energy economy, which is highly dependent on mechanical, electrical and control components. As a means of limiting these disparities in methodical testing, we built a modular bipedal robot platform, AMBER-3M. Three leg configurations were designed for this purpose: actuated flat foot, rigid point-foot, and compliant point-foot. As a proof of concept for the mechanical, electrical, and algorithmic modularity, we present walking experiments with all three AMBER-3M configurations, using the same control methods and experimental procedures. As a pilot study for investigating locomotion economy, we performed further systematic experiments of point-foot walking with the purpose of examining the effects of speed on the cost of transport (COT). We optimized 36 walking gaits for maximum locomotion economy at various transport velocities. Walking performance data was collected from these gaits spanning a speed range of 0.34 to 0.94 m/s. An apparent Pareto-optimal frontier was observed in the data, showing that mechanical cost of transport increases with speed; ranging from 0.22 up to 0.36. Conversely, the electrical cost of transport decreased at higher walking speeds.

This problem requires either agents to be distinguishable or some combinatorial optimization to be solved in order to find the most convenient target-to-agent assignment. However, in many applications or mission stages, group connectivity and collision free trajectories are in fact the only desired requirements, while the robots themselves are allowed to freely generate their spatial distribution. To this end, the simplest possible case corresponds to all agents trying to maintain the same relative scalar distance. However, since it is not possible to have more than d+1 equally separated points in a d-dimensional space, we investigate solutions where interagent distances are as close as possible to desired one. We introduce a quadratic potential proportional to the error from the desired distance and equilibrium with non-null potentials are investigated. Stability of the behavior resulting from our protocol is described using elements from rigidity theory and final results are presented in form of numerical simulations.

UCD was applied as a design process along with existing industry design guidelines and other design approaches. The goal of the evaluation study was to provide GE Power quantitative data on proposed benefits from the new HMI based on systematic design approaches compared to the legacy HMI product, developed by engineers with an ad hoc process. Compared to this Legacy HMI, the new AP HMI provides enhanced information architecture, simplified graphics and navigation, as well as improved alarm management allowing operators and plant maintenance personnel to focus on what is important. Nine operations staff from a power plant in France performed simulated tasks using both Legacy HMI as a baseline and AP HMI. We measured their performance and satisfaction on the use of HMI to quantify the enhanced effectiveness of AP HMI. AP HMI resulted in 33% higher success rate, 79% lower navigation time, 42% lower total time on task compared to Legacy HMI. Also, the user satisfaction for AP HMI was rated significantly higher than Legacy HMI.

HOM Writing, derived from Sutton Movement Writing and Shorthand [1], is a natural modality for encoding the movements that humans perform during various work activities. Beyond its use as a record of human movement, the intent is to use the writing as a modality of communicating to robots what movements to execute. Humanoid robots could directly map the key postures represented in the notation to their own postures, imitating the postures captured in the description, and calculating intermediate postures by interpolation. A motion generator would ensure the motor control needed to create continuous movements. This paper focuses on the generation of the activity movement scripts, and addresses two modalities of producing the scripts: 1) 'hand-coded' by a human, using an editor, and 2) automatic extraction from video, e.g. from video-recordings of a human performing an activity. A software tool developed to allow easy script writing, the HOM Editor, is described and illustrated in hand-coding of a sequence of movements. The automatic generation of scripts from video is done using the pose estimation system by Yang and Ramanan [2], which takes an image and produces the joint coordinates of the limb parts; this is illustrated with a task of moving and arranging chairs. The posture extraction from a video provided by a single camera may often lead to occlusions of body parts during activities in which objects are manipulated. We show the advantages of using an additional camera, which significantly increases the correct posture estimation, and discuss how to further improve the automatic generation of scripts.

Feasibility of Powerline Communications (PLC) on Future Spacecraft EMI/EMC Test Results on COTS PLC Technology	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY & SIGNAL/POWER INTEGRITY (EMCSI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility and Signal/Power Integrity (EMCSI)	AUG 07-11, 2017	Washington, DC	IEEE		powerline communications; electromagnetic compatibility; electromagnetic interference; smart cabling; cable harnessing; technology infusion; research and development; mass reduction		Cable harnessing mass continues to be a problem for spacecraft development, particularly with increasingly complex payloads and constraints to their mass and costs. As a strategic initiative to reduce cable harnessing on flight missions, NASA JPL's Powerline Communications (PLC) research and technology development (R&TD) effort investigates the ability to combine power and data onto the same cable conductors. Research and development of PLC technology, including testing of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) modules and design of custom PLC unit, aim to articulate the opportunity to infuse this technology into NASA flight projects. This paper illustrates the feasibility of Powerline Communications on future spacecraft through Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) testing on COTS PLC components including conducted emissions and susceptibility as well as radiated emissions and susceptibility.

RIMFAX will take radar soundings while the rover drives across the Martian terrain, which presents possible compatibility issues between rover and radar operations. In order to study this risk, a prototype RIMFAX antenna was attached to the flight-analogous rover Vehicle System Test Bed (VSTB) in a mechanically representative location. The prototype antenna collected spectral and time-domain data across a variety of driving operations in order to assess the radar sensitivity to rover generated noise. Conversely, the prototype antenna was driven while an engineering-model UHF antenna used for rover telecom measured received in-band power to ensure that the rover hardware was not at risk of damage. Evaluation of the data by the instrument science team showed that while rover noise was apparent to the receiver, data post-processing would yield >40 dB margin to the science requirements. Similarly, power levels received by the UHF antenna were well below damage thresholds.

Drawing on the existing framework for inferring topology and admittances of a power network from voltage and current phasor measurements, this paper proposes an online algorithm for event detection and localization in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. Using a convex relaxation and a matrix partitioning technique, the proposed algorithm is capable of identifying topology changes and attributing them to specific categories of events. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated on a standard test distribution feeder with synthesized loads, and it is shown that a tripped line can be detected and localized in an accurate and timely fashion, highlighting its potential for real world applications.

To determine the charging rates in each control period, OLP solves a linear program based only on EVs currently in the charging facility, assuming no future EV arrivals. We prove that OLP achieves the offline optimal where all future EV arrivals are assumed to be known in advance, provided the cost coefficients are uniformly monotone. For general cost functions, we prove that the competitive ratio is upper bounded by the variability in the cost coefficients. We demonstrate the performance of OLP using real charging data from Google and Caltech's Adaptive Charging Network.

We propose a novel ultra-low power all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) based potentiostat architecture for electrochemical sensing. The system is wirelessly powered by near-field RF coupling of an on-chip antenna to an external coil at 915 MHz. Bi-directional wireless telemetry supports data transmission from the sensor to the external reader (uplink) via backscattering, and reconfiguration of the sensor chip over the RF downlink. The 1.2x1.2 mm(2) prototype is fabricated in TSMC 65nm CMOS process. The potentiostat achieves a 100pA sensitivity over a full scale current range of 0-350nA. The total power consumption of the system is 4 mu W.

The ground space connectivity problem asks whether it is possible to go from one (efficiently preparable) state to another by applying a polynomial length sequence of 2-qubit unitaries while remaining at all times in a state with low energy for a given Hamiltonian H. It was shown in [GS15] that this problem is QCMA-complete for general local Haniiltorlians, where QCMA is defined as QMA with a classical witness and BQP verifier. Here we show that the commuting version of the problem is also QCMA-complete. This provides one of the first examples where commuting local Hamiltonians exhibit complexity theoretic hardness equivalent to general local Hamiltonians.

Majority of the photoacoustic imaging systems are based on time-domain pulsed photoacoustic method, which utilizes pulsed laser source to induce wideband photoacoustic signal revealing optical absorption contrast. An alternative way is frequency-domain photoacoustic method utilizing chirping modulation of laser intensity to achieve lower system cost. In this paper, we report another way of photoacoustic method, called phase-domain photoacoustic sensing, which explores the phase difference between two consequent intensity-modulated laser pulses induced photoacoustic measurements to reveal the optical property. The basic principle is introduced, modelled and experimentally validated in this paper, which opens another potential pathway to perform photoacoustic sensing and imaging eliminating acoustic detection variations beyond the conventional time-domain and frequency-domain photoacoustic methods.

CMDA provides tools to diagnostically analyze climate data for model validation and improvement, and to systematically manage analysis provenance for sharing results with other investigators. CMDA utilizes cloud computing resources, multi-threading computing, machine-learning algorithms, web service technologies, and provenance-supporting technologies to address technical challenges that the Earth science modeling and model analysis community faces in evaluating and diagnosing climate models. As CMDA technology and infrastructure have matured, we have developed the educational and scientific applications of CMDA. Educationally, CMDA supported the summer school of the JPL Center for Climate Sciences in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In the summer school, the students work on group research projects where CMDA provide datasets, analysis tools, and provenance support utility tools. Each student is assigned to a virtual machine with CMDA installed in Amazon Web Services. Scientifically, we have developed several science use cases of CMDA covering various topics, datasets, and analysis types. Each of the science use cases is described in terms of a scientific goal, datasets used, the analysis tools used, scientific results discovered, an analysis result such as output plots and data files, and a link to the corresponding analysis service call with all the input arguments filled.

Maximally Economic Sparse Arrays and Cantor Arrays	2017 IEEE 7TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMPUTATIONAL ADVANCES IN MULTI-SENSOR ADAPTIVE PROCESSING (CAMSAP)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	DEC 10-13, 2017	Curacao, NETH ANTILLES	IEEE		Symmetric arrays; sparse arrays; hole-free difference coarrays; maximally economic arrays; Cantor arrays	DEFINITE TOEPLITZ COMPLETION; LINEAR ANTENNA-ARRAYS; DOA ESTIMATION; AUGMENTABLE ARRAYS; DESIGN	Sparse arrays, where the sensors are properly placed with nonuniform spacing, are able to resolve more uncorrelated sources than sensors. This ability arises from the property that the difference coarray, defined as the differences between sensor locations, has many more consecutive integers (hole-free) than the number of sensors. In some implementations, it might be preferable that a) the arrays be symmetric, b) that the arrays be maximally economic, that is, each sensor be essential, and c) that the coarray be hole-free. The essentialness property of a sensor means that if it is deleted, then the difference coarray changes. Existing sparse arrays, such as minimum redundancy arrays (MRA), nested arrays, and coprime arrays do not satisfy these three criteria simultaneously. It will be shown in this paper that Cantor arrays meet all the desired properties mentioned above, based on a comprehensive study on the structure of the difference coarray. Even though Cantor arrays were previously proposed in fractal array design, their coarray properties have not been studied earlier. It will also be shown that the Cantor array has a hole-free difference coarray of size N-log2 (3) approximate to N-1.585 where N is the number of sensors. This is unlike the sizes of difference coarrays of the MRA, nested array, coprime array (all (O(N-2)), and uniform linear arrays (O(N))(1).	[Liu, Chun-Lin; Vaidyanathan, P.

Monotonicity Properties and Spectral Characterization of Power Redistribution in Cascading Failures	2017 55TH ANNUAL ALLERTON CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION, CONTROL, AND COMPUTING (ALLERTON)	Annual Allerton Conference on Communication Control and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	55th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	OCT 03-06, 2017	Monticello, IL	Coordinated Sci Lab, Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, IEEE, IEEE Informat Theory Soc, IEEE Control Syst Soc			MODEL; NETWORKS; GRAPHS	In this work, we apply spectral graph theory methods to study the monotonicity and structural properties of power redistribution in a cascading failure process. We demonstrate that in contrast to the lack of monotonicity in physical domain, there is a rich collection of monotonicity one can explore in the spectral domain, leading to a systematic way to define topological metrics that are monotonic. It is further shown that many useful quantities in cascading failure analysis can be unified into a spectral inner product, which itself is related to graphical properties of the transmission network. Such graphical interpretations precisely capture the Kirchhoff's law expressed in terms of graph structural properties and gauge the impact of a line when it is tripped. We illustrate that our characterization leads to a tree-partition of the network so that failure cascading can be localized.

Moreover, the resulting synthesis problem is convex. In this paper we provide minimal state space realizations for both the state and output feedback controllers. It is also shown that (for fixed n) the state dimension of the controllers grows linearly with FIR filter horizon length - in both cases, we show that if the underlying transfer matrices are structured, so is the corresponding state-space realization. For the H-2 state feedback case a simple decomposition technique reduces the synthesis problem to solving a set of lower dimensional LQR problems that can be solved in parallel.

We discuss the plans to leverage SnowEx for calibration, in particular characterizing potential biases due to interferometric penetration into the snow-cover by comparison with lidar and in situ measurements.

It is designed to measure the soil moisture over land using a combined active / passive L-band system. Due to the Aquarius mission, L-band model functions for ocean winds and salinity are already mature and may be directly applied to the SMAP mission. In contrast to Aquarius, the higher resolution and scanning geometry of SMAP allows for wide-swath ocean winds and salinities to be retrieved. We have found that the SMAP radiometer displays sensitivity all the way up to the most extreme wind speeds, possibly as high as 70 m/s, far beyond what is capable with typical C and Ku-band ocean wind scatterometers.

The model leverages sparsity in signals and is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing. It is based on the basic principles of regularization and data fidelity with certain constraints using modern methods in variational optimization -namely total variation (TV), both L-1 and L-2 fidelity, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The main algorithm in this paper, TV-L-1, uses sparsity promoting energy functionals to achieve two important imaging effects. The TV term maintains boundary sharpness of content in the underlying clean image, while the L-1 fidelity allows for the equitable removal of stripes without over-or under-penalization, providing a more accurate model of presumably independent sensors with unspecified and unrestricted bias distribution. A comparison is made between the TV-L-1 and TV-L-2 models to exemplify the qualitative efficacy of an L-1 striping penalty. The model makes use of novel minimization splittings and proximal mapping operators, successfully yielding more realistic destriped images in very few iterations.

Since both missions provide Low Earth Orbit observation at the same frequency, inter-calibration of brightness temperatures measured from these two missions leading to a consistent Tb record is critical in order to have consistent and reliable science datasets. For a radiometer, stability testing and drift monitoring of measured brightness temperature are often performed by comparing measured Tb with estimated Tb using in-situ temperature measurement and/or higher frequency microwave observations. Therefore having one additional reference Tb measured by another radiometer will help characterize and calibrate a radiometer with higher accuracy and benefit both missions.

The formulation is based on the PMCHWT surface integral equation which uses separate for air and ocean permittivities. The Sparse Matrix Canonical Grid (SMCG) is used to compute Method of Moments (MoM) solutions in conjunction with Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions with the surface electric field and surface magnetic field as the unknowns. Surface sizes used are up to 64 wavelengths by 64 wavelengths. Isotropic sea surfaces simulated using the Durden-Vesecky spectrum are studied for wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 10 m/s and incidence angles varying from 29 degrees to 46 degrees. Backscattering from NMM3D and composite two-scale model computations are compared with Aquarius satellite scatterometer estimates. Unlike the two-scale model, NMM3D does not impose separation between large scale roughness and small scale roughness elements. Results show that, in spite of using just the isotropic DV spectrum, NMM3D are in measurably better agreement with data than the composite surface model for co-polarized returns as well as the polarization ratio.

Because wetlands are often difficult to observe in situ, remote sensing is the only viable way to map wetland extent globally. However, current remote sensing methods suffer limitations in capturing wetland extent, and more importantly, wetland dynamics at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. GNSS-Reflectometry could help fill the current observation gap, as experimental data show that ground-reflected GNSS signals are very sensitive to changes in inundated areas. Furthermore, because this technique only requires a custom developed receiver and antenna system, a constellation of such instruments can potentially be launched at relatively low cost, providing global observations at sub-daily intervals. One challenge remains, however, which is quantitatively formulating the geophysical product of reflections over the land surface in various states of inundation. Here, we use a novel reflection dataset, derived from the SMAP radar receiver, to elucidate the sensitivity of reflections to small land surface features and their seasonal variations. Additionally, we quantify the dynamic range of reflections over both open and closed wetlands, and suggest an algorithm for wetland type classification.

Despite their importance in the seasonal and regional terrestrial water cycle, SWE is currently poorly characterized in space and time. We develop a method for observations of these parameters using P-band signals of opportunity (SoOp) concept to measure the SWE. Effect of wet snow on the measurement is analyzed through modeling and it is found that for wet snow, the phase of the SoOp measurement becomes correlated to snow depth while for dry snow, phase is correlated to the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). In addition, qualitative data analysis from two different site for a proof-of-concept experiment is shown in this paper.

FULL WAVE SIMULATION OF SNOWPACK APPLIED TO MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING OF SEA ICE	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		Snow on sea ice; microwave remote sensing; fully coherent model; backscattering enhancement; coherent layer effects	SCATTERING	A fully coherent snowpack scattering and emission model is developed by numerically solving Maxwell's equations over the entire snowpack on a bottom half-space. The scattering matrix of the snowpack is directly obtained including both amplitude and phase. Both bistatic scattering coefficients and brightness temperatures of the snowpack are derived from full wave simulations. Simulation results demonstrate backscattering enhancement effects and coherent thin layer effects. The model is applied to study microwave signatures of the Arctic sea ice where the snow cover thickness has rapidly decreased. Microwave signatures are important in classification of sea-ice types and in quantitative characterization of snow cover properties. Both have strong impacts on the thermodynamics of sea ice. In the fully coherent model, a half-space dyadic Green's function is used in the volume integral equation to represent the effects of the underlying sea ice. Discrete dipole approximation is used to solve the volume integral equations, where parallel fast Fourier transform technique is utilized to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplications. The snowpack is represented as a bicontinuous medium. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the two horizontal dimensions to simulate an infinite lateral extent of the snowpack.

Supporting NASA SnowEx Remote Sensing Strategies and Requirements for L-Band Interferometric Snow Depth and Snow Water Equivalent Estimation	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		snow; differential interferometry; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); water resources	SLOPE	The objectives of this research are to (1) address remote sensing strategies and requirements for estimating snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) using existing L-Band interferometric data sets in coordination with field-based observations and modeling frameworks and, with this information, (2) inform the Next Generation Cold Land Processes Experiment (SnowEx) toward articulating the appropriate science and research questions for a single motivating science plan. As proposed, SnowEx is a multi-year airborne snow campaign with a primary goal of exploring multi-modal sensor observations in coordination with field campaigns to inform the next generation snow remote sensing satellite platform. Based on limitations of satellite-based optical and LiDAR instruments operating in regions of the globe with consistent cloud-cover, the fact that many snow-dominated regions are at more northerly latitudes (limited solar illumination in the middle of winter), and these snow-dominated regions often experience periods of prolonged cloud cover (due to synoptic precipitation events), a microwave remote sensing platform may be the most viable path to space for a dedicated snow remote sensing mission. Specifically, L-Band radar interferometry has shown some unique promise with an archive of historical and contemporary satellite collections from JAXA's PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 instruments, respectively. Moreover, with the expected NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission launch in 2020 and the unprecedented availability of dedicated global interferometric L-Band products every 12-days, as well as what is in essence a NISAR airborne simulator in JPL's UAVSAR platform, the L-Band interferometric approach to estimating snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) requires further investigation within the context of in-situ observations and modeling frameworks.

The ASO flies a scanning lidar and imaging spectrometer to measure snow depth and albedo. For the SnowEx snow-free campaign, the ASO surveys produced high-resolution digital surface models of the underlying terrain with full-waveform laser returns. These data will be used to calculate snow depths during subsequent winter surveys, and provide insight to the impact of forest canopy structure on snow accumulation and melt.

Based on theoretical modeling, the wave propagation constant in the snow is proportional to the snow density. It is shown that the phase change of reflected signal from snowpack has a quasi-linear dependence on SWE. The model has been extended to multilayer to accommodate the various vertical snow profiles. In addition, the P-band reflectivity is also sensitive to the change of root zone soil moisture. In the paper, we also shown the reflectivity calculated using coherent wave approach has excellent sensitivity to the change of soil moisture for moderate range of incidence angles. In order to validate the theoretical results, a proof of concept ground-based experiment is conducted at Fraser, CO since 2015.

The composition and properties of marine slicks dampens the short-wave field by both suppression of wave growth and increase in wave dissipation, through an increase in surface tension and a reduction in wind friction. There are, however, clear complications related to SAR marine slick detection. The first problem is that marine slicks may be confused on SAR imagery with areas of low wind and other low-backscatter ocean features such as air-sea temperature differences, rain, and freshwater plumes. The second problem is that there are two primary forms of marine slicks, one composed of biogenic material and the other related to mineral oils from natural seeps or oil spills largely from anthropogenic-related hazards. Biogenic oils, often called surface active agents or surfactants and/or natural films, occur in a thin monolayer and are highly viscoelastic oils that are a by-product of ocean plant and animal growth. Surfactants readily accumulate in convergent zones by internal waves and current/eddy fields, but are mixed into the upper ocean and rapidly disperse and disappear under windy conditions. The conundrum of detecting and isolating spilled mineral oil from biogenic films and other ocean forms of low backscatter areas has long been recognized by Werner Alpers, his students, and colleagues, and continues to this day. This rich experimental and theoretical legacy, largely focused on the use of radar and SAR, took on steam in the 1980s and continues to this day. This includes laboratory experiments, detailed examination of the properties of both mineral and biogenic slicks and the dampening effects on radar scattering, collection of radar and SAR imagery from ocean platforms, aircraft, the space shuttle, and satellites. The complications and difficulties of this seemingly relative simple notion of separating biogenic films and mineral oil, including as these materials interact with wind, waves, and currents and the use of all sorts of radar frequencies and polarizations collecting data from all over the world, continues to prove challenging in identifying a reliable methodology. In this study, we will review the past efforts of Professor Alpers and his continued influence on current efforts to clearly identify mineral oil and its properties within the vagaries of the ocean environment.

We conjecture that the results obtained from previous analyses of spaceborne polarimetric SAR data, which seem to show differences in the scattering mechanism between radar scattering from mineral oil films and biogenic slicks, result from instrument noise. Measurements carried out with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) of NASA/JPL, which has an extremely low noise floor, confirm this view and show that Bragg scattering theory applies also for scattering from mineral oil films. However, measured differences in the statistics of the radar backscattering from mineral oil films and biogenic slicks, may be real and not noise-related.

NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission, launched in January 2015, provides global retrievals of FT state every two to three days. Validating SMAP FT observations with in-situ observations is difficult due to the substantial scale mismatch between a point estimate and a satellite footprint, inducing "representativeness errors" in the in-situ observations. Triple collocation (TC) is a validation technique that addresses this problem by combining estimates from in-situ, model and spaceborne estimates to obtain error estimates for all three products, without assuming that any product is error-free. Unfortunately, it fails when applied to binary or categorical variables, such as landscape FT state. In this study, we use a new variant of TC - categorical triple collocation (CTC) - that can be applied to binary variables, to validate the SMAP FT product across northern land regions (> 45N).

In this paper, we developed a new floodwater detection algorithm based on SAR backscattered intensity using pre- and post-flood data observed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2, which provided very high-spatial-resolution L-band SAR images (PALSAR-2 SM1, 2.5 m spatial resolution) in the case of the Kinu River flood. With this algorithm, we first classified land use types in order to analyze the characterization of urban land surface backscatters. Change detection was then conducted for the pilot area using correlation coefficients based on differences in the magnitude of the backscattering intensity derived from building orientation before and right after the flood.

However, currently the resolution of passive microwave retrieved soil moisture is low. To solve this problem, a soil moisture disaggregation algorithm based on thermal inertia relationship between daily temperature change and average soil moisture modulated by vegetation conditions has been formulated. This algorithm was applied to the SMAP (Soil Moisture Active/Passive) to produce the 1 km downscaled soil moisture over the SMAPVEX15 (SMAP Validation Experiment 2015). The disaggregated soil moisture has been compared to in situ observations and the results of this approach are very encouraging.

But, radar and radiometer receivers have yet to be integrated in an optimized manner for spaceborne systems. Fast sampling analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have been evolving to where we can consider in the 2025 time frame digitizing broad IF signals containing the desired radar signal, natural brightness emission and extraneous man-made RF signals (e.g. RFI) which can then be distributed and processed by radar and radiometer specific digital processors. In this way, a common RF front-end architecture can interface with an agile re-configurable backend and can be used across several systems (e.g. small, large class sensors). In this study, we designed and demonstrated a multipurpose receiver that can serve both the needs for the radar and radiometer, first focusing on Ka band.

Stress depends on the vector difference between wind and current. Using the unique capability of the scatterometer in measuring stress, we demonstrated that the effect of ocean surface stress associated with mesoscale eddies in spinning down the ocean eddies. The location of the stress centers is aligned with the temperature (buoyancy) centers at the surface. As we move away from the surface, other forces (pressure gradient) become increasingly important, and the wind centers are displaced from the surface stress centers, causing differences in wind and stress forcing of the ocean.

It uses image segmentation to spatio-temporally cluster the study region based on meteorological and land cover similarity, followed by a support vector machine based regression that computes the value of the high-resolution TB at all pixels. High resolution remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, soil texture, and land-cover were used for disaggregation. The algorithm was implemented in Iowa, United States, from May to September 2016, and compared with the field observations of TB from Microwave Water and Energy Balance Experiment conducted as a part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAPVEX16-MicroWEX). Additionally, they were also compared with the Sentinel downscaled SMAP TB at 1km. High resolution soil moisture is subsequently derived from high resolution TB using inverse models.

Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band can capture spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture in the landscape. Both ESA and NASA have launched L-band radiometers, in the form of the SMOS and SMAP satellites respectively, to monitor soil moisture globally, every 3-day at about 40 km resolution. However, their coarse scale restricts the range of applications. While SMAP included an L-band radar to downscale the radiometer soil moisture to 9 km, the radar failed after 3 months and this initial approach is not applicable to developing a consistent long term soil moisture product across the two missions anymore. Existing optical-, radiometer-, and oversampling-based downscaling methods could be an alternative to the radar-based approach for delivering such data. Nevertheless, retrieval of a consistent high resolution soil moisture product remains a challenge, and there has been no comprehensive inter-comparison of the alternate approaches. This research undertakes an assessment of the different downscaling approaches using the SMAPEx-4 field campaign data.

SMAP brightness temperature observations were compared with SMOS observations at 40 degrees incidence angle. The brightness temperatures from the two missions are not consistent and have a bias of about 2.7K over land with respect to each other. SMAP and SMOS missions use different retrieval algorithms and ancillary datasets which result in further inconsistencies between the soil moisture products. The reprocessed constant-angle SMOS brightness temperatures were used in the SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithm to develop a consistent multi-satellite product. The integrated product will have an increased global revisit frequency (1 day) and period of record that would be unattainable by either one of the satellites alone.

SMAP SSS achieved accuracy of 0.2 PSU on a monthly basis in comparison with Argo gridded data in the tropics and mid-latitudes. In tropical oceans, time series comparison of salinity measured at 1 m by moored buoys indicates that SMAP can track large salinity changes occurred within a month. Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from assessment of satellite retrieval. The resulting SMAP-buoy matchup analysis leads to an average standard deviation of 0.22 PSU and correlation coefficient of 0.73 on weekly scale; the average standard deviation reduced to 0.17 PSU and the correlation improved to 0.8 on monthly scale. SMAP L3 daily maps reveals salty water intrusion from the Arabian Sea into the Bay of Bengal during the Indian summer monsoon, consistent with the daily measurements collected from floats deployed during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project field campaign. In the Mediterranean Sea, the spatial pattern of SSS from SMAP is confirmed by the ship-based TSG data.

Several previous studies have shown success in using ground-reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals as a form of bistatic radar to sense soil moisture. However, the ability of this type of data to sense soil moisture variations from space is still a nascent field of study. In the past two years, three satellites have been launched that were either designed to capture ground-reflected GNSS signals or have been modified to record these signals. The data provided by these satellites are giving scientists an unprecedented opportunity to investigate their ability to detect changes in Earth's land surface, including but certainly not limited to near-surface soil moisture. This paper will present spaceborne observations of ground-reflected GNSS signals and evaluate their sensitivity to near-surface soil moisture. This sensitivity will be compared to empirical and theoretical sensitivities of monostatic L-band radar measurements to soil moisture. We will also comment on possibilities for retrieval algorithm development, using techniques employed for monostatic radar as a guide.

In a recent report, the National Research Council developed a "value framework" for Earth observing systems with a focus on prioritizing NASA observations that merit long-term continuity. In this paper, we refer to this framework to discuss how high value observations arise from opportunistic use of signals generated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS. The increasing number of GNSS constellations internationally, likely to be permanently deployed, suggests that the geosciences community will benefit by adopting these signals for a variety of remote sensing needs. We describe recent progress in using these observations scientifically and developing technology to exploit them. We conclude that dedicated constellations of GNSS science instruments in low Earth orbit capable of receiving both direct and reflected GNSS signals will provide excellent science return in a broad range of areas, and constitute a high value Earth observing system.

It can also provide important information about the wave field, leading to development of more realistic wave models and therefore improving forecasts of wave setup and overtopping processes. Satellite altimeters have a long history of mapping the variability of the Earth's open ocean. However, this is not the case for coastal areas because of the limitations of technology and difficulties in processing and interpretation of data near coastal surface (due land contamination and rapid variations due to tides and atmospheric effects). There is, therefore, a need for more accurate Sea Surface Height (SSH) near coastal areas. Bistatic altimetry using signals of opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital communication signals) may provide additional measurements in coastal areas through oblique incidence angles and high bandwidth (400 MHz). In this study, we investigate the capabilities of SoOp technique for coastal altimetry from spaceborne platforms.

This has basic architectural implications when one is designing a system to observe any particular atmospheric effect. We performed a study exploring the parameter space of low earth orbit constellations designed to retrieve temporal signatures, examining temporal resolution, constellation revisit time, regional coverage, spatial resolution, and data latency among other parameters, and assessed the results for mission cost, feasibility and technology maturity. We present the study results and discuss the implications for architectural trades particularly as they pertain to choices of geostationary versus low earth orbiting systems.

To address this need, the conically scanning Tropospheric Water and Cloud ICE (TWICE) millimeter and sub-millimeter radiometer instrument is being developed. A low-noise, power-efficient command and data handling (C&DH) subsystem has been designed to control TWICE data acquisition and other subsystems. The C&DH prototype board meets functional, noise and size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for deployment in a 6U-class satellite. Considering the limited power resources available on such platforms, a highly-efficient power regulation board has been designed to minimize power losses and reduce system noise. Furthermore, all of the components have been tested for radiation tolerance in low-Earth orbit.

Still, it has been little used due to the scarcity of long-term time-series of lidar measurements. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) is a landscape-level monitoring system that provides ongoing remote sensing measurements with high temporal resolution over large mountainous areas to quantify snow volume and dynamics. ASO collects multi-year low-resolution lidar data (similar to 1.5 pt/m(2)) with a nominal weekly frequency up to 12 times a year. In this work, we present a new method to automatically register ASO weekly low-resolution forest lidar point clouds in order to calculate spatially consistent datasets (similar to 18 pt/m(2)) adapted to fine scale forestry studies. Our method is tested using 12 lidar datasets acquired over the Tuolumne River Basin (California) in the spring and summer of 2014. On average, the ASO lidar system provides accurate measurements in terms of geolocation (0.38m and 0.12m for the horizontal and vertical dimension, respectively) but some datasets are biased up to 1.38m and 0.53m, respectively. Our registration method successfully corrected for systematic bias improving the 3D geometry of forest point clouds.

Recent improvements in remote sensing technologies and atmospheric / land surface models provides new approaches for assessing the HMA cryosphere.

In previous work, repeat-pass SAR interferometry from spaceborne sensors is utilized to create large-scale forest height maps based on a newly developed approach. This paper thus serves as a summary paper and also sheds light on the future directions with improved results. In particular, it will be shown that repeat-pass SAR interferometry is able to create a large-scale (11.6 million hectares) forest height mosaic product with RMSE <= 4 m for forest stands on the order of 6 hectares over both the flat and mountainous areas in New England, US through using the past and current spaceborne repeat-pass InSAR observations (i.e. JAXA's ALOS-1 and ALOS-2) combined with sparse airborne lidar training samples (44,000 hectares). Moreover, the results and performance of this approach can be remarkably improved with several enhancement techniques that can be easily satisfied with the use of future spaceborne repeat-pass InSAR and lidar missions (e.g. NASA-ISRO's NISAR and NASA's GEDI). The methodology described in this paper can be considered as a complimentary tool to the existing PolInSAR technique when single-pass full/dual-pol data are not available and/or the underlying topography is complicated.

The full wave approach for solving Maxwell equations is based on the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations (FL) combined with the Method of Moments for bodies of revolution (BOR). The accuracy of the method FL-BOR is first validated by comparing with the results from the commercial software HFSS for the two and five cylinders' cases. Next, the transmission through a vegetation canopy of cylindrical scatterers is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation where the cylinders, as many as 500, are generated in each realization and the scattering is solved by FL-BOR with exact solutions of the matrix equation. The results of transmission at C-band are compared with those from the distorted Born approximation (DBA) where the attenuation rate < K-e > is computed using Foldy's approximation. In NMM3D simulations, the transmission is calculated without the need of defining or calculating the attenuation rate. Two cases are studied: (a) short cylinders where the cylinder lengths are much smaller than the layer thickness and are randomly distributed in 3D in the vegetation layer, and (b) long cylinders where the cylinder lengths are the same as the thickness of the vegetation layer. Case (b) represents several vegetation types and also part of other vegetation types. The results of case (b) show there are significant differences of transmission, as much as 6 dB, from that of DBA.

Of particular interest is in the cold & fresh water where large SSS retrieval errors exist in comparison with Argo data. We found systematic SST dependence in Aquarius radar backscatter sigma(o) and radiometer excess emissivity Delta e, with the emissivity of specular surface estimated using collocated HYCOM SSS and NCEP or SSMI/S wind. In the cold water under medium to high wind, so and Delta e show opposite trend on SST: sigma(o) reduces while Delta e enhances by more than 10% relative to their corresponding values at the reference SST (15 degrees C). The geographical distribution of matchups with SST<5 degrees C & wind speed between 5-20 m s(-1) show that data collected under these conditions are coincident with the area where dSSS (= SSS-S-Argo) is largely positive. This is consistent with the SST trend observed in sigma(o), which would result in overestimation in roughness if the SST effect not considered. However, the enhanced Delta e in cold water is puzzling because it would cause even higher value for SSS retrieval if modeled as roughness. SSS retrieved with SST correction reduces bias but results on error improvement is mixed. We hypothesis there is an unknown defect in the dielectric constant model for cold water and propose an empirical correction for the Aquarius SSS retrieval.

Applying this methodology it is possible to retrieve SSS values in marginal seas or cold waters where the operational retrieval does not. Another important improvement is the possibility of defining a SMOS-based climatology to characterize spatial biases. Recently, using data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, JPL has started to produce a new 9-km resolution T-B product. The existence of such product offers the possibility of increasing the spatial resolution and quality of the mentioned SMOS SSS product using fusion techniques. The aim of this work is to produce high resolution SSS maps in marginal seas derived from the fusion of SMAP 9-km T-B and SMOS non-Bayesian debiased SSS products.

Each observatory carries a 4-channel bistatic wind scatterometer receiver. Measurements of the ocean surface scattering cross section are converted to 10 meter-referenced wind speed. The mission improves the temporal sampling of winds in tropical cyclones (TCs) with a revisit time of 2.8 hours (median) and 7.2 hours (mean) at all locations between 38 deg North and 38 deg South latitude. Operation at the 1575 MHz GPS L1 frequency permits wind measurements in the TC inner core that are often obscured from other spaceborne remote sensing instruments by intense precipitation in the eye wall and inner rain bands. The potential for improved storm surge forecast skill is examined using simulated CYGNSS science data products for Hurricane Irene. We present and compare ADCIRC 2DDI storm surge hindcasting results of Hurricane Irene using four meteorological forcing scenarios: 1) "True" meteorological data obtained from HWRF reanalysis runs; 2) "Worst-case forecast" using low-resolution NOGAPS forecast wind and pressures; 3) "Best-case forecast" using high-resolution HWRF forecast winds and pressures; and 4) a simulated "CYGNSS forecast" with wind field given by a parameterized model trained using CYGNSS-derived values for the maximum wind speed and radius of maximum winds. The results suggest that the improved temporal resolution of the CYGNSS-derived winds has a positive impact on storm surge modeling predictions.

Both instruments have served as prototypes for new orbital sensors. Hyperion has provided the only available global sample of the Earth's surface with: (i) passive optical mid-morning observations at moderate spatial resolution (30 m) to match the Landsat series; and (ii) spectral coverage over almost the full optical spectrum in 10 nm contiguous bands, in visible through shortwave infrared (VSWIR, 0.4-2.5 mu m) wavelengths. Consequently, Hyperion is a heritage platform for future full-spectrum VSWIR orbital spectrometers, including the German mission, EnMAP (2019), and the NASA pre-Phase A (yet unscheduled) mission, the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI), defined by the 2007 Decadal Survey conducted by the US National Research Council. We provide an overview of the mission's lifetime and Hyperion's scientific and application accomplishments, including calibration & validation activities, data quality evaluations during end of mission precession changes to the orbit and overpass time, and the development of a user-friendly science quality archive.

Basic information about sessile communities (wetlands, coral reefs, and sea grasses) includes mapping their extent and distribution, which can be gleaned from spectral surface reflectance imagery at high spatial resolution, but moderate temporal resolution. Moderate to high temporal resolution is also required for detailed observations of sessile community change (e.g., phenology, disturbance) and high temporal resolution is required for environmental changes in the surrounding water, phytoplankton concentration and composition, and concentrations of sediment or chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Current and upcoming satellite missions and technology could meet spatial and spectral challenges. Multiple orbiting and airborne platforms, along with a network of in situ measurements, could provide a more complete picture of how these vital resources are changing. This paper provides an overview of these resources.

We hypothesize that a pure spectroscopic approach can improve atmospheric inversion accuracy to minimize regional biases in global-scale investigations. Such techniques are pervasive in atmospheric remote sounding disciplines, where Optimal Estimation (OE) retrieval theory (Rodgers et al., 2000) inverts a radiance spectrum to recover a consistent physical model incorporating, for example, aerosol and H2O, the interactions between scattering, absorption, and the coupling between surface reflectance and atmosphere. This enables a statistically rigorous treatment of uncertainty with the potential to recover information on spectrally-broad signals. Here we demonstrate a proof of concept that overcomes the primary computational roadblock of these methods: fast execution of line-by-line Radiative Transfer (RT) models. Neural Network (NN) emulation can replicate the results of the MODTRAN 6.0 line-by-line A-band model to high accuracy and a five order of magnitude improvement in execution time. This demonstrates potential for OE to provide significant advances in the accuracy and modeling power of VSWIR atmospheric correction.

IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROLS ON CRYOSPHERIC MELTING IN A CHANGING WORLD	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		Snowmelt; glacier melt; imaging spectroscopy; energy balance; global		The global retreat of Earth's cryosphere is the iconic symbol of climate change. Decades of satellite, airborne, and ground observations show clear evidence of increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, declines in sea ice, and decreasing spring snow cover. This increased melting of cryosphere cover makes Earth more absorptive of sunlight and moves enormous volumes of stored water from frozen state to liquid, raising sea level and changing water availability to large populations. However, the distribution of forcings controlling this accelerated melting is poorly known. Atmospheric warming from greenhouse gases is contributing to this acceleration but its magnitude is uncertain due to our uncertainties in the controls on the dominant contributor to annual melt, absorbed sunlight, itself controlled by albedo. Despite this crucial role of albedo and solar radiation in snow and ice melt, sparse measurements have kept us from understanding the global distribution of controls on albedo, grain size and impurities, and from accurately modeling melt processes worldwide. Such an understanding is crucial to determining cryosphere melt and projecting its future behavior. Global spectroscopic measurements are required to improve our understanding of controls on cryosphere melt rates, enabling better predictions of future changes that will affect humankind.

This debris field was the result of an explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during its launch preparations on September 1. The data collected by UAVSAR allowed us to investigate methods for the detection of small ground targets in a complex wetland environment using multi-aspect, fully polarimetric, and high resolution SAR data. We developed a new time domain processor to focus the SAR data directly to a predefined map grid instead of traditional radar coordinates. This approach allowed us to form co-registered SAR images acquired from 8 flight headings to a common map grid without additional resampling. We computed various polarimetric observables for each observed aspect angle, then calculated statistical deviations to identify candidate locations of debris.

Repeat pass radar interferometry often uses data with less than ideal correlation levels resulting from either long spatial or temporal baselines or changes between observation leading to high levels of temporal correlation. To maximize the utility of such pairs filtering the interferogram to get maximal noise reduction if often needed. One technique that has proved quite useful in the geophysical community is power spectral or Goldstein-Werner filtering of the interferogram whereby a power weighted version of the Fourier transform is used to enhance fringe visibility [1]. Although this paper briefly touched upon the spatial resolution and noise reduction induced by the filter it did not provide a useful formula for predicting the expected amount of noise reduction. The purpose of this paper is to present a formula for the amount of noise reduction obtained from power spectral filtering albeit under the restriction of several simplifying assumptions to make the problem analytically tractable.

NISAR has completed its preliminary design and successfully passed its Preliminary Design Review in June 2016. This paper describes the radar instrument design, engineering model hardware development status, test results, and the plans for future maturation toward the Critical Design Review in late 2018. NISAR has two radars sharing a mechanical structure and reflector, one operating at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and the other at S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve wide-swath observations at both wavelengths, NISAR is designed as a reflector-feed system where the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive capability. In the partnership, NASA provides the instrument structure for both L-and S-band electronics, the L-band electronics, the reflector and associated boom, and an avionics payload to interface with the radar including a solid-state data recorder, high-rate Ka-band telecommunication link, and a GPS receiver. In addition to providing the spacecraft and launch vehicle for the mission partnership, ISRO is also providing S-band radar electronics, and an additional high-rate Ka-band telecom package. This paper will describe aspects of this technically and logistically complex international instrument and mission development, one that requires careful definition of interfaces, tracking of resources, joint analysis of designed capabilities, and detailed integration and test plans.

Over the past three decades, passive microwave remote sensing has been demonstrated as a promising tool for global soil moisture estimation and several missions have been launched over the past years. This study focuses on the parametrization of the tau-omega model at L-, C- and X-band for the Yanco site in New South Wales, Australia, and compares the resulting forward-simulated brightness temperatures with two missions: NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and JAXA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W mission. Preliminary comparison of SMAP and AMSR2 brightness temperatures and forward-simulated brightness temperatures at the Yanco site showed a generally good agreement and higher correlation for the vertical polarization. This is consistent with other studies analyzing the SMAP soil moisture products. Simultaneous calibration of the vegetation parameter b and roughness parameter h was also performed for the L-, C- and X-band data sets, respectively, at both horizontal and vertical polarizations.

The goal of the PALS measurements are to investigate the soil moisture retrieval algorithm formulation and parameterization under the varying (spatially and temporally) conditions of the agricultural domains and to obtain high resolution soil moisture maps within the SMAP pixels.

Both empirical and physically-based microwave emission models are used to understand the effects of vegetation on T-B for corn and soybean using ground-based T-B observations.

In order to account for the different frequencies and acquisition geometries of the two sensor types, the microwave covariation, being the fundamental building block of the moisture retrieval algorithm, is modeled using a fully physics-based approach. Moreover, a data-driven, single pass retrieval methodology for dual-frequency microwave covariation is proposed and tested on SMAP and Sentinel-1 data. The retrieval is also physics-based, incidence angle independent and therefore globally applicable without any empirical or statistical calibration.

First, SIR-C data received with two along-track antennas are used to validate the so-called orthogonal projection algorithm with spaceborne data.

In this work, we utilize an existing empirical approach as an alternative; it describes radar backscatter of a vegetated scene as a linear function of soil moisture, hence reducing dependence on ancillary data. We use 2.5 years of L-band Aquarius radar and radiometer derived soil moisture data to calculate two coefficients of a linear model function on a global scale; the coefficients are derived on a per pixel and on an IGBP land cover classification basis. These coefficients are used to estimate soil moisture from 2.5 months of L-band SMAP radar data and are evaluated with the SMAP Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product.

The images considered are the radar dataset collected by the Uninhabited Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) and the Lidar vertical full waveforms acquired by LVIS over boreal forests in the Canadian province of Quebec. We propose dataset descriptors and fusion methods in order to predict lidar from radar. The first challenge is to find features that go beyond the difference of geometrical configurations between the two types of information, and also that compensate the effect of the incidence angle on radar observables. This has been studied in previous work [1] and will be used here in order to focus on the fusion methods. In this paper, we aim to predict the vertical structure of a forest canopy from PolInSAR images. We assume the Lidar waveforms are a good descriptor of structure and use 3 decomposition methods to qualitatively characterizes these waveforms: 1-Relative Height (RH) metrics, 2-Legendre decomposition and 3-spectral clustering. The prediction will be obtained by a neuronal network which requires an input vector representing the PolinSAR data. We extracted 7 parameters from the PolinSAR images: [theta(mean).h(a), theta(0).h(a), gamma(mean), lambda(max), lambda(min), R-p, R-a]. Prediction of the RH produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.6 m for the top height (I.e. RH100). On the other hand, the Legendre coefficients were predicted with an accuracy of 15%, and the spectral clustering classes were obtained with accuracies better than 80% with 2 classes, but rapidly decreasing as the number of classes (waveform shapes) is increased.

This is significant to characterize the land-use change and its impact on climate change. In this paper, both single-pass and repeat-pass SAR interferometry from spaceborne sensors are combined in order to detect and quantify (with Normalized RMSE <= 30%) forest disturbance at a large scale (dozens of kilometers) however with a fine spatial resolution (< 1 hectare) based on two newly developed approaches. The single-pass InSAR approach is not only able to detect forest disturbance but also capable of characterizing meter (or even sub-meter) level change of forest phase-center (mean) height due to forest growth and/or degradation. These methods are extensively validated with the past and current spaceborne single-pass and repeat-pass InSAR missions (i.e. JAXA's ALOS-1, ALOS-2 and DLR's TanDEM-X) over subtropical forests in Australia as well as tropical forests in Brazil. Such techniques also serve as observing prototypes for the fusion of the future spaceborne InSAR missions (such as NASA-ISRO's NISAR and DLR's TanDEM-L).

A joint project between the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, ASTER has been acquiring data for 15 years, since March 2000. The archive now contains over 3 million scenes. Researchers at Australia's CSIRO analyzed and mosaicked all of the data for the continent to produce 17 ASTER Geoscience Maps at 90 m resolution. These unique products are being used for mineral exploration, climatological studies, and environmental impacts.

The InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) [1], a powerful, modular, and extensible framework, is expected to be used as the processing engine for generating tens of terabytes of SAR data products from the NISAR mission on a daily basis. Until recently, the ISCE framework was designed to exploit traditional CPU-based computational architectures. Simulations with SAR data from ESA's Sentinel 1 constellation have shown that these traditional implementations maybe insufficient to handle the daily influx of data from the NISAR mission. This paper describes the initial efforts by the NISAR project team to explore the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate SAR data processing. Preliminary results from "GPU-izing" interferogram generation workflows indicate that processing times can be reduced by an order of magnitude without loss in precision, potentially setting a new standard for radar processing in the world of "Big SAR Data".

The current retrieval algorithms use roughness models and parameterization developed at field scale to estimate soil moisture at satellite footprint. These models ignored large scale roughness features due to differences in elevation, concavity etc., observed within the satellite footprint. In this study, it is hypothesized that the satellite observed surface roughness is contributed by micro roughness (small-scale roughness) and macro roughness (large-scale roughness), incorporating the scattering features observed at field and satellite scale. The traditional algorithm is used to retrieve soil moisture for SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment, 2012), and SMAPVEX15 the field experiments.

The algorithm uses the mean dual-polarimetric alpha angle in conjunction with its probability distribution to isolate forest structural changes from statistical noise fluctuations. In contrast to radar backscatter, the dual-polarimetric alpha angle is estimated from the complex 2-by-2 covariance matrix and it is less sensitive to variations in soil moisture and terrain slope. Here we derive the statistical properties of the alpha angle for distribute targets, and show how these properties can be applied to detect the burned area of the 2009 Station Fire (CA) from L-band ALOS-1 data. The proposed algorithm can be applicable to future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) time-series to achieve automated global mapping of forest disturbances.

ECOSTRESS will answer science questions related to water use and availability in several key biomes of the terrestrial biosphere using surface temperature information measured from the thermal infrared (TIR) measurement. The instrument includes a TIR multispectral scanner with five spectral bands in the TIR between 8 and 12.5 pm and a spatial resolution of 60m. Model-derived evapotranspiration information derived from ECOSTRESS will help reveal how ecosystems change with climate and provide a critical link between the water cycle and plant health, both natural and agricultural. The inclined, precessing ISS orbit will also enable ECOSTRESS to sample the diurnal cycle in critical regions across the globe at spatiotemporal scales unexploited by current instruments in Sun-synchronous polar and high-altitude geostationary orbits. In this paper we will discuss the primary science objectives of ECOSTRESS, details of the Level 2, 3, and 4 science products and their derivation, validation strategies, and community outreach efforts.

It is expected that the next DS, currently under way, will put additional emphasis on the still pressing need for wind measurements from space. The first DS also called for a geostationary microwave sounder (GMS) on a Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission. Such a sounder, the Geostationary Synthetic Thinned Aperture Radiometer (GeoSTAR), has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The PATH mission has not yet been funded by NASA, but a low-cost subset of PATH, GeoStorm was proposed as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite. Both PATH and GeoStorm will obtain frequent (every 15 minutes of better) measurements of tropospheric water vapor profiles, and they can be used to derive atmospheric motion vector (AMV) wind profiles even in the presence of clouds. We report on simulation studies of such wind vectors derived from a GMS or possibly from a cluster of low-earth-orbiting (LEO) small satellites (e.g., CubeSats).

The TEMPEST concept is designed to improve the understanding of cloud processes, by providing critical information on the time evolution of cloud and precipitation microphysics and by improving our understanding of the largest sources of uncertainty in cloud models. TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers are able to perform observations inside the cloud to observe changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. The TEMPEST Technology Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) mission will be deployed to demonstrate measurement capabilities required for a constellation of 6U-Class nanosatellites to directly observe the temporal development of clouds to understand the conditions that control their transition from non-precipitating to precipitating clouds. TEMPEST-D will provide observations at five millimeter-wave frequencies from 89 to 183 GHz using a single compact instrument that is well suited for the 6U-Class architecture.

The dam is located on the Tigris river and is the biggest hydraulic structure in Iraq. From a geological point of view the dam foundation is unstable due to the underlying geology that is formed by alternate and variable strata of highly soluble materials such as gypsum, anhydrite, marl and limestone. Here we present the first comprehensive multi-sensor cumulative deformation map for the dam generated from space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from the Italian constellation COSMOSkyMed and the European Sentinel-1a satellite. We compared 2014-2016 data to an historic dataset spanning 2004-2010 acquired with the Envisat ASAR sensor. We found that deformation was rapid during 2004-2010, slowed down in 2012-2014, and restarted in August 2014 when grouting operations stopped due to the temporary capture of the dam by the self proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). We took advantage of the availability of data from multiple SAR satellites to infer the deformation at the dam in great spatial and temporal detail and shed new light on the processes of the ongoing destabilization. This study highlights how new constellations of SAR sensors together with the availability of historical datasets are leading to important advances in deformation monitoring of small scale geologic and manmade features.

The D2D devices are connected to a subset of the cloud data centers and thus possess a subset of the data. This paper is interested in reducing the total time of communication, i.e., the completion time, needed to disseminate all files among the devices using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). Unlike previous studies that assume a fully connected communication network, this paper tackles the more realistic scenario of a partially connected network in which devices can only target devices in their transmission range. The joint optimization of selecting the transmitting device(s) and the file combination(s) is first formulated and its intractability exhibited. The completion time is approximated using the celebrated decoding delay approach by deriving the relationship between the quantities in a partially connected network. The paper introduces the cooperation graph and demonstrates that under the collision free transmissions assumption, the problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem over the newly designed graph. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed solution provides noticeable performance enhancement and outperforms previously proposed IDNC-based schemes.

Automated Segmentation of Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Struts in Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography Images	2017 IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (BIBE)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	17th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)	OCT 23-25, 2017	Herndon, VA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Biol & Artificial Intelligence Soc		Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT); Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS); K-means clustering	STENT	Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS), the next step in the continuum of minimally invasive vascular interventions present new opportunities for patients and clinicians but challenges as well. As they are comprised of polymeric materials standard imaging is challenging. This is especially problematic as modalities like optical coherence tomography (OCT) become more prevalent in cardiology. OCT, a light-based intracoronary imaging technique, provides cross-sectional images of plaque and luminal morphology. Until recently segmentation of OCT images for BVS struts was performed manually by experts. However, this process is time consuming and not tractable for large amounts of patient data. Several automated methods exist to segment metallic stents, which do not apply to the newer BVS. Given this current limitation coupled with the emerging popularity of the BVS technology, it is crucial to develop an automated methodology to segment BVS struts in OCT images. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel BVS strut detection method in intracoronary OCT images. First, we preprocess the image to remove imaging artifacts. Then, we use a K-means clustering algorithm to automatically segment the image. Finally, we isolate the stent struts from the rest of the image. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated using expert estimations on 658 annotated images acquired from 7 patients at the time of coronary arterial interventions. Our proposed methodology has a positive predictive value of 0.93, a Pearson Correlation coefficient of 0.94, and a F1 score of 0.92. The proposed methodology allows for rapid, accurate, and fully automated segmentation of BVS struts in OCT images.

In SEQUAL the assessment of the state of 'well-being' - from behaviors and biological signals - is holistic, meaning that the estimation of individual's health, emotional condition, activity and wishes, are from the beginning determined in relation to each other and in (individual's own) context, with superior results compared to when estimated independent from each other, as in common practice. Similarly, the prediction of a person's future condition, intentions, future needs, and actions/treatment/interventions are determined holistically. SEQUAL includes robots, mobility systems and assistive devices for physical intervention, as well as remote professional caregivers, family and friends, to provide intelligent assistance and support network, aiming for higher quality of life for both patient and caregiver.

These findings constitute the first steps toward using model-based controllers for prosthetic devices as an alternative to commonly-used variable impedance and proportional-derivative (PD) control methods. The model upon which the controllers are based is a 5-link planar hybrid system (both continuous and discrete behaviors) with point feet, to represent a transfemoral amputee's body and limbs. A desired walking trajectory is generated through the framework of human-inspired control by solving an optimization problem. Smooth humanlike gait is achieved by combining model information with a desired trajectory. The stability of both controllers is proven for continuous dynamics within the framework of the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulations show the proposed controllers are capable of meeting specific performance requirements regarding trajectory tracking of the prosthetic knee and convergence to a stable periodic orbit while walking on flat ground. Finally, both RP and RS controllers are experimentally implemented on AMPRO3 (the third iteration of Advanced Mechanical Prosthesis), a custom self-contained powered transfemoral prosthesis. Results show that both controllers provide humanlike walking and accurate tracking performance for a healthy human subject utilizing a transfemoral prosthesis.

SLPs provide a novel parameterization of all internally stabilizing controllers and the system responses that they achieve. These can be combined with SLCs to provide parameterizations of constrained stabilizing controllers. We provide a catalog of useful SLCs, and show that by using SLPs with SLCs, we can parameterize the largest known class of constrained stabilizing controllers that admit a convex characterization. Finally, we formulate the SLS problem, and show that it defines the broadest known class of constrained optimal control problems that can be solved using convex programming. We end by using the system level approach to computationally explore tradeoffs in controller performance, architecture cost, robustness and synthesis/implementation complexity.

In this work, we introduce an efficient sense-and-avoid pipeline that compactly represents range measurements from multiple sensors, trajectory generation, and motion planning in a 2.5-dimensional projective data structure called an egospace representation. Egospace coordinates generalize depth image obstacle representations and are a particularly convenient choice for configuration flat mobile robots, which are differentially flat in their configuration variables and include a number of commonly used MAV plant models. After characterizing egospace obstacle avoidance for robots with trivial dynamics and establishing limits on applicability and performance, we generalize to motion planning over full configuration flat dynamics using motion primitives expressed directly in egospace coordinates.

The spacecraft dynamics, pulsar-timing model, and clock deviation model are combined to form the navigation system. An extended Kalman filter that uses epoch folding and leverages the timescale of the system is developed to more efficiently estimate the spacecraft states from four simultaneous X-ray pulsar measurements. Simulation results of an orbiter mission and a deep space mission are presented to show the accuracy of pulsar-based navigation in space.

Our approach hinges on a novel decomposition of the NUM problem that leads to easily solvable iterate update subproblems - we provide closed form solutions for these subproblems for proportional fairness and minimum delay fairness utility functions. We further show that this decomposition lends itself to a distributed implementation that naturally allows for the generation of a set of feasible transmission rates at each iteration of the algorithm, thus ensuring that queues remain empty throughout the network. We formalize these notions in the form of a congestion control protocol, and comment on their usefulness and implementation in the context of recent developments in software defined networking. Finally we compare the performance of our approach to state-of-the-art algorithms from the networking and optimization communities via a datacenter network simulation.

The design objective of FROST is to provide a unified software environment for developing model-based control and motion planning algorithms for robotic systems whose dynamics is hybrid in nature. In particular, FROST uses directed graphs to describe the underlying discrete structure of hybrid system models, which renders it capable of representing a wide variety of robotic systems. Equipped with a custom symbolic math toolbox in MATLAB using Wolfram Mathematica, one can rapidly prototype the mathematical model of robot kinematics and dynamics and generate optimized code of symbolic expressions to boost the speed of optimization and simulation in FROST. In favor of agile and dynamic behaviors, we utilize virtual constraint based motion planning and feedback controllers for robotic systems to exploit the full-order dynamics of the model. Moreover, FROST provides a fast and tractable framework for planning optimal trajectories of hybrid dynamical systems using advanced direct collocation algorithms. FROST has been successfully used to synthesize dynamic walking in multiple bipedal robots. Case studies of such applications are considered in this paper, wherein different types of walking gaits are generated for two specific humanoid robots and validated in simulation.

This paper introduces a new type of high reduction bearingless gearbox which is based on a gearbox with double-row planetary pinion, and can achieve high reduction ratios in a single composite stage. We discuss the practical issues which limit the applicability of the existing double row gearbox, and motivate our innovations. Several advantages of the bearingless gearbox over current approaches in terms of robustness, possible load distribution, manufacturability, and assembly are described. In the concept, all gear components float unconstrained, which is achieved by introducing an additional kinematic constraint that allows planets to be the same, in which case the planet carrier can be substituted with a secondary sun gear. The resulting planetary gearbox can be readily integrated into compact robotic joints. Its few lightweight components can be manufactured with high accuracy with standard machining techniques.

In unknown environments, however, this leads to numerous stops caused by the need for re-planning the trajectory due to unexpected obstacles. In this paper, we propose to use an active perception paradigm for planning. We predict the future uncertainty of the map and optimize trajectories to minimize re-planning risk. This leads to faster and safer trajectories. We evaluate the proposed planning approach in a series of simulation experiments, which show that we are able to achieve safer trajectories with a smaller number of re-planning stops and faster speeds.

For instance, if the task is to pour liquid from a container, the model encodes grasps that leave the opening of the container unobstructed. The model consists of two independent agents: First, a geometric grasp model that computes, from a depth image, a distribution of 6D grasp poses for which the shape of the gripper matches the shape of the underlying surface. The model relies on a dictionary of geometric object parts annotated with workable gripper poses and preshape parameters. It is learned from experience via kinesthetic teaching. The second agent is a CNN-based semantic model that identifies graspsuitable regions in a depth image: regions where a grasp will not impede the execution of the task. The semantic model allows us to encode relationships such as "grasp from the handle." A key element of this work is to use a deep network to integrate contextual task cues, and defer the structured-output problem of gripper pose computation to an explicit (learned) geometric model. Jointly, these two models generate grasps that are mechanically fit, and that grip on the object in a way that enables the intended task.

In this paper, we learn a manipulation model to execute tasks with multiple stages and variable structure, which typically are not suitable for most robot manipulation approaches. The model is learned from human demonstration using a tactile glove that measures both hand pose and contact forces. The tactile glove enables observation of visually latent changes in the scene, specifically the forces imposed to unlock the child-safety mechanisms of medicine bottles. From these observations, we learn an action planner through both a top-down stochastic grammar model (And-Or graph) to represent the compositional nature of the task sequence and a bottom-up discriminative model from the observed poses and forces. These two terms are combined during planning to select the next optimal action. We present a method for transferring this human-specific knowledge onto a robot platform and demonstrate that the robot can perform successful manipulations of unseen objects with similar task structure.

It is limited by communication constraints and to overcome this limitation, this paper formulates the process as a collaboration in which the human scientist and the robot work together to fill in gaps in knowledge to make discoveries. It introduces the science hypothesis map as the probabilistic structure in which scientists initially describe their abstract beliefs and hypotheses, and in which the state of this belief evolves as the robot makes raw measurements. It discusses how to incorporate path planning for maximizing scientific information gain, which is efficiently computed. As proof of concept, this paper describes a geologic exploration problem where a robot uses a spectrometer to infer the geologic composition of different regions in a mining district at Cuprite, Nevada. It shows that the science hypothesis map can infer geologic units with high accuracy, and that exploration using information gain-based path planning has better performance than exploration with conventional science-blind algorithms.

Quantifying Performance of Bipedal Standing with Multi-channel EMG	2017 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	SEP 24-28, 2017	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, RSJ, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, IEEE IES, SICE, New Technol Fdn			FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SELECTION; SIGNALS	Spinal cord stimulation has enabled humans with motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI) to independently stand and recover some lost autonomic function. Quantifying the quality of bipedal standing under spinal stimulation is important for spinal rehabilitation therapies and for new strategies that seek to combine spinal stimulation and rehabilitative robots (such as exoskeletons) in real time feedback. To study the potential for automated electromyography (EMG) analysis in SCI, we evaluated the standing quality of paralyzed patients undergoing electrical spinal cord stimulation using both video and multi-channel surface EMG recordings during spinal stimulation therapy sessions. The quality of standing under different stimulation settings was quantified manually by experienced clinicians. By correlating features of the recorded EMG activity with the expert evaluations, we show that multi-channel EMG recording can provide accurate, fast, and robust estimation for the quality of bipedal standing in spinally stimulated SCI patients. Moreover, our analysis shows that the total number of EMG channels needed to effectively predict standing quality can be reduced while maintaining high estimation accuracy, which provides more flexibility for rehabilitation robotic systems to incorporate EMG recordings.

A Stability Region Criterion for Flat-footed Bipedal Walking on Deformable Granular Terrain	2017 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	SEP 24-28, 2017	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, RSJ, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, IEEE IES, SICE, New Technol Fdn			POINT	Achieving stable bipedal robotic walking on deformable terrain is an open and challenging problem at the intersection of robotics and physics. Ground deformation introduces underactuation; uncertainty in terrain dynamics further complicates dynamical modeling and control methods. This work provides a stability criterion for flat-footed bipedal locomotion and allows model-based control methods to function on homogeneous deformable granular terrain (e.g. sand and dirt). By characterizing static reaction forces from granular materials, in conjunction with granular resistive force theory (RFT), we model and validate a static stability region for the center of mass (CoM) projection of a biped on a granular surface. We show that this stability region approximates the admissible Zero Moment Point (ZMP) region for walking, rendering common Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) methods valid with our foot placement strategy. By interpreting the stability region as the maximum reaction moment of the terrain, we formulate walking as a hybrid dynamical system and utilize the partial hybrid zero dynamics (PHZD) based methodology to generate walking gaits. Finally, we experimentally validate both the ZMP and PHZD walking gaits on a planar bipedal robot, showing that the stability region criterion permits stable dynamic walking on homogeneous granular terrain.

The design consists of a sensory glove that is capable of jointly collecting data of finger poses, hand poses, as well as forces on palm and each phalanx. Specifically, the sensory glove employs a network of 15 IMUs to measure the rotations between individual phalanxes. Hand pose is then reconstructed using forward kinematics. Contact forces on the palm and each phalanx are measured by 6 customized force sensors made from Velostat, a piezoresistive material whose force-voltage relation is investigated. We further develop an open-source software pipeline consisting of drivers and processing code and a system for visualizing hand actions that is compatible with the popular Raspberry Pi architecture. In our experiment, we conduct a series of evaluations that quantitatively characterize both individual sensors and the overall system, proving the effectiveness of the proposed design.

Workflow provenance is core to understand how services and workflows behaved in the past, which knowledge can be used to provide a better recommendation. Existing workflow provenance management systems handle various types of provenance separately. A typical data science exploration scenario, however, calls for an integrated view of provenance and seamless transition among different types of provenance. In this paper, a graph-based, uniform provenance model is proposed to link together design-time and run-time provenance, by combining retrospective provenance, prospective provenance, and evolution provenance. Such a unified provenance model will not only facilitate workflow mining and exploration, but also facilitate workflow interoperability. The model is formalized into colored Petri nets for verification and monitoring management. A SQL-like query language is developed, which supports basic queries, recursive queries, and cross-provenance queries. To verify the effectiveness of our model, A web-based, collaborative workflow prototyping system is developed as a proof-of-concept.

Service recommendation typically relies on service linkage prediction calculated by the semantic distances (or similarities) among services based on their collection of inherent attributes. Given a specific context (mashup goal), however, different attributes may contribute differently to a service linkage. In this paper, instead of training a model for all attributes as a whole, a novel approach is presented to simultaneously train separate models for individual attributes. Meanwhile, a latent attribute modeling method is developed to reveal context-aware attribute distribution. Experiments over real-world datasets have demonstrated that this fine-grained method yields higher link prediction accuracy.

This problem arises in many physical systems where only magnitudes can be measured. Our analysis approach is based on a novel comparison lemma, which upper bounds the performance of the convex-optimization-based PhaseLift algorithm in terms of an auxiliary convex optimization algorithm which is much more amenable to analysis. An upshot of our analysis is that an n-dimensional unknown signal can be recovered from the magnitudes of en random linear measurements, where e > 1 is a constant (which empirically appears to be 3). This improves the best known earlier results which could only guarantee signal recovery with O(n log n) magnitude-only measurements. in fact, and more explicitly, we show that the sufficient number of the measurements in the high SNR regime (which corresponds to noiseless phase retrieval) can be derived from solving a deterministic convex optimization in 3 variables.

In particular this univariate case highly suffers from several non-trivial ambiguities and therefore blind deconvolution is known to be ill-posed in general. However, if additional autocorrelation information is available and the corresponding polynomials are co-prime, blind deconvolution is uniquely solvable up to global phase. Using lifting, the outer product of the unknown vectors is the solution to a (convex) semi-definite program (SDP) demonstrating that-theoretically-recovery is computationally tractable. However, for practical applications efficient algorithms are required which should operate in the original signal space. To this end we also discuss a gradient descent algorithm (Wirtinger flow) for the original non-convex problem. We demonstrate numerically that such an approach has performance comparable to the semidefinite program in the noisy case. Our work is motivated by applications in blind communication scenarios and we will discuss a specific signaling scheme where information is encoded into polynomial roots.

In this paper, we report a long laser pulse induced dual photoacoustic (LDPA) nonlinear effect, which originates from unsatisfied stress and thermal confinements. Being different from conventional short laser pulse illumination, the proposed method utilizes a long square-profile laser pulse to induce dual photoacoustic signals. Without satisfying the stress confinement, the dual photoacoustic signals are generated following the positive and negative edges of the long laser pulse. More interestingly, the first expansion-induced photoacoustic signal exhibits positive waveform due to the initial sharp rising of temperature. On the contrary, the second contraction-induced photoacoustic signal exhibits exactly negative waveform due to the falling of temperature, as well as pulse-width-dependent signal amplitude. An analytical model is derived to describe the generation of the dual photoacoustic pulses, incorporating Gruneisen saturation and thermal diffusion effect, which is experimentally proved in vivo.

When we look across the NASA mission needs over the next decade, there are multiple ways DTN can work in concert with end-to-end mission system software to enhance mission capabilities or even enable new types of missions. DTN-enabled space systems can mitigate data loss when radio links are interrupted, improve the efficiency of operations by simplifying downlink planning, automate relay operations and enable coordinated operations among multiple spacecraft.

The work of spacecraft navigation involves rigorous requirements for accuracy and completeness, often carried out under uncompromising critical time pressures. Robust and fault tolerant design for the ground data system is crucial for the numerous space missions we support, from the Mars rover Curiosity to Cassini in orbit around Saturn. We begin by examining the design principles learned from fault tolerant design efforts to protect against random failure, and consider computer security engineering as a derivative effort to protect against intelligent actors promoting malicious failure. Examples for best practices of reliable system design from computer and aviation industry are considered and security fault tolerance principles are derived from this effort. Computer security design approaches are reviewed, both as abstract principles (starting from cornerstones in Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and from implementation. Strategic design principles such as defense in depth, least privilege, and vulnerability removal are used in this design. We evaluate system design from external access data flows, through internal host security mechanisms, and finally to user access controls. A complementary intersection the balance between the protection of the system and promoting its ease of use by engineers (making their experience as user friendly and efficient as possible) is evaluated. Finally, we consider future refinements to secure system architecture.

Implementation of (O-)CGR in The ONE	2017 6TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE MISSION CHALLENGES FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SMC-IT)			English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology (SMC-IT)	SEP 27-29, 2017	Univ Alcala, Alcala de Henares, SPAIN	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE	Univ Alcala	Routing; Delay-/Disruption- Tolerant Networking; The ONE; CGR; Space Networks	TOLERANT NETWORKING; DTN	Routing in Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) requires specific solutions as link impairments prevent the use of ordinary Internet algorithms, based on a timely dissemination of network topology information. Among DTN routing algorithms there is a dichotomy between opportunistic and deterministic (scheduled) solutions. The former are numerous and apply to terrestrial environments; CGR is the most widely supported algorithm designed for scheduled connectivity, and it is usually applied to space networks. However, in an attempt to provide a unified approach, an opportunistic variant of CGR, Opportunistic CGR (OCGR) has been recently proposed by some of the authors. Performance evaluations are normally carried out for opportunistic solutions by means of simulators, such as The ONE considered in this paper. CGR by contrast is more often studied by means of small testbeds. As the simulation approach could be complementary for CGR, and essential for OCGR, the authors have recently ported both of them into The ONE, by developing and releasing as free software a specific additional package. The aim of this paper is to show the rationale of this choice and discuss the many challenges that needed to be tackled to achieve this primary goal.

The task of author profiling seeks to find the demographics of people solely from their linguistic and content-based features in text. The ability to describe traits of authors clearly has applications in fields such as security and forensics, as well as marketing. Instead of seeing age as just a classification problem, we also frame age as a regression one, but use an ensemble chain method that incorporates the power of both classification and regression to learn the author's exact age.

We show that in the limit of large spatial block lengths, greedy compression with respect to the squared error distortion is optimal; that is, there is no tension between optimizing the distortion of the source in the current time instant and that of future times. We then extend this result to the case where at time t a random compression rate r(t) is allocated independently of the rate at other time instants. This, in turn, allows us to derive the optimal performance of sequential coding over packet-erasure channels with instantaneous feedback. For the case of packet erasures with delayed feedback, we connect the problem to that of compression with side information that is known at the encoder and may be known at the decoder - where the most recent packets serve as side information that may have been erased, and demonstrate that the loss due to a delay by one time unit is rather small.

The thermal performance of the microcooler was measured in vacuum for heat reject temperatures between 185 and 300 K. The cooler was driven with a Chroma 61602 AC power source for input powers ranging from 10 to 60 W and drive frequency between 115 and 140 Hz during thermal performance testing. The optimal drive frequency was dependent on both input power and heat reject temperature. In addition, the microphonics of the cooler were measured with the cooler driven by Iris Technologies LCCE-2 and HP-LCCE drive electronics for input powers ranging from 10 to 60 W and drive frequency between 135 and 145 Hz. The exported forces were strongly dependent on input power while only weakly dependent on the drive frequency. Moreover, the exported force in the compressor axis was minimized by closed loop control with the HP-LCCE. The cooler also survived a 500 krad radiation dose while being continuously operated with 30 W of input power at 220 K heat rejection temperature in vacuum. Finally, the DC and AC magnetic fields around the cooler were measured at various locations.	[McKinley, I. M.; Hummel, C. D.; Johnson, D. L.; Rodriguez, J.

It has components that traverse three primary thermal regions on JWST: Region 1, approximated by 40K; Region 2, approximated by 100K; and Region 3, which is at the allowable flight temperatures for the spacecraft bus. However, there are several sub-regions that exist in the transition between primary regions and at the heat reject interfaces of the Cooler Compressor Assembly (CCA) and Cooler Control Electronics Assembly (CCEA). The design and performance of the test facility to provide a flight representative thermal environment for acceptance testing and characterization of the complete MIRI cooler subsystem are presented.

However, the sheer volume of data alone - hundreds of observations for hundreds of millions of sources - necessitates advanced statistical and machine learning methodologies for scientific discovery: characterization, categorization, and classification. Whilst these techniques are slowly entering the astronomer's toolkit, their application to astronomical problems is not without its issues. In this paper, we will review some of the challenges posed by trying to identify variable stars in large data collections, including appropriate feature representations, dealing with uncertainties, establishing ground truths, and simple discrete classes.

The high-density two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure is used to screen out the lateral electric field and switch off the piezoelectric transducer. By properly selecting the thickness-to -wavelength ratio, the proposed Lamb wave delay line only exhibits zero-order symmetric (S0) and anti-symmetric (A0) Lamb wave mode responses, while providing significant spurious mode reduction up to 26.5 GHz. The Lamb wave delay lines show superior performance in terms of insertion loss and out-of-band rejection over conventional surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and also achieve a good linearity.

B-Si is integrated onto the surface of a highly miniaturized sub-mm implantable intraocular pressure (IOP) sensor. This integration has significantly improved sensor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through the suppression of background noise as well as durability through minimized device biofouling. The incorporation of b-Si has enabled the use of a slit-lamp, the most widely used clinical ophthalmic microscope, for real-time IOP measurements on fully awake rabbits at a world-record 12-cm readout distance. Furthermore, b-Si has shown remarkable antifouling properties during a 6-month in vivo study by minimizing tissue proliferation and encapsulation on the ocular implant, promising much improved long-term implant serviceability.

Current methods for communication and tracking of deep space probes use ground based systems such as the Deep Space Network (DSN). However, the increased communication demand will require radically new methods to ease communication congestion. Networks of communication relay satellites located at strategic locations such as geostationary orbit and Lagrange points are potential solutions. Instead of one large communication relay satellite, we could have scores of small satellites that utilize phase arrays to effectively operate as one large satellite. Excess payload capacity on rockets can be used to warehouse more small satellites in the communication network. The advantage of this network is that even if one or a few of the satellites are damaged or destroyed, the network still operates but with degraded performance. The satellite network would operate in a distributed architecture and some satellites maybe dynamically repurposed to split and communicate with multiple targets at once. The potential for this alternate communication architecture is significant, but this requires development of satellite formation flying and networking technologies. Our research has found neural-network control approaches such as the Artificial Neural Tissue can be effectively used to control multirobot/multi-spacecraft systems and can produce human competitive controllers. We have been developing a laboratory experiment platform called Athena to develop critical spacecraft control algorithms and cognitive communication methods. We briefly report on the development of the platform and our plans to gain insight into communication phase arrays for space.

Although it did not complete a safe landing on Mars, it transmitted data throughout its descent to the surface, until the loss of signal at 1 minute before the expected touch-down on Mars' surface. The main objective of the Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigations and Analysis (AMELIA) experiment was the assessment of the atmospheric science and landing site by exploiting the Entry Descent and Landing System (EDLS) sensors of Schiaparelli beyond their designed role of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the EDL technology demonstrator. Although more limited than expected, the flight data received from Schiaparelli are essential to investigate the anomaly that caused the crash landing and for the achievement of the AMELIA scientific objectives. We will present our methodology and results for the reconstruction of the dynamics of the vehicles during the EDL phases from the available flight data in order to assess the trajectory and attitude of the Schiaparelli EDM and to retrieve the atmospheric profiles.

An on-chip direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) digitally generates the chirping waveform which then drives a ring oscillator based K-u-Band phase-locked loop (PLL) to provide the final Ku-band FMCW signal. Employing a ring oscillator as oppose to a tuned inductor based oscillator (LC-VCO) allows the radar to achieve wider chirp bandwidth resulting in a higher axial resolution (7.5cm) which is needed to accurately quantify the snowpack profile. The demonstrated radar chip is fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process, and it consumes 250mW of power under 1.1V supply, making its payload requirements suitable for observations from a small UAV.

The input feeding is based on (N) E field probes employing capacitive resonance, feeding a wave-guide with artificial dielectrics (ADs). The signal summation occurs on a single transverse plane, thus providing insertion losses which do not scale with the number of inputs. This results in a combiner more compact and without restriction in the number of inputs compared to the traditional power of two (2(N)) combiners. The power combiner operation is presented in a BiCMOS technology implementation and analyzed by means of full wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Finally, the experimental results of an integrated 4: 1 back-to-back-combiner operating in the 240-310GHz band is presented and compared with the full EM model.

These sensors allow self-characterization, self-calibration, and self-monitoring of the radiation performance for both printed circuit board (PCB) antennas and integrated circuit (IC) antennas without any need to additional test equipment. In this paper, we explain how these sensors can be implemented and demonstrate how the far-field radiation properties can be determined from them. A PCB prototype consisting of two transmitting patch antennas and four integrated PFRS antennas is fabricated and tested to verify the concept and demonstrate the implemented sensors' capabilities to capture the radiation properties such as gain pattern, radiated polarization, and the steering angle of the antenna array as a few examples of radiation sensors applications.

The proposed digital pre-distortion technique first power combines the leakage signal with a second pre-distorting signal prior to entering the radar receiver. The Phase & amplitude of this pre-distorting signal are adjusted for partitions of the FMCW chirp to provide cancellation. Transitions between sections are pulse shaped to eliminate broadband frequency content.

Conventional high-speed connectors in interconnect standard such as USB, HDMI, DP, and Thunderbolt are not only expensive, but also suffer poor performance in both mechanical reliability and signal integrity often becoming a bottleneck in high-performance computing systems. The proposed CWC exploits a 125GHz CMOS transmitter (TX), receiver (RX), and compact FR4 PCB antenna to realize high-speed (>10Gb/s), low-cost, and energy-efficient connector solutions. An on-off keying (OOK) modulation is utilized for a non-coherent transceiver (TRX) architecture. In addition, antennas are designed on an FR4HR substrate for a compatibility with an existing infrastructure. The CMOS TX and RX is assembled with the antenna through a flip-chip process. The demonstrated CWC draws a total of 60mW of power under 1.1V supply while transferring 14Gb/s of data rate, achieving 4.28pJ/bit energy efficiency.

Such a telescope could study the origins of stars, planets, molecular clouds, and galaxies; providing a much needed means of following-up on tantalizing results from recent successful missions such as Spitzer, Herschel, SOFIA, and, in the near future, JWST. Indeed, Herschel began its life in the US space program as the Large Deployable Reflector (LDR) - to be assembled in low Earth orbit by shuttle astronauts. Escalating costs and smaller federal budget allocations resulted in a downsizing of the mission. However, by combining break-through technologies utilizing spherical reflectors and inflatable structures, the dream of a 10+ meter class space telescope can be realized. The same telescope technology can also be used to perform sensitive, high spectral and spatial resolution limb sounding studies of the Earth's atmosphere in greenhouse gases such as CO, ClO, O3, and water, as well as serve as a high flying hub for any number of telecommunications and surveillance activities. In our paper we discuss the prospects of using inflatable, spherical reflectors to realize a similar to 25 meter TeraHertz Space telescope (TST).

The development of arrays of hundreds of cryogenically-cooled millimeter wave receivers has previously been challenging, but is now achievable with highly repeatable MMIC processes and advances in cryogenic on-wafer testing of LNAs. We have developed InP HEMT LNA MMICs for the 67-90 GHz frequency band that is the last missing receiver system from the ALMA. These MMICs provided average performance of less than 22.5 K noise temperature over the frequency band and minimum noise temperature of 17.5 K at 72 GHz. These LNAs achieve NT=220K (NF=2.4dB) at 90 GHz for Earth remote sensing instrument on Sentinel-6. Our HRMR (High Resolution Microwave Radiometer) achieves NEDT < 0.05K enabling Sentinel-6 to measure coastal ocean topography at 3 km resolution with better than 1 cm accuracy.

Advanced modeling tools could help with the understanding of the effect of different geophysical parameters on the coherent and incoherent components of the reflected signature and could also provide a comparison between bistatic and backscattering signals for the same scenes.

Traditional tracking algorithms such as the combinatorial Kalman Filter have been used with great success in LHC experiments for years. However, these state-of-the-art techniques are inherently sequential and scale poorly with the expected increases in detector occupancy in the HL-LHC conditions. The HEP.TrkX project is a pilot project with the aim to identify and develop cross-experiment solutions based on machine learning algorithms for track reconstruction. Machine learning algorithms bring a lot of potential to this problem thanks to their capability to model complex non-linear data dependencies, to learn effective representations of high-dimensional data through training, and to parallelize easily on high-throughput architectures such as GPUs. This contribution will describe our initial explorations into this relatively unexplored idea space. We will discuss the use of recurrent (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks to find and fit tracks in toy detector data.

The TS ranges were within the IPC9701 specification: TC4; -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C and TC5, -55 degrees C to +100 degrees C. Two facilities were used for testing. The first facility simply performed TC5, TS, to determine the effect cycling alone whereas the second facility evaluated several additional parameters. The variables include 250 hours of 125 degrees C aging prior to TC4 thermal shock as well as including single-sided and double-sided assembly of the QFN devices. This allowed comparison of reliability for these conditions. Microstructural analysis, pre- and post isothermal again and thermal shock testing enabled a mechanistic analysis of the solder fatigue behavior.

An egocentric cylindrical representation is utilized to model the world using forward-looking stereo vision. This efficient representation enables a 360 degrees field of regard, as the vehicle moves around and disparity maps are fused temporally on the cylindrical map. For this purpose, we developed a new Gaussian Mixture Models-based disparity image fusion algorithm, with an extension to handle independently moving objects (IMO). The extension improves scene models in case of moving objects, where standard temporal fusion approaches cannot detect movers and introduce errors in world models due to the common static scene assumption. The on-board implementation of the vision pipeline provides disparity maps on a 360 degrees egocentric cylindrical surface at 10 Hz. The perception output is used in our system by real-time motion planning with collision avoidance on the MAV.

Images, for example, are naturally represented as third order tensors, where the modes correspond to height, width, and channels. In particular, tensor decompositions are noted for their ability to discover multi-dimensional dependencies and produce compact low-rank approximations of data. In this paper, we explore the use of tensor contractions as neural network layers and investigate several ways to apply them to activation tensors. Specifically, we propose the Tensor Contraction Layer (TCL), the first attempt to incorporate tensor contractions as end-to-end trainable neural network layers. Applied to existing networks, TCLs reduce the dimensionality of the activation tensors and thus the number of model parameters. We evaluate the TCL on the task of image recognition, augmenting popular networks (AlexNet, VGG). The resulting models are trainable end-to-end. We evaluate TCL's performance on the task of image recognition, using the CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets, studying the effect of parameter reduction via tensor contraction on performance. We demonstrate significant model compression without significant impact on the accuracy and, in some cases, improved performance.

Several aspects of the analysis are paid particular attention. First is the modeling of a thermal blanket at a small stand-off distance from the box chassis. The properties of the blanket are such that under some assumptions, it may be treated as an effective bumper shield, and under other assumptions, it may not. The assumptions and their effects on the results of the analysis are explored. Similarly, the configuration of the electronic components inside the chassis are such that several definitions of failure criteria appear plausible. The results of each treatment are presented together and compared with the status of the actual electronics box. The failure predictions vary widely between treatments, and the more conservative assumption sets predict incredulously high probabilities of failure. This is problematic because the conservative assumptions are the ones typically used in analyses for flight projects. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional damage-resistant design consists of a 'bumper' that is placed a small distance away from a spacecraft component or from the wall of the element in which it is housed. The performance of such a multi-wall structural element is typically characterized by its ballistic limit equation (BLE), which defines the threshold particle size that results in a failure of the spacecraft element. BLEs are also key components of any micro-meteoroid/orbital debris (MMOD) risk assessment calculations. However, these assessments often call for BLEs to predict impact response for projectiles made of materials not used in the development of those BLEs. The question naturally arises regarding how close are the predictions of such BLEs when used in impact scenarios involving projectiles made of materials not necessarily considered in their development. In an effort to address this issue, a study was performed with the objective of assessing the validity of the NNO BLE for non-aluminum particles. Particle materials considered included steel, copper, and A1203 (i.e. particles that are made of materials that are more dense than aluminum). Comparisons are made between actual test results involving these non-aluminum projectiles and the predictions of the NNO BLE. In nearly all cases, the NNO BLE was found not to work very well in the predicting failure / no failure response of these non-aluminum projectiles. A new NNO-type BLE is then developed that can be used to more reliably predict the response of dual-wall systems under the hypervelocity impact of such "heavier" non-aluminum projectiles.

However, relatively few experiments have been conducted to determine the dependence of strength properties on gravity. In this work, we experimentally investigated three measures of strength (peak, confined flow, and unconfined flow friction angle) in Earth, Martian, Lunar, and near-zero gravity. The angles were captured in a passive Earth pressure experiment conducted on a reduced gravity flight. The results showed no dependence of the peak friction angle on gravity, a weak dependence of the confined flow friction angle on gravity, and no dependence of the unconfined flow friction angle on gravity. These results highlight the importance of understanding strength and deformation mechanisms of granular material at different levels of gravity.

To enable this computational infrastructure, we configured, for the first time, a LIGO Data Grid Tier-1 Center that can submit heterogeneous LIGO workflows using Open Science Grid facilities. In order to enable a seamless connection between the LIGO Data Grid and Blue Waters via Open Science Grid, we utilize Shifter to containerize LIGO's workflow software. This work represents the first time Open Science Grid, Shifter, and Blue Waters are unified to tackle a scientific problem and, in particular, it is the first time a framework of this nature is used in the context of large scale gravitational wave data analysis. This new framework has been used in the last several weeks of LIGO's second discovery campaign to run the most computationally demanding gravitational wave search workflows on Blue Waters, and accelerate discovery in the emergent field of gravitational wave astrophysics. We discuss the implications of this novel framework for a wider ecosystem of Higher Performance Computing users.	[Huerta, E.

We define and characterize three classes of errors - localization, scoring, and background - study how they are influenced by instance attributes and their impact on an algorithm's performance. Our technique is applied to compare the two leading methods for human pose estimation on the COCO Dataset, measure the sensitivity of pose estimation with respect to instance size, type and number of visible keypoints, clutter due to multiple instances, and the relative score of instances. The performance of algorithms, and the types of error they make, are highly dependent on all these variables, but mostly on the number of keypoints and the clutter. The analysis and software tools we propose offer a novel and insightful approach for understanding the behavior of pose estimation algorithms and an effective method for measuring their strengths and weaknesses.

Most of the current methods are trying to infer some statistical properties to describe and then regenerate a granular medium. These techniques, however, remain at the lower orders and cannot extract very complex information and, thus, they produce unrealistic models that are physically unlikely. The texture of the generated particles using these techniques are mostly different from the real sharpness of granular materials. In this paper, a new technique for direct modeling of granular materials (DGM) based on using high-order statistics is introduced that can extract more information and, finally generate very accurate models. This method, indeed, does not employ any particle descriptor and uses the existing 2D/3D images directly. The results indicate a very good agreement between the simulated and original data. The computational cost of this method is very low.

The study is motivated by an emerging trend within platforms to impose increasingly fine-grained control over the options available to platform participants. While early online platforms allowed open access, e.g., Ebay allows any seller to interact with any buyer; modern platforms often impose matches directly, e.g., Uber directly matches drivers to riders. This control is performed with the goal of achieving more efficient market outcomes. However, the results in this paper highlight that imposing matches may create new strategic incentives that lead to increased inefficiency. In particular, in the context of networked Cournot competition, we prove that open access platforms guarantee social welfare within 7/16 of the optimal; whereas controlled allocation platforms can have social welfare unboundedly worse than optimal.

Unsupervised Non-Intrusive Energy Disaggregation for Commercial Buildings	2017 ASHRAE ANNUAL CONFERENCE PAPERS	ASHRAE Annual Conference Papers		English	Proceedings Paper	ASHRAE Annual Conference	JUN 24-28, 2017	Long Beach, CA	ASHRAE				Commercial buildings alone are responsible for 36% of the total United States electricity consumption, and 30% of this electricity consumption is wasted on average. One of the greatest challenges in improving building energy efficiency lies in the ability to do simple and non-intrusive load disaggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised, non-intrusive building energy disaggregation technique using only 15-minute interval whole-building energy consumption and weather data. The proposed disaggregation technique consists of an analysis loop with three steps. Step 1 analyzes the change in energy consumption in 15-minute intervals for every 3 degrees C temperature range to identify statistically significant temperature dependent and independent the equipment turn on-off states. In step 2, a probabilistic approach is developed using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) that combines equipment state transition matrices from the equipment turn on-off states of step 1 and an emission matrix representing all possible combinations of equipment energy consumption in each state. In step 3, FHMM identifies the best possible combinations of the equipment state and consumption for every point in time using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Ultimately, specific equipment such as HVAC, plug load, and lighting, can be identified virtually without setting foot in the building. The proposed disaggregation technique is validated by comparing real-world, sub-metered building equipment energy consumption data to the whole building data. The results show that the method achieves at least 80% accuracy. Using the disaggregation technique to identify the breakdown of HVAC, lighting, and plug load, we compare the results from building population studies to identify potential areas of energy waste and generate an automated virtual energy audit report. The report provides personalized building recommendations such as improving HVAC operations, lighting, and equipment scheduling, including a measure of potential return-on-investment	[Hossain, Mohammad A.; Khalilnejad, Arash; Swanson, Rachel A.; Mousseau, Jack; Pickering, Ethan M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Pickering, Ethan M.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [French, Roger H.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Abramson, Alexis R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA	Hossain, MA (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.

WFIRST will settle essential questions in both exoplanet and dark energy research and will advance topics ranging from galaxy evolution to the study of objects within the galaxy. The WFIRST mission uses a repurposed 2.4-m Forward Optical Telescope assembly (FOA), which, when completed with new aft optics will be an Integrated Optical Assembly (IOA). WFIRST is equipped with a Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and a Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). An Instrument Carrier (IC) meters these payload elements together and to the spacecraft bus (S/C). A distributed ground system receives the data, uploads commands and software updates, and processes the data. After transition from the study phase, Pre-Phase-A (a.k.a., "Cycle 6") design to NASA Phase A formulation, a significant change to the IOA was initiated; including moving the tertiary mirror from the instrument package to a unified three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) placement, that provides a wide 0.28-sq degrees instrumented field of view to the Wide Field Instrument (WFI). In addition, separate relays from the primary and secondary mirror feed the Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). During commissioning the telescope is aligned using wavefront sensing with the WFI[2]. A parametric and Monte-Carlo analysis was performed, which determined that alignment compensation with the secondary mirror alone degraded performance in the other instruments. This led to the addition of a second compensator in the WFI optical train to alleviate this concern. This paper discusses the trades and analyses that were performed and resulting changes to the WFIRST telescope architecture.

While the pixel pitch of the detectors is approximate to 605 mu m, we can leverage the detector readout architecture to determine the interaction location of an individual photon to much higher spatial accuracy. The sub-pixel spatial location allows us to finely oversample the point spread function of the optics and reduces imaging artifacts due to pixelation. In this paper we demonstrate how the sub-pixel information is obtained, how the detectors were calibrated, and provide ground verification of the quantum efficiency of our Monte Carlo model of the detector response.

Thus, they pose a serious challenge in building a low cost large area detector. We are developing Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) to make all connections (both power and data) through ASICs, which will eliminate wirebonds and enable simple direct flip-chip bonding between the ASIC and a substrate electronics layer. TSVs also enable a more compact layout of the ASIC, which reduces the inactive area of the detector plane, and thus enables nearly gaplessly tilable detector arrays. We demonstrate the first successful TSV implementation on ASICs used for CZT detectors onboard the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission as part of our program to develop large area CZT imagers for wide field coded aperture imaging.

The waveguide consists of two dielectrics and a linear eigenvalue problem is obtained for the modal solution by using surface integral equations and broadband Green's functions of the reference waveguide. The modes are calculated and are independent of frequency. The broadband Green's functions of the inhomogeneous waveguide is next expressed as a summations of these modes. The convergence of modal summations is accelerated by low wavenumber extractions. The accuracy of the results are verified by comparison with results from direct method of moment (MoM) and HFSS.

It has been designed to be deployed and reconfigured easily for scientific applications. These applications include both geospace and astronomy experiments where a relatively small and sparse aperture is sufficient in size. Examples include the study of ionospheric turbulence using active and passive radar imaging, astronomical observations of galactic synchrotron emission, and localization of bright radio emissions such as those from the Sun and Jupiter. The high degree of mobility afforded by the system enables interferometric configurations that are tailored to specific experiments and can be changed in the field. RAPID can also be deployed to locations that are optimal for specific scientific objectives or that complement other existing facilities by adding baselines or serving as a separate imaging receiver array.

This approach allows in principle, to quickly analyze the performance of different near-field coupling mechanisms with arbitrary excitations. The aim is to efficiently excite a WGM into a nonlinear dielectric resonator in order to detect the weak mm-wave radiation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by up-converting the signal into the optical domain via the nonlinearity of the medium.

In this article, we focus on the localization aspect of the technology. The technique requires a minimum of two nodes, of which one is mobile and can be located in the sub-surface, whereas the second is located at a fixed location above the over-burden. To simplify the proof-of-concept, we use a fixed transmitter device located above the ground, and a mobile receiver device located within a cave system, below the over-burden. By sensing and inverting the MQS field detected at the receiver, we were able to solve for positions of the mobile receiver device.

These recent works demonstrate the ability to determine the position of a mobile device in 2D space over ranges of up to many ten's of meters and in non-line-of-sight environment, due to use of MQS fields. One additional advantage of the recent theory and technique is that the solutions for range, azimuthal-direction, and orientation of the device are decoupled and can be solved in a low-latency environment. In this article, we demonstrate a low-latency solution for MQS positioning in a large 2D space.

The objective of this work is to study the benefits and challenges of including Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) capabilities into RRNs. In this context, an appealing RRN case study is presented and evaluated through simulations based on Delay/Disruption-tolerant Network (DTN) protocols and algorithms. Results show that even though the overall delivery metrics improve with ISLs, network congestion impedes a more efficient utilization of the communication resources.

Linear systems whose state vector evolves according to a Metzler matrix have many desirable properties in analysis and control with regard to scalability. This motivates the question, how close (in the Frobenius norm of coefficients) to the nearest Metzler matrix are we? Dropping the Metzler constraint, this problem has recently been studied using the theory of dissipative Hamiltonian (DH) systems, which provide a helpful characterization of the feasible set of stable matrices. This work uses the DH theory to provide a block coordinate descent algorithm consisting of a quadratic program with favourable structural properties and a semidefinite program for which recent diagonal dominance results can be used to improve tractability.

This paper seeks to provide a theoretical framework for how to design controllers that are decomposed across timescales in this way. The framework is analogous to how the network utility maximization framework uses optimization decomposition to distribute a global control problem across independent controllers, each of which solves a local problem; except our goal is to decompose a global problem temporally, extracting a timescale separation. Our results highlight that decomposition of a multi-timescale controller into a fast timescale, reactive controller and a slow timescale, predictive controller can be near-optimal in a strong sense. In particular, we exhibit such a design, named Multi-timescale Reflexive Predictive Control (MRPC), which maintains a pertimestep cost within a constant factor of the offline optimal in an adversarial setting.

Spectral Characterization of Controllability and Observability for Frequency Regulation Dynamics	2017 IEEE 56TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 12-15, 2017	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE			POWER-SYSTEMS; STABILITY	We give a full characterization using spectral graph theory of the controllability and observability of the swing and power flow dynamics in frequency regulation. In particular, we show that the controllability/observability of the system depends on two orthogonal conditions: 1) intrinsic structure of the system graph 2) algebraic coverage of buses with controllable loads/sensors. Condition 1) encodes information on graph symmetry and is shown to hold for almost all practical systems. Condition 2) captures how buses interact with each other through the network and can be verified using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. Based on this framework, the optimal placement of controllable loads and sensors in the network can be formulated as a set cover problem. We demonstrate how our results identify the critical buses in real systems by performing simulation in the IEEE 39-bus New England interconnection test system. We show that for this testbed, a single well chosen bus is capable of providing full controllability/observability.

The minimal rate required to stabilize such a system has been well studied. However, for a given fixed rate, how to quantize the states so as to optimize performance is an open question of great theoretical and practical significance. We concentrate on minimizing the control cost for first-order scalar systems. To that end, we use the Lloyd-Max algorithm and leverage properties of logarithmically-concave functions to construct the optimal quantizer that greedily minimizes the cost at every time instant. By connecting the globally optimal scheme to the problem of scalar successive refinement, we argue that its gain over the proposed greedy algorithm is negligible. This is significant since the globally optimal scheme is often computationally intractable. All the results are proven for the more general case of disturbances with logarithmically-concave distributions.

We consider two styles of platforms: open access platforms and discriminatory access platforms. In open access platforms, every firm can connect to every market, while discriminatory access platforms limit connections between firms and markets in order to improve social welfare. Our results provide tight bounds on the efficiency loss of both open access and discriminatory access platforms. For open access platforms, we show that the efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium is upper bounded by 3/2. In the case of discriminatory access platforms, we prove that, under an assumption on the linearity of cost functions, a greedy algorithm for optimizing network connections can guarantee the efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium is upper bounded by 4/3.

We further showed that such localized controllers enjoy O(1) synthesis and implementation complexity relative to the dimension of the global system, making them particularly well suited for the control of large-scale cyber-physical systems. However, the assumptions under which a system is localizable are stringent: roughly, a system is localizable if the controller has the necessary actuation, sensing and communication resources to "get out ahead" of the propagation of a disturbance and neutralize it, thus containing its effect to a localized spatiotemporal region. In this paper, we relax the assumption of exact localizability, and develop a controller synthesis methodology that is applicable to arbitrary systems that are in an appropriate sense "easy to control." We focus on the state-feedback setting and develop a simple necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability using the system level approach. We then leverage this condition, along with the introduction of virtual actuation, communication and system responses into the synthesis process, to design stabilizing controllers that have (i) O(1) synthesis and implementation complexity and (ii) guaranteed performance bounds. We end with a power-inspired example demonstrating the usefulness of these techniques, wherein we synthesize a near globally optimal controller for a system that is neither localizable nor quadratically invariant.

Here, we are interested in designing a synthetic control circuit that regulates the total cell population and the relative ratio between cell strains in a culture that contains two different cell strains. We have developed a dual feedback control strategy that uses two separate control loops to achieve the two control objectives respectively. We have implemented the strategy in a population regulation circuit where both the total population size and relative cell strain ratio can be set by reference signals. The circuit shows robustness and adaptation to perturbations in cell growth rate and changes in cell numbers. The control architecture is general and could apply to any organism for which synthetic biology tools for quorum sensing, comparison between outputs, and growth control are available.

Their key insight was that by using a sufficiently high sampling rate we can use a simple linear model for control purposes thereby trivializing controller design. In this paper, we provide a variation of model-free control for which it is possible to formally prove the existence of a sufficiently high sampling rate ensuring that controllers solving output regulation and tracking problems for the approximate linear model also solve the same problems for the true and unknown nonlinear model. This is verified experimentally on the bipedal robot AMBER-3M.

This has motivated recent development of online algorithms for solving time-varying optimal power flow problems. We have proposed a centralized quasi-Newton algorithm and have derived theoretical guarantees for its tracking performance. In this paper we show how this algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner by a network of controllable energy resources coordinated by an operator.

The goal is to reduce the total EV cost and station congestion due to temporary shortage in supply of available batteries. We show that the problem is reducible to the minimum weight perfect bipartite matching problem. This leads to an efficient solution based on the Hungarian algorithm. Numerical results suggest that the proposed solution provides a significant improvement over a greedy heuristic that assigns nearest stations to EVs.

Previous work has extended phase based motion magnification techniques to achieve state of the art results in vibrational and structural analysis. One limitation on the current approach is that it does not work very well in situations where substantial rigid body motion is present in the scene. The large rigid motion drowns out the tiny vibrations that are relevant for a full-field structural analysis. This work extends upon previous phase based motion algorithms in order to allow them to work even in cases with large rigid body motion present. Through a keypoint tracking and video cropping scheme rigid body motion is subtracted from video streams, while preserving the smaller motions of interest. After this preprocessing step, the new video stream can be passed into the full-field analysis scheme as usual, in order to get a full-field modal decomposition.

However, video cameras record large amounts of redundant background data causing video processing to be computationally inefficient. This work explores the use of a silicon retina imager to perform operational modal analysis. The silicon retina provides an efficient alternative to standard framebased video cameras. Modeling the biological retina, each silicon retina pixel independently and asynchronously records changes in intensity. By only recording intensity change events, all motion information is captured without recording redundant background information. This asynchronous event-based data representation allows motion to be captured on the microsecond scale, equivalent to traditional cameras operating at thousands of frames per second. With minimal data storage and processing requirements, the silicon retina shows promise for real-time vibration measurement and structural control applications. This study takes the first step toward these applications by adapting existing video frame-based modal analysis techniques to operate on event-based silicon retina measurements. Specifically, blind source separation and video motion processing techniques are used to automatically output vibration parameters from silicon retina data. The developed method is demonstrated on a cantilever beam.

Using Bayes's rule, we reduce the problem to estimating the ratio of two related prior expectations. For a model elliptic problem, we provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of the ratio estimator in the case where Monte Carlo, quasi-Monte Carlo, or multilevel Monte Carlo methods are used as estimators for the two prior expectations. We show that the computational complexity of the ratio estimator to achieve a given accuracy is the same as the corresponding complexity of the individual estimators for the numerator and the denominator. We also include numerical simulations, in the context of the model elliptic problem, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Satellite observations can provide information on the atmospheric state at fine spatial and temporal resolution while providing substantial coverage across the globe. For example, this capability can greatly enhance the understanding of the space-time variation of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), since ground-based measurements are limited. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) collects tens of thousands of observations of reflected sunlight daily, and the mission's retrieval algorithm processes these indirect measurements into estimates of atmospheric CO2. The retrieval is an inverse problem and consists of a physical forward model for the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere that includes absorption and scattering by gases, aerosols, and the surface. The model and other algorithm inputs introduce key sources of uncertainty into the retrieval problem. This article develops a computationally efficient surrogate model that is embedded in a simulation experiment for studying the impact of uncertain inputs on the distribution of the retrieval error.

Given an admissible target measure, we show the existence of the best approximation, with respect to this divergence, from certain sets of Gaussian measures and Gaussian mixtures. The asymptotic behavior of such best approximations is then studied in the small parameter limit where the measure concentrates; this asympotic behavior is characterized using Gamma-convergence. The theory developed is then applied to understand the frequentist consistency of Bayesian inverse problems in finite dimensions. For a fixed realization of additive observational noise, we show the asymptotic normality of the posterior measure in the small noise limit. Taking into account the randomness of the noise, we prove a Bernstein-Von Mises type result for the posterior measure.

Enhancing Tolerance to Unexpected Jumps in GR(1) Games	2017 ACM/IEEE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (ICCPS)	ACM-IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	8th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) held as part of Cyber-Physical Systems Week	APR 18-21, 2017	Pittsburgh, PA	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE Comp Soc		Linear Temporal Logic; Formal Methods; Synthesis; Robustness		When used as part of a hybrid controller, finite-memory strategies synthesizedfrom linear-time temporal logic (LTL) specifications rely on an accurate dynamics model in order to ensure correctness of trajectories. In the presence of uncertainty about the underlying model, there may exist unexpected trajectories that manifest as unexpected transitions under control of the strategy. While some disturbances can be captured by augmenting the dynamics model, such approaches may be conservative in that bisimulations may fail to exist for which strategies can be synthesized. In this paper, we consider games of the GR(1) fragment of LTL, and we characterize the tolerance of hybrid controllers to perturbations that appear as unexpected jumps (transitions) to states in the discrete strategy part of the controller. As a first step, we show robustness to certain unexpected transitions that occur in a finite manner, i.e., despite a certain number of unexpected jumps, the sequence of states obtained will still meet a stricter specification and hence the original specification. Additionally, we propose algorithms to improve robustness by increasing tolerance to additional disturbances. A robot gridworld example is presented to demonstrate the application of the developed ideas and also to perform empirical analysis.

A neural network is trained on the selected features of both the objects and background in the longwave (LW) Infrared (IR) images. Multiple iterations of training are performed until the accuracy of the segmentation reaches satisfactory level. The segmentation boundary of the LW image is used to segment the midwave (MW) and shortwave (SW) IR images. A second neural network detects the local discontinuities and refines the accuracy of the local boundaries. This article compares the neural network based segmentation method to the Wavelet-threshold and Grab-Cut methods. Test results have shown increased accuracy and robustness of this segmentation scheme for multi-spectral IR images.

Using a sequential maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach, the unknown FE model parameters, the measurement noise variances, and the input ground acceleration time histories are estimated jointly. This approach requires the computation of FE response sensitivities with respect to the unknown FE model parameters (i.e., FE parameter sensitivities) as well as the FE response sensitivities with respect to the values of the input ground acceleration at every time step (i.e., FE input sensitivities). The FE parameter and input sensitivities are computed using the direct differentiation method (DDM). The presented output-only nonlinear FE model updating method is validated using the numerically simulated seismic response of a realistic threedimensional five-story reinforced concrete building structure. The simulated building responses to a horizontal bi-directional seismic excitation is contaminated with artificial measurement noise and used to estimate the unknown FE model parameters characterizing the nonlinear material constitutive laws of the reinforced concrete, as well as the root mean square of the measurement noise at each measurement channel, and the full time history of the seismic base acceleration. The method presented in this paper provides a powerful framework for structural system and damage identification of civil structures, when the input excitations are not measured, are partially measured, or the measured input excitations are erroneous.

However, there are well-known limitations of the ABC approach to the Bayesian model selection problem, mainly due to lack of a sufficient summary statistics that work across models. In this paper, we show that formulating the standard ABC posterior distribution as the exact posterior PDF for a hierarchical state-space model class allows us to independently estimate the evidence for each alternative candidate model. We also show that the model evidence is a simple by-product of the ABC-SubSim algorithm. The validity of the proposed approach to ABC model selection is illustrated using simulated data from a three-story shear building with Masing hysteresis. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The high contrast is achieved by utilizing slit and surface plasmon polariton resonances in an array of gold lines filled with a phase change material (Germanium Telluride-GeTe). Stacking multiple layers of the phase change plasmonic grating enabled development of the high-index modulator in chip scale dimensions at telecommunication wavelength. Coupling the optical modes of multiple layers results in such a high contrast when GeTe goes through crystallographic phase transition. Phase transition through joule-heating is achieved by employing a matching circuit.

This starshade is flown between the telescope and the star, and suppresses stellar light sufficiently to allow the imaging of the faint reflected light of the planet. This paper presents a mechanical architecture for this occulter, which must stow in a 5 m-diameter launch fairing and then deploy to about a 80 m diameter structure. The optical performance of the starshade requires that the edge profile is accurate and stable. The stowage and deployment of the starshade to meet these requirements present unique challenges that are addressed in this proposed architecture. The mechanical architecture consists of a number of petals attached to a deployable perimeter truss, which is connected to central hub using tensioned spokes. The petals are furled around the stowed perimeter truss for launch. Herein is described a mechanical design solution that supports an 80 m-class starshade for flight as part of HabEx.

Such masks for high contrast coronagraphic imaging require various fabrication technologies to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron scale island features, ultra-low reflectivity regions, uniformity, wave front quality, etc. We present the technologies employed at JPL to produce these pupil plane and image plane coronagraph masks, and lab-scale external occulter masks, highlighting accomplishments from the high contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at JPL and from the high contrast imaging lab (HCIL) at Princeton University. Inherent systematic and random errors in fabrication and their impact on coronagraph performance are discussed with model predictions and measurements.	[Balasubramanian, Kunjithapatham; Riggs, A. J.

However, for a starshade to generate a sufficiently dark shadow on the telescope, the two must be coaligned to just 1 meter laterally, even at these large separations. The principal challenge to achieving this level of control is in determining the position of the starshade with respect to the space telescope. In this paper, we present numerical simulations and laboratory results demonstrating that a Zernike wavefront sensor coupled to a WFIRST-type telescope is able to deliver the stationkeeping precision required, by measuring light outside of the science wavelengths. The sensor can determine the starshade lateral position to centimeter level in seconds of open shutter time for stars brighter than eighth magnitude, with a capture range of 10 meters. We discuss the potential for fast (ms) tip/tilt pointing control at the milli-arcsecond level by illuminating the sensor with a laser mounted on the starshade. Finally, we present early laboratory results.

The SPC provides starlight suppression in a pair of wedge-shaped regions over an 18% bandpass, and is well suited for spectroscopy of known exoplanets. To demonstrate this starlight suppression in the presence of expected on orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have recently built a dynamic testbed at JPL analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture, with both Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and SPC architectures and a Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to apply, sense, and correct dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present our best up-to-date results of the SPC mode demonstration from the testbed, in both static and dynamic conditions, along with model comparisons. HLC results will be reported separately.

The Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) is an IFS that has been built for the Subaru telescope. CHARIS has been delivered to the observatory and now sits behind the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system. CHARIS has 'high' and 'low' resolution operating modes. The high-resolution mode is used to characterize targets in J, H, and K bands at R70. The low-resolution prism is meant for discovery and spans J+H+K bands (1.15-2.37 microns) with a spectral resolution of R18. This discovery mode has already proven better than 15-sigma detections of HR8799c,d,e when combining ADI+SDI. Using SDI alone, planets c and d have been detected in a single 24 second image. The CHARIS team is optimizing instrument performance and refining ADI+SDI recombination to maximize our contrast detection limit. In addition to the new observing modes, CHARIS has demonstrated a design with high robustness to spectral crosstalk. CHARIS has completed commissioning and is open for science observations.

Key to the science of direct imaging is the spectroscopic capabilities of the instrument, our ability to fit spectra, and understanding the composition of the observed planets. Direct imaging instruments generally use an integral field spectrograph (IFS), which encodes the spectrum into a two-dimensional image on the detector. This results in more efficient detection and characterization of targets, and the spectral information is critical to achieving detection limits below the speckle floor of the imager. The most mature application of these techniques is at more modest contrast ratios on ground-based telescopes, achieving approximately 5-6 orders of magnitude suppression. In space, where we are attempting to detect Earth-analogs, the contrast requirements are more severe and the IFS must be incorporated into the wavefront control loop to reach le-10 detection limits required for Earth-like planet detection.

Two key aspects to advancing starshade technology are the demonstration of starlight suppression to the level required for flight and validation of optical models at this high level of suppression. These technologies are addressed in current efforts underway at the Princeton Starshade Testbed. We report on results from modeling the performance of the Princeton Starshade Testbed to help achieve the milestone 10(-9) suppression. We use our optical model to examine the effects that errors in the occulting mask shape and external environmental factors have on the limiting suppression. We look at deviations from the ideal occulter shape such as over-etching during the lithography process, edge roughness of the mask, and random defects introduced during manufacturing. We also look at the effects of dust and wavefront errors in the open-to-atmosphere testbed. These results are used to set fabrication requirements on the starshade and constraints on the testbed environment. We use detailed measurements of the manufactured occulting mask to converge towards agreement between our modeled performance predictions and the suppression measured in the testbed, thereby building confidence in the validity of the optical models. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and practicalities of scaling to a larger testbed to further advance the optical aspect of starshade technology.

In order to achieve an optimal trade-off between planet light throughput and diffracted starlight suppression, we consider coronagraphs comprised of a stage of phase control implemented with deformable mirrors (or other optical elements), pupil plane apodization masks (gray scale or complex valued), and focal plane masks (either amplitude only or complex-valued, including phase only such as the vector vortex coronagraph). The optimization of these optical elements, with the goal of achieving 10 or more orders of magnitude in the suppression of on-axis (starlight) diffracted light, represents a challenging non-convex optimization problem with a nonlinear dependence on control degrees of freedom. We develop a new algorithmic approach to the design optimization problem, which we call the "Auxiliary Field Optimization" (AFO) algorithm. The central idea of the algorithm is to embed the original optimization problem, for either phase or amplitude (apodization) in various planes of the coronagraph, into a problem containing additional degrees of freedom, specifically fictitious "auxiliary" electric fields which serve as targets to inform the variation of our phase or amplitude parameters leading to good feasible designs. We present the algorithm, discuss details of its numerical implementation, and prove convergence to local minima of the objective function (here taken to be the intensity of the on-axis source in a "dark hole" region in the science focal plane). Finally, we present results showing application of the algorithm to both unobscured off-axis and obscured on-axis segmented telescope aperture designs. The application of the AFO algorithm to the coronagraph design problem has produced solutions which are capable of directly imaging planets in the habitable zone, provided end-to-end telescope system stability requirements can be met. Ongoing work includes advances of the AFO algorithm reported here to design in additional robustness to a resolved star, and other phase or amplitude aberrations to be encountered in a real segmented aperture space telescope.

The intensity at the pupil plane in the shadow is dark enough to detect Earth-like exoplanets by using direct imaging. At Princeton, we have designed and built a testbed that allows verification of scaled starshade designs whose suppressed shadow is mathematically identical to that of space starshade. The starshade testbed uses a 77.2 m optical propagation distance to realize the flight Fresnel number of 14.5. Here, we present lab result of a revised sample design operating at a flight Fresnel number. We compare the experimental results with simulations that predict the ultimate contrast performance.

We have demonstrated a new concept for speckle nulling by injecting directly imaged planet light into a single-mode fiber, linking a high-contrast adaptively-corrected coronagraph to a high-resolution spectrograph (diffraction-limited or not). The restrictions on the incident electric field that will couple into the single-mode fiber give the adaptive optics system additional degrees of freedom to suppress the speckle noise on top of destructive interference. We are able to achieve a starlight suppression gains that are an order of magnitude better than conventional techniques in broadband light with minimal planet throughput losses.

The payload will include a coronagraph instrument (CGI). The CGI designs under development use deformable mirrors (DM) to create a point spread function (PSF) with a dark region around the obscured star object. Electric field conjugation (EFC) is an iterative nonlinear optimization procedure that uses measurements of the electric field at the image to determine the DM displacements that modify the PSF to create the region of high contrast in the image. EFC requires a numerical model of the coronagraph to calculate the Jacobian of the system, which is used, along with regularization, to solve for the DM displacements for each iteration of the nonlinear optimization. Ideally, the coronagraph is aligned and calibrated, and the calibration data are used in the numerical model for calculating the Jacobian. However, calibration and alignment measurements always contain uncertainty resulting in calibration error. Therefore, the Jacobian calculated from the numerical model is not an exact representation of the physical coronagraph, and the resulting DM solution for an EFC iteration does not have the exact impact on the electric field of the coronagraph as predicted by the EFC. The result is slow convergence, and, as will be shown, the necessity of more restrictive regularization. Using Monte Carlo trials, we investigate the effect of calibration error on EFC convergence and regularization. Comparison to results from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph are also presented.

The high-contrast imaging system serves as a spatial filter to separate the light from the star and the planet while the high-resolution spectrograph acts as a spectral filter, which differentiates between features in the stellar and planetary spectra. The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) located downstream from the current W. M. Keck II adaptive optics (AO) system will contain a fiber injection unit (FIU) combining a high-contrast imaging system and a fiber feed to Kecks high resolution infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC. Resolved thermal emission from known young giant exoplanets will be injected into a single-mode fiber linked to NIRSPEC, thereby allowing the spectral characterization of their atmospheres. Moreover, the resolution of NIRSPEC (R = 37,500) is high enough to enable spin measurements and Doppler imaging of atmospheric weather phenomenon. The module will be integrated and tested at Caltech before being transferred to Keck in 2018.	[Mawet, D.; Delorme, J.

EXOSIMS has been adopted by the Exoplanet Exploration Programs Standards Definition and Evaluation Team (ExSDET) as a common mechanism for comparison of exoplanet mission concept studies. To ensure trustworthiness of the tool, we developed a validation test plan that leverages the Python-language unit-test framework, utilizes integration tests for selected module interactions, and performs end-to-end crossvalidation with other yield tools. This paper presents the test methods and results, with the physics-based tests such as photometry and integration time calculation treated in detail and the functional tests treated summarily. The test case utilized a 4m unobscured telescope with an idealized coronagraph and an exoplanet population from the IPAC radial velocity (RV) exoplanet catalog. The known RV planets were set at quadrature to allow deterministic validation of the calculation of physical parameters, such as working angle, photon counts and integration time. The observing keepout region was tested by generating plots and movies of the targets and the keepout zone over a year. Although the keepout integration test required the interpretation of a user, the test revealed problems in the L2 halo orbit and the parameterization of keepout applied to some solar system bodies, which the development team was able to address. The validation testing of EXOSIMS was performed iteratively with the developers of EXOSIMS and resulted in a more robust, stable, and trustworthy tool that the exoplanet community can use to simulate exoplanet direct-detection missions from probe class, to WFIRST, up to large mission concepts such as HabEx and LUVOIR.

The main technical challenge in direct detection comes from three areas: starlight suppression, low flux detection, and speckle stabilization in the dark zone where the planet or disk light is to be detected. These three aspects in turn place requirements on key instrument parameters such as system throughput, raw contrast and detector effects. The link between instrument limitations and instrument performance is captured in models, and balanced using error budgets. Instrument performance can be measured in terms of the science yield, which is itself limited by available mission time and the instrument sensitivity floor. In this paper, we present an overview of the modeling and methodology to assess the sensitivity of the coronagraph and some of the key results pertaining to the WFIRST coronagraph.

We are able to recover all of the 32 previously reported circumstellar disks, and obtain better contrast close to the star. For some of the disks, our results are limited by the over subtraction of the methods, and therefore the major regions of the disks can be recovered except the faintest regions.

The CGI operating modes are the hybrid Lyot coronagraph for planet detection and inner debris disk imaging, a shaped pupil coronagraph for planet characterization, and another shaped pupil for outer disk imaging. Early CGI designs focused on overcoming the diffraction of the large pupil obscurations. Now that those designs have been proven to work in the lab, the design emphasis has been on achieving higher throughput and lower sensitivities to jitter and polarization aberrations. Here we present those improvements and the integration of science yield modeling into the spectrographic shaped pupil design process.	[Riggs, A. J.

To achieve this goal, coronagraphic instruments have favored integral field spectrographs (IFS) as the science cameras to disperse the entire search area at once and obtain spectra at each location, since the planet position is not known a priori. These spectrographs are useful against confusion from speckles and background objects, and can also help in the speckle subtraction and wavefront control stages of the coronagraphic observation. We present a software package, the Coronagraph and Rapid Imaging Spectrograph in Python (crispy) to simulate the IFS of the WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). The software propagates input science cubes using spatially and spectrally resolved coronagraphic focal plane cubes, transforms them into IFS detector maps and ultimately reconstructs the spatio-spectral input scene as a 3D datacube. Simulated IFS cubes can be used to test data extraction techniques, refine sensitivity analyses and carry out design trade studies of the flight CGI-IFS instrument. crispy is a publicly available Python package and can be adapted to other IFS designs.

Since being selected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in December 2013, the coronagraph technology is being matured to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by 2018. To demonstrate starlight suppression in presence of expecting on-orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have built a dynamic testbed in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2016. This testbed, named as Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed, is designed analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture: It has both HLC and Shape Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) architectures, and also has the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to sense and correct the dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present upto-date progress of HLC mode demonstration in the OMC testbed. SPC results will be reported separately. We inject the flight-like Line of Sight (LoS) and Wavefront Error (WFE) perturbation to the OMC testbed and demonstrate wavefront control using two deformable mirrors while the LOWFS/C is correcting those perturbation in our vacuum testbed. As a result, we obtain repeatable convergence below 5 x 10(-9) mean contrast with 10% broadband light centered at 550 nm in the 360 degrees dark hole with working angle between 3 lambda/D and 9 lambda/D. We present the key hardware and software used in the testbed, the performance results and their comparison to model expectations.

With smaller telescopes, the targets tend to be brighter and closer to the Solar System, and their putative planetary systems span angles that require starshades with radii of 10-30 m at distances of 10s of Mm. With larger apertures, the light-collecting power enables studies of more numerous, fainter systems, requiring larger, more distant starshades with radii >50 m at distances of 100s of Mm. Characterization using infrared wavelengths requires even larger starshades. A mitigating approach is to observe planets between the petals, where one can observe regions closer to the star but with reduced throughput and increased instrument scatter. We compare the starshade shape requirements, including petal shape, petal positioning, and other key terms, for the WFIRST 26m starshade and the HABEX 72 m starshade concepts, over a range of working angles and telescope sizes. We also compare starshades having rippled and smooth edges and show that their performance is nearly identical.

The LOWFS/C uses a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) with the phase shifting disk combined with the starlight rejecting occulting mask. For wavefront error corrections, WFIRST LOWFS/C uses a fast steering mirror (FSM) for line-of-sight (LoS) correction, a focusing mirror for focus drift correction, and one of the two deformable mirrors (DM) for other low order wavefront error (WFE) correction. As a part of technology development and demonstration for WFIRST Coronagraph, a dedicated Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed has been built and commissioned. With its configuration similar to the WFIRST flight coronagraph instrument the OMC testbed consists of two coronagraph modes, Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) and Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC), a low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS), and an optical telescope assembly (OTA) simulator which can generate realistic LoS drift and jitter as well as low order wavefront error that would be induced by the WFIRST telescope's vibration and thermal changes. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of WFIRST LOWFS/C, describe the OMC testbed, and present the testbed results of LOWFS sensor performance. We will also present our recent results from the dynamic coronagraph tests in which we have demonstrated of using LOWFS/C to maintain the coronagraph contrast with the presence of WFIRST-like line-of-sight and low order wavefront disturbances.

The coronagraph employs sequential deformable mirrors to compensate for phase and amplitude errors. Using the optical model of an Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), we have investigated the sensitivity of a Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) broadband contrast performance to DM actuator errors and actuator limits. Considered case include drifts in actuator gains or actuator response curves, paired actuators, as well as the limits imposed by a neighboring-actuator rule. Actual data about the actuator drifts and the knowledge about the paired-actuators obtained in several DM characterization experiments conducted at JPL, as well as the neighboring-actuator rule implemented on the OMC testbed were used in simulations.

The coronagraph employs sequential deformable mirrors to compensate for phase and amplitude errors. Using the optical model of an Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), we have investigated and compared through modeling and simulations the performance of several actuator regularization-schemes in broadband wavefront control algorithm used to generate dark holes in an OMC, such as a Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC). Using the concept of a Tikhonov filter constituting the G-matrix, we have explained what the different regularization schemes do to singular-modes during a wavefront control (WFC) process called Electric Field Conjugation (EFC). In some cases we confirmed the numerical predictions with the testbed measured results. We present our findings in this paper.

In addition to the diffracted and scattered light for the on-axis star, a multi-star system features additional starlight leakage from the off-axis star that must also be controlled. A basic option is for additional starshades to block the off axis stars. An interesting option takes the form of hybrid operation of a starshade in conjunction with an internal starlight suppression. Two hybrid scenarios are considered. One such scenario includes the coronagraph instrument blocking the on-axis star, with the starshade blocking off-axis starlight. Another scenario uses the wavefront control system in the coronagraph instrument and using a recent Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC) technique can remove the off-axis stars leakage to enable a region of high-contrast around the on-axis star blocked by the starshade. We present simulation results relevant for the WFIRST telescope.

The dust grains coalesce into structures reminiscent of early solar system formation; their composition has been predicted through simulations and some edge-on observations but better data is required to validate them. Scattered light from these dust grains presents challenges to exoplanet imaging missions: resolution of their stellar environment is hindered by exozodiacal emissions and therefore sets the size and scope of these imaging missions. Understanding the composition of this interplanetary dust in our solar system requires an imaging mission from a vantage point above the ecliptic plane. The high surface brightness of the zodiacal light requires only a small aperture with moderate sensitivity; therefore a 3cm camera is enough to meet the science goals of the mission at an orbital height of 0.1AU above the ecliptic. A 6U CubeSat is the target mass for this mission which will be a secondary payload detaching from an existing interplanetary mission. Planetary flybys are utilized to produce most of the plane change Delta v; deep space corrective maneuvers are implemented to optimize each planetary flyby. We developed an algorithm which determines the minimum Delta v required to place the CubeSat on a transfer orbit to a planet's sphere of influence and maximizes the resultant orbital height with respect to the ecliptic plane. The satellite could reach an orbital height of 0.22 AU with an Earth gravity assist in late 2024 by boarding the Europa Clipper mission.

Currently at Princeton and JPL, two control schemes are being employed: electric field conjugation (EFC) and stroke minimization. Both of them are based on a linearized state transition model and both have achieved great success over the past decade. In this paper, we develop a general framework for the control system and improve upon the robustness of wavefront controllers from the perspective of stochastic optimization. We start by analyzing the model uncertainty and reformulating the wavefront control as a stochastic optimization problem. Then, we apply this idea to a recently proposed linear constraint wavefront controller and develop a robust version. According to the numerical simulations, the robust linear controller reveals the potential for creating more uniform dark holes. In experiment, the robust linear controller achieves at least as good performance as Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and stroke minimization.	[Sun, He; Kasdin, N.

We have developed an automated data architecture to process and index all data related to the survey uniformly. An automated and flexible data processing framework, which we term the GPIES Data Cruncher, combines multiple data reduction pipelines together to intelligently process all spectroscopic, polarimetric, and calibration data taken with GPIES. With no human intervention, fully reduced and calibrated data products are available less than an hour after the data are taken to expedite follow-up on potential objects of interest. The Data Cruncher can run on a supercomputer to reprocess all GPIES data in a single day as improvements are made to our data reduction pipelines. A backend MySQL database indexes all files, which are synced to the cloud, and a front-end web server allows for easy browsing of all files associated with GPIES. To help observers, quicklook displays show reduced data as they are processed in real-time, and chatbots on Slack post observing information as well as reduced data products. Together, the GPIES automated data processing architecture reduces our workload, provides real-time data reduction, optimizes our observing strategy, and maintains a homogeneously reduced dataset to study planet occurrence and instrument performance.

Future mission concepts under study by the 2020 decadal survey, e.g., HabEx and LUVOIR, have the potential of achieving this goal. We investigate the baseline requirements for detecting four molecular species, H2O, O-2, CH4, and CO2. These molecules are highly relevant to habitability and life activity on Earth and other planets. Through numerical simulations, we find the minimum requirement for spectral resolution (R) and starlight suppression level (C) for a given exposure time. We consider scenarios in which different molecules are detected. For example, R = 6400 (400) and C = 5 x 10(-10) (2 x 10(-9)) are required for HabEx (LUVOIR) to detect O-2 and H2O for an exposure time of 400 hours for an Earth analog around a solar-type star at a distance of 5 pc. The full results are given in Table 2. The impact of exo-zodiacal contamination and thermal background is also discussed.

Acyclicity for Groups and Vector Spaces	SOUTHEAST ASIAN BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Acyclic matching property; Linear matching property; Torsion-free groups	MATCHINGS	A matching in an Abelian group G is a bijection f from a subset A to a subset B in G such that a + f(a) is not an element of. A, for all a. A. This notion was introduced by Fan and Losonczy who used matchings in Z(n) as a tool for studying an old problem of Wakeford concerning canonical forms for symmetric tensors. The notion of acyclic matching property was provided by Losonczy and it was proved that torsion-free groups admit this property. In this paper, we introduce a duality of acyclic matching as a tool for classification of some Abelian groups; moreover, we study matchings for vector spaces and give a connection between matchings in groups and vector spaces.

The equations of motion are formulated in a preconditioned form using kinematic substructuring with a heuristic application of Generalized Coordinate Partitioning (GCP). This results in an optimal split of dependent and independent variables during run time. It also allows reliable handling of end of stroke conditions and bifurcations in mechanisms, thereby facilitating dynamic simulation of paradoxical linkages such as Bricard's mechanism that has been known to cause problems with some multibody dynamic codes. The new Preconditioned Equations of Motion are then solved using a recursive formulation of the Schur Complement Method combined with Sparse Matrix Techniques. In this fashion the Preconditioned Equations of Motion are recursively uncoupled and solved one kinematic substructure at a time. The results are demonstrated using examples.

This paper seeks to investigate the suitability of several different open and closed loop control techniques for application to the problem of end effector position control with minimal vibration for a low stiffness space based manipulator. Simulations of a representative planar problem with two flexible links are used to measure performance and sensitivity to parameter variation of: model predictive control, command shaping, and command shaping with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback. An experimental testbed is then used to validate simulation results for the recommended command shaped controller.

NON-RECIPROCITY IN STRUCTURES WITH NONLINEAR INTERNAL HIERARCHY AND ASYMMETRY	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2017, VOL 8	Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences / Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE 2017)	AUG 06-09, 2017	Cleveland, OH	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div		Non-reciprocity; periodic structures; nonlinear wave propagation; resonance capture	MECHANICAL OSCILLATORS; IRREVERSIBLE-PROCESSES; WAVES	Acoustic reciprocity is a property of linear, time invariant systems in which the locations of the source of a forcing and the received signal can be interchanged with no change in the measured response. This work investigates the breaking of acoustic reciprocity using a hierarchical structure consisting of internally-scaled masses coupled with cubically nonlinear springs. Using both direct results and variable transformations of numerical simulations, energy transmission is shown to occur in the direction of decreasing scale but not vice versa, constituting the breaking of acoustic reciprocity locally. When a linear spring connects the smallest scale of such a structure to the largest scale of another identical structure, an asymmetrical lattice is formed. Because of the scale mixing and transient resonance capture that occurs within each unit cell, it is demonstrated through further numerical experiments that energy transmission occurs primarily in the direction associated with the nonlinear coupling from the large to the small scale, thus signifying the breaking of reciprocity globally. This nonlinear hierarchical structure exhibits strong amplitude-dependency in which reciprocity breaking is associated with specific ranges of excitation amplitudes for both impulse and harmonic forcing.

These transients are similar to transients in fluid filledpipelines observed during water hammer events. In this paper, the effect of an air gap in the syringe and a converging section are studied experimentally and numerically in a model system which consists of a fluid-filled metal tube that is impulsively loaded with a projectile to simulate the action of the autoinjector mechanism operation. The air between the buffer and the water results in a complex interaction between the projectile and the buffer. Also, there are tension waves inside the tube due to the presence of a free surface, and this causes distributed cavitation which, in turn, gives rise to steepening of the pressure waves. The converging section can amplify the pressure waves if the wave front is sharp. Pressures as high as 50 MPa have been measured at the apex of the cone with impact velocities of 5.5 m/s.

Performing these tasks while using minimal mass/volume systems and with low energy consumption is another set of requirements imposed on such technologies. A deep drill, called Auto-Gopher II, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Corp. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary-hammer drill that combines formation breaking by hammering using an ultrasonic actuator and cuttings removal by rotating a fluted auger bit. The hammering mechanism is based on the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to transform high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher and then integrated into a rotary hammer device to develop the Auto-Gopher-I. The lessons learned from these developments are being integrated into the development of the Auto-Gopher-II, an autonomous deep wireline drill with integrated cuttings and sample management and drive electronics. Subsystems of the wireline drill are being developed in parallel at JPL and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. This paper presents the development efforts of the piezoelectric actuator, cuttings removal and retention flutes and drive electronics.

The dynamics of such a process is well modeled by a two-body decay, resulting in a monoenergetic electron with an energy slightly below the muon rest mass (104.967 MeV). The calorimeter of this experiment plays an important role to provide excellent particle identification capabilities and an online trigger filter while aiding the track reconstruction capabilities. The baseline calorimeter configuration consists of two disks each made with similar to 700 undoped CsI crystals read out by two large area UV-extended Silicon Photomultipliers. These crystals match the requirements for stability of response, high resolution and radiation hardness. In this paper we present the final calorimeter design.

Precision Timing with Silicon Sensors for Use in Calorimetry	17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CALORIMETRY IN PARTICLE PHYSICS (CALOR2016)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Calorimetry in Particle Physics (CALOR)	MAY 15-20, 2016	Daegu, SOUTH KOREA					The high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN is expected to provide instantaneous luminosities of 5 x 10(34) cm(-2) s(-1). The high luminosities expected at the HL-LHC will be accompanied by a factor of 5 to 10 more pileup compared with LHC conditions in 2015, causing general confusion for particle identification and event reconstruction. Precision timing allows to extend calorimetric measurements into such a high density environment by subtracting the energy deposits from pileup interactions. Calorimeters employing silicon as the active component have recently become a popular choice for the HL-LHC and future collider experiments which face very high radiation environments. We present studies of basic calorimetric and precision timing measurements using a prototype composed of tungsten absorber and silicon sensor as the active medium. We show that for the bulk of electromagnetic showers induced by electrons in the range of 20 GeV to 30 GeV, we can achieve time resolutions better than 25 ps per single pad sensor.

One exciting option for such a detector is a calorimeter composed of a secondary emitter as the active element. In this report we outline the study and development of a secondary emission calorimeter prototype using micro-channel plates (MCP) as the active element, which directly amplify the electromagnetic shower signal. We demonstrate the feasibility of using a bare MCP within an inexpensive and robust housing without the need for any photo cathode, which is a key requirement for high radiation tolerance. Test beam measurements of the prototype were performed with 120 GeV primary protons and secondary beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility, demonstrating basic calorimetric measurements and precision timing capabilities. Using multiple pixel readout on the MCP, we demonstrate a transverse spatial resolution of 0.8 mm, and time resolution better than 40 ps for electromagnetic showers.

We discuss how timing information with a precision of a few tens of pico seconds and below can significantly improve the reconstruction of the physics events under challenging high pileup conditions to be faced at the High-Luminosity LHC or a future hadron collider. The particular challenge in measuring the time of arrival of a high energy photon lies in the stochastic component of the distance of initial conversion and the size of the electromagnetic shower. We present studies and measurements from test beams for calorimeter based timing measurements to explore the ultimate timing precision achievable for high energy photons of 10 GeV and above. We focus on techniques to measure the timing with a high precision in association with the energy of the photon. We present test-beam studies and results on the timing performance and characterization of the time resolution of LYSO-based calorimeters. We demonstrate time resolution of 30 ps is achievable for a particular design.

A crucial issue is radiation damage. We report an investigation on gamma-ray induced radiation damage in crystal scintillators of large size, including BaF2, BGO, CeF3, pure CsI, LSO/LYSO/LFS and PWO with an integrated dose up to 340 Mrad at a dose rate up to 1 Mrad/h. Optical and scintillation properties of these crystal samples were measured before and after irradiations. The result shows that pure CsI crystals have good radiation hardness below 100 krad. BaF2, BGO and LYSO crystals show good radiation hardness beyond 1 Mrad. In terms of light output degradation LSO/LYSO/LFS is clearly the best among all scintillation crystals.	[Yang, F.; Zhang, L.

This paper reports an investigation on proton induced radiation damage in various crystal scintillators. Large size BGO, LFS and PWO crystals of 18 to 22 cm long were irradiated by 800 MeV protons up to 3x10(15) p/cm(2) at the WNR facility of LANSCE with longitudinal transmittance measured in situ. LYSO plates of 14x14x1.5 mm(3) were irradiated by 24 GeV protons up to 8.2x10(15) p/cm(2) at the IRRAD facility of CERN. Degradations in both transmittance and light output are reported. The results show an excellent radiation hardness of LYSO/LFS crystals against charged hadrons.

Thin crystal plates are used as the sensitive medium to reduce the light path length and thus the radiation damage effects and the calorimeter cost. A design of such a calorimeter uses tungsten as absorber, LYSO crystals as active medium, and liquid scintillator filled quartz capillaries as WLS to transport scintillating light to photodetectors. Initial calorimeter design and performance of prototype modules are presented. Possible optimizations are discussed.

Prior approaches have mainly been either purely reactive, mapping low-level visual features directly to headings, or deliberative methods that use onboard 3-D sensors to create a 3-D, voxel-based world model, then generate 3-D trajectories and check them for potential collisions with the world model. Onboard 3-D sensor suites have had limited fields of view. We use forward-looking stereo vision and lateral structure from motion to give a very wide horizontal and vertical field of regard. We fuse depth maps from these sources in a novel robot-centered, cylindrical, inverse range map we call an egocylinder. Configuration space expansion directly on the egocylinder gives a very compact representation of visible freespace. This supports very efficient motion planning and collision-checking with better performance guarantees than standard reactive methods. We show the feasibility of this approach experimentally in a challenging outdoor environment.

By strategically exploiting turbulence-induced "gravity fluctuations," our technique enables a new experimental approach for testing surface interactions of robotic systems in micro-to milli-gravity environments. This strategy is used to evaluate the performance of internally-actuated hopping rovers designed for controlled surface mobility on small Solar System bodies. In experiments, these rovers demonstrated a range of maneuvers on various surfaces, including both rigid and granular. Results are compared with analytical predictions and numerical simulations, yielding new insights into the dynamics and control of hopping rovers.

A Forward-Adjoint Operator Pair Based on the Elastic Wave Equation for Use in Transcranial Photoacoustic Computed Tomography	SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES			English	Article						photoacoustic computed tomography; transcranial imaging; image reconstruction; elastic wave equation	PERFECTLY MATCHED LAYER; IMPULSIVE POINT-SOURCE; FINITE-DIFFERENCE; HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA; FDTD SOLUTION; PROPAGATION; SKULL; ABSORPTION; ULTRASOUND; CONFIGURATION	Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging imaging modality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to form images of the photoacoustically induced initial pressure distribution within tissue. The PACT reconstruction problem corresponds to an inverse source problem in which the initial pressure distribution is recovered from measurements of the radiated wavefield. A major challenge in transcranial PACT brain imaging is compensation for aberrations in the measured data due to the presence of the skull. Ultrasonic waves undergo absorption, scattering, and longitudinal-to-shear wave mode conversion as they propagate through the skull. To properly account for these effects, a wave-equation-based inversion method should be employed that can model the heterogeneous elastic properties of the skull. In this work, a forward model based on a finite-difference time-domain discretization of the three-dimensional elastic wave equation is established and a procedure for computing the corresponding adjoint of the forward operator is presented. Massively parallel implementations of these operators employing multiple graphics processing units are also developed. The developed numerical framework is validated and investigated in computer-simulation and experimental phantom studies whose designs are motivated by transcranial PACT applications.

The HydroCube satellites would operate at sun-synchronous 3-day repeat polar orbits with a spatial resolution of about 1-3 Km. The mission goals would be to improve the estimation of terrestrial water storage and weather forecasts. Root-zone soil moisture and snow water storage in land are critical parameters of the water cycle. The HydroCube Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) concept utilizes passive receivers to detect the reflection of strong existing P-band radio signals from geostationary Mobile Use Objective System (MUOS) communication satellites. The SWE remote sensing measurement principle using the P-band SoOp is based on the propagation delay (or phase change) of radio signals through the snowpack. The time delay of the reflected signal due to the snowpack with respect to snow-free conditions is directly proportional to the snowpack SWE. To address the ionospheric delay at P-band frequencies, the signals from both MUOS bands (360-380 MHz and 250-270 MHz) would be used. We have conducted an analysis to trade off the spatial resolution for a space-based sensor and measurement accuracy. Through modeling analysis, we find that the dual-band MUOS signals would allow estimation of soil moisture and surface roughness together. From the two MUOS frequencies at 260 MHz and 370 MHz, we can retrieve the soil moisture from the reflectivity ratio scaled by wavenumbers using the two P-band frequencies for MUOS. A modeling analysis using layered stratified model has been completed to determine the sensitivity requirements of HydroCube measurements. For mission concept demonstration, a field campaign has been conducted at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado since February 2016. The data acquired has provided support to the HydroCube concept.

Such an approach, called triangle queries, was proposed in [1], where it was shown that, for a fixed query budget, it outperforms clustering based on edge queries (i.e, comparing pairs of objects). In [1] the clustering algorithm for triangle and edge queries was identical and each triangle query response was treated as 3 separate edge query responses. In this paper we directly exploit the triangle structure of the responses by embedding them into a 3-way tensor. Since there are 5 possible responses to each triangle query, it is a priori not clear how best to embed them into the tensor. We give sufficient conditions on non-trivial embedding such that the resulting tensor has a rank equal to the underlying number of clusters (akin to what happens with the rank of the adjacency matrix). We then use an alternating least squares tensor decomposition algorithm to cluster a noisy and partially observed tensor and show, through extensive numerical simulations, that it significantly outperforms methods that make use only of the adjacency matrix.

Techniques to achieve high performance in spite of the coarse quantizers have recently been advanced. In the context of array processing and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation also, one bit quantizers have been studied in the past, although not as extensively. This paper shows that sparse arrays such as nested and coprime arrays are more robust to the deleterious effects of one-bit quantization, compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs); in fact, sparse arrays with one-bit quantizers are often found to be as good as ULAs with unquantized data. Nested and coprime arrays without quanitzers are known to be able to resolve more DOAs than the number of sensors, when sources are uncorrelated. It will be demonstrated that this continues to be true even with one-bit quantization.	[Liu, Chun-Lin; Vaidyanathan, P.

In this paper, we consider the phaseless super-resolution problem of recovering a sum of sparse Dirac delta functions which can be located anywhere in the continuous time-domain. For such signals in the continuous domain, we propose a novel Semidefinite Programming (SDP) based signal recovery method to achieve the phaseless super-resolution.

P-L}, what is the minimum number of samples of x(n) required to find the period? For the special case where the samples of x(n) are constrained to be contiguous in time, this problem has recently been solved. More generally, when the samples are allowed to be non-contiguous, the problem is quite difficult. This paper provides the answer for the restricted situation where P is an element of {P-1, P-2}. With P-1 < P-2, the necessary and sufficient number of (possibly noncontiguous) samples for period estimation turns out to be (a) P-1, if P-1 is not a divisor of P-2, and (b) P-2 otherwise. While the proof is quite involved even in this restricted case, it is likely to form the basis for addressing the more general situation where P is an element of {P-1, P-2, ... P-L}.

One of these concepts is the uncertainty principle, which studies the concentration of a signal on a graph and its graph Fourier basis (GFB). An eigenvector of a graph is the most localized signal in the GFB by definition, whereas it may not be localized in the vertex domain. However, if the eigenvector itself is sparse, then it is concentrated in both domains simultaneously. In this regard, this paper studies the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of 1, 2, and 3-sparse eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. The provided conditions are purely algebraic and only use the adjacency information of the graph. Examples of both cIassical and real-world graphs with sparse eigenvectors are also presented.

This problem arises in applications where measuring the phase, and making high-frequency measurements, are either too costly or altogether infeasible. The problem is especially challenging because it combines the difficult problems of phase retrieval and classical super-resolution. Recently, the authors in [ 1] demonstrated that by making three phaseless low-frequency measurements, obtained by appropriately "masking" the signal, one can uniquely and robustly identify the phase using convex programming and obtain the same super-resolution performance reported in [2]. However, the masks proposed in [1] are very specific and in many applications cannot be directly implemented. In this paper, we broadly extend the class of masks that can be used to recover the phase and show how their effect can be emulated in coherent diffraction imaging using multiple illuminations, as well as in direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation using multiple sources to excite the environment. We provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the method and approach.

We consider two variants of decoders based on the regularized least squares followed by hard-thresholding: the case where the convex relaxation is from {-1,1}(n) to R-n and the box constrained case where the relaxation is to [-1,1](n). For both cases, we derive an exact expression of the bit error probability when n and m grow simultaneously large at a fixed ratio. For the box constrained case, we show that there exists a critical value of the SNR, above which the optimal regularizer is zero. On the other side, the regularization can further improve the performance of the box relaxation at low to moderate SNR regimes. We also prove that the optimal regularizer in the bit error rate sense for the unboxed case is nothing but the MMSE detector.

An efficient way to accomplish this is to make use of fast embedding techniques involving Fourier transform e. g. circulant matrices. While binary embedding has been studied extensively, theoretical results on fast binary embedding are rather limited. In this work, we build upon the recent literature to obtain significantly better dependencies on the problem parameters. A set of N points in R-n can be properly embedded into the Hamming cube {+/- 1}(k) with delta distortion, by using k similar to delta(-3) log N samples which is optimal in the number of points N and compares well with the optimal distortion dependency delta(-2). Our optimal embedding result applies in the regime log N less than or similar to n(1/3). Furthermore, if the looser condition log N less than or similar to root n holds, we show that all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the points can be optimally embedded. We believe the proposed techniques can be useful to obtain improved guarantees for other nonlinear embedding problems.

Multi-view (multi-angular) and multi-spectral data are linked to the underlying microphysics using 3D radiative transfer, accounting for multiple-scattering. Despite the nonlinearity of the tomography model, inversion is enabled using a few approximations that we describe.

In this paper, we study non-linear tensor factorization methods based on deep variational autoencoders. Our approach is well-suited for settings where the relationship between the latent representation to be learned and the raw data representation is highly complex. We apply our approach to a large dataset of facial expressions of movie-watching audiences (over 16 million faces).

For example, if two Mechanical Turkers happen to click on the same pixel location when annotating a part in a given image-an event that is very unlikely to occur by random chance-, it is a strong indication that the location is correct. A similar type of confidence can be obtained if a single Turker happened to agree with a computer vision estimate. We thus incrementally collect a variable number of worker annotations per image based on online estimates of confidence. This is done using a sequential estimation of risk over a probabilistic model that combines worker skill, image difficulty, and an incrementally trained computer vision model. We develop specialized models and algorithms for binary annotation, part keypoint annotation, and sets of bounding box annotations. We show that our method can reduce annotation time by a factor of 4-11 for binary filtering of websearch results, 2-4 for annotation of boxes of pedestrians in images, while in many cases also reducing annotation error. We will make an end-to-end version of our system publicly available.

When photons are few and far in between, the concept of 'image' breaks down and it is best to consider directly the flow of photons. Computer vision in this regime, which we call 'scotopic', is radically different from the classical image-based paradigm in that visual computations (classification, control, search) have to take place while the stream of photons is captured and decisions may be taken as soon as enough information is available. The scotopic regime is important for biomedical imaging, security, astronomy and many other fields. Here we develop a framework that allows a machine to classify objects with as few photons as possible, while maintaining the error rate below an acceptable threshold. A dynamic and asymptotically optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is a key feature of this framework. We propose and study an algorithm to optimize the tradeoff of a convolutional network directly from lowlight images and evaluate on simulated images from standard datasets. Surprisingly, scotopic systems can achieve comparable classification performance as traditional vision systems while using less than 0.1% of the photons in a conventional image. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithms work even when the illuminance of the environment is unknown and varying. Last, we outline a spiking neural network coupled with photon-counting sensors as a power-efficient hardware realization of scotopic algorithms.

Batch and Recursive Bayesian Estimation Methods for Nonlinear Structural System Identification	RISK AND RELIABILITY ANALYSIS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS: IN HONOR OF PROF. ARMEN DER KIUREGHIAN	Springer Series in Reliability Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	Risk and Reliability Symposium in Honor of Armen Der Kiureghian	OCT 04-05, 2015	Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL	MAE Ctr, Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Struct Engn & Soc Risk Management Programs	Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign		CONCRETE; MODEL; SENSITIVITY	This chapter presents a framework for the identification of nonlinear finite element (FE) structural models using Bayesian inference methods. Using the input-output dynamic data recorded during an earthquake event, batch and recursive Bayesian estimation methods are employed to update a mechanics-based nonlinear FE model of the structure of interest (building, bridge, dam, etc.). Unknown parameters of the nonlinear FE model characterizing material constitutive models, inertia, geometric, and/or constraint properties of the structure can be estimated using limited response data recorded through accelerometers or heterogeneous sensor arrays. The updated nonlinear FE model can be used to identify the damage in the structure following a damage-inducing event. This framework, therefore, can provide an advanced tool for post-disaster damage identification and structural health monitoring. The batch estimation method is based on a maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) approach, where the time history of the input and output measurements are used as a single batch of data for estimating the FE model parameters. This method results in a nonlinear optimization problem that can be solved using gradient-based and non-gradient-based optimization algorithms. In contrast, the recursive Bayesian estimation method processes the information from the measured data recursively, and updates the estimation of the FE model parameters progressively over the time history of the event. The recursive Bayesian estimation method results in a nonlinear Kalman filtering approach. The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are employed as recursive Bayesian estimation methods herein. For those estimation methods that require the computation of structural FE response sensitivities (total partial derivatives) with respect to the unknown FE model parameters, the direct differentiation method (DDM) is used. Response data numerically simulated from a nonlinear FE model (with unknown material model parameters) of a five-story two-by-one bay reinforced concrete frame building subjected to bi-directional horizontal seismic excitation are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed framework.

FILTER BASED METHODS FOR STATISTICAL LINEAR INVERSE PROBLEMS	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Kalman filter; 3DVAR; statistical inverse problems; artificial dynamics	HILBERT SCALES; REGULARIZATION; RATES	Ill-posed inverse problems are ubiquitous in applications. Understanding of algorithms for their solution has been greatly enhanced by a deep understanding of the linear inverse problem. In the applied communities ensemble-based filtering methods have recently been used to solve inverse problems by introducing an artificial dynamical system. This opens up the possibility of using a range of other filtering methods, such as 3DVAR and Kalman based methods, to solve inverse problems, again by introducing an artificial dynamical system. The aim of this paper is to analyze such methods in the context of the linear inverse problem. Statistical linear inverse problems are studied in the sense that the observational noise is assumed to be derived via realization of a Gaussian random variable. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of filter based methods for these inverse problems. Rigorous convergence rates are established for 3DVAR and for the Kalman filters, including minimax rates in some instances. Blowup of 3DVAR and a variant of its basic form is also presented, and optimality of the Kalman filter is discussed. These analyses reveal a close connection between (iterated) regularization schemes in deterministic inverse problems and filter based methods in data assimilation. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theory.

In order to form clathrate hydrates, water molecules are removed from the aqueous solution. This fact causes great impact on solutes concentration, including available nutrients in solution so habitability is directly affected. Both, thermodynamical history recorded in the experiments and visual features following of the system help to understand the truly effect of salting-out on geology and its expression on Europa's surface in application to space exploration.

These methods can preserve structural properties of the input matrix, such as positive-semidefiniteness, and they can produce approximations with a user-specified rank. The algorithms are simple, accurate, numerically stable, and provably correct. Moreover, each method is accompanied by an informative error bound that allows users to select parameters a priori to achieve a given approximation quality. These claims are supported by numerical experiments with real and synthetic data.

In this study, we use the scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) technique to study the surface photovoltage dynamics in doped silicon samples. We observe that the optical excitation of lightly doped n-type and p-type silicon as well as heavily doped n-type silicon increases the electron density on the surface. In contrast, the optical excitation of heavily doped p-type silicon increases the hole density on the surface. Furthermore, we show that the rise and the decay timescales of these events strongly depend on the doping concentration.

By defining desired positions in terms of offsets from the route, the spatial and temporal components can be decoupled. The spatial components are planned using a two-step planner for fast real-time planning. The spatially defined paths are passed to a speed adaptation algorithm for temporal considerations including inter-vehicle collision avoidance.

Additive Effects on Li parallel to CFx and Li parallel to CFx-MnO2 Primary Cells at Low Temperature	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTE; CATHODE; LI/CFX; 15-CROWN-5; SYSTEMS	The effect of additives and electrolyte composition was investigated for Li parallel to CFx and Li parallel to CFx-MnO2 cells operated at low (ca. -40 degrees C) temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel measurements indicated that the anode is far more resistive than the cathode at low temperatures. Adding a small amount of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) to a propylene carbonate (PC) + 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) + tetrahydrofuran (THF) ternary blend was found to have a beneficial effect on the anode of a cell when using 0.5 M LiClO4 as the electrolyte salt. Although the cathode impedance did increase with the addition of FEC, the overall cell impedance dropped dramatically, particularly at -40 degrees C. Capacity at low temperature was not significantly improved with FEC addition, however, indicating that static (i.e. EIS) measurements may not be the best tool to understand the cell under dynamic (discharge) conditions. 15-crown-5 (as an additive) proved to have severe negative effects on specific capacity.

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) retarder optics. The DKIST retarder baseline design used 6 crystals, single-layer anti-reflection coatings, thick cover windows and oil between all optical interfaces. This new tool estimates polarization fringes and optic Mueller matrices as functions of all optical design choices. The amplitude and period of polarized fringes under design changes, manufacturing errors, tolerances and several physical factors can now be estimated. This tool compares well with observations of fringes for data collected with the SPINOR spectropolarimeter at the Dunn Solar Telescope using bi-crystalline achromatic retarders as well as laboratory tests. With this new tool, we show impacts of design decisions on polarization fringes as impacted by anti-reflection coatings, oil refractive indices, cover window presence and part thicknesses. This tool helped DKIST decide to remove retarder cover windows and also recommends reconsideration of coating strategies for DKIST. We anticipate this tool to be essential in designing future retarders for mitigation of polarization and intensity fringe errors in other high spectral resolution astronomical systems.

The instrument includes a dual-channel polarimetry mode designed to detect the inherently polarized light scattered o ff debris disks and protoplanetary disks and suppress unpolarized light from the host star. GPI has imaged over two dozen circumstellar disks{detecting some for the fi rst time in scattered light{and carried out polarimetric measurements of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here, we review the current status of the debris disk component of the GPI Exoplanet Survey and report on updates to standard data reduction techniques that improve upon the achievable polarimetric contrasts.

The solution that we propose uses a method to construct an imaging system in space in which the nonlinear optical properties of a cloud of micron-sized particles, shaped into a specific surface by electromagnetic means, and allows one to form a very large and lightweight aperture of an optical system, hence reducing overall mass and cost. Recent work at JPL has investigated the feasibility of a granular imaging system, concluding that such a system could be built and controlled in orbit. We conducted experiments and simulation of the optical response of a granular lens. In all cases, the optical response, measured by the Modulation Transfer Function, of hexagonal reflectors was closely comparable to that of a conventional spherical mirror. We conducted some further analyses by evaluating the sensitivity to fill factor and grain shape, and found a marked sensitivity to fill factor but no sensitivity to grain shape. We have also found that at fill factors as low as 30%, the reflection from a granular lens is still excellent. Furthermore, we replaced the monolithic primary mirror in an existing integrated model of an optical system (WFIRST Coronagraph) with a granular lens, and found that the granular lens that can be useful for exoplanet detection provides excellent contrast levels. We will present our testbed and simulation results in this paper.

We show that, in contrast to the forwards Markov chain, the dynamics of the backwards chain explicitly involve the stationary distribution of the model, and from this we derive a functional equation that the stationary distribution must satisfy. We use this functional equation to derive differential equations for the stationary distribution of Bak-Sneppen models in which all but one or all but two of the fitnesses are replaced at each step, subject to certain conditions on the relative locations of the replaced species. This gives a unified way of deriving Schlemm's expressions for the stationary distributions of the isotropic four-species model, the isotropic five-species model, and the anisotropic three-species model.

It has worst-case running time n(1/2) m(1/2) s(2) poly(log(n), log(m), R, r, 1/delta), with n and s the dimension and row-sparsity of the input matrices, respectively, m the number of constraints, delta the accuracy of the solution, and R, r upper bounds on the size of the optimal primal and dual solutions, respectively. This gives a square-root unconditional speed-up over any classical method for solving SDPs both in n and m. We prove the algorithm cannot be substantially improved (in terms of n and m) giving a O(O-1/2 + m(1/2)) quantum lower bound for solving semidefinite programs with constant s, R, r and d. The quantum algorithm is constructed by a combination of quantum Gibbs sampling and the multiplicative weight method. In particular it is based on a classical algorithm of Arora and Kale for approximately solving SDPs. We present a modification of their algorithm to eliminate the need for solving an inner linear program which may be of independent interest.	[Brandao, Fernando G. S.

We model granular materials using a viscoplastic constitutive law that produces a Drucker-Prager-like yield condition in the limit of vanishing flow. A friction law for non-steady flows, incorporating rate-dependence and dilation, is derived and implemented within the constitutive law. We compare our SPH simulations with experimental data, demonstrating that they can capture both steady and non-steady dynamic flow behavior, notably including transient column collapse profiles. This technique may therefore be attractive for modeling the time-dependent evolution of natural and industrial flows.

The majority of the Selenichnites found in this study contain only one lunate cast and some are distinguished by linear ridges that project behind a single lunate cast. A detailed investigation of the morphology and orientation of these Selenichnitesattributable to xiphosurans, relatives of modern horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus)yields an understanding of xiphosuran digging behavior. Statistical analysis of 96 lunate casts from two populations of Selenichnites separated by several hundred thousand years shows, with 99% confidence, that the prosomas (heads) of the younger population are smaller. Further study of the wealth of Selenichnites at Joggins will be useful to determine which factors control xiphosuran body-size changes and the timescale on which those changes can be seen manifest in a population. The smallest known Selenichnites (7mm wide) is also reported.

VEM will provide a global map of surface composition as well as redox state of the surface, providing a comprehensive picture of surface-atmosphere interaction on Venus. In addition, continuous observation of the thermal emission of the Venus will provide tight constraints on current day volcanic activity. These capabilities are complemented by measurements of atmospheric water vapor abundance as well as cloud microphysics and dynamic. Atmospheric data will allow for the accurate correction of atmospheric interference on the surface measurements and represent highly valuable science on their own. A mission combining VEM with a high-resolution radar mapper such as the NASA VOX or the ESA EnVision mission proposals in a low circular orbit will provide key insights in the divergent evolution of Venus.

Design and characterization of a low cost CubeSat multi-band optical receiver to map water ice on the lunar surface for the Lunar Flashlight mission	INFRARED REMOTE SENSING AND INSTRUMENTATION XXV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Infrared Remote Sensing and Instrumentation XXV	AUG 07-08, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		NASA Lunar Flashlight mission; NIR optical receiver; NIR multi-band reflectometer; CubeSat	ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER; TEMPERATURE-MEASUREMENTS; POLAR-REGIONS; SOUTH-POLE; MOON; ALBEDO	Lunar Flashlight is an innovative NASA CubeSat mission dedicated to mapping water ice in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon, which may act as cold traps for volatiles. To this end, a multi- band reflectometer will be sent to orbit the Moon. This instrument consists of an optical receiver aligned with four lasers, each of which emits sequentially at a different wavelength in the near- infrared between 1 mu m and 2 mu m. The receiver measures the laser light reflected from the lunar surface; continuum/absorption band ratios are then analyzed to quantify water ice in the illuminated spot. Here, we present the current state of the optical receiver design. To optimize the optical signal-to-noise ratio, we have designed the receiver so as to maximize the laser signal collected, while minimizing the stray light reaching the detector from solar-illuminated areas of the lunar surface outside the field-of-view, taking into account the complex lunar topography. Characterization plans are also discussed. This highly mass- and volume-constrained mission will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first CubeSats performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit.

While ensemble-based quantum memories have been routinely realized, implementing single rare-earth ion qubit remains an outstanding challenge due to its weak photoluminescence. Here we demonstrate a nanophotonic platform consisting of yttrium vanadate (YVO) photonic crystal nanobeam resonators coupled to a spectrally dilute ensemble of Nd ions. The cavity acts as a memory when prepared with spectral hole burning, meanwhile it permits addressing of single ions when high-resolution spectroscopy is employed. For quantum memory, atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol was implemented in a 50 ppm Nd:YVO nanocavity cooled to 480 mk. The high-fidelity quantum storage of time-bin qubits is demonstrated with a 80% efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The small mode volume of the cavity results in a peak atomic spectral density of <10 ions per homogeneous linewidth, suitable for probing single ions when detuned from the center of the inhomogeneous distribution. The high-cooperativity coupling of a single ion yields a strong signature (20%) in the cavity reflection spectrum, which could be detected by our efficient SNSPD. We estimate a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 10 for addressing a single Nd ion with its 879.7nm transition. This, combines with the AFC memory, constitutes a promising platform for preparation, storage and detection of rare-earth qubits on the same ship.

Four different coating recipes are presented as candidates for future far-ultraviolet (FUV) sensitive broadband observatories. Three samples were first coated with aluminum (Al) and lithium fluoride (LiF) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) using a new high-temperature physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. Two of these samples then had an ultrathin (10-20 angstrom) protective coat of either magnesium fluoride (MgF2) or aluminum fluoride (A1F(3)) applied using atomic later deposition (ALD) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). A fourth sample was coated with Al and a similar high temperature PVD coating of ALF(3). Polarized reflectivities into the FUV for each sample were obtained through collaboration with the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We present a procedure for using these reflectivities as a baseline for calculating the optical constants of each coating recipe. Given these results, we describe plans for improving our measurement methodology and techniques to develop and characterize these coating recipes for future FUV missions.

LUVOIR is being designed to pursue an ambitious program of exoplanetary discovery and characterization, cosmic origins astrophysics, and planetary science. The LUVOIR study team is investigating two large telescope apertures (9- and 15-meter primary mirror diameters) and a host of science instruments to carry out the primary mission goals. Many of the exoplanet, cosmic origins, and planetary science goals of LUVOIR require high-throughput, imaging spectroscopy at ultraviolet (100 - 400 nm) wavelengths. The LUVOIR Ultraviolet Multi-Object Spectrograph, LUMOS, is being designed to support all of the UV science requirements of LUVOIR, from exoplanet host star characterization to tomography of circumgalactic halos to water plumes on outer solar system satellites. LUMOS offers point source and multi-object spectroscopy across the UV bandpass, with multiple resolution modes to support different science goals. The instrument will provide low (R = 8,000 - 18,000) and medium (R = 30,000 - 65,000) resolution modes across the far-ultraviolet (FUV: 100 - 200 nm) and near-ultraviolet (NUV: 200 - 400 nm) windows, and a very low resolution mode (R = 500) for spectroscopic investigations of extremely faint objects in the FUV. Imaging spectroscopy will be accomplished over a 3 x 1.6 arcminute field-of-view by employing holographically-ruled diffraction gratings to control optical aberrations, microshutter arrays (MSA) built on the heritage of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), advanced optical coatings for high-throughput in the FUV, and next generation large-format photon-counting detectors. The spectroscopic capabilities of LUMOS are augmented by an FUV imaging channel (100 - 200nm, 13 milliarcsecond angular resolution, 2 x 2 arcminute field-of-view) that will employ a complement of narrow-and medium-band filters. The instrument definition, design, and development are being carried out by an instrument study team led by the University of Colorado, Goddard Space Flight Center, and the LUVOIR Science and Technology Definition Team. LUMOS has recently completed a preliminary design in Goddard's Instrument Design Laboratory and is being incorporated into the working LUVOIR mission concept. In this proceeding, we describe the instrument requirements for LUMOS, the instrument design, and technology development recommendations to support the hardware required for LUMOS. We present an overview of LUMOS' observing modes and estimated performance curves for effective area, spectral resolution, and imaging performance. Example "LUMOS 100-hour Highlights" observing programs are presented to demonstrate the potential power of LUVOIR's ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities.

The observatory provides high-resolution soft X-ray spectroscopy in the 12-50 angstrom bandpass with unprecedented sensitivity: effective areas of >450 cm(2) and spectral resolution >2500. The Arcus key science goals are (1) to measure the effects of structure formation imprinted upon the hot baryons that are predicted to lie in extended halos around galaxies, groups, and clusters, (2) to trace the propagation of outflowing mass, energy, and momentum from the vicinity of the black hole to extragalactic scales as a measure of their feedback and (3) to explore how stars, circumstellar disks and exoplanet atmospheres form and evolve. Arcus relies upon the same 12m focal length grazing-incidence silicon pore X-ray optics (SPO) that ESA has developed for the Athena mission; the focal length is achieved on orbit via an extendable optical bench. The focused X-rays from these optics are diffracted by high-efficiency Critical-Angle Transmission (CAT) gratings, and the results are imaged with flight-proven CCD detectors and electronics. The power and telemetry requirements on the spacecraft are modest. Mission operations are straightforward, as most observations will be long (similar to 100 ksec), uninterrupted, and pre-planned, although there will be capabilities to observe sources such as tidal disruption events or supernovae with a similar to 3 day turnaround. Following the 2nd year of operation, Arcus will transition to a proposal-driven guest observatory facility.	[Smith, R. K.; Allured, R.; Brenneman, L.; Brickhouse, N. S.; Cheimets, P.

The materials that were developed in the early days of this field generated limited actuation strain and therefore received relatively little attention. However, over the last years a series of EAP materials has emerged that exhibits a significant shape change in response to electrical stimulation. Their capability allowed the production and demonstration of various exciting and novel mechanisms including robot fish, catheter steering elements, miniature grippers, loudspeakers, fishlike blimps, and dust-wipers. Novel applications such as microfluidic systems and tissue engineering have also emerged. The impressive advances in improving their actuation strain are attracting the attention of many engineers and scientists from many different disciplines. These materials are particularly attractive to biomimetic applications since they can be used to make biologically inspired intelligent robots and other mechanisms. Increasingly, EAP-actuated mechanisms are being engineered with large application potential. This chapter reviews the state of the art, challenges, and potential applications of EAP materials.

Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs	WAVELETS AND SPARSITY XVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Wavelets and Sparsity XVII	AUG 06-09, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Multirate processing; graph signals; block-cyclic graphs; spectral approximation	FILTER BANKS	A variety of different areas consider signals that are defined over graphs. Motivated by the advancements in graph signal processing, this study first reviews some of the recent results on the extension of classical multirate signal processing to graphs. In these results, graphs are allowed to have directed edges. The possibly non-symmetric adjacency matrix A is treated as the graph operator. These results investigate the fundamental concepts for multirate processing of graph signals such as noble identities, aliasing, and perfect reconstruction (PR). It is shown that unless the graph satisfies some conditions, these concepts cannot be extended to graph signals in a simple manner. A structure called M-Block cyclic structure is shown to be sufficient to generalize the results for bipartite graphs on two-channels to M-channel filter banks. Many classical multirate ideas can be extended to graphs due to the unique eigenstructure of M-Block cyclic graphs. For example, the PR condition for filter banks on these graphs is identical to PR in classical theory, which allows the use of well-known filter bank design techniques. In order to utilize these results, the adjacency matrix of an M-Block cyclic graph should be given in the correct permutation. In the final part, this study proposes a spectral technique to identify the hidden M-Block cyclic structure from a graph with noisy edges whose adjacency matrix is given under a random permutation. Numerical simulation results show that the technique can recover the underlying M-Block structure in the presence of random addition and deletion of the edges.

I argue that, through connections to materiality, this symbol functions as a nodal point that implicates the reader of Ritter's fragment project within the same operations of constructing both symbols and ideas that inform the text. This approach entails a significant departure from the scholarship of the past decade or two, where Ritter's circle times has been understood almost exclusively as a phenomenon of acoustics and self-writing.

Charge distribution uncertainty in differential mobility analysis of aerosols	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BIPOLAR ION ENVIRONMENT; OPPOSED MIGRATION ION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; FLOW-RATE; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; PARTICLE FORMATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; BOREAL FOREST; NM PARTICLES; STATE	The inference of particle size distributions from differential mobility analyzer (DMA) data requires knowledge of the charge distribution on the particles being measured. The charge distribution produced by a bipolar aerosol charger depends on the properties of the ions produced in the charger, and on the kinetics of charge transfer from molecular ions or ion clusters to the particles. A single parameterization of a theoretically predicted charge distribution is employed in most DMA analyses regardless of the atmospheric conditions being probed. Deviations of the actual charge distribution from that assumed in the data analysis will bias the estimated particle size distribution. We examine these potential biases by modeling measurements and data inversion using charge distributions calculated for a range of atmospheric conditions. Moreover, simulations were performed using the ion-to-particle flux coefficients predicted for a range of properties of both the particles and ions. To probe the biases over the full range of particle sizes, the measurements were simulated through an atmospheric new particle formation event. The differences between the actual charge distribution and that according to the commonly used parametrization resulted in biases as large as a factor of 5 for nucleation-mode particles, and up to 80% for larger particles. Incorrect estimates of the relative permittivity of the particles or not accounting for the temperature and pressure effects for measurements at 10 km altitude produced biases in excess of 50%; threefold biases result from erroneous estimates of the ion mobility distribution. We further report on the effects of the relative permittivity of the ions, the relative concentrations of negative and positive ions, and truncation of the number of charge states considered in the inversion.

Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx): Initial Flight System Design	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VIII	AUG 06-07, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		telescope; decadal survey; exoplanets; starshade; coronagraph; habitability; astrophysics		The Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) is a concept for a mission to directly image planetary systems around Sun-like stars and to perform general astrophysics investigations being studied as part of a number of mission concepts for the upcoming 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. HabEx would help assess the prevalence of habitable planets in our galaxy, searching in particular for potential biosignatures in the atmospheres of planets in habitable zones. More generally, HabEx would image our neighboring solar systems and characterize the variety of planets that inhabits them. Its direct imaging capability would also enable the mission to study the structure and evolution of debris disks around nearby stars, and their dynamical interaction with planets. Additionally, it will explore a number of more general astrophysics phenomena in our solar system, galaxy, and beyond, in the UV through NIR range. The exoplanet science goals lead to a mission concept with requirements for high contrast imaging and the continuous spectral coverage. The baseline for HabEx is a 4-meter diameter off-axis telescope designed to both search for habitable planets and perform general astrophysics observations, possibly combined with a starshade. In this paper, the initial flight system design for both the telescope and the starshade are presented, focusing on the key and driving requirements and subsystems, as well as the trajectory and station keeping and formation flying technique. Furthermore, some of the initial design trades undergone are described, as well as the key challenges and enablers. Finally, some of the future design and architecture trades to be performed within the flight systems as part of the continuing effort in the HabEx study are discussed.

Typical Aluminum mirrors protected with MgF2 fall short of the requirements below 120nm. New and improved coatings are sought to protect aluminum from oxidizing readily in normal environment causing severe absorption and reduction of reflectance in the deep UV. Choice of materials and the process of applying coatings present challenges. Here we present the progress achieved to date with experimental investigations of coatings at JPL and at GSFC and discuss the path forward to achieve high reflectance in the spectral region from 90 to 300nm without degrading performance in the visible and NIR regions taking into account durability concerns when the mirrors are exposed to normal laboratory environment as well as high humidity conditions. Reflectivity uniformity required on these mirrors is also discussed.

The required planet/star brightness ratio of order 10-10 at visible wavelengths can be obtained by blocking stellar photons with an occulter, either externally (a starshade) or internally (a coronagraph) to the telescope system, and managing diffracted starlight, so as to directly image the exoplanet in reflected starlight. Coronagraph instruments require advancement in telescope aperture (either monolithic or segmented), aperture obscurations (obscured by secondary mirror and its support struts), and wavefront error sensitivity (e.g. line-of-sight jitter, telescope vibration, polarization). The starshade, which has never been used in a science application, benefits a mission by being decoupled from the telescope, allowing a loosening of telescope stability requirements. In doing so, it transfers the difficult technology from the telescope system to a large deployable structure (tens of meters to greater than 100 m in diameter) that must be positioned precisely at a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers from the telescope. We describe in this paper a roadmap to achieving the technological capability to search for biosignatures on an Earth-like exoplanet from a future space telescope. Two of these studies, HabEx and LUVOIR, include the direct imaging of Earth-sized habitable exoplanets as a central science theme.

With the JWST Science and Operations Center co-located at STScI, JOST was developed to provide both a platform for staff training and to test alternate wavefront sensing and control strategies for independent validation or future improvements beyond the baseline operations. The design of JOST reproduces the physics of JWSTs three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) using three custom aspheric lenses. It provides similar quality image as JWST (80% Strehl ratio) over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module, but at 633 nm. An Iris AO segmented mirror stands for the segmented primary mirror of JWST. Actuators allow us to control (1) the 18 segments of the segmented mirror in piston, tip, tilt and (2) the second lens, which stands for the secondary mirror, in tip, tilt and x, y, z positions. We present the most recent experimental results for the segmented mirror alignment. Our implementation of the Wavefront Sensing (WFS) algorithms using phase diversity is tested on simulation and experimentally. The wavefront control (WFC) algorithms, which rely on a linear model for optical aberrations induced by misalignment of the secondary lens and the segmented mirror, are tested and validated both on simulations and experimentally. After alignment, JOST achieves 23 nm RMS WFE at 633 nm (RMS = lambda/28), which after accounting for the difference in design wavelengths, is comparable to the budgeted post-alignment WFE expected for JWST. We present the performance of the full active optic control loop in presence of perturbations on the segmented mirror, and we detail the quality of the alignment correction.

The Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) mission concept being assessed by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is expected to be 9 to 15 meters in diameter, have a segmented primary mirror and be diffraction limited at a wavelength of 500 nanometers. The optical stability is expected to be in the picometer range for minutes to hours. Architecture studies to support the NASA Science and Technology Definition teams (STDTs) are underway to evaluate systems performance. JWST is the closest analog to this mission concept but requires significant performance improvements to meet the science goals. To help define the technology needs and assess performance, a first order error budget has been developed. Like the JWST error budget, the error budget includes the active, adaptive and passive elements in spatial and temporal domains JWST performance is scaled using first order approximations where appropriate and includes technical advances in telescope control.

The telescope is designed specifically to operate with both a high contrast coronagraph and a starshade, enabling the direct optical detection of exoplanets as close as 70 mas from their star. The telescope will be equipped with cameras for exoplanetary system imaging and with spectrometers capable of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. Gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane have spectral lines in the visible and near infrared part of the spectrum and may indicate biological activity. In addition to the study of exoplanets, HabEx enables general astrophysics with two dedicated instruments. One instrument is a camera enabling imaging on a 3 arc minute field of view in two bands stretching from the UV to the near infrared. The same instrument can also be operated as a multi-object spectrograph, with resolution of 2000. A second instrument will be a high resolution UV spectrograph operating from 120 nm with up to 60,0000 resolution. We discuss the preliminary designs of the telescope and the optical instruments for the observatory.

The effects of space telescope primary mirror segment errors on coronagraph instrument performance	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VIII	AUG 06-07, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Coronagraph; Exoplanet; Wavefront; Segmented; Contrast		Direct imaging of potentially habitable planets is challenging because of the relative proximity of the planet to the star and the low flux ratio (typically well under 1e-9 in the visible) of the planet relative to the star. Future exoplanet direct imaging telescopes like the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) or the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) will hence require large collecting apertures with very low wavefront errors. The feasibility of these missions is in a large part dependent on the sensitivity of the achieved contrast at small working angles to imperfections and motions of the telescope optics. In past studies, we explored the effect of applying specific modes to segmented and monolith telescopes on the contrast leakage of a coronagraph. Here we present a revised analysis which, though not substantially different from the previous results, includes a mode careful theoretical examination of the issues involved. We conclude by highlighting the importance of the temporal characteristics of the errors.	[Nemati, Bijan] Univ Alabama, 301 Sparkman Dr,OPB400, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Stahl, Mark T.; Stahl, H.

Laser Metrology (MET) provides a different, complementary sensing method, one that can be used to measure changes in the alignment of the optics at high bandwidth, independent of the magnitude of the host star. Laser metrology measures changes in the separation of optical fiducial pairs, which can be separated by many meters. The principle of operations is similar to the laser metrology system used in LISA-Pathfinder to measure the in-orbit displacement between two test masses to a precision of similar to 10 picometers. In closed loop with actuators, MET actively maintains rigid body alignment of the front-end optics, thereby eliminating the dominant source of wavefront drift. In the case of a segmented, active primary mirror, MET provides six degrees of freedom sensing, replacing edge sensors. MET maintains wavefront control even during attitude maneuvers, such as slews between target stars, thereby avoiding the need to repeat time-consuming speckle suppression. These features can significantly improve the performance and observational efficiency of future large-aperture space telescopes equipped with internal coronagraphs. We evaluate MET trusses for various proposed monolithic and segmented space-based coronagraphs and present the performance requirements necessary to maintain contrast drift below 10(-11).

LUVOIR Backplane Thermal Architecture Development Through the Composite CTE Sensitivity Study	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VIII	AUG 06-07, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		LUVOIR; ATLAST; Thermal Distortion; pico-meter; Composite; CTE; CTE sensitivity; ULE; HST; JWST		The Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) is one of four 2020 Decadal Survey Missions, a concept for 'flag-ship' class space-borne observatory, operating across the multi-wavelength UV/Optical/NIR spectra. An Optical Telescope concept being considered is the segmented primary mirror architecture with composite backplane structure. In order to achieve the high-contrast imaging required to satisfy the primary science goals of this mission would require, roughly, 10 pico-meter wavefront RMS stability over a wavefront control time step of approximately 10 minutes. The LUVOIR primary mirror backplance support structure (PMBSS) requires active thermal management to maintain operational temperature while on orbit. Furthermore, the active thermal control must be sufficiently stable to prevent time-varying thermally induced distortions in the PMBSS. This paper describes a systematic approach to developing a thermal architecture of a modular composite section of the mirror support structure heavily guided by the sensitivity studies of the composite Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) values. Thermal and finite-element models, sensitivity studies against the absolute values and their variations of the composite CTE, the early findings from the thermal and thermal-distortion analyses are presented.

One of the key scientific objectives of the latter two is the detection and characterization of the earth-like planets around nearby stars using the direct imaging technique (along with a broad range of investigations regarding the architecture of and atmospheric composition exoplanetary systems using this technique). As a consequence dedicated exoplanet instruments are being studied for these mission concepts. This paper discusses the design of the coronagraph instrument for the architecture "A" (15 meters aperture) of LUVOIR. The material presented in this paper is aimed at providing an overview of the LUVOIR coronagraph instrument. It is the result of four months of discussions with various community stakeholders (scientists and technologists) regarding the instrument's basic parameters followed by meticulous design work by the the GSFC Instrument Design Laboratory team. In the first section we review the main science drivers, presents the overall parameters of the instrument (general architecture and backend instrument) and delve into the details of the currently envisioned coronagraph masks along with a description of the wavefront control architecture. Throughout the manuscript we describe the trades we made during the design process. Because the vocation of this study is to provide a baseline design for the most ambitious earth-like finding instrument that could be possibly launched into the 2030's, we have designed an complex system privileged that meets the ambitious science goals out team was chartered by the LUVOIR STDT exoplanet Working Group. However in an effort to minimize technological risk we tried to maximize the number of technologies that will be matured by the WFIRST coronagraph instruments.

This indicates that an alternative to autonomous self-deployment similar to that of the James Webb Space Telescope will eventually be required. Moreover, even before this size limit is reached, there will be significant motivation to service, repair, and upgrade in-space missions of all sizes, whether to extend the life of expensive facilities or to replace outworn or obsolete onboard systems as was demonstrated so effectively by the Hubble Space Telescope program. In parallel with these challenges to future major space astronomy missions, the capabilities of in-space robotic systems and the goals for human space flight in the 2020s and 2030s offer opportunities for achieving the most exciting science goals of the early 21st Century. In this paper, we summarize the history of concepts for human operations beyond the immediate vicinity of the Earth, the importance of very large apertures for scientific discovery, and current capabilities and future developments in robot-and astronaut-enabled servicing and assembly.

Here, we present a 23-year-old man undergoing surgical evaluation with left fronto-temporal electrocorticography (ECoG) and microelectrode-array (MEA) in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). We compare action-potential (AP) and local field potentials (LFP) recorded from MEA with ECoG. Seizure onset in the mesial-temporal lobe was characterized by changes in the pattern of AP-firing without clear changes in LFP or ECoG in MTG. This suggests simultaneous analysis of neuronal activity in differing spatial scales and frequency ranges provide complementary insights into how focal and network neurophysiological activity contribute to ictal activity.

We evaluate in detail the aperture efficiency that can be obtained with a spherical reflector with linearly polarized Gaussian beam illumination. A 100 GHz, 30 cm diameter spherical reflector from a parent sphere of 30 cm radius has been built and measured. The maximum directivity of 46.1 dB agrees closely with the predictions of electromagnetic modeling, as does the increase in the directivity by more than 3 dB resulting from moving the feed by 0.7 cm closer to the reflective surface relative to the paraxial focal point.

Phase-relationships between scales in the perturbed turbulent boundary layer	JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE			English	Article						Turbulent boundary layers; very-large-scale-motions	WALL TURBULENCE; ROUGHNESS-PERTURBATION; AMPLITUDE-MODULATION; FLOWS; CHANNEL; REGION; PIPE	The phase-relationship between large-scale motions and small-scale fluctuations in a non-equilibrium turbulent boundary layer was investigated. A zero-pressure-gradient flat plate turbulent boundary layer was perturbed by a short array of two-dimensional roughness elements, both statically, and under dynamic actuation. Within the compound, dynamic perturbation, the forcing generated a synthetic very-large-scale motion (VLSM) within the flow. The flow was decomposed by phase-locking the flow measurements to the roughness forcing, and the phase-relationship between the synthetic VLSM and remaining fluctuating scales was explored by correlation techniques. The general relationship between large- and small-scale motions in the perturbed flow, without phase-locking, was also examined. The synthetic large scale cohered with smaller scales in the flow via a phase-relationship that is similar to that of natural large scales in an unperturbed flow, but with a much stronger organizing effect. Cospectral techniques were employed to describe the physical implications of the perturbation on the relative orientation of large- and small-scale structures in the flow. The correlation and cospectral techniques provide tools for designing more efficient control strategies that can indirectly control small-scale motions via the large scales.

Protein engineering to increase the potential of a therapeutic antibody Fab for long-acting delivery to the eye	MABS			English	Article						age-related macular degeneration; isomerization; deamidation; stability; solubility; protein engineering; high concentration formulation; long-acting delivery	SINGLE INTRAVITREAL INJECTION; MACULAR DEGENERATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY; INTRAOCULAR PHARMACOKINETICS; ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY; RANIBIZUMAB; COMPLEMENT; FRAGMENT; ISOMERIZATION	To date, ocular antibody therapies for the treatment of retinal diseases rely on injection of the drug into the vitreous chamber of the eye. Given the burden for patients undergoing this procedure, less frequent dosing through the use of long-acting delivery (LAD) technologies is highly desirable. These technologies usually require a highly concentrated formulation and the antibody must be stable against extended exposure to physiological conditions. Here we have increased the potential of a therapeutic antibody antigen-binding fragment (Fab) for LAD by using protein engineering to enhance the chemical and physical stability of the molecule. Structure-guided amino acid substitutions in a negatively charged complementarity determining region (CDR-L1) of an anti-factor D (AFD) Fab resulted in increased chemical stability and solubility. A variant of AFD (AFD.v8), which combines light chain substitutions (VL-D28S:D30E:D31S) with a substitution (VH-D61E) to stabilize a heavy chain isomerization site, retained complement factor D binding and inhibition potency and has properties suitable for LAD. This variant was amenable to high protein concentration (>250 mg/mL), low ionic strength formulation suitable for intravitreal injection. AFD.v8 had acceptable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties upon intravitreal injection in rabbits, and improved stability under both formulation and physiological conditions. Simulations of expected human PK behavior indicated greater exposure with a 25-mg dose enabled by the increased solubility of AFD.v8.

A comparative study of nanovoid growth in FCC metals	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article						Non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics; thermo-mechanical coupling; nanovoids; finite temperature	NONLINEAR HYPERELASTIC STRUCTURES; DYNAMIC RELAXATION ALGORITHM; QUASI-CONTINUUM ANALYSIS; IRREVERSIBLE-PROCESSES; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; RECIPROCAL RELATIONS; FINITE-TEMPERATURE; INFORMATION-THEORY; SIMULATION; SINGLE	Previous HotQC studies of Cu nanovoids undergoing volumetric expansion conducted by the authors have uncovered a quasistatic-to-dynamic transition at a critical strain rate of the order of 10(8) s(-1). At low strain rates nanovoid expansion takes place under essentially isothermal conditions, whereas at high strain rates it happens under essential adiabatic conditions. In this paper, we present a comparative study concerned with two different scenarios, each representing a variation on the reference case presented in [1]: (i) aluminium (Al) nanovoids undergoing volumetric expansion; and (ii) copper (Cu) nanovoids undergoing uniaxial deformation. Scenario (i) addresses material specificity by replacing Cu by Al in the reference case, whereas scenario (ii) addresses the effect of triaxiality by replacing volumetric expansion by uniaxial expansion in the reference case. We find a distinct quasistatic-to-dynamic transition in both scenarios, which suggests that the transition is indeed universal, i.e. material and strain-triaxiality independent. By contrast, the fine structure of the dislocation mechanisms that mediate void growth are strongly material and loading specific.

The IMF is a key ingredient for simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and is used to calibrate star formation relations in extra-galactic observations. Modeling the IMF directly in hydrodynamical simulations has been attempted in several previous studies, but the most important processes that control the IMF remain poorly understood. This is because predicting the IMF from direct hydrodynamical simulations involves complex physics such as turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation feedback and mechanical feedback, all of which are difficult to model and the methods used have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, a physical interpretation of the simulated IMFs requires a numerically converged solution at high resolution, which has so far not been convincingly demonstrated. Here we present a resolution study of star cluster formation aimed at producing a converged IMF. We compare a set of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations with three different implementations of the thermodynamics of the gas: 1) with an isothermal equation of state (EOS), 2) with a polytropic EOS, and 3) with a simple stellar heating feedback model. We show that in the simulations with an isothermal or polytropic EOS, the number of stars and their mass distributions depend on the numerical resolution. By contrast, the simulations that employ the simple radiative feedback module demonstrate convergence in the number of stars formed and in their IMFs.

They were initially studied for many promising reasons: resolving the measurement problem, formulating a theory of quantum mechanics and gravity, and understanding the limits of standard quantum mechanics. However, certain non-linear theories have been experimentally tested and failed. More significantly, it has been shown that, in general, deterministic non-linear theories can be used for superluminal communication. We highlight another serious issue: the distribution of measurement results predicted by non-linear quantum mechanics depends on the formulation of quantum mechanics. In other words, Born's rule cannot be uniquely extended to non-linear quantum mechanics. We present these generalizations of Born's rule, and then examine whether some exclude superluminal communication. We determine that a large class do not allow for superluminal communication, but many lack a consistent definition. Nonetheless, we find a single extension of Born's rule with a sound operational definition, and that does not exhibit superluminal communication. The non-linear time-evolution leading to a certain measurement event is driven by the state conditioned on measurements that lie within the past light cone of that event.

The annual fluxes from its sources and sinks are investigated using a 3-D chemistry transport model, STOCHEM-CRI. In terms of the flux analysis, the oxidation of CS2 by OH is found to be the main removal process (76-88% of the total loss) and the dry deposition loss contributes 11-24% to the total loss of CS2. The global burden of CS2 was calculated, varying between 6.1 to 19.2 Tg and the lifetime of CS2 was determined to be within the range of 2.8-3.4 days. The global distribution of CS2 found the Northern Hemisphere (NH) continental landmasses to be the areas of concentration maxima with peak concentrations reaching up to 20 ppt during June-July-August (J-J-A) season and 40 ppt during December-January-February (D-J-F) season in anthropogenic source regions. Oceanic regions returned low CS2 levels of less than 2 ppt. The vertical profile of CS2 shows higher levels up to 3 ppt at 30 degrees N-45 degrees N during J-J-A and up to 4 ppt at 30 degrees N-55 degrees N during D-J-F. The oxidation of CS2 by OH can produce a substantial amount (0.58 Tg/yr) of atmospheric OCS and the annual average surface distribution of this flux shows up to 6 Gg/yr OCS formed in the regions with highest anthropogenic pollution (e.g.,South east Asia). In general, the model-measurement comparison reveals an underprediction of model CS2 compared with measured CS2 for most of the regions. It is likely that the emissions of CS2 are being underestimated and there are likely much larger emission sources of atmospheric CS2 than previously suggested.

This chapter brings together several actors and stakeholders in these developments to discuss their drivers and implications. All types of data are considered: official data, data collected by researchers, lab experiments, randomized control trials, and proprietary data from private and public sources. When relevant, emphasis is placed on developments specific to Europe. The basic message of the chapter is that there is no single type of data that is superior to all others. We need to promote diversity of data sources for economic research and ensure that researchers are equipped to take advantage of them. All stakeholders - researchers, research institutions, funders, statistical agencies, central banks, journals, data firms, and policy-makers - have a role to play in this.

Despite the huge efforts made for localization using smartphone inertial sensors, its performance is still unsatisfactory in large open areas, such as halls, supermarkets, and museums, due to accumulated errors arising from the uncertainty of users' mobility and fluctuations of magnetic field. Regarding that, this paper presents iBILL, an indoor localization approach that jointly uses iBeacon and inertial sensors in large open areas. With users' real-time locations estimated by inertial sensors through an improved particle filter, we revise the algorithm of augmented particle filter to cope with fluctuations of magnetic field. When users enter vicinity of iBeacon devices clusters, their locations are accurately determined based on received signal strength of iBeacon devices, and accumulated errors can, therefore, be corrected. Proposed by Apple Inc. for developing LBS market, iBeacon is a type of Bluetooth low energy, and we characterize both the advantages and limitations of localization when it is utilized. Moreover, with the help of iBeacon devices, we also provide solutions of two localization problems that have long remained tough due to the increasingly large computational overhead and arbitrarily placed smartphones. Through extensive experiments in the library on our campus, we demonstrate that iBILL exhibits 90% errors within 3.5 m in large open areas.

Relationship between SST gradients and upwelling off Peru and Chile: model/satellite data analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE SST; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM; OCEAN; MODEL	The upwelling system off Peru/Chile is characterized by significant mesoscale to submesoscale surface variability that results from the instability of the coastal currents (due to the strong vertical and horizontal shears) and to the marked density cross-shore gradients (associated with the mean upwelling). Here we investigate to what extent upwelling intensity can be inferred from sea surface temperature (SST) derived from remote sensing. As a first step in validation, a comparison between SST observations is performed, which indicates that the 1 km gridded multi-scale ultra-high-resolution (MUR) SST data set is defining a zone of maximum SST gradients closer to shore than the low-resolution National Centers for Environmental Information 0.25 degrees resolution data set. Two model versions, at nominal resolutions of 2 km and 4 km, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model are analysed. A high-resolution version at 2 km is examined for the period 13 September 2011-23 January 2013, while a 4 km version is examined for 6 March 2011-22 April 2013. MUR shows maxima SST gradients in the range of 0.03 +/- 0.02 K km(-1) while the model showed higher gradients around 0.05 +/- 0.02 K km(-1). Based on coherence spectra, the relationship between upwelling rate (as inferred from the vertical velocity) and SST gradient is documented in the model from intraseasonal to annual timescales. It suggests that changes in SST gradient magnitudes are related to changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling off Peru and Chile. Such a relationship between SST gradients and vertical velocity would allow for the use of satellite-derived SSTs to monitor the intensity	[Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge; Torres, Hector S.; Menemenlis, Dimitris; Chin, Toshio; Armstrong, Edward M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA	Vazquez-Cuervo, J (corresponding author), M-S 300-323,3800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

These interactions are often mediated by protein interaction domains that enable proteins to recognize their interaction partners, often by binding to short peptide motifs. For example, PDZ domains, which are among the most common protein interaction domains in the human proteome, recognize specific linear peptide sequences that are often at the C-terminus of other proteins. Determining the set of peptide sequences that a protein interaction domain binds, or it's "peptide specificity," is crucial for understanding its cellular function, and predicting how mutations impact peptide specificity is important for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human diseases. Moreover, engineering novel cellular functions for synthetic biology applications, such as the biosynthesis of biofuels or drugs, requires the design of protein interaction specificity to avoid crosstalk with native metabolic and signaling pathways. The ability to accurately predict and design protein-peptide interaction specificity is therefore critical for understanding and engineering biological function. One approach that has recently been employed toward accomplishing this goal is computational protein design. This chapter provides an overview of recent methodological advances in computational protein design and highlights examples of how these advances can enable increased accuracy in predicting and designing peptide specificity.

Effect of Displacement Damage on Tantalum Oxide Resistive Memory	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							RADIATION; MEMRISTORS; TAOX	The radiation environment of space poses a challenge for electronic systems, in particular flash memory, which contains multiple radiation-sensitive parts. Resistive memory (RRAM) devices have the potential to replace flash memory, functioning as an inherently radiation resistant memory device. Several studies indicate significant radiation resistance in RRAM devices to a broad range of radiation types and doses. In this study, we focus on the effect of displacement damage on tantalum oxide-based RRAM devices, as this form of damage is likely a worst-case scenario. An Ar+ (170 keV) ion beam was used to minimize any contribution from ionization damage, maximizing the effect of displacement damage. Fluence levels were chosen to generate enough oxygen vacancies such that devices in the high resistance state (HRS) would likely switch to the low resistance state (LRS). More than half of devices tested at the highest fluence level (1.43E13 ions/cm(2)) switched from HRS to LRS. The devices were then switched for 50 set/reset cycles, after which the radiation-induced resistance shift disappeared. These results suggest that device switching may mitigate radiation damage by accelerating oxygen vacancy-interstitial recombination.

This allows three-dimensional reconstruction from a two-dimensional image. This is applicable to the tasks of fast motion capture, particle tracking etc. Sampling high resolution holograms yields a spatiotemporal tradeoff. We spatially subsample holograms to increase temporal resolution. We demonstrate this idea with two subsampling techniques, periodic and uniformly random sampling. The implementation includes an on-chip setup for periodic subsampling and a DMD (Digital Micromirror Device)-based setup for pixel-wise random subsampling. The on-chip setup enables direct increase of up to 20 in camera frame rate. Alternatively, the DMD-based setup encodes temporal information as high-speed mask patterns, and projects these masks within a single exposure (coded exposure). This way, the frame rate is improved to the level of the DMD with a temporal gain of 10. The reconstruction of sub sampled data using the aforementioned setups is achieved in two ways. We examine and compare two iterative reconstruction methods. One is an error reduction phase retrieval and the other is sparsity-based compressed sensing algorithm.

The electromagnetic fields are calculated by numerical solutions of 3D Maxwell equations (NMM3D) using the method of Foldy Lax multiple scattering equations combined with the method of the body of revolution (BOR). Using the calculated transmission, we derive, the "tau", the optical thickness, which describes the magnitude of the transmission. Two cases are considered: the short-cylinder case and the extended-cylinder case. The case of short cylinders is that the lengths of cylinders are much smaller than the layer thickness, while the case of extended cylinders is that the lengths of the cylinders are the same as or comparable to the layer thickness. Numerical results are illustrated for vertically polarized plane waves obliquely incident on the layer of cylinders. The NMM3D results for the extended-cylinder case show large differences of transmission from the results of the other approaches, such as the effective permittivity (EP), the distorted Born approximation (DBA), and the radiative transfer equation (RTE). For the case of short cylinders, the NMM3D results are in close agreement with those of EP, DBA, and RIB.

CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) NASA InVEST Technology Demonstration	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS XLIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications XLIII	APR 09-13, 2017	Anaheim, CA	SPIE		Infrared; Sounding; CubeSat; Grating; Spectrometer		Infrared sounders measure the upwelling radiation of the Earth in the Midwave Infrared (MWIR) and Longwave Infrared (LWIR) region of the spectrum with global daily coverage from space. The observed radiances are assimilated into weather forecast models and used to retrieve lower tropospheric temperature and water vapor for climate studies. There are several operational sounders today including the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on Aqua, the Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on Suomi NPP and JPSS, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on the MetOp spacecraft. The CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) is a NASA In-flight Validation of Earth Science Technologies (InVEST) program to demonstrate three new instrument technologies in an imaging sounder configuration. The first is a 2D array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The detectors are hybridized to a commercial ROIC and commercial camera electronics. The second technology is a MWIR Grating Spectrometer (MGS) designed to provide imaging spectroscopy for atmospheric sounding in a CubeSat volume. The MGS employs an immersion grating or grism, has no moving parts, and is based on heritage spectrometers including the OCO-2. The third technology is a Black Silicon infrared blackbody calibration target. The Black Silicon offers very low reflectance over a broad spectral range on a flat surface and is more robust than carbon nanotubes. JPL will also develop the mechanical, electronic and thermal subsystems for the CIRAS payload. The spacecraft will be a commercially available CubeSat. The integrated system will be a complete 6U CubeSat capable of measuring temperature and water vapor profiles with good lower tropospheric sensitivity. The low cost of CIRAS enables multiple units to be flown to improve temporal coverage or measure 3D Atmospheric Motion Vector (AMV) winds. CIRAS will launch in 2019 and is only a technology demonstration. However, what we learn will benefit future instruments that support operational weather forecasting and climate studies.

Here we study photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime of this InAsSb/InSb digital alloy. While increasing temperature from 15 K to 40 K we show a 14 meV blue shift of the photoluminescence peak energy and a decrease in lifetime. This deviation from the expected Varshni empirical relation indicates strong carrier localization. We contrast to photoluminescence and lifetime results in bulk InAsSb. We discuss implications of this localization for design of digital alloy InAsSb/InSb nBn detectors.

The three categories of technologies include organic multichip modules (MCMs), ceramic leadless surface mount technology (SMT) and 3D printed waveguide structures. There are many other packaging technologies that currently exist but these three were selected in part due to their heritage in various commercial, military and space applications along with each having a relatively clear path to flight. For each of these technologies, detailed examples will be included in which hardware has been fabricated and tested for use in RF electronics for spacecraft transponders. The organic MCM example will be described in most detail and it utilizes a packaging technology by the name of CoreEZ which is a trademark of i3 Electronics. This MCM has shrunk a portion of our electronics down to 1/8th of its previous area. The CoreEZ technology has been shown to be rad hard beyond a total ionizing dose (TID) of 300kRad and the MCM which was fabricated has gone through thermal cycling and shown to have no degradation in performance. The ceramic leadless package examples include packages from high reliability manufactures by the name of KCB solutions and Barry Industries. In the case of KCB solutions, we have multiple products that will be described including a hermetic ceramic carrier which houses three microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) along with small discrete components. Finally, we will discuss the results of our search for a 3D printing process that allows us to reduce the cost and volume of our waveguide filters and diplexers for low cost small satellite applications. We have fabricated a few prototypes using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and metal coated plastics. Each of these packaging technology discussions will have a brief overview of its current and future use.

Radio emission from CMEs is a direct tracer of the particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere and potential magnetic connections from the lower solar corona to the larger heliosphere. These questions are among those highlighted in the current Solar Decadal Servey, e.g., "Discover and characterize fundamental processes that occur both within the heliosphere and throughout the Universe." Furthermore, CME radio emission is quite strong, such that only a relatively small number of antennas is required, and a small mission would make a fundamental advancement in our scientific understanding. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art for tracking CME radio emission is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES) in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping. This type of heliophysics mission has been studied several times in the past, but had so far been found to be cost prohibitive, due to the inherent complexity of building multiple spacecraft and flying them in constellation. However, with the increased popularity and success of CubeSat concepts, accompanied by the miniaturization of subsystem components, a range of missions are now being enabled at lower cost than ever before. The paper presents the science requirements for a Small Explorer (SMEX)-class (typically < similar to$100M, including all lifecycle costs) mission concept, and walks through the major features of the SunRISE mission study. SunRISE is composed of six 6U (where 1U is defined as a 10 by 10 by 10cm form-factor) CubeSats placed in an orbit slightly above the Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) to achieve the aforementioned science goals. The spacecraft fly in a passive formation, which allows them to form an interferometer while minimizing the impact on operations complexity. The paper provides an overview of the mission and spacecraft design, as well as the concept of operations for the mission. Finally, it discusses how the SunRISE mission concept could serve as a stepping stone in demonstrating space-based interferometry and enable more complex mission concepts in the future.

An areostationary Relay Satellite is expected to be used for future communication network for the exploration of Mars. An areostationary Relay Satellite at 17,000 km above Mars surface is always in the same place in the sky on Mars, receiving data from the rovers/landers and low Mars orbiters and transmitting it to an Earth station. The areostationary satellite enables almost all time communication, except for certain durations when Mars is in between the areostationary Relay Satellite and the Earth. In this paper we define a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system between various assets such as rovers/landers on Mars surface, low Mars orbiters such as MRO, CubeSats in vicinity of Mars, and an areostationary relay satellite at 17,000 km above Mars surface. We assume data rates between 50 Kbps and 1 Mbps operating at 8.40 GHz frequency. We define the transmit power, antenna size, and data rates for the assets communicating with the areostationary relay satellite. Since the areostationary relay satellite simultaneously receives data from many users we have chosen the code division multiple access (CDMA) as a multiple access scheme, which does not require time/frequency coordination among users. Furthermore we compute the link budgets for various communication links, we define the modulation format, the PN spreading and chip rates. We provide a new theoretical analysis for multiuser interference, and simulate the performance of coded CDMA communication system. For coded system we use standard CCSDS LDPC codes proposed by NASA for space applications. Using CDMA, the communication structure of all assets on Mars operates at one single RF frequency. However the initial states of spreading PN codes assigned to users are different such that if all users communicate simultaneously with the areostationary relay satellite over a given band will have low cross correlation that reduces the multiuser interference.

As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in space exploration, the communication systems currently implemented will need to be improved to support those missions. One of the bottlenecks is the antennas' size, due to the close relation between antenna gain and dimensions. Hence, a possible solution is to develop inflatable antennas which can be packaged efficiently, occupying a small amount of space, and they can provide, once deployed, large dish dimension and correspondent gain. A prototype of a 1 m inflatable antenna for X-Band has been developed in a joint effort between JPL and ASU. After initial photogrammetry tests and radiation tests, it was discovered that the design was not able to meet the required gain. As a result, a new design, based on a spherical inflatable membrane, is proposed. This new design will allow reaching a more stable inflatable surface, hence improving the electromagnetic performance. This paper will detail the principle challenges in developing this new antenna focusing on: design, EM analysis, fabrication and tests.

The goal of the LunaH-Map mission is to map the hydrogen content of the entire South Pole of the moon, including permanently shadowed regions at high resolution. The spacecraft is a 6 U CubeSat and the main instrument is a neutron spectrometer which will be used to perform the measurements required to accomplish the primary science objective. Once LunaH-Map reaches the Moon, the spacecraft will perform a 60-day science mission, consisting of 141 science orbits during which the measurements will be taken. In the design of the LunaH-Map spacecraft, one of the main challenges is the telecommunication system as the spacecraft needs the ability to relay data during the long cruise phase and during the science phase. In addition, the telecommunication system needs to support the main navigation functions required to reach the Moon and to insert in the highly elliptical orbit required for the science phase. This paper covers the main aspects of the telecommunication design for the mission including: link and coverage analysis, waveform selection and spectral constraints, hardware selection and ground station coordination.

S	Bahrami, P; Nesmith, B; Carpenter, K			IEEE	Bahrami, Poyan; Nesmith, Bill; Carpenter, Kalind			Milli-watt Radioisotope Power to Enable Small, Long-Term Robotic "Probe" Space Exploration	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Milli-watt Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) based on Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs) could be an ideal power source for certain spacecraft that cannot use solar power due to large distances from the sun, or other environmental constraints, and where they enable or significantly enhance the ability of a mission to meet its scientific or operational goals. Various modular, compact RHU-based thermoelectric (TE) generator concepts developed or derived from current NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects satisfying this need have been investigated. These modular, compact and low mass power systems could support small, highly-mobile robotic exploration packages, and could be incorporated into different robotic package concepts, spacecraft or satellites. Current modular RPS design concepts with 40mW, 80mW and 120mW power levels use RHUs and Bi2Te3 TE converters. Skutterudites materials could be used in the future if new higher thermal energy output and higher temperature miniature heat sources were developed, for example, using technologies currently in the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) used in higher electric power output RTGs. Small (a.k.a., "mice-like") robotic packages could effectively utilize these RHU-driven power levels to accommodate crawling, climbing, monitoring, taking measurements, and communicating during long-term planetary missions aimed at gathering environmental and geologic data (i.e., over multiple decades). Waste heat from the cold side of the TE converter could also be directed toward the electronics and / or energy storage (e.g. batteries) to keep them within design temperature ranges. In addition to power generation and electronics / battery heating, the RHU / TE configuration could be designed to survive an external 500 degrees C bake out procedure for critical spacecraft sterilization, environmental certification and planetary protection. Analytical studies have been performed to optimize various design configurations for power, mass, volume and robotic mobility. Specific power (mW/kg) and volumetric specific power (mW/cm(3)) characteristics of various design configurations will be presented and key conceptual design tradeoffs will be discussed. Hot-and cold-side thermal interfaces required to meet power and mass goals and associated design sensitivities will also be discussed. RHU / TE systems must overcome critical design challenges to survive high-g loadings in some robotic applications and we will examine the mass impacts required to satisfy various dynamic loading environments up to 10,000 g's. Power can be generated for a minimum of 30 years or more using plutonium-238 dioxide heat sources (given that Pu-238 has an 87.7 year half-life) with some reduction in power as the heat source naturally degrades.

The outer solar system, in particular, poses a challenge for lower mission cost as the principal need for a robotic craft -a source of energy -is difficult to supply through conventional means (solar energy). Even as far from the Sun as Saturn, the solar energy density is only 1% of that at Earth. Not viewed typically as a power source for low-cost missions, radioisotope power systems (RPS) may well fill that role by providing power to small spacecraft in the outer solar system. And the outer solar system beckons with extremely compelling science. The rich dynamics of the atmospheres of the gas giants are continuously operating laboratories of extreme weather processes, examples of which in miniaturized scale may become more familiar here on Earth. Enceladus, a small moon of Saturn, has been seen by the Cassini mission to be a site of continuous high geologic activity, with plumes of water vapor and particles pumped hundreds of kilometers above the surface, indeed into Saturn orbit. The internal heating mechanisms of this activity beg for explanation, and more importantly, initial measurements by the Cassini spacecraft give tantalizing clues that the geo-thermal source of the heating is, in fact, maintaining a global sub-surface ocean, which in combination could provide a habitat for life. This paper will explore how existing and currently available RPS elements may make mission concepts to explore the intriguing science of Enceladus economically tractable, and at the same time provide a generic platform for other small but highly capable spacecraft to explore the outer solar system.

The 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey, Vision and Voyages, states: "Because of this ocean's potential suitability for life, Europa is one of the most important targets in all of planetary science." Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the planned Europa Mission. This exploration is intimately tied to understanding the three "ingredients" for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy. The Europa Mission would investigate these ingredients by comprehensively exploring Europa's ice shell and liquid ocean interface, surface geology and surface composition to glean insight into the inner workings of this fascinating moon. In addition, a lander mission is seen as a possible future step, but current data about the Jovian radiation environment and about potential landing site hazards and potential safe landing zones is insufficient. Therefore an additional goal of the mission would be to characterize the radiation environment near Europa and investigate scientifically compelling sites for hazards, to inform a potential future landed mission. The Europa Mission envisions sending a flight system, consisting of a spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific instruments, to execute numerous flybys of Europa while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge is that the flight system must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh at Europa. The innovative design of this multiple-flyby tour is an enabling feature of this mission: by minimizing the time spent in the radiation environment the spacecraft complexity and cost has been significantly reduced compared to previous mission concepts. The spacecraft would launch from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, on a NASA supplied launch vehicle, no earlier than 2022. The formulation and implementation of the proposed mission is led by a joint Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. In June 2015, NASA announced the selection of a highly capable suite of 10 scientific investigations to be flown on the Europa Mission. Since the announcement, the Europa Mission Team has updated the spacecraft design in order to fully accommodate this instrument suite - a significant challenge. After completing a successful System Requirements Review and Mission Definition Review in January of 2017, the project is currently transitioning from the concept development phase to the preliminary design phase of the mission. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Mission since 2015, including maturation of the spacecraft design, requirements, system analyses, and mission trajectories.

EDL trajectories with SRP enable landing larger masses on Mars than those possible using aerodynamic decelerators only. For manned missions to Mars, SRP will be a necessary technology, given the high ballistic coefficients that the entry vehicles require. Trajectories using SRP as the only means of terminal deceleration possess specific characteristics that require a tailored strategy and guidance algorithms, both of which are outlined in this paper.
