New frequency multiplier chips have been designed and fabricated in the 100 GHz to 1 THz range focusing on higher power operation. Initial tests have shown efficiencies of around 30% for a single-chip 105-120 GHz tripler, and 25% for a singlechip 170-200 GHz doubler, when pumped with 500 mW. These results correspond to a factor of 2-3 improvement with regards to previous designs at these frequencies. Similar improvements are expected for the new designs at higher frequencies.

The RTGx software, when used in conjunction with JPL's Global Differential GPS System (GDGPS), can be configured for real-t ime kinematic Precise Point Positioning (K-PPP) for centimeter-level positioning accuracy. Since 2006, RTGx's predecessor, RTG, has provided operational real-time K-PPP for NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) repeat pass interferometry mission on campaigns all over the world. While RTG's GPS-only data processing is meeting mission requirements during nominal science operations, its performance naturally degrades during certain flight scenarios, such as abrupt changes in the aircraft attitude or high banking turns, which induce signal loss-of-lock, carrier-phase breaks and/or cycle slips. During these periods, the well-known downsides of K-PPP, including the position solution's sensitivity to phase breaks and slow convergence after loss-of-lock become apparent, and may impact the instruments critical data take periods. Therefore, tightly-coupled INS has been integrated into RTGx to offer additional robustness. This paper discusses the adopted INS formulation and uses the flight data made available to the community by the National Geodetic Survey's Kinematic Challenge (Damiani et al., 2013) to offer an experimental performance evaluation. The integration of INS in RTGx is shown to provide solution improvements both in terms of accuracy and precision with respect to a post-processed ambiguity-fixed reference solution. Furthermore, the integration of INS into the RTGx software will enable RTGx to support new application domains.

The super-A polynomial is a two-parameter deformation of the A-polynomial known from knot theory or Chern-Simons theory with SL(2, C) gauge group. The two parameters of the super-A-polynomial encode, respectively, the t-deformation which leads to the "refined A-polynomial", and the Q-deformation which leads to the augmentation polynomial of knot contact homology. For a given knot, the super-A-polynomial encodes the asymptotics of the corresponding S-r-colored HOMFLY homology for large r, while the quantum super-A polynomial provides recursion relations for such homology theories for each r. The super-A-polynomial also admits a simple physical interpretation as the defining equation for the space of SUSY vacua in a circle compactification of the effective 3d N = 2 theory associated to a given knot (complement). We discuss properties of super-A-polynomials and illustrate them in many examples.

The resulting mesh and its texture can then directly be edited in post-production. Our method makes no assumption on the costumes or accessories present in the recording. We take as input a raw sequence of volumetric static poses reconstructed from video sequences acquired in a multi-viewpoint chroma-key studio. The first frame is chosen as the reference mesh. An iterative approach is applied throughout the sequence in order to induce a deformation of the reference mesh for all input frames. At first, a pseudo-rigid transformation adjusts the pose to match the input visual hull as closely as possible. Then, local deformation is added to reconstruct fine details. We provide examples of actors' performance inserted into virtual scenes, including dynamic interaction with the environment.

In this paper, a UHD image reconstruction algorithm is proposed for the UHDTV broadcasting system. A transmitted HD image at the receiver side is first up sampled to UHD resolution, then the error map between the interpolated UHD image and the original UHD image is estimated. The final reconstructed UHD image is the sum of the interpolated UHD image and the estimated UHD error map. There are two steps to estimate the content of the UHD error map: 1) key point detection and prediction estimate the location of the pixels with large error and create a spline tube between two adjacent key points; 2) spline-tube interpolation estimate the error value along the spline tube. Our simulation results on six images show that the proposed reconstruction method performs better than conventional up sampling without estimating the error map.

Significant progress has been made over the last several years in utilizing single platforms with a number of newly miniaturized instruments appropriate to aircraft with sub-500 gm payloads. For example, we have been mapping the SO2-water-vapor plume at Turrialba, for comparison with NASA spacecraft-based (e.g., ASTER) data, and are measuring diffuse CO2 emissions over the volcano's flanks, as well as in and near its eruption column. Future work will include devising strategies, platforms, and instrumentation for deployments of multiple UAV formations ("swarms") as 2D and 3D time-series meshes, to better characterize the mass fluxes and dynamics of emissions. We plan to undertake test flights in the United States, as well as at Turrialba and Poas Volcanoes in Costa Rica. Our most immediate aims are to improve characterizations of local emissions for mitigation of proximal volcanic hazards and for validation of abundance retrievals and transport models based on orbital data. Overall, of course, we strive to better understand how volcanoes work, specifically to better constrain estimates of global SO2 and CO2 perennial (diffuse) and event-related (eruptive) emissions-changes in which may foster regional and global climate perturbations.

Deep earthquakes are located in a scattered pattern southeast of Peistareykir at 8-20 km depth (b.s.l.). Although not associated with detectable surface uplift they may be caused by high strain rates within the plastic regime of the crust in the vicinity of the Husavik-Flatey transform fault system or due to reduced normal friction caused by melt movements at depth.

We find that the use of higher-order schemes improves substantially the quality of the gravitational waveforms extracted from the simulations when compared to those computed using traditional second-order schemes. The reduced de phasing and the faster convergence rate allow us to estimate the phase evolution of the gravitational waves emitted, as well as the magnitude of finite-resolution effects, without the need of phase- or time-alignments or rescalings of the waves, as sometimes done in other works. Furthermore, by using an additional unpublished simulation at very high resolution, we confirm the robustness of our high convergence order of 3.2.

The NOvA simulation chain	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2015), PARTS 1-9	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	APR 13-17, 2015	Okinawa, JAPAN					The NOvA experiment is a two-detector, long-baseline neutrino experiment operating in the recently upgraded NuMI muon neutrino beam. Simulating neutrino interactions and backgrounds requires many steps including: the simulation of the neutrino beam flux using FLUKA and the FLUGG interface; cosmic ray generation using CRY; neutrino interaction modeling using GENIE; and a simulation of the energy deposited in the detector using GEANT4. To shorten generation time, the modeling of detector-specific aspects, such as photon transport, detector and electronics noise, and readout electronics, employs custom, parameterized simulation applications. We will describe the NOvA simulation chain, and present details on the techniques used in modeling photon transport near the ends of cells, and in developing a novel data-driven noise simulation. Due to the high intensity of the NuMI beam, the Near Detector samples a high rate of muons originating in the surrounding rock. In addition, due to its location on the surface at Ash River, MN, the Far Detector collects a large rate 0140 kHz) of cosmic muons. We will discuss the methods used in NOvA for overlaying rock muons and cosmic ray muons with simulated neutrino interactions and show how realistically the final simulation reproduces the preliminary NOvA data.

Data handling with SAM and art at the NO nu A experiment	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2015), PARTS 1-9	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	APR 13-17, 2015	Okinawa, JAPAN					During operations, NOvA produces between 5,000 and 7,000 raw files per day with peaks in excess of 12,000. These files must be processed in several stages to produce fully calibrated and reconstructed analysis files. In addition, many simulated neutrino interactions must be produced and processed through the same stages as data. To accommodate the large volume of data and Monte Carlo, production must be possible both on the Fermilab grid and on off-site farms, such as the ones accessible through the Open Science Grid. To handle the challenge of cataloging these files and to facilitate their off-line processing, we have adopted the SAM system developed at Fermilab. SAM indexes files according to metadata, keeps track of each file's physical locations, provides dataset management facilities, and facilitates data transfer to off-site grids. To integrate SAM with Fermilab's art software framework and the NOvA production workflow, we have developed methods to embed metadata into our configuration files, art files, and standalone ROOT files. A module in the art framework propagates the embedded information from configuration files into art files, and from input art files to output art files, allowing us to maintain a complete processing history within our files. Embedding metadata in configuration files also allows configuration files indexed in SAM to be used as inputs to Monte Carlo production jobs. Further, SAM keeps track of the input files used to create each output file. Parentage information enables the construction of self-draining datasets which have become the primary production paradigm used at NOvA. In this paper we will present an overview of SAM at NOvA and how it has transformed the file production framework used by the experiment.

A data summary file structure and analysis tools for neutrino oscillation analysis at the NOvA experiment	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2015), PARTS 1-9	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	APR 13-17, 2015	Okinawa, JAPAN					The NuMI Off-axis Neutrino Experiment (NOvA) is designed to study neutrino oscillations in the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) is currently being upgraded to provide 700 kW for NOvA. A 14 kt Far Detector in Ash River, MN and a functionally identical 0.3 kt Near Detector at Fermilab are positioned 810 km apart in the NuMI beam line. The fine granularity of the NOvA detectors provides a detailed representation of particle trajectories. The data volume associated with such granularity, however, poses problems for analyzing data with ease and speed. NOvA has developed a data summary file structure which discards the full event record in favor of higher-level reconstructed information. A general-purpose framework for neutrino oscillation measurements has been developed for analysis of these data summary files. We present the design methodology for this new file format as well as the analysis framework and the role it plays in producing NOvA physics results.

During the RunI of LHC (2010-2012), CMS has produced over 12 Billion simulated events, organized in approximately sixty different campaigns each emulating specific detector conditions and LHC running conditions (pile up). In order to aggregate the information needed for the configuration and prioritization of the events production, assure the book-keeping of all the processing requests placed by the physics analysis groups, and to interface with the CMS production infrastructure, the web based service Monte Carlo Management (McM) has been developed and put in production in 2013. McM is based on recent server infrastructure technology (CherryPy AngularJS) and relies on a CouchDB database back-end. This contribution covers the one and half year of operational experience managing samples of simulated events for CMS, the evolution of its functionalities and the extension of its capability to monitor the status and advancement of the events production.

ANSE Project	Virtual Circuits in PhEDEx, an update from the ANSE project	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2015), PARTS 1-9	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	APR 13-17, 2015	Okinawa, JAPAN					The ANSE project has been working with the CMS and ATLAS experiments to bring network awareness into their middleware stacks. For CMS, this means enabling control of virtual network circuits in PhEDEx, the CMS data-transfer management system. PhEDEx orchestrates the transfer of data around the CMS experiment to the tune of 1 PB per week spread over about 70 sites. The goal of ANSE is to improve the overall working efficiency of the experiments, by enabling more deterministic time to completion for a designated set of data transfers, through the use of end-to-end dynamic virtual circuits with guaranteed bandwidth. ANSE has enhanced PhEDEx, allowing it to create, use and destroy circuits according to it's own needs. PhEDEx can now decide if a circuit is worth creating based on its current workload and past transfer history, which allows circuits to be created only when they will be useful. This paper reports on the progress made by ANSE in PhEDEx. We show how PhEDEx is now capable of using virtual circuits as a production-quality service, and describe how the mechanism it uses can be refactored for use in other software domains. We present first results of transfers between CMS sites using this mechanism, and report on the stability and performance of PhEDEx when using virtual circuits. The ability to use dynamic virtual circuits for prioritised large-scale data transfers over shared global network infrastructures represents an important new capability and opens many possibilities. The experience we have gained with ANSE is being incorporated in an evolving picture of future LHC Computing Models, in which the network is considered as an explicit component. Finally, we describe the remaining work to be done by ANSE in PhEDEx, and discuss future directions for continued development.

The DAQ system readouts the more than 344,000 detector channels and assembles the information into an raw unfiltered high bandwidth data stream. The NOvA trigger systems operate in parallel to the readout and asynchronously to the primary DAQ readout/event building chain. The data driven triggering systems for NOvA are unique in that they examine long contiguous time windows of the high resolution readout data and enable the detector to be sensitive to a wide range of physics interactions from those with fast, nanosecond scale signals up to processes with long delayed coincidences between hits which occur at the tens of milliseconds time scale. The trigger system is able to achieve a true 100% live time for the detector, making it sensitive to both beam spill related and off-spill physics.	[Norman, A.; Ding, P.

The challenges presented by expanding needs for CPU, storage and network capacity as well as rapid handling of large datasets of file and object collections have pointed the way towards future more agile pervasive models that make best use of highly distributed heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we explore the use of Named Data Networking (NDN), a new Internet architecture focusing on content rather than the location of the data collections. As NDN has shown considerable promise in another data intensive field, Climate Science, we discuss the similarities and differences between the Climate and HEP use cases, along with specific issues HEP faces and will face during LHC Run2 and beyond, which NDN could address.

Heartbeat stars are eccentric ellipsoidal variables that undergo strong tidal interactions when the stars are almost in contact at the time of closest approach. These interactions deform of the stars and cause a notable light curve variation in the form of a tidal pulse. A subset of these objects (similar to 20%) show prominent tidally induced pulsations: pulsations forced by the binary orbit. We now have a fully functional code that models binary star features (using PHOEBE) and stellar pulsations simultaneously, enabling a complete and accurate heartbeat star model to be determined.

Among multiple components of the research, the Dense Sampling Method with the Rosette Transform enables a new method to process coarse-resolution satellite scatterometer data into a 1-km posting to delineate urban extent on the basis of physical infrastructures, rather than arbitrary boundaries from political or administrative definitions. Scatterometer data from the QuikSCAT satellite are processed for all 29 mega cities across the world. Results reveal an urban mega agglomeration of connected cities along a swath extending over 450 km from the Pacific coast to the internal land.	[Nghiem, S.

The main importance is given by two key factors: the exploitement of rich SAR data archives and the development of processing techniques able to extract information from these datasets. InSAR time series techniques such as permanent scatterers (PS) or SBAS have proven capable of estimating displacements to with 1 mm precision for targets that show a stable electromagnetic signature. At the same time the availability of SAR constellations with a reduced revisit time, such as the X band COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X/PAZ satellites, has reduced the minimum detectable deformation gradient between two neighboring points and improved the theoretical precision given for a network of selected stable pixels. Independently from the applied processing methodology, the main drawback at X-band is the shorter time interval to temporal decorrelation. This effect can be partially mitigated by a short repeat time acquisitions plan. A technique able to deal with distributed scatterers is fundamental for extending the spatial coverage of the coherent area. In this paper we analyze the potential of X-band COSMO-SkyMed short repeat pass interferometry over a rural area in the southern part of Italy for assessing the capabilities and limitations of the Quasi-PS (QPS) technique in an X-band non-optimal scenario.

CLUTTER DETECTION USING TWO-CHANNEL RADAR SOUNDER DATA	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE		Radar Sounder; Interferometry; Clutter Detection; Planetary Radar		Surface clutter can corrupt both Earth and planetary Radar Sounder (RS) observations preventing definitive interpretation of subsurface features, which are often the primary interest of geologists and planetary scientists. Clutter is usually detected by manual or automatic techniques that require ancillary information about the topography of the surface. However, this topography information is not always available. In this paper, we propose a novel method for clutter detection that is independent from ancillary information. This method uses a two channel RS system to exploit the cross-channel interferometric phase difference and is made up three main steps: i) feature extraction and theoretical phase difference estimation, ii) RS interferogram formation and iii) comparison of theoretical and real phase difference distributions. The proposed method has been validated on RS data acquired in Greenland.	[Castelletti, D.; Bruzzone, L.] Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Schroeder, D.

MODELING OCEAN WAVE SURFACE TO SIMULATE SPACEBORNE SCATTEROMETER OBSERVATIONS IN PRESENCE OF RAIN	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE		Modeling; ocean surface; rain; scatterometry; spectrum; wind	WIND; SPECTRUM	Spaceborne scatterometer observations, especially at Ku-band, are affected by rain in several ways and these effects need to be corrected to avoid errors in wind retrievals. In this work we propose a model to derive the surface backscattering coefficient in presence of both wind and rain. Our approach consists in the development of an ocean surface wind wave spectrum accounting for two effects due to raindrops impact on the surface: the rain-induced wave damping and the generation of ring waves. The results show that this extended spectrum is able to model the ocean surface wave modifications due to rain so that it can be used for further study in physically representing the scatterometer observations in presence of both wind and rain.

HADLEY CELL TRENDS AND VARIABILITY AS DETERMINED FROM SCATTEROMETER OBSERVATIONS: HOW RAPIDSCAT WILL HELP ESTABLISHING RELIABLE LONG-TERM RECORD.	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE		Hadley cell; ocean surface winds; scatterometry		Recent evidence suggests that the tropics have expanded over the last few decades by a very rough 10 per decade. Until now, understanding the mechanisms of that expansion has been confined to models and proxies because of the unavailability of systematic observations of the large-scale circulation. Scatterometer-derived ocean surface vector winds, provide for the first time, an accurate depiction of the large-scale circulation and allow the study of the Hadley cell evolution through analysis of its surface branch. In this study we determine the extent of the Hadley cell as defined by the subtropical zero-crossing of the zonally-averaged zonal wind component. We use scatterometer observations from a number of missions, covering similar to 13 years. Our analyses reveal seasonal and interannual variability, as well as a long-term trend for expansion of the Hadley cell width. More interestingly, our results show an apparent discontinuity in the signal when the data source changes from one observing system to another. This raises the question about the significance of the unresolved diurnal signal. Indeed, analyses of observations from tandem missions support this notion. Fortunately, the RapidScat mission makes it possible to resolve, for the first time, the details of the diurnal signal. Our preliminary analyses of the RapidScat observations show the presence of a clear semidiurnal signal in the width of the Hadley cell. This helps explain previously found discrepancies. More importantly, this points to a clear need to understand and resolve the diurnal signal before merging wind observations from different missions to form a consistent climate record.

Precipitation profiling capabilities are currently limited to a few instruments deployed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which cannot provide the temporal resolution necessary to observe the evolution of short time-scale weather phenomena and improve numerical weather prediction models. A constellation of precipitation profiling instruments in LEO would provide this essential capability, but the cost and timeframe of typical satellite platforms and instruments make this solution prohibitive. A new radar instrument architecture that is compatible with low-cost satellite platforms, such as CubeSats and SmallSats, has been designed at JPL that enables constellation missions, which could revolutionize climate science and weather forecasting.

The multi-scale measurements are combined using time-series of active passive microwave data to retrieve the statistical regression parameters (alpha, beta) from successive overpasses. In this study, we introduce a physically-based forward model as well as data-based retrieval of the beta-parameter. The forward model stems from analyses of the scattering and loss terms occurring during bare and vegetated soil scattering/emission and allows a physically-based modelling of the beta-parameter. This provides possibilities to analyze the different influences of soil roughness as well as vegetation structure and moisture on the beta-parameter under different environmental conditions. In addition, a physically-based retrieval of beta from one active-passive SMAP acquisition couple is proposed, circumventing lengthy time-series regressions. The key operation enabling a single-pass retrieval of the beta-parameter is the vegetation correction of the backscatter signal. This can be achieved by use of the measured cross-polarized backscatter signal together with an appropriate polarimetric vegetation volume model.

In order to better estimate mangrove biomass, carbon dynamics and land coverage changes, mangrove canopy height is a key parameter. However, there is a surprisingly absence of information needed for global-scale mangrove height mapping because of the lack of high spatial resolution data, available spaceborne data sets, and modeling techniques. In recent studies, the first single-pass TanDEM-X data showed a great possibility of mangrove canopy height estimate with accuracies comparable to airborne lidar canopy height model with single- and dual-Pol-InSAR techniques. Based on the method mentioned in [2], we here generated large-scale mangrove canopy height map with a 12-m spatial resolution over Sundarbans, the world largest mangrove forest, from existing global TDX acquisitions.

INSAR COHERENCE DUE TO REMOTE SENSING OF LOW-LOSS, GUIDING PLANAR-LAYERED GEOPHYSICAL MEDIA USING H-POLARIZED MICROWAVES	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE		Radar interferometry; radar remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar	RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; PENETRATION	We propose a planar-layered medium-based radar backscatter model to predict coherence trends, in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images, manifest when interrogating planar-layered dielectric geophysical subsurfaces. This InSAR coherence model improves upon past ones in two ways: Incorporation of "multi-bounce", arising from the guidance behavior of minimally-attenuating and high-contrast dielectric slabs, as well as azimuthal deviation in antenna pointing. Including the former renders this model especially suitable for analyzing coherence modifications (decorrelation and phase bias) arising from remote sensing of low-attenuating targets (e.g., dry soil), which augments applicability to high-attenuating targets (e.g., wet, salty soils) readily analyzed with many traditional InSAR models. Representing the model's key contributions, we discuss two predicted trends: Namely, in the limit of a perfectly guiding dielectric slab (i.e., zero attenuation and infinite dielectric contrast), the interferometric correlation is inversely proportional to the InSAR perpendicular baseline length and the phase bias linearly diverges.

However, the relatively short antenna length and high temporal resolution of the COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR system provides an opportunity to measure the precise displacement in the along-track direction. In this study, we have assessed the MAI performance in comparison with GPS and established an empirical uncertainty model of MAI measurements with respect to interferometric coherence. It enables us to confirm the difference between theoretical and practical uncertainties of the MAI method. Moreover, this study will be helpful for evaluating the reliability of MAI measurements where GPS data are unavailable.

This communication discusses the scientific value of GNSS-R to (a) furthering our understanding of ocean mesoscale circulation toward scales finer than those that existing nadir altimeters can resolve, and (b) mapping vegetated wetlands, an emerging application that might open up new avenues to map and monitor the planet's wetlands for methane emission assessments. Such applications are expected to be demonstrated by the availability of data from GEROS-ISS, an ESA experiment currently in phase A [2], and CyGNSS [3], a NASA mission currently in development. In particular, the paper details the expected error characteristics and the role of filtering played in the assimilation of these data to reduce the altimetric error (when averaging many measurements).

The non-linearities convert additive white uncertainty into biases in the measured quantities, and the accuracy of any estimate of the biases depends on how detailed a description one can use of the underlying non-uniformity. In this paper, we describe a method that we developed to characterize this non-uniformity in a very similar way to the treatment of Hydrometeor-Size-Distribution variability, by parametrizing it. This should be particularly useful to allow retrieval algorithms to account for NUBF in a more realistic way.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) has served this role during the development phase and for interim corrections early in the GPM mission.

The method is based on performing multiple retrievals by perturbing the various inputs to the retrieval algorithm. This results in calculating the sensitivity of the Aquarius salinity to these inputs. Together with an error model for the uncertainties in the input parameters it is possible to calculate the uncertainty in the retrieved SSS. It is important to distinguish between random uncertainties, which get suppressed when computing weekly or monthly averages and systematic uncertainties, which do not get suppressed by taking averages. We compare the results of the formal uncertainty estimates with uncertainty estimates based on comparing the Aquarius salinities with those from external validation sources finding excellent agreement.

Our approach leverages online estimated ego motion states and uses a novel inertialoptical flow (IOF) measurement analysis to identify moving objects and to characterize them in their angular and linear velocities. The novelty of our algorithm lies in the identification and segmentation of consistent optical flow outliers in the so-called kinematic space. These consistent outliers in combination with the IOF information for ego-motion estimation yield a first order estimation of the moving object in full 3D and in metric units. The approach is highly efficient as it only requires matched features in two consecutive images. We evaluate and demonstrate our algorithm in simulations and in real world tests.

Receding horizon frameworks mitigate the computational intractability of reactive synthesis for temporal logic, but have thus far been limited by pursuing a single sequence of short horizon problems to the goal. We propose a receding horizon algorithm for reactive synthesis that automatically determines a path to the currently pursued goal at runtime, responding as needed to nondeterministic environment behavior. This is achieved by allowing each short horizon to have multiple local goals, and determining which local goal to pursue based on the current global goal, the currently perceived environment and a pre-computed invariant dependent on the global goal. We demonstrate the utility of this additional flexibility in grant-response tasks, using a search-and-rescue example. Moreover, we show that these goal-dependent invariants mitigate the conservativeness of the receding horizon approach.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION (HRI'15)	ACMIEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction		English	Proceedings Paper	10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)	MAR 02-05, 2015	Portland, OR	IEEE, ACM, ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGART, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, AAAI, HFES, ACM SIGAI		Activity recognition; first-person videos; human-robot interaction		In this paper, we present a core technology to enable robot recognition of human activities during human-robot interactions. In particular, we propose a methodology for early recognition of activities from robot-centric videos (i.e., first-person videos) obtained from a robot's viewpoint during its interaction with humans. Early recognition, which is also known as activity prediction, is an ability to infer an ongoing activity at its early stage. We present an algorithm to recognize human activities targeting the camera from streaming videos, enabling the robot to predict intended activities of the interacting person as early as possible and take fast reactions to such activities (e.g., avoiding harmful events targeting itself before they actually occur). We introduce the novel concept of 'onset' that efficiently summarizes pre-activity observations, and design a recognition approach to consider event history in addition to visual features from first-person videos. We propose to represent an onset using a cascade histogram of time series gradients, and we describe a novel algorithmic setup to take advantage of such onset for early recognition of activities. The experimental results clearly illustrate that the proposed concept of onset enables better/earlier recognition of human activities from first-person videos collected with a robot.	[Ryoo, M.

The approach of using a single-anchor for 2D position and orientation sensing results in significantly simplified systems and setup when compared to previous multi-anchor systems. The various advantages of single-anchor systems over multi-anchor systems include accurate closed-form inverted solutions, substantially simplified system setup and calibration, no relative ground truth needs, and ability to easily perform low-latency or real-time sensing with simple systems.

We demonstrated a particular design of a surface coupling antenna which is capable of launching energy efficiently into the main mode of a plastic waveguide. A 3D printer was used to print the designed system to verify our results. The maximum available power gain of the system was measured as 0.128, implying that the coupler achieves an efficiency of at least 36% at the designed center frequency of 9.6GHz. The actual coupler efficiency is believed to be much higher because the polymer used is very lossy in this frequency range.

The closed-form spectra of the GRBFs allows an efficient computation of the MoM impedance matrix using the spectral-domain approach and asymptotic expansions.

This recent addition to the ISS significantly improves the detection and sensing capabilities of the current satellite constellation. An important consideration in this antenna is the interference generated towards nearby space vehicles and humans due to its relatively high RF power output. To avoid this issue, our work aims to characterize the antenna's near-field distribution, whose knowledge could aid in blanker circuit design to shut off the RF power for certain time slots during the scan period. A generalized and customized procedure using Spectral Domain analysis, i.e. plane wave spectra, is proposed to predict the absolute near-field values in V/m for a given radiated power and measured far-field patterns.

These Hamiltonians appear as coefficients of the characteristic equations of their Lax matrices, which define spectral curves for linear systems of differential and difference systems. The characteristic equations in the case of the associated linear problems for various discrete Painleve equations is biquadratic in the Painleve variables. We show that the discrete isomonodromic deformations that define the discrete Painleve equations may be succinctly described in terms of the characteristic equation of their Lax matrices.

In particular, this assessment covers attitude estimation and control in general, as well as the estimation and control of vehicle flight paths when flight path and attitude dynamics are strongly coupled or performed primarily onboard (as is the case during certain critical phases, such as entry, descent, and landing, in some planetary missions). This work first surveys the technologies, appraises their applicability to future NASA planetary missions, and then quantitatively assesses priorities for NASA based on likely need, relevance and optionally cost.

A single update on sol 647 to the onboard model of planetary motion both corrected for accumulated clock drift error and compensated for future clock drift. A flight software update on sol 481 added an accelerometer-only mode for updating attitude, eliminating accumulation of gyroscope propagation error when updating attitude during arm activities. The adoption of an operational pattern of following each drive with an accelerometer-based correction to attitude eliminated the roll and pitch components of gyroscope propagation error accumulated during drives. With these three improvements, only the yaw component of gyroscope propagation error grows from sol to sol.

Even if these are known based on ground observations, the overall environment may also be challenging from an orbit stability point of view, especial for a binary asteroid. For an asteroid with a sufficiently small total size and mass, however, orbital mechanics approaches can be eschewed in favor of performing multiple flybys of the body at low speeds, performing a "turn around" maneuver every few days to revisit the body. In this paper this mission approach is explored in more detail, and in terms of observations and gravity field measurements of the central body. Considerations will also be explored for the deployment of surface packages using such an approach. It will be shown that this approach to mission operations at small asteroids forms another possible close proximity solution in addition to the already explored orbital and hovering approaches used by the NEAR and Hayabusa missions, respectively.

After a series of orbits which took it progressively closer to the nucleus, the Philae lander was released from the Rosetta orbiter and touched down on the surface of the comet on November 12, 2014. Navigation of Rosetta, including the landing of Philae, was especially challenging due to several factors, including the use of terrain-relative optical navigation, the central body being a highly irregularly shaped object with unknown mass distribution, and an unknown coma environment. The responsibility for mission design and navigation of Rosetta resides with the Flight Dynamics group at the European Space Operations Center; through a collaborative arrangement, navigation specialists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory also performed a parallel effort to reconstruct the spacecraft's orbit from approach through the Philae landing. In this paper, we describe JPL's methods and results in determining the orbit of Rosetta and the Philae lander.

These tools increasingly draw from a common implementation of capabilities known as the Small-Body Dynamics Toolkit (SBDT). Fundamentally, the SBDT provides support for trajectory integration and geometric analysis of the environment, providing force models (gravity, solar pressure, comet outgassing), equations of motion, polyhedron shape utilities, altitude calculations, occultation checking, and more. Using the capabilities of the SBDT; analysis tools for mapping performance analysis (PB-CAGE), navigation performance analysis (AutoNAV), and trajectory design space characterization (SBMCT) have been developed. This paper provides a brief overview of the SBDT and these associated analysis tools.

This SFDT flight tested two entry technologies, a 6-meter supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (SIAD), which was deployed at Mach 4, and a supersonic disksail parachute, which was deployed at Mach 2.75. In order to test these entry technologies in Mars-relevant conditions, the technologies must fly through a representative mach and dynamic pressure regime. To accomplish that, the test vehicle was hoisted under a balloon up to an altitude of 36 km. At this point, the test vehicle separated from the balloon and began its primary mission under its own propulsion. A critical aspect of meeting the test conditions was to deploy the technologies at the correct velocities, to within 30m/s. Several challenges existed to accomplish this level of accuracy, including initialization of the IMU (GLN-MAC) while in a pendulum-motion under the balloon, the use of a magnetometer in a untested configuration for heading, and loss of GPS solutions at vehicle spin-up, requiring ded-reckoned navigation throughout the flight. This paper describes the challenges and our solutions to initialization, producing a navigated velocity for event triggering, operations, and the in-flight performance of the system.

Using a spin-stabilized attitude control architecture based on the earlier Mars Exploration Rovers and Mars Pathfinder missions, MSL executed 4 trajectory corrections, 22 turns to maintain power and communications and 18 turns in support of in-flight alignments and calibrations. To enable use of a guided, lifting entry, cruise ACS was also called on to perform a high-reliability precision initialization of the entry vehicle's onboard inertial navigation system just before landing. Along with other surprises, cruise operations were complicated by an early problem with the spacecraft flight computer which prevented use of the onboard star scanner for the first few months of flight. During this important period, ACS activities were accomplished using a combination of sun-only modes and ground based attitude determination. This paper outlines the MSL cruise attitude control system and relates our flight experience during operations, describing some of the challenges faced during the mission and the techniques and system features used to over-come them. We also present a performance assessment and several lessons learned with relevance. to Mars 2020 and other future missions using the MPF/MER/MSL cruise architecture.

A flop is a change of kinematic solution in the middle of an Earth track, temporarily breaking the communications link. When the Mars Science Laboratory rover is level and the Earth is near the horizon, the Earth is occluded for 55 percent of rover headings. When the rover is level and the Earth is near zenith, a flop is required to continue tracking for 44 percent of rover headings. These constraints and two tools used in everyday tactical operations to help rover planners choose unoccluded, flop-free end-of-drive headings are described.

AN ERROR BUDGET FOR POINTING AT SURFACE FEATURES FROM CLOSE RANGE	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2015	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	JAN 30-FEB 04, 2015	Breckenridge, CO					Spacecraft instrument pointing performance is often characterized by a single number: radial angular error, three sigma. In support of the spacecraft design process, pointing error budgets allocate allowable contributions to this error from the sensors, actuators, and portions of spacecraft structure that affect pointing accuracy. When pointing the Mars Science Laboratory ChemCam Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer at a surface feature, the error of interest is the distance of the laser spot from the feature on the surface. The footprint of error on the surface depends not only on the overall radial angular error, but also on the distance to the surface feature. Translational distortions within the spacecraft also affect the error footprint. The effective origin of error is defined, and a mathematical formulation for computing pointing error budgets in terms of radial distances from a surface feature is presented.

The controller relies on limited aerodynamic data with initial firing conditions in order to avoid the need for complicated electronics and sensors. First range and lateral control are shown to be achieved independently, and then they were combined to demonstrate full 3D control. A 6DoF simulation is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Sensitivity analysis to variations in initial conditions are carried out using Monte Carlo simulations. With a 5 m/s muzzle velocity, a 95% confidence predefined target landing is achieved with -0.236% +/- 0.792% lateral and -0.352% +/- 0.185% range error.

The Wills-Harrison model, accounting for charge transfer upon alloying, is used to explain the observed negative excess vibrational entropy of mixing, which increases the miscibility gap temperature in the system by an estimated maximum of 550K and we adjudicate to a charge transfer from the Fe to the Au atoms that results in an increase in the electron density in the free-electron-like states and in stronger sd-hybridization. When Au is the solvent, this softens the Fe-Fe bonds but stiffens the Au-Au and Au-Fe bonds which results in a net stiffening relative to the elemental components.

Due to limited close approach tracking data, a Europa flyby mission suffers strong coupling between the gravity solution quality and tracking data quantity and quality. This work explores utilizing Low Gain Antennas with the Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) to provide abundant high accuracy uplink-only radiometric tracking data. DSAC's performance, expected to exhibit an Allan Deviation of less than 3e-15 at one day, provides long-term stability and accuracy on par with the Deep Space Network ground clocks, enabling one-way radiometric tracking data with accuracy equivalent to that of its two-way counterpart. The feasibility of uplink-only Doppler tracking via the coupling of LGAs and DSAC and the expected Doppler data quality are presented. Violations of the Kalman filter's linearization assumptions when state perturbations are included in the flyby analysis results in poor determination of the Europa gravitational tide parameters. B-plane targeting constraints are statistically determined, and a solution to the linearization issues via pre-flyby approach orbit determination is proposed and demonstrated.

Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories II (POST2) was one of the flight dynamics codes used to simulate and predict the flight performance and Monte Carlo analysis was used to characterize the potential flight conditions experienced by the test vehicle. This paper compares the simulation predictions with the reconstructed trajectory of SFDT-1. Additionally, off-nominal conditions seen during flight are modeled in post-flight simulations to find the primary contributors that reconcile the simulation with flight data. The results of these analyses are beneficial for the pre-flight simulation and targeting of the follow-on SFDT flights currently scheduled for summer 2015.

The purpose of the project is to develop and mature aerodynamic decelerator technologies for landing large mass payloads on the surface of Mars. The technologies include a Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator and Supersonic Parachutes. The first Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test occurred on June 28th, 2014 at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. This test was used to validate the test architecture for future missions. The flight was a success and, in addition, was able to acquire data on the aerodynamic performance of the supersonic inflatable decelerator. This paper describes the instrumentation, analysis techniques, and acquired flight test data utilized to reconstruct the vehicle trajectory, atmosphere, and aerodynamics. The results of the reconstruction show significantly higher lofting of the trajectory, which can partially be explained by off-nominal booster motor performance. The reconstructed vehicle force and moment coefficients fall well within pre-flight predictions. A parameter identification analysis indicates that the vehicle displayed greater aerodynamic static stability than seen in pre-flight computational predictions and ballistic range tests.

The subset consists of those trajectories that, after the first Mars flyby, perform a half-revolution transfer with Mars before returning to Earth. This class of free returns is useful for both human and robotic Mars missions because of its low geocentric energy at departure and arrival, and because of its extended stay time in the vicinity of Mars. Ballistic opportunities are documented over Earth departure dates ranging from 2015 through 2100. The mission is viable over three or four consecutive Mars synodic periods and unavailable for the next four, with the pattern repeating approximately every 15 years. Over the remainder of the century, a minimum Earth departure hyperbolic excess speed of 3.16 km/s, a minimum Earth atmospheric entry speed of 11.47 km/s, and a minimum flight time of 904 days are observed. The algorithm used to construct these trajectories is presented along with several examples.

A better approach, and one that is demonstrated in this paper, is a multi-step process whereby the solution of the aforementioned problem is solved at a medium-fidelity and this solution is used as an initial guess for a higher-fidelity solver. The framework presented in this work uses two tools developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC): the Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator (EMTG) and the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). EMTG is a medium to medium-high fidelity low-thrust interplanetary global optimization solver, which now has the capability to automatically generate GMAT script files for seeding a high-fidelity solution using GMAT's local optimization capabilities. An overview of the analysis tools is presented along with a discussion of the autonomy of the tool-chain. Current capabilities are highlighted with increasingly difficult problems; the final problem being the recreation of the interplanetary trajectory for the DAWN mission.

One of the most significant, unsolved problems with optimizing low-orbit trajectories using feedback control is eclipse constraints. Employing a new forward-looking feedback control technique, however, allows for an optimization of the trajectory including the effects of eclipses or any other arbitrary engine shutoff periods. The control law applies weightings to the optimal thrusting angles based on the spacecraft's relative instantaneous efficiency over one revolution, which includes the effect of the engine shutoffs. This method also facilitates simple exploration of the propellant versus time trade space in the presence of engine shutoff constraints.

Three mission models are considered that differ in the number of transit habitats and the type of fly-by and return trajectories used. Earth-Mars-Earth and Earth-Mars-Mars-Earth fly-by and return trajectories form the basis for these architectures. The strategies assume the existence and operation of the Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft with no reliance or requirement for new technology development. The capability for hyperbolic rendezvous and complex orbital operations at Mars is needed. Advantages of the proposed strategies include, smaller transit habitats since they are only occupied for fractions of the overall mission time, lower propellant requirements since the interplanetary transit habitats need not be inserted into or taken out of Mars orbit, and some limited abort opportunities. The strategies can be used in a stair step approach that facilitates a logical sequence of fly-by, orbital, Mars moons or surface missions. Representative solutions and selected mission performance data are presented for missions in the 2020-2050 time frame bracketing 15 complete Earth-Mars synodic cycles.	[Thomas, Andrew S.

Within the context of exploring the dynamical behavior of a spacecraft orbiting or moving near such systems, a first step in the analysis is an assessment of the perturbing effect that dominates the dynamics of the spacecraft. The relative strength of several perturbations, including the perturbation that arises from the existence of a binary system, rather than a single body system, is compared by exploiting 'zonal maps'. Such a map is useful in determining the type of orbit that is practical in support of a given mission scenario.

An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method is used to estimate the small body spin state with optical landmark measurements, as well-as the spacecraft position, velocity, attitude, and surface landmark locations. An example scenario based on the Rosetta mission is used, with a tumbling small body. The SLAM method proves effective, with order of magnitude decreases in the spacecraft and small body spin state errors after less than a quarter of the comet characterization phase. Initial small body angular velocity errors can be several times larger than the true rates, and the SLAM method will still converge (effectively having no apriori knowledge of the angular velocity). It is also observed that higher levels of tumbling in the small body increase the spin state angular velocity estimation errors and decrease the moments of inertia error, as expected.

This paper employs various quantitative metrics to characterize the performance and relative effectiveness of various types of mapping orbits including terminator, quasi-terminator, hovering, ping-pong, and conic-like trajectories. Metrics of interest include surface area coverage, lighting conditions, and the variety of viewing angles achieved. The metrics discussed in this investigation are intended to enable mission designers and project stakeholders to better understand the implications of candidate mapping orbits during preliminary mission formulation activities.

Dynamically challenging asteroids are fast rotators, where the amended gravitational acceleration almost vanishes near the equator. In the studied architecture, a mothership flies-by the asteroid at high altitude and releases the lander on a ballistic trajectory towards its landing site. Given fixed constraints and GNC capabilities, the landing time and spread can be reduced manyfold with fine adjustments of the lander's orbit parameters such as the radius of periapse, the inclination, or the argument of periapse.

Heliotropic orbits provide long-lifetime, low-altitude orbits in the presence of these significant perturbations. Using a constrained, doubly-averaged disturbing potential in the Lagrange Planetary Equations yields inclined heliotropic orbits as well as a method for assessing the likelihood of a heliotropic orbit existing in an uncertain environment. The existence of heliotropic orbits is shown to be robust to uncertainty in the gravity parameters of a model of Bennu, and an example orbit shows how heliotropic orbits persist in the presence of other gravity perturbations as well.

This paper describes our approach and results for supplementing radiometric observables with on-board telemetry measurements to improve the reconstructed trajectory estimate for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN). Uncertainties in Mars atmospheric models, combined with non-continuous tracking degrade navigation accuracy, making MAVEN a key candidate for using on-board telemetry data to help complement its orbit determination process. The successful demonstration of using telemetry data to improve the accuracy of ground based orbit determination could reduce cost (DSN tracking time) and enhance the performance of future NASA missions. In addition, it presents an important stepping stone to autonomous on-board aerobraking and aerocapture.

DSAC's stability yields one-way radiometric tracking data with better accuracy than current two-way tracking data and enables transitioning to more efficient and flexible one-way deep space navigation. This study discusses the potential for one-way radiometric navigation using DSAC, including those navigation uses that are immediately enabled, and those that require additional infrastructure and flight system development for full realization.

Design Investigation of a Coreless Tubular Linear Generator for a Moball: a Spherical Exploration Robot with Wind-Energy Harvesting Capability	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 26-30, 2015	Seattle, WA	IEEE				Moball is a wind-driven spherical robot equipped with sensors for in-situ observation of scientifically important and windy environments, e.g., the Earth's polar regions, Mars, and Saturn's moon Titan. More importantly, Moball incorporates an internal triaxial set of linear electromagnetic generators which can be used to harvest wind energy for long-duration self-sustained operation, or to bias its' wind-driven motions as a form of steering. This paper describes our process to optimize the design of a coreless tubular linear generator for Moball so as to improve energy generation and motion control capabilities with the minimal moving generator mass. The performance of three different types of movers was analyzed with the help of finite element analysis. We determined a final optimized structure and its' dimensions involving a single dipole PM and novel slope-shaped back-irons. A prototype of a single-axis linear generator with a length of 0.8 m was fabricated and assembled. Drop and rotating tests were performed to measure the generated power with this machine. The maximum generated power in the rotating test was 1.05 W at 19 rpm when the load resistance was 40 Omega. The experimental results agreed well with our model predictions. The paper concludes with an overview of the current Moball prototype and ongoing work. The design process developed in this paper can serve as a guideline for future design of energy scavenging systems for robots.

Many high-level synthesis approaches employ discrete abstractions to reason about the dynamics of the continuous system in a simplified manner. Often, these abstractions are expensive to compute. We circumvent the need to have detailed abstractions for nonlinear systems by proposing a framework for adapting abstractions based on partial solutions to the low-level controller synthesis problem. The contribution of this paper is a reactive synthesis algorithm that makes use of our adaptation procedure to update the high-level strategy each time the non-deterministic discrete abstraction is modified. We combine this with a verified low-level controller synthesis scheme capable of automatically synthesizing controllers for a wide class of nonlinear systems. This novel synthesis framework is demonstrated on a dynamical robot executing an autonomous inspection task.

The modules are cubes that can pivot about their edges along the (x) over cap, (y) over cap, or (z) over cap axes to move on a 3-dimensional substrate. This is a different model from prior work, which usually considers modules that slide along their faces. We analyze the pivoting cube model and give sufficient conditions for reconfiguration to be feasible. In particular, we show that if an initial configuration does not contain any of three subconfigurations, which we call rules, then it can reconfigure into a line. We provide provably correct algorithms for reconfiguration for both 2-D and 3-D systems, and we verify our algorithms via simulation on randomly generated 2-D and 3-D configurations.

Classical approaches detect surface appearance but do not measure the underlying mechanical properties that determine wheel-terrain interaction. Diurnal temperature variations of a granular material, however, are strongly correlated with both its surface appearance and subsurface geophysical properties. This paper presents a technique for determining relative differences in looseness and traversability of granular terrain through analysis of thermal imagery. Terrain compaction and traversability are predicted by estimating a material's thermal inertia from observations of thermal transients. Results from a set of experiments in sandy terrain demonstrate the ability of this approach to differentiate between safe, compact and hazardous, loose terrain.

We consider a three-parameter model of the relative position of the fingers, which gives complete generality for three point fingers in the plane. We consider robustness of caging grasps what variations in the relative position of the fingers is allowed without breaking the cage. Using a simple decomposition of free space around the polygon, we present an algorithm which gives all caging placements of the fingers and a characterization of the robustness of these cages, albeit at the cost of significant computational complexity.

Kinematics for Combined Quasi-Static Force and Motion Control in Multi-Limbed Robots	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 26-30, 2015	Seattle, WA	IEEE			MANIPULATION	This paper considers how a multi-limbed robot can carry out manipulation tasks involving simultaneous and compatible end-effector velocity and force goals, while also maintaining quasi-static stance stability. The formulation marries a local optimization process with an assumption of a compliant model of the environment. For purposes of illustration, we first develop the formulation for a single fixed based manipulator arm. Some of the basic kinematic variables we previously introduced for multi-limbed robot mechanism analysis in [1] are extended to accomodate this new formulation. Using these extensions, we provide a novel definition for static equilibrium of multi-limbed robot with actuator limits, and provide general conditions that guarantee the ability to apply arbitrary end-effector forces. Using these extended definitions, we present the local optimization problem and its solution for combined manipulation and stance. We also develop, using the theory of strong alternatives, a new definition and a computable test for quasi-static stance feasibility in the presence of manipulation forces. Simulations illustrate the concepts and method.

The work discussed in this paper presents an approach to a human-in-the-loop mode of robot operation that integrates high level human cognition and commanding with the intelligence and processing power of autonomous systems. Our framework for a " Supervised Remote Robot with Guided Autonomy and Teleoperation" (SURROGATE) is demonstrated on a robotic platform consisting of a pan-tilt perception head, two 7-DOF arms connected by a single 7-DOF torso, mounted on a tracked-wheel base. We present an architecture that allows high-level supervisory commands and intents to be specified by a user that are then interpreted by the robotic system to perform whole body manipulation tasks autonomously. We use a concept of "behaviors" to chain together sequences of "actions" for the robot to perform which is then executed real time.

MatchEx goes beyond traditional position-based cross-matching algorithms by using other available data together with expert logic to determine which candidate match is the best. Furthermore, the local background density of sources is used to determine and minimize the false-positive match rate and to estimate match completeness. The logical outcome and statistical probability of each match decision is stored in the database and may be used to tune the algorithm and adjust match parameter thresholds. For our first production run, we cross matched the GALEX All Sky Survey Catalog (GASC), containing nearly 40 million NUV-detected sources, against a directory of 180 million objects in NED. Candidate matches were identified for each GASC source within a 7.'' 5 radius. These candidates were filtered on position-based matching probability and on other criteria including object type and object name. We estimate a match completeness of 97.6% and a match accuracy of 99.75%. Over the next year, we will be cross-matching over 2 billion catalog sources to NED, including the Spitzer Source List, the 2MASS point-source catalog, AllWISE, and SDSS DR 10. We expect to add new capabilities to filter candidate matches based on photometry, redshifts, and refined object classifications. We will also extend MatchEx to handle more heterogenous datasets federated from smaller catalogs through NED's literature pipeline.

The tool is integrated within the Spectral Explorer from HTPE, which offers additional functionality such as an interface to the spectral fitter tool. All the actions with HIPE tools produce Python code, which can later be reused in scripts for automation. Various results can be saved as FITS files and loaded into other astronomical analysis tools.

Modern archives are web-based. As the science becomes more and more data driven, the pressure on visualization tools to support large datasets increases. While tables can render one page at a time, image overlays showing the returned catalog entries or XY plots showing the relationship between table columns must cover all of the rows to be meaningful. The large data set could easily overwhelm the browsers capabilities. Therefore the amount of data to be transported or rendered must be reduced. IRSA's catalog visualization is based on Firefly package, developed in IPAC (Roby 2013). Firefly is used by multiple web-based tools and archives, maintained by IRSA: Catalog Search, Spitzer, WISE, Plank, etc. Its distinctive feature is the tri-view: table, image overlay, and XY plot. All three highly interactive components are integrated together. The tri-view presentation allows an astronomer to dissect a dataset in various ways and to detect underlying structure and anomalies in the data, which makes it a handy tool for data exploration. Many challenges are encountered when only a subset of data is used in place of the full data set. Preserving coherence and maintaining the ability to select and filter data become issues. This talk addresses how we have solved problems in large dataset visualization.

PTF utilizes a 7.1 square degree camera on the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt telescope to survey the sky primarily at a single wavelength (R-band) at a rate of 1000-3000 square degrees a night. The data are used to detect and study transient and moving objects such as gamma ray bursts, supernovae and asteroids, as well as variable phenomena such as quasars and Galactic stars. The data processing system at IPAC handles realtime processing and detection of transients, solar system object processing, high photometric precision processing and light curve generation, and long-term archiving and curation. This was developed under an extremely limited budget profile in an unusually agile development environment. Here we discuss the mechanics of this system and our overall development approach. Although a significant scientific installation in of itself, PTF also serves as the prototype for our next generation project, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Beginning operations in 2017, ZTF will feature a 50 square degree camera which will enable scanning of the entire northern visible sky every night. ZTF in turn will serve as a stepping stone to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), a major NSF facility scheduled to begin operations in the early 2020s.

M. Keck Observatory, serves science and calibration data for all active and inactive instruments from the twin Keck Telescopes located near the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In addition to the raw data, we produce and provide quick look reduced data for four instruments (HIRES, LWS, NIRC2, and OSIRIS) so that KOA users can more easily assess the scientific content and the quality of the data, which can often be difficult with raw data. The reduced products derive from both publicly available data reduction packages (when available) and KOA-created reduction scripts. The automation of publicly available data reduction packages has the benefit of providing a good quality product without the additional time and expense of creating a new reduction package, and is easily applied to bulk processing needs. The downside is that the pipeline is not always able to create an ideal product, particularly for spectra, because the processing options for one type of target (eg., point sources) may not be appropriate for other types of targets (eg., extended galaxies and nebulae). In this poster we present the design and implementation for the current pipelines used at KOA and discuss our strategies for handling data for which the nature of the targets and the observers' scientific goals and data taking procedures are unknown. We also discuss our plans for implementing automated pipelines for the remaining six instruments.	[Gelino, Christopher R.; Berriman, G. B.; Kong, M.; Laity, A. C.; Swain, M.

While much effort is spent on VO, little thought is given to the types of User Interfaces we need to effectively search this sort of data. For instance, an astronomer might need to search Spitzer, WISE, and 2MASS catalogs and images then see the results presented together in one UI. Moving seamlessly between data sets is key to presenting integrated results. Results need to be viewed using first class, web based, integrated FITS viewers, XY Plots, and advanced table display tools. These components should be able to handle very large datasets. To make a powerful Web based UI that can manage and present multiple searches to the user requires taking advantage of many HTML5 features. AJAX is used to start searches and present results. Push notifications (Server Sent Events) monitor background jobs. Canvas is required for advanced result displays. Lesser known CSS3 technologies makes it all flow seamlessly together. At IPAC, we have been developing our Firefly toolkit for several years. We are now using it to solve this multiple data set, multiple queries, and integrated presentation problem to create a powerful research experience. Firefly was created in IRSA, the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu). Firefly is the core for applications serving many project archives, including Spitzer, Planck, WISE, PTF, LSST and others. It is also used in IRSA's new Finder Chart and catalog and image displays.

The ASCL has recently moved a new infrastructure into production. The new site provides a true database for the code entries and integrates the WordPress news and information pages and the discussion forum into one site. Previous capabilities are retained and permalinks to ascl.net continue to work. This improvement offers more functionality and flexibility than the previous site, is easier to maintain, and offers new possibilities for collaboration. This paper covers these recent changes to the ASCL.

Data and Metadata Management at the Keck Observatory Archive	ASTRONOMICAL DATA ANALYSIS SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS: XXIV	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	24th International Conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems, ADASS XXIV	OCT 05-09, 2014	Univ Calgary, Calgary, CANADA	Anglo-Australian Observ, Cybera Inc, Univ Calgary, European Space Agcy, European So Observ, Infrared Process & Anal Ctr, Natl Opt Astron Observ, Smithsonian Astrophys Observ, Space Telescope Sci Inst	Univ Calgary			A collaboration between the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO) in Hawaii and the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) in California, the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) was commissioned in 2004 to archive data from WMKO, which operates two classically scheduled 10 m ground-based telescopes. The data from Keck are not suitable for direct ingestion into the archive since the metadata contained in the original FITS headers lack the information necessary for proper archiving. The data pose a number of challenges for KOA: different instrument builders used different standards, and the nature of classical observing, where observers have complete control of the instruments and their observations, lead to heterogeneous data sets. For example, it is often difficult to determine if an observation is a science target, a sky frame, or a sky flat. It is also necessary to assign the data to the correct owners and observing programs, which can be a challenge for time-domain and target-of-opportunity observations, or on split nights, during which two or more principle investigators share a given night. In addition, having uniform and adequate calibrations is important for the proper reduction of data. Therefore, KOA needs to distinguish science files from calibration files, identify the type of calibrations available, and associate the appropriate calibration files with each science frame. We describe the methodologies and tools that we have developed to successfully address these difficulties, adding content to the FITS headers and "retrofitting" the metadata in order to support archiving Keck data, especially those obtained before the archive was designed. With the expertise gained from having successfully archived observations taken with all eight currently active instruments at WMKO, we have developed lessons learned from handling this complex array of heterogeneous metadata. These lessons help ensure a smooth ingestion of data not only for current but also future instruments, as well as a better experience for the archive user.	[Berriman, G. B.; Gelino, C. R.; Laity, A.

This wealth of resources is a boon to researchers, but it also presents inter operability problems. Despite working with different software tools, researchers want to disseminate their work widely as well as reuse and extend the models of other researchers. This situation led in the year 2000 to an effort to create a tool-independent, machine-readable file format for representing models: SBML, the Systems Biology Markup Language. SBML has since become the de facto standard for its purpose. Its success and general approach has inspired and influenced other community-oriented standardization efforts in systems biology. Open standards are essential for the progress of science in all fields, but it is often difficult for academic researchers to organize successful community-based standards. I draw on personal experiences from the development of SBML and summarize some of the lessons learned, in the hope that this may be useful to other groups seeking to develop open standards in a community-oriented fashion.

Valuing Information in Complex Systems: An Integrated Analytical Approach to Achieve Optimal Performance in the Beer Distribution Game	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Value of information; beer distribution game; decision analysis; system dynamics; control theory	SUPPLY CHAINS; MANAGEMENT; COORDINATION; DECISIONS; STABILITY; RISK	Even seemingly simple systems can produce complex dynamics, which leads management professionals to develop tools for training, monitoring, and improving performance. Management simulators provide useful insights about human behavior and interactions, while computational and informational decision support tools offer opportunities to reduce inconsistencies, errors, and non-optimal human choices, particularly for complex systems that involve multiple decision makers, uncertainty, variability, and time. We use the context of a popular management simulator that teaches students about the bullwhip effect (i.e., the beer distribution game) to explore an integrated decision analytic, control theory, and system dynamics approach to the game that recognizes the value of available (imperfect) information and considers the value of perfect information to provide the optimal strategy. Using a discrete event simulation, we characterize optimal decisions and overall team scores for the situation of actual available information and perfect information. We describe our implementation of the strategy in the field to win the 2007 beer game world championship played at the 25th conference of the International System Dynamics Society. This paper seeks to demonstrate that better understanding of the system and use of available information leads to significantly lower expected costs than identified in prior studies. Understanding complex systems and using information optimally may increase system stability and significantly improve performance, in some cases even without better information than already available.

Observations of rotational transitions of various vibrational levels of CO, (CO)-C-13, CS, CCH, H2O, SiO, SiS, SiC2, HCN and HNC have been collected with the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE instruments over multiple epochs. The intensity monitoring shows strong and periodic variations of most of the observed molecules, often with differential behavior depending on the transition level (larger variation at higher J), and generally enhanced modulations in the vibrational modes of some of these molecules (e.g. HCN). These results show that the effect of LR pumping through the different vibrational levels on the emergent line profiles of a given transition can be really significant. This implies that the IR radiation field of the circumstellar envelope and its time variation has to be taken into account in any radiative transfer model in order to derive accurately the physico-chemical structure of the envelope.

The new and novel feature is the use of thin-film Mg to release the captured CTCs based on the fact that any Cl-containing culture medium can readily etch Mg away [1]. The releasing and the isolation of each individual CTC are demonstrated here. After filtration process, the filter is submerged in PBS to facilitate Mg etching. The top PA-C filter pieces break apart from the bottom after Mg completely dissolves, enabling captured CTC cells to detach from the filter. The released CTC can then be easily aspirated into a micropipette, and then for further, such as, DNA mutation analysis.

The repetitive uniaxial tensile tests are done to characterize its mechanical behavior and the water vapor transmission rate is measured to evaluate its barrier property. The experimental data are in accordance with the composite material theory. A novel approach of facilitating the diffusion and penetration of parylene coatings into PDMS using in-situ heated deposition is presented. The parylene depth profiling in PDMS and 180 degrees peel tests demonstrate that parylene deposition at elevated temperatures shows enhanced pore sealing capability. A theoretical model is proposed, featuring an infinitely long cylindrical PDMS pore model, free molecular flow and time-varying pore geometry during the deposition. There is only one unknown parameter in the model: the PDMS pore diameter.

More interestingly, contrary to human heart the zebrafish heart has a remarkable ability to "regenerate" after severe injury [4], making it also a popular model for studies of regenerative medicine. On the other hand, Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool to monitor the physiological changes of the zebrafish heart. However, due to its in-water habitat, a long term ECG monitoring solution, although very much needed, was not present. All published adult zebrafish ECG recorded to this date have been done acutely with anesthetized fish. This work presents, for the first time a wearable flexible parylene (PA) micro-electrode that monitors the Adult Zebrafish ECG long term. We show here the design, fabrication and testing of the flexible electrode along with a micro-molded ultra-soft, density adjusted silicone jacket, allowing ECG recording to be carried under water, in the fish's natural habitat with no need for anesthesia.

While this approach has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems and environments, it scales poorly. A receding horizon framework mitigates this computational blowup, by decomposing the global control problem into several tractable subproblems. The existence of a global controller is ensured through symbolic checks of the specification, and local controllers are synthesized when needed. This reduces the size of the synthesized strategy, but still scales poorly for problems with dynamic environments because of the large number of environment strategies in each subproblem. Ad-hoc methods to locally restrict the environment come with the risk of losing correctness. We present a method for reducing the size of these subproblems by eliminating locally redundant variables, while maintaining correctness of the local (and thus global) controllers. We demonstrate the method using an autonomous car example, on problem sizes that were previously unsolvable due to the number of variables in the environment. We also demonstrate how the reduced specifications can be used to identify opportunities for reusing the synthesized local controllers.

We first show the global asymptotic stability of a completely decentralized frequency integral control. Then we design a distributed averaging-based integral (DAI) control which operates by local frequency sensing and neighborhood communication. Equilibrium analysis shows that DAI recovers the nominal frequency with minimum total generation cost and user disutility for load control after a change in generation or load. Local asymptotic stability of DAI is established with a Lyapunov method. Simulations demonstrate improvement in both transient and steady-state performance achieved by the proposed control strategies, compared to droop control.

We will show that, if the linearized system is stabilizable, we can redefine the output of the system such that the input-output linearized system is locally asymptotically stable. Furthermore we develop an LQR technique for designing the redefined output, which assures stabilization of the zerodynamics. Simulations of a physical system show that the resulting controller, which in a way fuses LQR techniques with input-output linearization, outperforms a regular LQR feedback controller and demonstrates a big region of attraction. The presented technique can be used to regulate the system around an equilibrium and to achieve tracking for certain trajectories. Conditions are established that allow the asymptotic regulation and tracking of desired trajectories for the original output. We will demonstrate the control design on a two-dimensional Segway model.

In this paper, we study a special feature of the energy function that has previously received little attention: convexity. We prove that the energy function for structure preserving models of power systems is convex under certain reasonable conditions on phases and voltages. Beyond stability analysis, these convexity results have a number of applications, noticeably, building a provably convergent PF solver, which we discuss in detail in this paper. We also outline potential applications to reformulating Optimum Power Flow (OPF), Model Predictive Control (MPC) and identifying the most probable failure (instanton) as convex optimization problems.

Scanning electron microscope is carried out for issues relating to factors limiting the reliability, growth of intermetallic compounds, and thermal stability. For low-temperature thermoelectric module, N-type Bi2Te3 is bonded to alumina substrates by using a Ni/Sn/Ag system. During bonding and subsequent aging reaction at 200 C, Sn reacts with Ag to foul' Ag3Sn, and Ni reacts with Sn to foul' Ni3Sn4. This reaction process takes less than 72 h to exhaust the entire Sn layer to produce a bonding that can withstand temperature as high as 480 degrees C. The interfacial reaction, Ni penetration depth, and IMC kinetics between Ni and Bi2Te3 at 200, 250, and 300 degrees C are also investigated in detail. For mid-temperature thermoelectric module, N-type PbTe is bonded to alumina substrates by using a Ag/In/Ag system. During assembly at 190 degrees C, all Ag/In/Ag joint are transfouned into Ag2In, which has the melting temperature above 670 degrees C, in less than 2 minutes. Furtheunore, this Ag-In joint has passed high temperature storage test at 400 degrees C for 1000 h. The success of solid liquid interdiffusion technique and related contact materials provide a cost effective way to assemble thermoelectric modules for power generating or cooling applications which require long tem' operations at high temperatures.

The decision process will use, among others sources, ADS-B information, shared by neighboring traffic. In such distributed systems, trustworthiness among aircraft become of primary importance. In this work we show that autonomous aircraft employing deterministic sense and avoid strategies can be forced into predetermined trajectories when their precise position and velocity are available to a potentially malicious craft. In other words, malicious pursuer players (real or hoaxed) taking advantage of shared data and predictable collision avoidance properties can dictate evader agent trajectory, which might not realize the threat at all. As shown by numerical simulations and ground robot experiments, combination of arcs and straight paths can be achieved and be used to arbitrarily control the evader.

The mission's primary objectives would be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. To meet demanding coverage, sampling, and accuracy requirements, the system would require a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed. To address the broad range of disciplines and scientific study areas of the mission, a dual-frequency system was conceived, at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve these observational characteristics, a reflector-feed system is considered, whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive ("SweepSAR") capability at both L-band and S-band. In the partnership, NASA would provide the instrument structure for both L-and S-band electronics, the L-band electronics, the reflector and associated boom, and an avionics payload to interface with the radar that would include a solid state recorder, high-rate Ka-band telecommunication link, and a GPS receiver. ISRO would provide the spacecraft and launch vehicle, and the S-band radar electronics.

Improved Absolute Radiometric Calibration of a UHF Airborne Radar	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL RADAR CONFERENCE (RADARCON)	IEEE Radar Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Radar Conference (RadarCon)	MAY 10-15, 2015	Arlington, VA	IEEE, Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE Informat Theory Soc				The AirMOSS airborne SAR operates at UHF and produces fully polarimetric imagery [1]. The AirMOSS radar data are used to produce Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM) depth profiles. The absolute radiometric accuracy of the imagery, ideally of better than 0.5 dB, is key to retrieving RZSM, especially in wet soils where the backscatter as a function of soil moisture function tends to flatten out [2]. In this paper we assess the absolute radiometric uncertainty in previously delivered data, describe a method to utilize Built In Test (BIT) data to improve the radiometric calibration, and evaluate the improvement from applying the method.

A Wireless EeG Recording System for Small Animal Models of Heart Regeneration	2015 IEEE MTT-S INTERNATIONAL MICROWAVE SYMPOSIUM (IMS)	IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)	MAY 17-22, 2015	Phoenix, AZ	IEEE MTT S		Wireless ECG; flexible MEA; zebrafish; neonatal mice; inductive coupling; heart regeneration	ZEBRAFISH	Heart failure afflicts the developed world, causing mortality more than any other diseases. This is due to the fact that humans' heart possesses a very limited capacity to regenerate. Heart attacks or myocardial infarction (MI) could result in an irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes and consequently heart failure. Besides, zebrafish and neonatal mice are well-known for their magical capacity to recover after ventricular amputation, thus becoming precious models for heart regeneration studies. In this work, we report the first wireless electrocardiography (ECG) recording system for small animal models of heart regeneration. The system consists of a microelectrode array (MEA) and electronic components for wireless powering, signal processing and data communication. The MEA is based on a biocompatible and flexible polymer so it could conform to non-planar anatomical surfaces. The power transfer is achieved using inductive coupling between two solenoids and the ECG signals are sent through an optical link. The wireless operation can free the animal, eliminating anesthesia during experiments and thus minimizing unwanted side effects. The first generation of the device was demonstrated successfully with neonatal mice, revealing awake ECG signals with all features, thereby paving the way to physiologically investigate heart regeneration in long-term without disrupting the animals' normal activities.

This CubeSat constellation will directly observe the time evolution of clouds to study the conditions that control the transition of clouds to precipitation. The TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers will penetrate into the cloud to directly observe changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. TEMPEST provides observations at five millimeter-wave frequencies from 90 to 183 GHz using a single compact instrument that is well suited for a 6U CubeSat architecture and fits well within the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative capabilities.

It is the first ever RF MEMS component reported to be operating above 220 GHz. The micromachined E-plane stub can be blocked/unblocked from the micromachined waveguide by using a MEMS-reconfigurable surface. The surface is designed so that in the blocking state it is in the H-plane and comprises the roof of the main waveguide, whereas in the non-blocking state it comprises a transmissive E-plane surface for the stub. The measurement results of the first prototypes show a return loss better than 15 dB from 500-600 GHz. The insertion loss is better than 3 dB up to 550 GHz, and better than 4 dB up to 600 GHz. The switchable stub can be utilized as a basic reconfigurable device for tuning/matching of waveguide components under operation; the implemented prototype switchable stub achieves a (measured) tuning of 2.50 at 500 GHz, with a change in S21 better than 0.15 dB for the whole band. The paper further shows that the reconfigurable stub can also be operated in analog tuning mode. This paper also demonstrates that MEMS-reconfigurable E-plane surfaces can be designed and operated deep into the submillimeter-wave frequency range.

In particular, the outstanding long-term stability [2] and practicality of the ground-based clock have attracted significant interests for time-keeping and metrology. However, the mercury RF discharge lamp used for optical pumping and state detection may limit the ultimate stability performance of the clock [3-4], constraining even broader application. For mercury ion frequency standards, the operational lamp behavior is described by the ratio of useful light at 194nm and unwanted background light at 254nm (194/254). This ratio has been observed to depend on several factors Increasing the 194nm output decreases optical pumping times and an increase of the 194/254 ratio improves the clock signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These improvements lead to an improvement in clock short-term stability and enable the use of an even broader range of local oscillators. We have carried out several experiments to unfold the relationship between the 194/254 and the fabrication factors: buffer gas pressure, lamp ID, and the quantity of mercury. The quantitative results may be used to improve the process of lamp fabrication for mercury ion frequency standards. The research here may also shed light on other lamp-based applications.

The circuit design starts from the analysis and optimization of a distributed structure, while implemented using coupled lump elements for performance improvement and area-efficient layout. Moreover, a specific bias scheme is used to further decrease insertion loss by more than 0.5 dB. This SPST switch achieves higher than 35 dB isolation over an ultra-wide frequency range, from 54 GHz to 84 GHz, a minimum 1.7 dB insertion loss, and <-10 dB return loss with 0.012 mm(2) chip area in 65 nm CMOS. This design achieves more than 10 dB enhancement of isolation by comparing with state-of-the-arts while maintaining similar insertion loss.

Gratings can have broadband reflectivity by appropriately offsetting grating resonances. Subwavelength feature sizes suppress diffraction, and the high-refractive index of the grating layer leads to relatively angle-insensitive reflectance. Gratings can be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography, making them a scalable and economical option for photovoltaic applications. Using these gratings to create a series of dichroic filters to separate incident solar light into a series of bands which can then be coupled into independent subcells has potential for high efficiency by overcoming losses due to lack of absorption of subbandgap photons and thermalization of excited carriers which account for loss of over 40% of incident power on single-junction solar cells. Independent connection and physically separated subcells permit freer bandgap selection and relieve the current-matching constraint which limits conventional monolithic tandem multijunction cell efficiency.

The design employs a series of multilayer dielectric stack filters to divide the incident spectrum onto seven independently connected subcells. We optimized the geometry and components of the design through coupled wave-optics, device physics, electrical circuit, and ray tracing models. We show a wide design space where >50% module efficiencies are possible and have chosen a design with a projected 50.8% module efficiency to prototype. Initial efforts show excellent matching of the fabricated optical splitting prism (90.1% splitting efficiency) to the theoretical design (93% splitting efficiency). Additionally, integrating fabricated concentrators yields an optical structure consistent with a 30% efficiency module.

However, the lack of an n-type dopant and surface instability have hindered the development of a high efficiency Cu2O device. In this work, the floating zone method is used to grow high quality single crystals of Cu2O in order to controllably study the interfacial reactions between Cu2O and its heterojunction partners. While inclusions of CuO are inherent to the floating zone growth process we show that they can be removed by post-annealing with phase purity and crystallinity shown by x-ray diffraction. We discuss the role of CuO inclusions on the electronic properties of single crystal Cu2O wafers using Hall measurements. Changes in the resistivity and mobility due to post-annealing are correlated to changing defect densities obtained from steady-state photoluminescence. The optimization of the Cu2O wafers provides a pathway towards the first float zone single crystal Cu2O photovoltaic device.

Measurements of the outgoing longwave radiation and vertical velocity from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis and cloud ice water content from the Microwave Limb Sounder show distinct variations in convection due to a phase shift of both El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These variations in convection are associated with changes in precipitation and water amount over the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO), depending on the phases of ENSO and/or the IOD. Over the EIO in 2006, induced by the interplay of both positive ENSO and IOD, it is drier and less isotopically depleted due to less frequent and/or weaker deep convective activity and subsequent precipitation compared to 2005. By contrast, over the WIO in 2006, an increase in water vapour and precipitation but little isotopic fractionation in water vapour of clear sky compared to 2005 is likely associated with an increase in both enhanced deep and shallow convection, caused by the positive IOD. Therefore, paleoarchives of water isotopes near Africa will be more difficult to relate to a single process because changes in convective activity result in changes in precipitation but do not have a significant impact on the isotopic composition of the source vapour based on this case analysis.

A simple application of the results proves that a smooth Fano complete intersection is separably rationally connected if and only if it is separably uniruled. In particular, a general such Fano complete intersection is separably rationally connected.

We find an overdensity of SPIRE color selected far-infrared bright galaxies (3.9 sigma compared with COSMOS field) similar to 5' west of the HAEs density peak of in a radius of 6 co-Mpc. This suggests 2QZ cluster is experiencing enhanced dusty star-formation. However, SPIRE color selection with S-500/S-350 vs S-350/S-250 has a redshift uncertainty, we need spectroscopic observation with ALMA to confirm the precise redshifts.

We detect [CII] emission in about half the sample, with [CII]/ L-IR ratios which lie between 1.6x10(-4) and 1.6x10(-3). We find that [CII]/L-IR ratios in mergers are lower by a factor of similar to 2 - 3; however we do not find evidence for a metallicity dependence. We predict based on these measurements that ALMA spectroscopy of z > 5 Lyman-break galaxies should reveal median [CII]/L-IR ratios of 6x10(-4) and maybe even as high as 10(-3), depending on whether mergers or cold gas accretion powers star-formation.

(CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-18 trace relatively denser outflow material than (CO)-C-12 and allow us to trace the outflow to lower velocities than what it possible using only the (CO)-C-12 emission. Interestingly, the cavity wall of the red lobe can be seen at velocity as low as 0.2 km/s. Using (CO)-O-18, we are now able to estimate the optical depth of CO, and then use the corrected (CO)-C-13 emission to further and better correct the (CO)-C-12 emission and estimate the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy of the outflow. Moreover, (CO)-O-18 reveals a flattened rotational structure at the center, likely to be a rotational envelope infalling onto an inner Keplerian disk.

The continuum emission extends from about 30 to 150 AU from the central star, with a depletion region at intermediate radii (similar to 80 AU). The dust density in the outer regions appears similar or larger than in the inner regions, which can be interpreted by models of formation and evolution of planetesimal belts which involve the disruptive collisions of planetesimals triggered by the recent formation of Pluto-sized bodies. If the region with lower dust density at intermediate radii in the disk is a fully depleted gap, then this structure could be carved by a planet with a mass of similar to 1 to few Earth masses at 80 AU from the star.

The Coldest Object in the Universe: Probing the Mass Distribution of the Ultra-Cold Outflow and Dusty Disk in the Boomerang Nebula	REVOLUTION IN ASTRONOMY WITH ALMA: THE THIRD YEAR	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	4th ALMA Science Conference on Revolution in Astronomy with ALMA: The Third Year	DEC 08-11, 2014	Tokyo Int Forum, Tokyo, JAPAN		Tokyo Int Forum		MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; STARS	Our Cycle 0 ALMA observations confirmed that the Boomerang Nebula is the coldest known object in the Universe, with a massive high-speed outflow that has cooled significantly below the temperature of the cosmic background (CMB). The Boomerang's prodigious mass-loss rate (0.001M(circle dot) yr(-1)) and low-luminosity (300L(circle dot)) make it a key object for understanding the remarkable transition of the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars into bipolar planetary nebulae. We have obtained new ACA CO 1-0 data that recover much of the flux lost in the Cycle 0 data, and reveal heretofore unseen distant regions of the ultra-cold outflow reheated to temperatures above the CMB. Our CO J=3-2 data reveal the precise, highly collimated shape of an inner bipolar structure and its dense central waist, with unprecedented angular resolution (0.4 ''). The waist shows a core-halo structure in the thermal dust emission at 0.88 mm, and its derived flux at this wavelength, compared with the 3.3, 2.6, and 1.3 mm fluxes support the presence of about 5 x 10(-4) M(circle dot)of very large (similar to mm-sized), cold (similar to 30K) grains. We also find the unexpected presence of weak SO emission, possibly resulting from the release of S from grains due to high-speed shocks.

High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is increasingly used to better resolve the orientation and mixing of fibers. Here, we assessed the added value of multi-shell q-space sampling on the reconstruction of major fibers using mathematical frameworks from q-ball imaging (QBI) and generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), as compared to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We scanned a healthy mouse brain using 7-Tesla 5-shell HARDI (b = 1000, 3000, 4000, 8000, 12000 s/mm(2)), also known as hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI). We found that QBI may provide greater reconstruction accuracy for major fibers, which improves with the addition of higher b-value shells, unlike GQI or DTI (as expected). Although QBI is a special case of GQI, the major fiber orientation in QBI was more closely related to the orientation in DTI, rather than GQI. HYDI can aid the clinical outcomes of research and especially - more advanced human and animal connectomics projects to map the brain's neural pathways and networks.

The OCO-2 instrument incorporates three bore-sighted, high-resolution grating spectrometers, designed to measure the near-infrared absorption of reflected sunlight by carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen. The cryocooler system design is coupled with the instrument's thermal control design to maximize the instrument's performance. A single-stage NGAS pulse tube cryocooler provides refrigeration to three focal plane arrays to similar to 120 K via a high conductance flexible thermal strap. A variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) based heat rejection system (HRS) transports waste heat from the instrument located inside the spacecraft to the space-viewing radiators. The HRS provides tight temperature control of the optics to 267 K and maintains the cryocooler at 300 K. Soon after entering the A-Train on August 3, 2014, the optics and focal planes were cooled to their operating temperatures. This paper provides a general overview of the cryogenic system design and reviews the in-flight cryogenic performance during the Observatory's first year.

However, as the hot-side temperature decreases from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, the level of radiant heat transfer drops as the fourth power of the temperature, while the heat transfer by conduction only falls off linearly. This results in cryogenic MLI being dominated by conduction, a quantity that is extremely sensitive to MLI blanket construction and very poorly quantified in the literature. To develop useful quantitative data on cryogenic blanket conduction, multilayer nonlinear heat transfer models are used to analyze extensive heat transfer data measured by Lockheed Palo Alto on their cryogenic dewar MLI and measured by JPL on their spacecraft MLI. The data-fitting aspect of the modeling allows the radiative and conductive thermal properties of the tested blankets to be explicitly quantified. Results are presented showing that MLI conductance varies by a factor of 600 between spacecraft MLI and Lockheed's best cryogenic MLI.	[Ross, R.

Runtime verification is a partial solution to this problem, consisting of checking actual execution traces against formalized requirements. A related activity is that of humans attempting to understand (or comprehend) what the system does when it executes, for validation purposes, or for simply operating the system optimally. For example, a key challenge in operating remote spacecraft is that ground operators must rely on the limited visibility available through spacecraft telemetry in order to assess spacecraft health and operational status. In this paper we illustrate the use of the rule- based runtime verification system LogFire for supporting such log comprehension. Specifically, LogFire is used for generating abstract events from the concrete events in logs, followed by a visualization of these abstract events using the D3 visualization framework.

Direct quantification is difficult because vents typically become blocked with lava at the end of eruptions. Indirect geophysical techniques have shed light on some volcanic conduit geometries, but the scales are too coarse to resolve narrow fissures (widths typically 1 m). Kilauea's Mauna Ulu eruption, which started with <50 m high Hawaiian fountains along a 4.5 km fissure on 24 May 1969, provides a unique opportunity to measure the detailed geometry of a shallow magmatic pathway, as the western vents remain unobstructed to depths >30 m. Direct measurements at the ground surface were augmented by tripod-mounted lidar measurements to quantify the shallow conduit geometry for three vents at a resolution <4 cm. We define the form of the fissure in terms of aspect ratio, flaring ratio, irregularity, sinuosity, and segmentation and discuss the factors influencing these parameters. In the past, simplified first-order fissure geometries have been used in computational modeling. Our data can provide more accurate conduit shapes for better understanding of shallow fissure fluid dynamics and how it controls eruptive behavior, especially if incorporated into computer models.

Kilauea's 5-9 March 2011 Kamoamoa Fissure Eruption and Its Relation to 30+Years of Activity From Pu'u 'O'o	HAWAIIAN VOLCANOES: FROM SOURCE TO SURFACE	Geophysical Monograph Book Series		English	Proceedings Paper	American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on Hawaiian Volcanoes - From Source to Surface	AUG 20-24, 2012	HI	Amer Geophys Union			KUPAIANAHA ERUPTION; VOLCANO; HAWAII; MAGMA; INFLATION	Lava output from Kilauea's long-lived East Rift Zone eruption, ongoing since 1983, began waning in 2010 and was coupled with uplift, increased seismicity, and rising lava levels at the volcano's summit and Pu'u 'O'o vent. These changes culminated in the four-day-long Kamoamoa fissure eruption on the East Rift Zone starting on 5 March 2011. About 2.7 x 10(6) m(3) of lava erupted, accompanied by similar to 15 cm of summit subsidence, draining of Kilauea's summit lava lake, a 113 m drop of Pu'u 'O'o's crater floor, similar to 3 m of East Rift Zone widening, and eruptive SO 2 emissions averaging 8500 tonnes/day. Lava effusion resumed at Pu'u 'O'o shortly after the Kamoamoa eruption ended, marking the onset of a new period of East Rift Zone activity. Multiparameter monitoring before and during the Kamoamoa eruption suggests that it was driven by an imbalance between magma supplied to and erupted from Kilauea's East Rift Zone and that eruptive output is affected by changes in the geometry of the rift zone plumbing system. These results imply that intrusions and eruptive changes during ongoing activity at Kilauea may be anticipated from the geophysical, geological, and geochemical manifestations of magma supply and magma plumbing system geometry.

L. Bowen published two seminal works on the chemical differentiation of magmas in which he posed the basis for a physicochemical understanding of the fractionation of crystals from melts in molten rock. A subsequent century of research and technological advances has enhanced our understanding of the physics and chemistry of magmatic systems and their temporal evolution. The image of sub-volcanic magmatic systems has evolved greatly in that time, from a simple 'boiling vat' concept of molten rock in which bubbles, crystals and melt separate gravitationally to a recognition that magma vats are relatively rare and that most magmatic systems spend much of their lifetime in a partially molten, or mushy, state. Real magmatic systems appear to be organized into a series of storage regions periodically connected by feeding structures transferring magma (and heat) at different fluxes. Magma fluxes between the different portions of this plumbing system, and the variation of the chemical and physical properties of magma as it rises through the crust, exert essential controls on the eruptive modalities of volcanoes and the geochemistry of their products. This book presents a collection of contributions that use petrology, geochemistry, geochronology and numerical modelling to identify the processes operating at different depths within magmatic systems and to characterize the fluxes of magma between them.

We present the results of hydrothermal experiments on a dacite from Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) in Colorado (USA), a classic example of a monotonous intermediate deposit, in order to characterize the variations in chemical and physical properties of hydrous dacite magmas as a function of temperature. The experiments (200 MPa, 720-1100 degrees C) span the inferred pre-eruptive conditions of FCT magmas, and are shown to provide the best match to the chemical and physical properties of the erupted magmas at 790 +/- 10 degrees C under conditions at or close to water-saturation. The results show the important effect of water content in controlling the chemical and physical evolution of magma, and the contrasted behaviour of water-saturated v. water-undersaturated magmas. In both cases, however, there is a broad interval of temperature (200 degrees C) over which crystal fraction changes little. By recasting this behaviour in terms of enthalpy, rather than temperature, as the independent variable we show that this interval corresponds to a minimum in the change in crystallinity per unit of energy added or subtracted from the system, such that small perturbations to the heat content of the system (e.g. by cooling or new magma injections) results in very little change in magma properties. The crystal content in this interval is 55-65 wt%, which is close to the phenocryst content (40-55 wt%) of monotonous intermediates. We propose that crystal-rich magmas tend to settle in this 'petrological trap', changing little in physical and chemical properties over time as the system grows. Petrological trapping enables very large volumes of intermediate magma to accumulate in the shallow crust until such time as the net buoyancy force of these crystal-rich magma is sufficient to overcome the strength of the roof rocks, leading to a potentially very large eruption.

J	Chen, B; Perona, P				Chen, Bo; Perona, Pietro			Speed versus accuracy in visual search: Optimal performance and neural architecture	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						visual search; ideal observer; speed-accuracy tradeoff; spiking neural networks; gain control	PERCEPTUAL DECISION; SET-SIZE; ATTENTION; MODELS; STIMULUS; CHOICE; CORTEX; FIELD; REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION	Searching for objects among clutter is a key ability of the visual system. Speed and accuracy are the crucial performance criteria. How can the brain trade off these competing quantities for optimal performance in different tasks? Can a network of spiking neurons carry out such computations, and what is its architecture? We propose a new model that takes input from V1-type orientation-selective spiking neurons and detects a target in the shortest time that is compatible with a given acceptable error rate. Subject to the assumption that the output of the primary visual cortex comprises Poisson neurons with known properties, our model is an ideal observer. The model has only five free parameters: the signal-to-noise ratio in a hypercolumn, the costs of false-alarm and false-reject errors versus the cost of time, and two parameters accounting for nonperceptual delays. Our model postulates two gain-control mechanisms-one local to hypercolumns and one global to the visual field-to handle variable scene complexity. Error rate and response time predictions match psychophysics data as we vary stimulus discriminability, scene complexity, and the uncertainty associated with each of these quantities. A five-layer spiking network closely approximates the optimal model, suggesting that known cortical mechanisms are sufficient for implementing visual search efficiently.

Retinotopic organization of extrastriate cortex in the owl monkey-dorsal and lateral areas	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Retinotopy; Polar angle; Eccentricity; Visual field sign; Owl monkey	TEMPORAL VISUAL AREA; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; CEBUS MONKEY; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; INTERHEMISPHERIC CONNECTIONS; VENTRAL SUBDIVISIONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS	Dense retinotopy data sets were obtained by microelectrode visual receptive field mapping in dorsal and lateral visual cortex of anesthetized owl monkeys. The cortex was then physically flatmounted and stained for myelin or cytochrome oxidase. Retinotopic mapping data were digitized, interpolated to a uniform grid, analyzed using the visual field sign technique-which locally distinguishes mirror image from nonmirror image visual field representations-and correlated with the myelin or cytochrome oxidase patterns. The region between V2 (nonmirror) and MT (nonmirror) contains three areas-DLp (mirror), DLi (nonmirror), and DLa/MTc (mirror). DM (mirror) was thin anteroposteriorly, and its reduced upper field bent somewhat anteriorly away from V2. DI (nonmirror) directly adjoined V2 (nonmirror) and contained only an upper field representation that also adjoined upper field DM (mirror). Retinotopy was used to define area VPP (nonmirror), which adjoins DM anteriorly, area FSTd (mirror), which adjoins MT ventrolaterally, and TP (mirror), which adjoins MT and DLa/MTc dorsoanteriorly. There was additional retinotopic and architectonic evidence for five more subdivisions of dorsal and lateral extrastriate cortex-TA (nonmirror), MSTd (mirror), MSTv (nonmirror), FSTv (nonmirror), and PP (mirror). Our data appear quite similar to data from marmosets, though our field sign-based areal subdivisions are slightly different. The region immediately anterior to the superiorly located central lower visual field V2 varied substantially between individuals, but always contained upper fields immediately touching lower visual field V2. This region appears to vary even more between species. Though we provide a summary diagram, given within-and between-species variation, it should be regarded as a guide to parsing complex retinotopy rather than a literal representation of any individual, or as the only way to agglomerate the complex mosaic of partial upper and lower field, mirror-and nonmirror-image patches into areas.

The control problem is formulated as a two-timescale optimal power flow problem with chance constraints, which minimizes power loss while limiting the probability of voltage violations due to fast changes in load. The control problem forms the basis of an optimization problem which determines the sizes of the control devices by minimizing sum of the expected power loss cost and the capital cost. We develop computationally efficient heuristics to solve the optimal sizing problem and implement real-time control. Numerical experiments on a circuit with high-performance computing (HPC) load show that the proposed sizing and control schemes significantly improve the reliability of voltage regulation on the expense of only a moderate increase in cost.

Impact of environmental moisture on tropical cyclone intensification	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							WAVE CRITICAL LAYER; AMBIENT MOISTURE; PART II; DRY AIR; INTENSITY; SIMULATIONS; ATLANTIC; PARAMETERIZATION; FORECASTS	The impacts of environmental moisture on the intensification of a tropical cyclone (TC) are investigated in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, with a focus on the azimuthal asymmetry of the moisture impacts relative to the storm path. A series of sensitivity experiments with varying moisture perturbations in the environment are conducted and the Marsupial Paradigm framework is employed to understand the different moisture impacts. We find that modification of environmental moisture has insignificant impacts on the storm in this case unless it leads to convective activity that deforms the quasi-Lagrangian boundary of the storm and changes the moisture transport into the storm. By facilitating convection and precipitation outside the storm, enhanced environmental moisture ahead of the northwestward-moving storm induces a dry air intrusion to the inner core and limits TC intensification. In contrast, increased moisture in the rear quadrants favors intensification by providing more moisture to the inner core and promoting storm symmetry, with primary contributions coming from moisture increase in the boundary layer. The different impacts of environmental moisture on TC intensification are governed by the relative locations of moisture perturbations and their interactions with the storm Lagrangian structure.

We present the results of a validation study of methane, version V5R_CH4_222, retrieved with the IMK/IAA (Institut fur Meteorologie und Klimaforschung,Karlsruhe/Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia, Grenada) MIPAS scientific level 2 processor. The level 1 spectra are provided by the ESA (European Space Agency) and version 5 was used. The time period covered is 2005-2012, which corresponds to the period when MIPAS measured trace gas distributions at a reduced spectral resolution of 0.0625 cm(-1). The comparison with satellite instruments includes the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment (SOFIE) and the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). Furthermore, comparisons with MkIV balloon-borne solar occultation measurements and with air sampling measurements performed by the University of Frankfurt are presented. The validation activities include bias determination, assessment of stability, precision validation, analysis of histograms and comparison of corresponding climatologies. Above 50 km altitude, MIPAS methane mixing ratios agree within 3% with ACE-FTS and SOFIE. Between 30 and 40 km an agreement within 3% with SCIAMACHY has been found. In the middle stratosphere, there is no clear indication of a MIPAS bias since comparisons with various instruments contradict each other. In the lower stratosphere (below 25 km) MIPAS CH4 is biased high with respect to satellite instruments, and the most likely estimate of this bias is 14 %. However, in the comparison with CH4 data obtained from cryogenic whole-air sampler (cryosampler) measurements, there is no evidence of a high bias in MIPAS between 20 and 25 km altitude. Precision validation is performed on collocated MIPAS-MIPAS pairs and suggests a slight underestimation of its uncertainties by a factor of 1.2. No significant evidence of an instrumental drift has been found.

Monitoring Atlantic overturning circulation and transport variability with GRACE-type ocean bottom pressure observations - a sensitivity study	OCEAN SCIENCE			English	Article							THERMOHALINE CIRCULATION	The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key mechanism for large-scale northward heat transport and thus plays an important role for global climate. Relatively warm water is transported northward in the upper layers of the North Atlantic Ocean and, after cooling at subpolar latitudes, sinks down and is transported back south in the deeper limb of the AMOC. The utility of in situ ocean bottom pressure (OBP) observations to infer AMOC changes at single latitudes has been characterized in the recent literature using output from ocean models. We extend the analysis and examine the utility of space-based observations of time-variable gravity and the inversion for ocean bottom pressure to monitor AMOC changes and variability between 20 and 60 degrees N. Consistent with previous results, we find a strong correlation between the AMOC signal and OBP variations, mainly along the western slope of the Atlantic Basin. We then use synthetic OBP data - smoothed and filtered to resemble the resolution of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) gravity mission, but without errors - and reconstruct geostrophic AMOC transport. Due to the coarse resolution of GRACE-like OBP fields, we find that leakage of signal across the step slopes of the ocean basin is a significant challenge at certain latitudes. Transport signal rms is of a similar order of magnitude as error rms for the reconstructed time series. However, the interannual AMOC anomaly time series can be recovered from 20 years of monthly GRACE-like OBP fields with errors less than 1 sverdrup in many locations.	[Bentel, K.; Landerer, F.

A COMPACTNESS LEMMA AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE EXISTENCE OF MINIMIZERS FOR THE LIQUID DROP MODEL	SIAM JOURNAL ON MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						liquid drop model; existence of minimizer; compactness	ISOPERIMETRIC PROBLEM; SHARP CONSTANTS; INEQUALITIES; SOBOLEV	The ancient Gamow liquid drop model of nuclear energies has had a renewed life as an interesting problem in the calculus of variations: Find a set Omega subset of R-3 with given volume A that minimizes the sum of its surface area and its Coulomb self energy. A ball minimizes the former and maximizes the latter, but the conjecture is that a ball is always a minimizer-when there is a minimizer. Even the existence of minimizers for this interesting geometric problem has not been shown in general. We prove the existence of the absolute minimizer (over all A) of the energy divided by A (the binding energy per particle). A second result of our work is a general method for showing the existence of optimal sets in geometric minimization problems, which we call the "method of the missing mass." A third point is the extension of the pulling back compactness lemma [E. H. Lieb, Invent. Math., 74 (1983), pp. 441-448] from W-1,W-p to BV.

In this work, we present an algorithm for predicting optimal real-time compression rates for video. The video data we consider is spatially compressed during the acquisition process, unlike in many of the standard methods. Rather than temporally compressing the frames at a fixed rate, our algorithm adaptively predicts the compression rate given the behavior of a few previous compressed frames. The algorithm uses polynomial fitting and simple filters, making it computationally feasible and easy to implement in hardware. Based on numerical simulations of real videos, the algorithm is able to capture object motion and approximate dynamics within the compressed frames. The adaptive video compression improves the quality of the reconstructed video (as compared to an equivalent fixed rate compression scheme) by several dB of peak signal-to-noise ratio without increasing the amount of information stored, as seen in numerical simulations presented here.

In the previously known case of compact hyperbolic complex surfaces, we give a new proof using their Albanese in conjunction with some key results of Faltings, but without appealing to the Shafarevich conjecture. In higher dimension, our methods allow us to solve an alternative of Ullmo and Yafaev. Our strongest result uses in addition Rogawski's theory and establishes the Mordellicity of the Baily-Borel compactifications of Picard modular surfaces of some precise levels related to the discriminant of the imaginary quadratic fields.

Unlike empirical EV, which are derived from the observed spectra, the synthetic EV are derived from a large ensemble of spectra which are calculated assuming that, given a state of the atmosphere, the spectra created by the instrument can be accurately calculated. The synthetic EV are then used to reconstruct the observed spectra. The analysis of the differences between the observed spectra and the reconstructed spectra for Simultaneous Nadir Overpasses of tropical oceans reveals unexpected differences at the more than 200 mK level under relatively clear conditions, particularly in the mid-wave water vapor channels of CrIS. The repeatability of these differences using independently trained SEV and results from different years appears to rule out inconsistences in the radiative transfer algorithm or the data simulation. The reasons for these discrepancies are under evaluation.	[Aumann, H.

OCO-2 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 2 July 2014, and joined the 705 km Afternoon Constellation a month later. Its primary instrument, a 3-channel imaging grating spectrometer, was then cooled to its operating temperatures and began collecting about one million soundings over the sunlit hemisphere each day. As expected, about 13% of these measurements are sufficiently cloud free to yield full-column estimates of the column-averaged atmospheric CO2 dry air mole fraction, X-CO2. After almost a full year in orbit, the X-CO2 product is beginning to reveal some of the most robust features of the atmospheric carbon cycle, including the northern hemisphere spring drawdown, and enhanced values co-located with intense fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions. As the carbon cycle science community continues to analyze these OCO-2 data, information on regional-scale sources (emitters) and sinks (absorbers) as well as far more subtle features are expected to emerge from this high resolution, global data set.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) has 4482 infrared detectors. The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) (a Fourier Transform Spectrometer) has 27. This paper examines issues related to multiple detectors and describes their impact on calibration and data analysis, using examples from AIRS and CrIS. The potential differences among detectors are not limited to dead channels. They can include: noise characteristics, spatial response, illumination through the optical system, and exposure to radiation. The more detectors in an instrument, the more important it is for both the hardware and data analysis software designers to be prepared to handle such differences. Techniques used to mitigate these effects are described in this paper.

Tropical simultaneous nadir observations for IR sounder evaluation and comparison	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XX	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Simultaneous Nadir Observations; SNO; AIRS; CrIS; hyperspectral sounding; infrared; climate		Simultaneous Nadir Observations (SNOs) contain thousands of pairs of observations taken within 8 km and 10 minutes. SNOs have been very useful for comparisons in polar conditions. But classic SNO pairing criteria have very low yield in the tropics, making these SNOs less useful for investigating instrument performance for hotter scenes or scenes with high contrast. We introduce a modified methodology, which finds pairs of matched spectra in a wider angular range but is restricted to the tropics. We illustrate this with AIRS and CrIS data. Insight into instrument differences is gained from statistical distributions of the residual differences between the matched pairs. A sample analysis compares AIRS and CrIS brightness temperature at 900 cm-1 as function of scene brightness temperature. The proposed method may be applicable to matchups of other sensors on different spacecraft.

Improving AIRS radiance spectra in high contrast scenes using MODIS	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XX	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		AIRS; Spatial; Co-Registration; Clouds		The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua Spacecraft was launched on May 4, 2002. AIRS acquires hyperspectral infrared radiances in 2378 channels ranging in wavelength from 3.7-15.4 mu m with spectral resolution of better than 1200, and spatial resolution of 13.5 km with global daily coverage. The AIRS is designed to measure temperature and water vapor profiles for improvement in weather forecast accuracy and improved understanding of climate processes. As with most instruments, the AIRS Point Spread Functions (PSFs) are not the same for all detectors. When viewing a non-uniform scene, this causes a significant radiometric error in some channels that is scene dependent and cannot be removed without knowledge of the underlying scene. The magnitude of the error depends on the combination of non-uniformity of the AIRS spatial response for a given channel and the non-uniformity of the scene, but is typically only noticeable in about 1% of the scenes and about 10% of the channels. The current solution is to avoid those channels when performing geophysical retrievals. In this effort we use data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument to provide information on the scene uniformity that is used to correct the AIRS data. For the vast majority of channels and footprints the technique works extremely well when compared to a Principal Component (PC) reconstruction of the AIRS channels. In some cases where the scene has high inhomogeneity in an irregular pattern, and in some channels, the method can actually degrade the spectrum. Most of the degraded channels appear to be slightly affected by random noise introduced in the process, but those with larger degradation may be affected by alignment errors in the AIRS relative to MODIS or uncertainties in the PSF. Despite these errors, the methodology shows the ability to correct AIRS radiances in non-uniform scenes under some of the worst case conditions and improves the ability to match AIRS and MODIS radiances in non-uniform scenes.

These results are obtained through the development of a reduction calculus for optimization problems over measures on spaces of measures. We use this calculus to investigate the mechanisms that generate brittleness/robustness and, in particular, we observe that learning and robustness are antagonistic properties. It is now well understood that the numerical resolution of PDEs requires the satisfaction of specific stability conditions. Is there a missing stability condition for using Bayesian inference in a continuous world under finite information?

Novel crystal detectors are continuously being discovered and developed in academia and in industry. In high energy and nuclear physics experiments, total absorption electromagnetic calorimeters (ECAL) made of inorganic crystals are known for their superb energy resolution and detection efficiency for photon and electron measurements. A crystal ECAL is thus the choice for those experiments where precision measurements of photons and electrons are crucial for their physics missions. For future HEP experiments at the energy and intensity frontiers, however, the crystal detectors used in the above mentioned ECALs are either not bright and fast enough, or not radiation hard enough. Crystal detectors have also been proposed to build a Homogeneous Hadron Calorimeter (HHCAL) to achieve unprecedented jet mass resolution by duel readout of both Cherenkov and scintillation light, where development of cost-effective crystal detectors is a crucial issue because of the huge crystal volume required. This paper discusses several R&D directions for the next generation of crystal detectors for future HEP experiments.

Previous studies have speculated on the mechanical forces required for migration by observing matrix fiber alignment, densification, and degradation, but these forces remain difficult to quantify. Here we present a new experimental technique to simultaneously measure full-field 3D displacements and structural remodeling of a fibrous matrix, both of which result from cellular forces. We apply this "2-in-1" experimental technique to follow single cells as they invade a physiologically relevant fibrin matrix. We find that cells generate tube-like structures in the matrix by plastically deforming their surroundings, and they re-use these tubes to extend protrusions. Cells generate these tubular structures by applying both pulling and pushing forces.

This approach has led to many great achievements in science, but will never help to explore the interstellar medium. Fortunately, a paradigm shift is upon us in how a spacecraft is constructed and propelled. This paper describes a mission concept to get to our Sun's Gravity Lens at 550AU in less than 10 years. It will be done by using DE-STAR, a scalable solar-powered phased-array laser in Earth Orbit, as a directed energy photon drive of low-mass wafersats. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] With recent technologies a complete mission can be placed on a wafer including, power from an embedded radio nuclear thermal generator (RTG), PV, laser communications, imaging, photon thrusters for attitude control and other sensors. As one example, a futuristic 200 MW laser array consisting of 1 - 10 kw meter scale sub elements with a 100m baseline can propel a 10 gram wafer scale spacecraft with a 3m laser sail to 60AU/Year. Directed energy propulsion of low-mass spacecraft gives us an opportunity to capture images of Alpha Centauri and its planets, detailed imaging of the cosmic microwave background, set up interstellar communications by using gravity lenses around nearby stars to boost signals from interstellar probes, and much more. This system offers a very large range of missions allowing hundreds of wafer scale payload launches per day to reach this cosmological data reservoir. Directed Energy Propulsion is the only current technology that can provide a near-term path to utilize our Sun's Gravity Lens.

Spectral Invariance Hypothesis Study of Polarized Reflectance with Ground-Based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI)	POLARIZATION SCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Polarization Science and Remote Sensing VII	AUG 11-12, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		pBRF; pBRDF; land surface reflectance; spectrally neutral; spectral invariance; Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI)	AEROSOL PROPERTIES; LAND SURFACES; RETRIEVAL	Many models used to represent the boundary condition for the separation of atmospheric scattering from the surface reflectance in polarized remote sensing measurements assume that the polarized surface reflectance is spectrally neutral. The Spectral Invariance Hypothesis asserts that the magnitude and shape of the polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF) is equal for all wavelengths. In order to test this hypothesis, JPL's Ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) is used to measure polarization information of different outdoor surface types. GroundMSPI measures the linear polarization Stokes parameters (I, Q, U), at three wavelengths, 470 nm, 660 nm, and 865 nm. The camera is mounted on a two-axis gimbal to accurately select the view azimuth and elevation directions. On clear sky days we acquired day-long scans of scenes that contain various surface types such as grass, dirt, cement, brick, and asphalt and placed a Spectralon panel in the camera field of view to provide a reflectance reference. Over the course of each day, changing solar position in the sky provides a large range of scattering angles for this study. The polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF) is measured for the three wavelengths and the best fit slope of the spectral correlation is reported. This work reports the range of best fit slopes measured for five region types.

Ground-MSPI is an eight-band spectropolarimetric camera mounted on a rotating gimbal to acquire pushbroom imagery of outdoor landscapes. The camera uses a photoelastic-modulator-based polarimetric imaging technique to measure linear Stokes parameters in three wavebands (470, 660, and 865 nm) with a +/-0.005 uncertainty in degree of linear polarization (DoLP). Comparisons between MSPI measurements, BRDM models, and common modifications to the model are made over a range of scattering angles determined from a fixed viewing geometry and varying sun positions over time. The BRDM model is comprised of a volumetric reflection term plus a specular reflection term of Fresnel-reflecting micro-facets. We consider modifications to this model using a shadowing function and two different micro-facet scattering density functions. We report the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the Ground-MSPI measurements and BRDM model. The BRDM model predicts an angle of the linear polarization (AoLP) that is perpendicular to the scattering plane. This is usually, but not always, observed in Ground-MSPI measurements and in this work we offer explanations for some of the deviations from the model.

Since these methods can impact the making of sometimes critical decisions in increasingly complicated contexts, the sensitivity of their posterior conclusions with respect to the underlying models and prior beliefs is a pressing question to which there currently exist positive and negative answers. We report new results suggesting that, although Bayesian methods are robust when the number of possible outcomes is finite or when only a finite number of marginals of the data-generating distribution are unknown, they could be generically brittle when applied to continuous systems (and their discretizations) with finite information on the data-generating distribution. If closeness is defined in terms of the total variation (TV) metric or the matching of a finite system of generalized moments, then (1) two practitioners who use arbitrarily close models and observe the same (possibly arbitrarily large amount of) data may reach opposite conclusions; and (2) any given prior and model can be slightly perturbed to achieve any desired posterior conclusion. The mechanism causing brittleness/robustness suggests that learning and robustness are antagonistic requirements, which raises the possibility of a missing stability condition when using Bayesian inference in a continuous world under finite information.

Synthetic emission spectra spanning the X-ray, UV, and visible ranges have also been calculated, based on theoretical treatment of the transfer of between one and six electrons from the target neutral to the projectile ion, followed by radiative and non-radiative decay of the resulting highly-excited projectile states.

Among them, the capture on the radioactive tritium nuclei is challenging, but perhaps doable. The principal difficulty is the need for the combination of a very strong source and very good detector resolution. It is argued that if it turns out that the neutrino masses follow the degenerate scenario, i.e. if m(nu) >= 0.1 eV for all three massive neutrinos, then it is important to devote a substantial effort to develop a realistic detection experiment.

Our result, in particular, leads to an expected polynomial-time algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of tree polymatrix games in which the number of actions per player is a fixed constant. Further, for trees with constant degree, the running time of the algorithm matches the best known upper bound for approximating Nash equilibria in bimatrix games (Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta 2003). Notably, this work closely complements the hardness result of Rubinstein (2015), which establishes the inapproximability of Nash equilibria in polymatrix games over constant-degree bipartite graphs with two actions per player.

This bound generalizes a recent result of Sharir and Solomon [20] concerning point-line incidences in four dimensions (where d = 4 and k = 2), and partly generalizes a recent result of Guth [8] (as well as the earlier bound of Guth and Katz [10]) in three dimensions (Guth's three-dimensional bound has a better dependency on q). It also improves a recent d-dimensional general incidence bound by Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl [7], in the special case of incidences with algebraic curves. Our results are also related to recent works by Dvir and Gopi [4] and by Hablicsek and Scherr [11] concerning rich lines in high-dimensional spaces.

Instantaneous longwave radiative impact of ozone: an application on IASI/MetOp observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; LOWER STRATOSPHERE; SATELLITE; IASI; SOUNDER; MODEL; ATTRIBUTION; RETRIEVALS; PROFILES; CLIMATE	Ozone is an important greenhouse gas in terms of anthropogenic radiative forcing (RF). RF calculations for ozone were until recently entirely model based, and significant discrepancies were reported due to different model characteristics. However, new instantaneous radiative kernels (IRKs) calculated from hyperspectral thermal IR satellites have been able to help adjudicate between different climate model RF calculations. IRKs are defined as the sensitivity of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) flux with respect to the ozone vertical distribution in the full 9.6 mu m band. Previous methods applied to measurements from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on Aura rely on an anisotropy approximation for the angular integration. In this paper, we present a more accurate but more computationally expensive method to calculate these kernels. The method of direct integration is based on similar principles to the anisotropy approximation, but it deals more precisely with the integration of the Jacobians. We describe both methods and highlight their differences with respect to the IRKs and the ozone longwave radiative effect (LWRE), i.e., the radiative impact in OLR due to absorption by ozone, for both tropospheric and total columns, from measurements of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard MetOp-A. Biases between the two methods vary from -25 to +20% for the LWRE, depending on the viewing angle. These biases point to the inadequacy of the anisotropy method, especially at nadir, suggesting that the TES-derived LWREs are biased low by around 25% and that chemistry-climate model OLR biases with respect to TES are underestimated. In this paper we also exploit the sampling performance of IASI to obtain first daily global distributions of the LWRE, for 12 days (the 15th of each month) in 2011, calculated with the direct integration method. We show that the temporal variation of global and latitudinal averages of the LWRE shows patterns which are controlled by changes in the surface temperature and ozone variation due to specific processes, such as the ozone hole in the polar regions and stratospheric intrusions into the troposphere.

Simulated retrievals for the remote sensing of CO2, CH4, CO, and H2O from geostationary orbit	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ERROR ANALYSIS; TOTAL COLUMNS; LOS-ANGELES; OCO MISSION; SCIAMACHY; ALGORITHM; CLOUDS	The Geostationary Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GeoFTS) is designed to measure high-resolution spectra of reflected sunlight in three near-infrared bands centered around 0.76, 1.6, and 2.3 mu m and to deliver simultaneous retrievals of column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2, CH4, CO, and H2O (denoted XCO2, XCH4, XCO, and XH2O, respectively) at different times of day over North America. In this study, we perform radiative transfer simulations over both clear-sky and all-sky scenes expected to be observed by GeoFTS and estimate the prospective performance of retrievals based on results from Bayesian error analysis and characterization. We find that, for simulated clear-sky retrievals, the average retrieval biases and single-measurement precisions are <0.2% for XCO2, XCH4, and XH2O, and <2% for XCO, when the a priori values have a bias of 3% and an uncertainty of 3 %. In addition, an increase in the amount of aerosols and ice clouds leads to a notable increase in the retrieval biases and slight worsening of the retrieval precisions. Furthermore, retrieval precision is a strong function of signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. This simulation study can help guide decisions on the design of the GeoFTS observing system, which can result in cost-effective measurement strategies while achieving satisfactory levels of retrieval precisions and biases. The simultaneous retrievals at different times of day will be important for more accurate estimation of carbon sources and sinks on fine spatiotemporal scales and for studies related to the atmospheric component of the water cycle.

Performance status of the AIRS instrument thirteen years after launch	IMAGING SPECTROMETRY XX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Imaging Spectrometry XX	AUG 10-12, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		EOS; AIRS; infrared; sounder; calibration; reliability		The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a hyperspectral infrared instrument on the EOS Aqua Spacecraft, launched on May 4, 2002. AIRS has 2378 infrared channels ranging from 3.7 mu m to 15.4 mu m and a 13.5 km footprint at nadir. AIRS is a "facility" instrument developed by NASA as an experimental demonstration of advanced technology for remote sensing and the benefits of high resolution infrared spectra to science investigations. AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), produces temperature profiles with 1K/km accuracy on a global scale, as well as water vapor profiles and trace gas amounts for CO2, CO, SO2, O-3 and CH4. AIRS data are used for weather forecasting, climate process studies and validating climate models. The AIRS instrument has far exceeded its required design life of 5 years, with nearly 13 years of routine science operations that began on August 31, 2002. While the instrument has performed exceptionally well, with little sign of wear, the AIRS Project continues to monitor and maintain the health of AIRS, characterize its behavior and improve performance where possible. Radiometric stability has been monitored and trending shows better than 16 mK/year stability. Spectral calibration stability is better than 1 ppm/year. At this time we expect the AIRS to continue to perform well into the next decade. This paper contains updates to previous instrument status reports, with emphasis on the last three years.

Model products were aggregated over sounder footprints corresponding to 13 km in LEO, 2 km in LEO, and 5 km in GEO sampled every 72 minutes. We simulated radiances for instruments with AIRS-like spectral coverage, spectral resolution, and channel noise, using these aggregated products as the truth, and analyzed them using a slightly modified version of the operational AIRS Version-6 retrieval algorithm. Accuracy of retrievals obtained using simulated AIRS radiances with a 13 km footprint was similar to that obtained using real AIRS data. Spatial coverage and accuracy of retrievals are shown for all three sounding scenarios.

The MTF of an imaging system quantifies the ability of the system to resolve or transfer spatial frequencies. In this presentation we will discuss the detail MTF measurements of 1024x1024 pixels mid-wavelength and long-wavelength quantum well infrared photodetector, and 320x256 pixels long-wavelength InAs/GaSb superlattice infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs). Long wavelength Complementary Barrier Infrared Detector (CBIRD) based on InAs/GaSb superlattice material is hybridized to recently designed and fabricated 320x256 pixel format ROIC. The n-type CBIRD was characterized in terms of performance and thermal stability. The experimentally measured NEAT of the 8.8 mu m cutoff n-CBIRD FPA was 18.6 mK with 300 K background and f/2 cold stop at 78K FPA operating temperature. The horizontal and vertical MTFs of this pixel fully delineated CBIRD FPA at Nyquist frequency are 49% and 52%, respectively.	[Gunapala, S. D.; Rafol, S. B.; Ting, D. Z.; Soibel, A.; Hill, C.

An Improved Ionospheric Modelling Technique Using GPS and Empirical-Orthogonal-Function Fits	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ION 2015 PACIFIC PNT MEETING	Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific PNT Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	Pacific PNT Meeting	APR 20-23, 2015	Honolulu, HI					Ionospheric models have become useful tools for both improving the accuracies of positioning and navigation and scientific research. The data-driven modelling techniques have been proven to be good candidates for real-time applications due to their ease of use and potentially higher accuracy compared to broadcast models. In this paper, we propose to employ ionospheric climatology to replace widely-used arbitrary functions to more accurately describe variabilities of the ionosphere. We have found that modelling precision has improved by 13.9% using the newly proposed method compared to the spherical harmonic function (SHF) modelling method. Other benefits of the modelling method are also demonstrated in the paper by comparing independent GPS observations that were not included in the original solution. In addition, we validated our new modelling results using independent data sources.

Detection of Natural-Hazards-Generated TEC Perturbations Using Ground-Based and Spaceborne Ionospheric Measurements and Potential New Applications	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ION 2015 PACIFIC PNT MEETING	Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific PNT Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	Pacific PNT Meeting	APR 20-23, 2015	Honolulu, HI				MODEL	Natural hazards including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis have been significant threats to humans throughout recorded history. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS, including the Global Positioning System (GPS)) receivers have become primary sensors to measure signatures associated with natural hazards. These signatures typically include GP S-derived seismic deformation measurements, co-seismic vertical displacements and real-time GPS-derived ocean buoy positioning estimates. Another way to use GPS observables is to compute the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) to measure, model and monitor post-seismic ionospheric disturbances caused by e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. In this paper, we discuss new applications using examples of recent natural hazards that generated TEC perturbations. We present results for state-of-the-art imaging using ground and space-based ionospheric measurements and coupled atmosphere-ionosphere modeling of ionospheric TEC perturbations. Our study strongly suggests that both ground-based and space-borne UPS remote sensing techniques could play a critical role in detection and imaging of the upper atmosphere signatures of natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The GNSS-based remote sensing of natural-hazard induced ionospheric disturbances could potentially be applied to operational tsunami and earthquake early warning systems.

Simulated GNSS Observation of Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance from Ground Receivers	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ION 2015 PACIFIC PNT MEETING	Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific PNT Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	Pacific PNT Meeting	APR 20-23, 2015	Honolulu, HI					Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TID) can be induced by acoustic waves in the neutral atmosphere, allowing such process to be observed as changes in the trans-ionospheric GNSS signal. Coherence between measurements from different stations within a large, dense GNSS network has been used to identify and characterize various TIDs. In order to evaluate the sensitivity, accuracy and possible biases of this technique, a simulator has been developed. The magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations were simplified through assumptions about the time scales of various processes, and the interactions between ions and electrons in the ionosphere. A ray-trace method was used propagate the acoustic wave from the surface and the problem was approximated as axially symmetric about the point source location, allowing a two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system to be used. These model simplifications were necessary to produce a numerically efficient algorithm capable of simulating hundreds of GNSS ray paths, in order to represent the response over a large network. Ground motion observed during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami was used to define the input signal. Synthetic waveforms produced from the model were found to agree well with the GNSS observations made in Japan during that event. Arrival time errors showed geographical correlation with the distance form the epicenter, indicating the limitations of the point-source approxiamation.	[Lee, S. C. G.; Garrison, J.

Currently, the NASA WFIRST-AFTA mission study includes an internal coronagraph instrument to find and characterize exoplanets. Various types of masks could be employed to suppress the host star light to about 10(-9) level contrast over a broad spectrum to enable the coronagraph mission objectives. Such masks for high contrast internal coronagraphic imaging require various fabrication technologies to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron scale island features, ultra-low reflectivity regions, uniformity, wave front quality, achromaticity, etc. We present the approaches employed at JPL to produce pupil plane and image plane coronagraph masks by combining electron beam, deep reactive ion etching, and black silicon technologies with illustrative examples of each, highlighting milestone accomplishments from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at JPL and from the High Contrast Imaging Lab (HCIL) at Princeton University. We also present briefly the technologies applied to fabricate laboratory scale star shade masks.

One of the coronagraphs under consideration to be used for this mission is the highly efficient Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) coronagraph. This paper presents and describes: (a) the PIAA design for Exo-C; (b) an end-to-end performance analysis including sensitivity to jitter, and (c) the expected science yield of Exo-C with PIAA. The design is a "classic" PIAA, which is made possible by the unobstructed aperture. It consists of a pair of forward and inverse PIAA optics and a simple hard-edge focal plane mask. A mild binary pre-apodizer relaxes the radius of curvature on the PIAA mirrors to be easier than typical PIAA mirrors manufactured to date. This design has been optimized for high performance while being relatively insensitive to low order aberrations. The throughput is 90% relative to telescope PSF, while the inner working angle is 2.1 l/D and the contrast is similar to 1e-9 in a full 360-degree field of view (after wavefront control with two DMs), all for a 20% spectral band centered around 550nm. The design also has good tolerance to jitter: contrast at 1.6mas jitter is still within a factor of a few of 1e-9.

One approach for achieving this performance is to fly a starshade at a long distance in front of the telescope, shading the telescope from the direct starlight, but allowing planets around the star to be seen. The starshade is positioned so that sunlight falls on the surface away from the telescope, so the sun does not directly illuminate it. However, sunlight scattered from the starshade edge can enter the telescope, raising the background light level and potentially preventing the starshade from delivering the required contrast. As a result, starshade edge design has been identified as one of the highest priority technology gaps for external occulter missions in the NASAs Exoplanet Exploration Program Technology Plan 2013. To reduce the sunlight edge scatter to an acceptable level, the edge Radius Of Curvature (ROC) should be 1 mu m or less (commercial razor blades have ROC of a few hundred nanometer). This poses a challenging manufacturing requirement and may make the occulter difficult to handle. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to controlling the edge scattering by applying a flexible metamaterial to the occulter edge. Metamaterials are artificially structured materials, which have been designed to display properties not found in natural materials. Metamaterials can be designed to direct the scatter at planned incident angles away from the space telescope, thereby directly decreasing the contaminating background light. Reduction of the background light translates into shorter integration time to characterize a target planet and therefore improves the efficiency of the observations. As an additional benefit, metamaterials also have potential to produce increased tolerance to edge defects.

The Wide Field Instrument (WFI) offers Hubble quality imaging over a 0.28 square degree field of view, and will gather NIR statistical data on exoplanets through gravitational microlensing. The second instrument is a high contrast coronagraph that will carry out the direct imaging and spectroscopic analysis of exoplanets, providing a means to probe the structure and composition of planetary systems. The coronagraph instrument is expected to operate in low photon flux for long integration times, meaning all noise sources must be kept to a minimum. In order to satisfy the low noise requirements, the Electron Multiplication (EM)-CCD has been baselined for both the imaging and spectrograph cameras. The EMCCD was selected in comparison with other candidates because of its low effective electronic read noise at sub-electron values with appropriate multiplication gain setting. The presence of other noise sources, however, such as thermal dark signal and Clock Induced Charge (CIC), need to be characterised and mitigated. In addition, operation within a space environment will subject the device to radiation damage that will degrade the Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) of the device throughout the mission lifetime. Here we present our latest results from pre- and post-irradiation testing of the e2v CCD201-20 BI EMCCD sensor, baselined for the WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph instrument. A description of the detector technology is presented, alongside considerations for operation within a space environment. The results from a room temperature irradiation are discussed in context with the nominal operating requirements of AFTA-C and future work which entails a cryogenic irradiation of the CCD201-20 is presented.

Exoplanet science with the LBTI: instrument status and plans	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets VII	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		LBT; ELT; Fizeau imaging; Infrared interferometry; Exoplanet; Exozodiacal disks	LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; NULLER; INTERFEROMETER; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM	The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) is a strategic instrument of the LBT designed for high-sensitivity, high-contrast, and high-resolution infrared (1.5-13 mu m) imaging of nearby planetary systems. To carry out a wide range of high-spatial resolution observations, it can combine the two AO-corrected 8.4-m apertures of the LBT in various ways including direct (non-interferometric) imaging, coronagraphy (APP and AGPM), Fizeau imaging, non-redundant aperture masking, and nulling interferometry. It also has broadband, narrowband, and spectrally dispersed capabilities. In this paper, we review the performance of these modes in terms of exoplanet science capabilities and describe recent instrumental milestones such as first-light Fizeau images (with the angular resolution of an equivalent 22.8-m telescope) and deep interferometric nulling observations.

Mission design for high-contrast imaging requires numerical wavefront error propagation to ensure accurate component specifications. For constructed instruments, wavelength and angle-dependent throughput and contrast models allow detailed simulations of science observations, allowing mission planners to select the most productive science targets. The PICTURE family of missions seek to quantify the optical brightness of scattered light from extrasolar debris disks via several high-contrast imaging techniques: sounding rocket (the Planet Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Rocket Experiment) and balloon flights of a visible nulling coronagraph, as well as a balloon flight of a vector vortex coronagraph (the Planetary Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Recoverable Experiment - Coronagraph, PICTURE-C). The rocket mission employs an on-axis 0.5m Gregorian telescope, while the balloon flights will share an unobstructed off-axis 0.6m Gregorian. This work details the flexible approach to polychromatic, end-to-end physical optics simulations used for both the balloon vector vortex coronagraph and rocket visible nulling coronagraph missions. We show the preliminary PICTURE-C telescope and vector vortex coronagraph design will achieve 10(-8) contrast without post-processing as limited by realistic optics, but not considering polarization or low-order errors. Simulated science observations of the predicted warm ring around Epsilon Eridani illustrate the performance of both missions.

PISCES will be used to advance the technology readiness of the high contrast IFS baselined on the Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope/Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets (WFIRST-AFTA) coronagraph instrument. PISCES will be integrated into the high contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and will work with both the Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and the Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) configurations. We discuss why the lenslet array based IFS was selected for PISCES. We present the PISCES optical design, including the similarities and differences of lenslet based IFSs to normal spectrometers, the trade-off between a refractive design and reflective design, as well as the specific function of our pinhole mask on the back surface of the lenslet array to reduce the diffraction from the edge of the lenslets. The optical analysis, alignment plan, and mechanical design of the instrument will be discussed.

It will host two major astronomical instruments: a wide-field imager (WFI) to search for dark energy and carry out wide field near infrared (NIR) surveys, and a coronagraph instrument (CGI) to image and spectrally characterize extrasolar planets. In this paper, we discuss the work that has been carried out at JPL in advancing Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) technology to higher flight maturity, with the goal of reaching a NASA technology readiness level of 6 (TRL-6) by early-to-mid 2016. The EMCCD has been baselined for both the coronagraph's imager and integral field spectrograph (IFS) based on its sub-electron noise performance at extremely low flux levels - the regime where the AFTA CGI will operate. We present results from a study that fully characterizes the beginning of life performance of the EMCCD. We also discuss, and present initial results from, a recent radiation test campaign that was designed and carried out to mimic the conditions of the WFIRST-AFTA space environment in an L2 orbit, where we sought to assess the sensor's end of life performance, particularly degradation of its charge transfer efficiency, in addition to other parameters such as dark current, electron multiplication gain, clock induced charge and read noise.

Based largely on performance predictions from end-to-end optical propagation modeling, promising coronagraphic methods were selected in late 2013 for further consideration for use on AFTA. Since those downselect analyses further modeling work has been done on evaluating refined coronagraph designs, wavefront sensing and control, detector representation, and time-dependent effects. Thermal, structural, ray trace, and diffraction propagation models are used in these studies. Presented here is the progress to date and plans for future analyses.

The starshade is flown some tens of thousands of kilometers ahead of the telescope. Science instruments may include a wide field camera for imaging the target exoplanetary system as well as an integral field spectrometer for characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We show the preliminary designs of the optical instruments for observatories such as Exo-S, discuss formation flying and control, retargeting maneuvers and other aspects of a starshade mission. The implementation of a starshade-ready WFIRST-AFTA is discussed and we show how a compact, standalone instrument package could be developed as an add-on to future space telescopes, requiring only minor additions to the telescope spacecraft.

The future generation of space and ground based coronagraphic instruments will have to achieve high contrast levels on on-axis and/or segmented telescopes. To correct for the high amplitude aberrations introduced by secondary mirror structures and segmentation of the primary mirror, we explore a two deformable mirror (DM) method. The major difficulty of several DM methods is the non-linear relation linking actuator strokes to the point spread function in the coronagraph focal plane. The Active Compensation of Aperture Discontinuities (ACAD) method is achieving this minimization by solving a non linear differential Monge Ampere equation. Once this open loop method have reached the minimum, a close-loop stroke minimization method can be applied to correct for phase and amplitude aberrations to achieve the ultimate contrast. In this paper, I describe the results of the parametric analysis that that I have undertaken on this method. After recalling the principle of the method, I will described the explored parameter space (deformable mirror set-up, shape of the pupil, bandwidth, coronagraph designs). I will precisely described the way I simulated the Vortex coronagraph for this numerical simulation. Finally I will present the preliminary results of this parametric analysis for space telescope pupils only.

The first flight in 2017 will use a 10(-4) visible nulling coronagraph (previously flown on the PICTURE sounding rocket) and the second flight in 2019 will use a 10(-7) vector vortex coronagraph. A low-order wavefront corrector (LOWC) will be used in both flights to remove time-varying aberrations from the coronagraph wavefront. The LOWC actuator is a 76-channel high-stroke deformable mirror packaged on top of a tip-tilt stage. This paper will detail the selection of a complementary high-speed, low-order wavefront sensor (LOWFS) for the mission. The relative performance and feasibility of several LOWFS designs will be compared including the Shack-Hartmann, Lyot LOWFS, and the curvature sensor. To test the different sensors, a model of the time-varying wavefront is constructed using measured pointing data and inertial dynamics models to simulate optical alignment perturbations and surface deformation in the balloon environment.

The testbed is designed to explore optimal use of starlight (including starlight rejected by the coronagraph) for wavefront control, system self-calibration, and point spread function (PSF) calibration. It is also compatible with coronagraph designs for centrally obscured and segmented apertures, and includes shaped or apodized pupils, a range of focal plane masks and Lyot stops of multiple sizes, and an optional PIAA apodizing stage. Starlight is reflected and imaged from the focal plane mask and Lyot stop for low-order wavefront sensing. Both a segmented and a continuous sheet MEMS DM are included to simulate segmented telescope pupils, apply known test phase patterns, and implement a controllable phase apodization coronagraph. The testbed is adaptable and is currently being used to investigate three different techniques: (1) the differential optical transfer function (dOTF), (2) low-order wavefront sensing (LOWFS) with a hybrid-Lyot coronagraph, and (3) linear dark field control (LDFC).

The studies are expected to include two mission concepts capable of directly imaging exo-earths (HabEx and LUVOIR). Direct imaging of an exo-earth begins with starlight suppression, which is required at a depth of 10(-10) in the visible for an earth-sun twin. The current results of laboratory coronagraphs are approaching the levels needed for the direct detection and characterization of an exo-earth. Other critical technologies are needed, such as ultra-low noise detectors, large format deformable mirrors, a large aperture space telescope, and sophisticated post-processing algorithms. While technologically challenging, the goal is not impossible; many of the required technologies are already at TRL 3 and beyond. After the successful on-orbit operation of WFIRST-AFTA in the next decade, some of the technologies will be at TRL 9. This paper summarizes the needed technologies that NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program is prioritizing for maturation.

The objective of this controller is to cancel jitter disturbances in the beam from the spacecraft to a pointing stability of 0.4 masec over the duration of the observation using a momentumcompensated FSM. The plant model for the FSM was characterized experimentally, and the sensor model is based on simulated modeling. The control approach is divided between feedback compensation of low frequency attitude control system (ACS) drift, and feedforward cancellation of high frequency tonal disturbances originating from reaction wheel excitation of the telescope structure. This paper will present various aspects of the controller design, plant characterization, sensor modeling, disturbance estimation, performance simulation, and preliminary experimental testing results.

A Mach-Zehnder interferometer based on orbital angular momentum for improved vortex coronagraph efficiency	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets VII	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Orbital angular momentum; Coronagraphy; Interferometry; Birefringence; Polarization	1ST LIGHT; PHOTON; PHASE	The Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) is a vectorial vortex phase mask. it act, as a half-wave plate with a radial fast axis orientation operating in the mid infrared domain. When placed at the the focus of a telescope element provides a continuous helical phase ramp for an on axis sources, which creates the orbital angular momentum. Thanks to that phase, the intensity of the central source is canceled by a down-stream pupil stop, while the off axis sources are not affected. However due to experimental conditions the nulling is hardly perfect. To improve the null, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer containing Dove prisms differently oriented can be proposed to sort out light based on its orbital angular momentum (OAM). Thanks to the differential rotation of the beam, a 7 phase shift is achieved for the on axis light affected by a non zero OAM Therefore the contrast between the star and its faint companion is enhanced. Nevertheless, due the Dove prisms birefringence, the performance of the interferometer is relatively poor. To solve this problem, we propose to add a birefringent wave-plate in each arm to compensate this birefringence. In this paper, we will develop the mathematical model of the wave front using the Jones formalism. The performance of the interferometer is at first computed for the simple version without the birefringent plate. Then the effect of the birefringent plate is be mathematically described and the performance is re-computed.

Phase-only and complex masks are designed for the entrance pupil, focal plane, and the plane of the Lyot stop. Optimal masks are obtained using both analytical and numerical methods. The latter makes use of an iterative error reduction algorithm to calculate "correcting" optics that mitigate unwanted diffraction from aperture obstructions. We analyze the achieved performance in terms of starlight suppression, contrast, off-axis image quality, and chromatic dependence. Manufacturing considerations and sensitivity to aberrations are also discussed. This work provides a path to joint optimization of multiple coronagraph planes to maximize sensitivity to exoplanets and other faint companions.

The LOWFS/C uses the rejected stellar light from coronagraph to sense and suppress the telescope pointing drift and jitter as well as the low order wavefront errors due to changes in thermal loading on the telescope and the rest of the observatory. In this paper we will present an overview of the low order wavefront sensing and control subsystem for the WFIRST Coronagraph. We will describe LOWFS/C's Zernike wavefront sensor concept and control design, and present an overview of sensing performance analysis and modeling, predicted line-of-sight jitter suppression loop performance, as well as the low order wavefront error correction with the coronagraph's deformable mirror.

The coronagraph employs two sequential deformable mirrors (DMs) to compensate for phase and amplitude errors in creating dark holes. DMs are critical elements in high contrast coronagraphs, requiring precision and stability measured in picometers to enable detection of Earth-like exoplanets. Working with a low-order wavefront-sensor the DM that is conjugate to a pupil can also be used to correct low-order wavefront drift during a scientific observation. However, not all actuators in a DM have the same gain. When using such a DM in low-order wavefront sensing and control subsystem, the actuator gain calibration errors introduce highspatial frequency errors to the DM surface and thus worsen the contrast performance of the coronagraph. We have investigated the effects of actuator gain calibration errors and the actuator command digitization errors on the contrast performance of the coronagraph through modeling and simulations, and will present our results in this paper.

Scaling relation for occulter manufacturing errors	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets VII	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		External Occulters; Starshades; High Contrast Imaging; Scaling; Scalar Diffraction; Optical Verification		An external occulter is a spacecraft flown along the line-of-sight of a space telescope to suppress starlight and enable high-contrast direct imaging of exoplanets. The shape of an external occulter must be specially designed to optimally suppress starlight; however, deviations from the ideal shape such as manufacturing errors can result in loss of suppression in the shadow. Due to the long separation distances and large dimensions involved for a space occulter, laboratory testing is conducted with scaled versions of occulters etched on silicon wafers. Using numerical simulations for a flight Fresnel occulter design, we show how the suppression performance of an occulter mask scales with the available propagation distance for expected random manufacturing defects along the edge of the occulter petal. We derive an analytical model for predicting performance due to such manufacturing defects across the petal edges of an occulter mask and compare this with the numerical simulations. We discuss the scaling of an extended occulter testbed.	[Sirbu, Dan; Kasdin, N.

Philip			Preliminary analysis of effect of random segment errors on coronagraph performance	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets VII	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Space Telescope Mirrors; Segmented Mirrors; Systems Engineering; Conoragraph		"Are we alone in the Universe?" is probably the most compelling science question of our generation. To answer it requires a large aperture telescope with extreme wavefront stability. To image and characterize Earth-like planets requires the ability to block 10(10) of the host star's light with a 10(-11) stability. For an internal coronagraph, this requires correcting wavefront errors and keeping that correction stable to a few picometers rms for the duration of the science observation. This requirement places severe specifications upon the performance of the observatory, telescope and primary mirror. A key task of the AMTD project (initiated in FY12) is to define telescope level specifications traceable to science requirements and flow those specifications to the primary mirror. From a systems perspective, probably the most important question is: What is the telescope wavefront stability specification? Previously, we suggested this specification should be 10 picometers per 10 minutes; considered issues of how this specification relates to architecture, i.e. monolithic or segmented primary mirror; and asked whether it was better to have few or many segments. This paper reviews the 10 picometers per 10 minutes specification; provides analysis related to the application of this specification to segmented apertures; and suggests that a 3 or 4 ring segmented aperture is more sensitive to segment rigid body motion that an aperture with fewer or more segments.

Exo-C: A probe-scale space observatory for direct imaging and spectroscopy of extrasolar planetary systems	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets VII	AUG 10-13, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Exoplanets; high contrast imaging; optical astronomy; space mission concepts		"Exo-C" is NASAs first community study of a modest aperture space telescope mission that is optimized for high contrast observations of exoplanetary systems. The mission will be capable of taking optical spectra of nearby exoplanets in reflected light, discovering previously undetected planets, and imaging structure in a large sample of circumstellar disks. It will obtain unique science results on planets down to super-Earth sizes and serve as a technology pathfinder toward an eventual flagship-class mission to find and characterize habitable Earth-like exoplanets. We present the mission/payload design and highlight steps to reduce mission cost/risk relative to previous mission concepts. Key elements are an unobscured telescope aperture, an internal coronagraph with deformable mirrors for precise wavefront control, and an orbit and observatory design chosen for high thermal stability. Exo-C has a similar telescope aperture, orbit, lifetime, and spacecraft bus requirements to the highly successful Kepler mission (which is our cost reference). Much of the needed technology development is being pursued under the WFIRST coronagraph study and would support a mission start in 2017, should NASA decide to proceed. This paper summarizes the study final report completed in March 2015.

The mission is comprised of two formation-flying spacecraft - a starlight suppressing starshade and a telescope separated by similar to 30,000 km. To align the starshade between the target star and telescope, one of the two spacecraft must perform a retargeting slew. This drives the need for a sophisticated program to help optimize this path to maximize target yield within mission constraints such as solar and earth avoidance angles, thrust and fuel limitations, and target scheduling for previously-discovered known giant planets. The Design Reference Mission (DRM) describes the sequence of observations to be performed and estimates the number of planets that will be detected and characterized. It is executed with a Matlab-based tool developed for the Exo-S Study. Here we analyze four case studies: Case 1: Starshade with a 1.1m dedicated telescope prioritizing the search for earths in the Habitable Zone (HZ). Case 2: Starshade with a 1.1m dedicated telescope focused on maximizing planet harvest return and characterization. Case 3: Starshade that rendezvous with a 2.4 m shared telescope prioritizing the search for earths in the HZ. Case 4: A Rendezvous Earth Finder mission based on a 40-m diameter starshade with a 2.4 m telescope, operating for 4 years, and focused exclusively on detecting Earths in the HZ Previous starshade DRM tools have been reported in the literature, all of them focused on detection and/or characterization of Earth-twins in the habitable zone. This study has taken then next step and focused on total planet harvest including known Gas Giants, Earths in the Habitable Zone and elsewhere, super-earths, sub-Neptunes, and Jupiters. The DRM employs a hierarchical approach: an observation schedule of known radial velocity gas giants, whose availabilities for observation are known form their orbital parameters, forms a "framework" of observation that have a high probability of success. Between these observations, the next highest priority stars are scheduled and these in turn form the framework for the next observational tier. We report the expected observational completeness, planet yields, and planet characterizations for the three case studies.	[Trabert, Rachel; Shaklan, Stuart; Lisman, P.

To maintain the high contrast needed for the coronagraph, wavefront error (WFE) of the optical system needs to be continuously sensed and controlled. Low Order Wavefront Sensing (LOWFS) uses the rejected starlight from an immediate focal plane to sense wavefront changes (mostly thermally induced low order WFE) by combining the LOWFS mask (a phase plate located at the small center region with reflective layer) with the starlight rejection masks, i.e. Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC)'s occulter or Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC)'s field stop. Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) measures phase via the phase-contrast method and is known to be photon noise optimal for measuring low order aberrations. Recently, ZWFS was selected as the baseline LOWFS technology on WFIST/AFTA for its good sensitivity, accuracy, and its easy integration with the starlight rejection mask. In this paper, we review the theory of ZWFS operation, describe the ZWFS algorithm development, and summarize various numerical sensitivity studies on the sensor performance. In the end, the predicted sensor performance on SPC and HLC configurations are presented.	[Wang, Xu; Wallace, J.

The science goals of ATLAST address a broad range of astrophysical questions from early galaxy and star formation to the processes that contributed to the formation of life on Earth, combining general astrophysics with direct-imaging and spectroscopy of habitable exoplanets. The key technologies are: internal coronagraphs, starshades (or external occulters), ultra-stable large-aperture telescopes, detectors, and mirror coatings. Selected technology performance goals include: 1x10(-10) raw contrast at an inner working angle of 35 milli-arcseconds, wavefront error stability on the order of 10 pm RMS per wavefront control step, autonomous on-board sensing & control, and zero-read-noise single-photon detectors spanning the exoplanet science bandpass between 400 nm and 1.8 mu m. Development of these technologies will provide significant advances over current and planned observatories in terms of sensitivity, angular resolution, stability, and high-contrast imaging. The science goals of ATLAST are presented and flowed down to top-level telescope and instrument performance requirements in the context of a reference architecture: a 10-meter-class, segmented aperture telescope operating at room temperature (similar to 290 K) at the sun-Earth Lagrange-2 point. For each technology area, we define best estimates of required capabilities, current state-of-the-art performance, and current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) -thus identifying the current technology gap. We report on current, planned, or recommended efforts to develop each technology to TRL 5.

ATLAST ULE Mirror Segment Performance Analytical Predictions Based on Thermally Induced Distortions	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VII	AUG 09-10, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		ATLAST; thermal distortion; ULE; UV; HST; JWST		The Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) is a concept for a 9.2 m aperture space-borne observatory operating across the UV/Optical/NIR spectra. The primary mirror for ATLAST is a segmented architecture with pico-meter class wavefront stability. Due to its extraordinarily low coefficient of thermal expansion, a leading candidate for the primary mirror substrate is Corning's ULE (R) titania-silicate glass. The ATLAST ULE (R) mirror substrates will be maintained at 'room temperature' during on orbit flight operations minimizing the need for compensation of mirror deformation between the manufacturing temperature and the operational temperatures. This approach requires active thermal management to maintain operational temperature while on orbit. Furthermore, the active thermal control must be sufficiently stable to prevent time-varying thermally induced distortions in the mirror substrates. This paper describes a conceptual thermal management system for the ATLAST 9.2 m segmented mirror architecture that maintains the wavefront stability to less than 10 pico-meters/10 minutes RMS. Thermal and finite-element models, analytical techniques, accuracies involved in solving the mirror figure errors, and early findings from the thermal and thermal-distortion analyses are presented.

The X-ray Surveyor Mission: A Concept Study	UV, X-RAY, AND GAMMA-RAY SPACE INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY XIX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV, X-Ray, and Gamma-Ray Space Instrumentation for Astronomy XIX	AUG 09-10, 2015	San Diego, CA	SPIE		X-ray Astronomy; X-ray optics; X-ray gratings; X-ray detectors	SPECTROSCOPY	NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory continues to provide an unparalleled means for exploring the high-energy universe. With its half-arcsecond angular resolution, Chandra studies have deepened our understanding of galaxy clusters, active galactic nuclei, galaxies, supernova remnants, neutron stars, black holes, and solar system objects. As we look beyond Chandra, it is clear that comparable or even better angular resolution with greatly increased photon throughput is essential to address ever more demanding science questions-such as the formation and growth of black hole seeds at very high redshifts; the emergence of the first galaxy groups; and details of feedback over a large range of scales from galaxies to galaxy clusters. Recently, we initiated a concept study for such a mission, dubbed X-ray Surveyor. The X-ray Surveyor strawman payload is comprised of a high-resolution mirror assembly and an instrument set, which may include an X-ray microcalorimeter, a high-definition imager, and a dispersive grating spectrometer and its readout. The mirror assembly will consist of highly nested, thin, grazing-incidence mirrors, for which a number of technical approaches are currently under development-including adjustable X-ray optics, differential deposition, and new polishing techniques applied to a variety of substrates. This study benefits from previous studies of large missions carried out over the past two decades and, in most areas, points to mission requirements no more stringent than those of Chandra.

FIREBall-2 is designed to measure emission from the strong resonance lines of HI, OVI, and CIV, all red-shifted to 195-225 nm window; its detector is a delta-doped electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EM-CCD). Delta-doped arrays, invented at JPL, achieve 100% internal QE from the UV through the visible. External losses due to reflection (similar to 70% in some UV regions) can be mitigated with antireflection coatings (ARCs). Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), thin-film optical filters are incorporated with existing detector technologies. ALD offers nanometer-scale control over film thickness and interface quality, allowing for precision growth of multilayer films. Several AR coatings, including single and multi-layer designs, were tested for FIREBall-2. QE measurements match modeled transmittance behavior remarkably well, showing improved performance in the target wavelength range. Also under development are ALD coatings to enhance QE for a variety of spectral regions throughout the UV (90-320 nm) and visible (320-1000 nm) range both for space-based imaging and spectroscopy as well as for ground-based telescopes.

The optical, mechanical and chemical properties of this overcoat material strongly affect the spectral reflective properties and durability of the mirror system. We are developing atomic layer deposited metal fluorides and assessing their applicability for future astronomical space missions in the ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. We are currently performing depositions on silicon wafers to serve as a basis for the metal-fluoride on Al depositions. In this paper we present reflectance, surface roughness, environmental storage and polarization sensitivity results of thin layers of AlF3 on silicon. Atomic layer deposited coatings of AlF3 grown at 100 and 200 degrees C yield good optical characteristics deduced from reflectance measurements from 90 - 800 nm and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements from 200 - 800 nm, which are consistent with calculations from optical constants derived by our group and from the literature. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements demonstrate a 15% increase in surface roughness for a similar to 25 nm film with respect to a silicon reference. Temporary storage in a gN(2) box minimally affects the UV reflectance of similar to 30 nm of AlF3 on Si. Overall, these coatings have proven to be versatile and optically stable in the early phases of development.

The enormous abundance enhancement of the rare 3 He isotope is the most striking feature of these events, though large enhancements in heavy and ultra-heavy nuclei are also observed. Recurrent 3 He-rich SEPs in impulsive events have only been observed for limited time periods, up to a few days which is typically the time that a single stationary spacecraft is magnetically connected to the source active regions on the Sun. With the launch of the two STEREO spacecraft we now have the possibility of longer connection time to solar active regions. We examined the evolution of source regions showing repeated 3 He-rich SEP emissions for relatively long time periods. We found that recurrent 3 He-rich SEPs in these long-lived sources occur after the emergence of magnetic flux.	[Bucik, R.; Innes, D. E.; Chen, N.

For this purpose we describe the microstructures by laminates of first order. We propose an analytical partial relaxation of an incompressible neo-Hookean energy formulation, keeping the internal variables and geometric microstructure parameters fixed, thus approximating the relaxed energy by an upper bound of the rank-one-convex hull. Based on the minimization of a Lagrange functional, consisting of the sum of rate of energy and dissipation potential, we derive an incremental strategy to model the time-continuous evolution of the laminate microstructure. Special attention is given to the three distinct cases of microstructure evolution, initiation, rotation, and continuous change. We compare a rate-independent approach with another one that employs viscous regularization which has certain advantages concerning the numerical implementation. Simple shear and tension/compression tests will be shown to demonstrate the differences between both approaches and to show the physical implications of the models introduced.

The design is based on a 3200 x 480 element x 18 mu m pixel size focal plane array, two of which are utilized to cover the full swath. At an optical speed of F/1.8, the system is the fastest proposed to date to our knowledge. The utilization of only two spectrometer modules fed from the same telescope reduces system complexity while providing a solution within achievable detector technology. Predictions of complete system response are shown. Also, it is shown that detailed ghost analysis is a requirement for this type of spectrometer and forms an essential part of a complete design.

J	Woo, R				Woo, Richard			Perception of Solar Eclipses Captured by Art Explains How Imaging Misrepresented the Source of the Solar Wind	I-PERCEPTION			English	Article						Solar eclipse; perception; art; imaging; solar corona; solar wind	MAGNETIC-FIELDS	The visible corona revealed by the natural phenomenon of solar eclipses has been studied for 150 years. A turning point has been the discovery that the true spatial distribution of coronal brightness can neither be seen nor imaged on account of its unprecedented dynamic range. Howard Russell Butler (1856-1934), the painter of solar eclipses in the early 20th century, possessed the extraordinary skill of painting from memory what he saw for only a brief time. His remarkable but forgotten eclipse paintings are, therefore, ideal for capturing and representing best the perceptual experience of the visible corona. Explained here is how by bridging the eras of visual (late 19th century) and imaging investigations (since the latter half of the 20th century), Butler's paintings reveal why white-light images misled researching and understanding the Sun's atmosphere, the solar wind. The closure in understanding solar eclipses through the convergence of perception, art, imaging, science and the history of science promises to enrich the experience of viewing and photographing the first solar eclipse of the 21st century in the United States on 21st August 2017.

A key enabling design element is the unipolar barrier, which is used to implement the complementary barrier infra-red detector (CBIRD) design for increasing the collection efficiency of photogenerated carriers, and reducing dark current generation without impeding photocurrent flow. Heterostructure superlattice detectors that make effective use of unipolar barriers have demonstrated strong reduction of generation-recombination (G-R) dark current due to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) processes. In the last several years we solely focused on the development of antimonide based IR detectors. Recently, we demonstrated RoA values over 14,000 Ohm cm(2) for a 9.9 mu m cutoff device by incorporating electron-blocking and hole-blocking unipolar barriers.

J	Chen, YK; Lewis, NS; Xiang, CX				Chen, Yikai; Lewis, Nathan S.; Xiang, Chengxiang			Operational constraints and strategies for systems to effect the sustainable, solar-driven reduction of atmospheric CO2	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; EXCHANGE; ELECTRODES; CAPTURE; ENERGY; DIFFUSIVITY; PERMEATION; PHOSPHIDE	The operational constraints for a 6-electron/6-proton CO2 reduction system that operates at the concentration of CO2 in the current atmosphere (p(CO2) = 400 ppm) have been evaluated on a variety of scale lengths that span from laboratory scale to global scale. Due to the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, limitations due to mass transport of CO2 from the tropopause have been evaluated through five different regions, each with different characteristic length scales: the troposphere; the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL); the canopy layer; a membrane layer; and an aqueous electrolyte layer. The resulting CO2 conductances, and associated physical transport limitations, will set the ultimate limit on the efficiency and areal requirements of a sustainable solar-driven CO2 reduction system regardless of the activity or selectivity of catalysts for reduction of CO2 at the molecular level. At the electrolyte/electrode interface, the steady-state limiting current density and the concomitant voltage loss associated with the CO2 concentration overpotential in a one-dimensional solar-driven CO2 reduction cell have been assessed quantitatively using a mathematical model that accounts for diffusion, migration and convective transport, as well as for bulk electrochemical reactions in the electrolyte. At p(CO2) = 400 ppm, the low diffusion coefficient combined with the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions constrains the steady-state limiting current density to <0.1 mA cm(-2) in a typical electrochemical cell with natural convection and employing electrolytes with a range of pH values. Hence, in such a system, the CO2 capture area must be 100- to 1000-fold larger than the solar photon collection area to enable a >10% efficient solar-driven CO2 reduction system (based on the solar collection area). This flux limitation is consistent with estimates of oceanic CO2 uptake fluxes that have been developed in conjunction with carbon-cycle analyses for use in coupled atmosphere/ocean general circulation models. Two strategies to improve the feasibility of obtaining efficient and sustainable CO2 transport to a cathode surface at p(CO2) = 400 ppm are described and modeled quantitatively. The first strategy employs yet unknown catalysts, analogous to carbonic anhydrases, that dramatically accelerate the chemically enhanced CO2 transport in the aqueous electrolyte layer by enhancing the acid-base reactions in a bicarbonate buffer system. The rapid interconversion from bicarbonate to CO2 in the presence of such catalysts near the cathode surface would in principle yield significant increases in the steady-state limiting current density and allow for >10% solar-fuel operation at the cell level. The second strategy employs a thin-layer cell architecture to improve the diffusive transport of CO2 by use of an ultrathin polymeric membrane electrolyte. Rapid equilibration of CO2 at the gas/electrolyte interface, and significantly enhanced diffusive fluxes of CO2 in electrolytes, are required to increase the steady-state limiting current density of such a system. This latter approach however only is feasible for gaseous products, because liquid products would coat the electrode and therefore thicken the hydrodynamic boundary layer and accordingly reduce the diffusive CO2 flux to the electrode surface. Regardless of whether the limitations due to mass transport to the electrode surface are overcome on the laboratory scale, at global scales the ultimate CO2 flux limitations will be dictated by mass transport considerations related to transport of atmospheric CO2 to the boundary plane of the solar-driven reactor system. The transport of CO2 across the troposphere/ABL interface, the ABL/canopy layer interface, and the canopy layer/electrolyte interface have therefore been assessed in this work, to provide upper bounds on the ultimate limits for the solar-to-fuel (STF) conversion efficiency for systems that are intended to effect the reduction of atmospheric CO2 in a sustainable fashion at global scale.

J	Huo, PF; Miller, TF				Huo, Pengfei; Miller, Thomas F., III			Electronic coherence and the kinetics of inter-complex energy transfer in light-harvesting systems	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							QUANTUM COHERENCE; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; EXCITON COHERENCE; CLASSICAL ANALOG; CONDENSED-PHASE; TRANSFER RATES; DYNAMICS; COMPLEXES; TRANSPORT; MODEL	We apply real-time path-integral dynamics simulations to characterize the role of electronic coherence in inter-complex excitation energy transfer (EET) processes. The analysis is performed using a system-bath model that exhibits the essential features of light-harvesting networks, including strong intra-complex electronic coupling and weak inter-complex coupling. Strong intra-complex coupling is known to generate both static and dynamic electron coherences, which delocalize the exciton over multiple chromophores and potentially influence the inter-complex EET dynamics. With numerical results from partial linearized density matrix (PLDM) real-time path-integral calculations, it is found that both static and dynamic coherence are correlated with the rate of inter-complex EET. To distinguish the impact of these two types of intra-complex coherence on the rate of inter-complex EET, we use Multi-Chromophore Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (MC-FRET) theory to map the original parameterization of the system-bath model to an alternative parameterization for which the effects of static coherence are preserved while the effects of dynamic coherence are largely eliminated. It is then shown that both parameterizations of the model (i.e., the original that supports dynamic coherence and the alternative that eliminates it), exhibit nearly identical EET kinetics and population dynamics over a wide range of parameters. These observations are found to hold for cases in which either the EET donor or acceptor is a dimeric complex and for cases in which the dimeric complex is either symmetric or asymmetric. The results from this study suggest that dynamic coherence plays only a minor role in the actual kinetics of inter-complex EET, whereas static coherence largely governs the kinetics of incoherent inter-complex EET in light-harvesting networks.

In particular, it allows one to answer questions like Is there a direct relation between Khovanov homology and the A-polynomial of a knot? which would not have been asked otherwise. We will explain that the answer to this question is "yes" and introduce a certain deformation of the planar algebraic curve defined by the zero locus of the A-polynomial. This novel deformation leads to a categorified version of the Generalized Volume Conjecture that completely describes the "color behavior" of the colored sl(2) knot homology and, eventually, to a similar conjecture for the colored HOMFLY homology. Furthermore, this deformation is strong enough to distinguish mutants, and its most interesting properties include relations to knot contact homology and knot Floer homology.

The Si NCs exhibit nanosecond PL decay dynamics that is independent of NC size and uniform across the emission spectrum.

S	Broadbent, A; Jeffery, S		Gennaro, R; Robshaw, M		Broadbent, Anne; Jeffery, Stacey			Quantum Homomorphic Encryption for Circuits of Low T-gate Complexity	ADVANCES IN CRYPTOLOGY, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO)	AUG 16-20, 2015	Santa Barbara, CA	Intl Assoc Cryptol Res, UCSB Comp Sci Dept, Qualcomm, NSF, Microsoft				Fully homomorphic encryption is an encryption method with the property that any computation on the plaintext can be performed by a party having access to the ciphertext only. Here, we formally define and give schemes for quantum homomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such that quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our schemes allow for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for circuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion of the circuit (we use the "pi/8" non-Clifford group gate, also known as the T-gate). More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a decryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of T-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with the total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of length given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's T-gate depth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant T-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption scheme. A further contribution of ours is to formally define the security of encryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attacks in both the public-and private-key settings. In this context, we show the equivalence of several definitions. Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern cryptographic definitions, and can be seen as a quantum analogue of classical results establishing homomorphic encryption for circuits with a limited number of multiplication gates. Historically, such results appeared as precursors to the breakthrough result establishing classical fully homomorphic encryption.

Optimization of the GSFC TROPOZ DIAL retrieval using synthetic lidar returns and ozonesondes - Part 1: Algorithm validation	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION LIDAR; OZONE; PROFILES	The main purpose of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center TROPospheric OZone DIfferential Absorption Lidar (GSFC TROPOZ DIAL) is to measure the vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone for science investigations. Because of the important health and climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, it is imperative to quantify background photochemical ozone concentrations and ozone layers aloft, especially during air quality episodes. For these reasons, this paper addresses the necessary procedures to validate the TROPOZ retrieval algorithm and confirm that it is properly representing ozone concentrations. This paper is focused on ensuring the TROPOZ algorithm is properly quantifying ozone concentrations, and a following paper will focus on a systematic uncertainty analysis. This methodology begins by simulating synthetic lidar returns from actual TROPOZ lidar return signals in combination with a known ozone profile. From these synthetic signals, it is possible to explicitly determine retrieval algorithm biases from the known profile. This was then systematically performed to identify any areas that need refinement for a new operational version of the TROPOZ retrieval algorithm. One immediate outcome of this exercise was that a bin registration error in the correction for detector saturation within the original retrieval was discovered and was subsequently corrected for. Another noticeable outcome was that the vertical smoothing in the retrieval algorithm was upgraded from a constant vertical resolution to a variable vertical resolution to yield a statistical uncertainty of < 10 %. This new and optimized vertical-resolution scheme retains the ability to resolve fluctuations in the known ozone profile, but it now allows near-field signals to be more appropriately smoothed. With these revisions to the previous TROPOZ retrieval, the optimized TROPOZ retrieval algorithm (TROPOZ(opt)) has been effective in retrieving nearly 200m lower to the surface. Also, as compared to the previous version of the retrieval, the TROPOZopt had an overall mean improvement of 3.5 %, and large improvements (upwards of 10-15% as compared to the previous algorithm) were apparent between 4.5 and 9 km. Finally, to ensure the TROPOZopt retrieval algorithm is robust enough to handle actual lidar return signals, a comparison is shown between four nearby ozonesonde measurements. The ozonesondes are mostly within the TROPOZopt retrieval uncertainty bars, which implies that this exercise was quite successful.	[Sullivan, J. T.; McGee, T.

Real-time remote detection and measurement for airborne imaging spectroscopy: a case study with methane	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							THERMAL EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY; CARBON-DIOXIDE OBSERVATIONS; COLUMN-AVERAGED METHANE; SPECTROMETER SYSTEM; ANOMALY DETECTION; VOLCANIC SO2; RETRIEVAL; AIRCRAFT; ONBOARD; CALIBRATION	Localized anthropogenic sources of atmospheric CH4 are highly uncertain and temporally variable. Airborne remote measurement is an effective method to detect and quantify these emissions. In a campaign context, the science yield can be dramatically increased by real-time retrievals that allow operators to coordinate multiple measurements of the most active areas. This can improve science outcomes for both single-and multiple-platform missions. We describe a case study of the NASA/ESA CO2 and MEthane eXperiment (COMEX) campaign in California during June and August/September 2014. COMEX was a multi-platform campaign to measure CH4 plumes released from anthropogenic sources including oil and gas infrastructure. We discuss principles for real-time spectral signature detection and measurement, and report performance on the NASA Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). AVIRIS-NG successfully detected CH4 plumes in real-time at Gb s(-1) data rates, characterizing fugitive releases in concert with other in situ and remote instruments. The teams used these real-time CH4 detections to coordinate measurements across multiple platforms, including airborne in situ, airborne non-imaging remote sensing, and ground-based in situ instruments. To our knowledge this is the first reported use of real-time trace-gas signature detection in an airborne science campaign, and presages many future applications. Post-analysis demonstrates matched filter methods providing noise-equivalent (1 sigma) detection sensitivity for 1.0% CH4 column enhancements equal to 141 ppm m.	[Thompson, D.

Very little is known in terms of the power of this class. The only proposed approach for establishing upper bounds is based on a hierarchy of semidefinite programs introduced independently by Pironio et al. and Doherty et al. in 2006. This hierarchy converges to a value, the field-theoretic value, that is only known to coincide with the provers' maximum success probability in a given proof system under a plausible but difficult mathematical conjecture, Connes' embedding conjecture. No bounds on the rate of convergence are known. We introduce a rounding scheme for the hierarchy, establishing that any solution to its N-th level can be mapped to a strategy for the provers in which measurement operators associated with distinct provers have pairwise commutator bounded by O(l(2)/root N) in operator norm, where l is the number of possible answers per prover. Our rounding scheme motivates the introduction of a variant of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, called MIP delta*, in which the soundness property is required to hold against provers allowed to operate on the same Hilbert space as long as the commutator of operations performed by distinct provers has norm at most delta. Our rounding scheme implies the upper bound MIP delta*subset of DTIME(exp(exp(poly)/delta(2))). In terms of lower bounds we establish that MIP2-poly* contains NEXP with completeness 1 and soundness 1 - 2(-poly). We discuss connections with the mathematical literature on approximate commutation and applications to device-independent cryptography.

Using satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration and groundwater changes to determine anthropogenic water fluxes in land surface models	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							ENERGY-BALANCE; UNITED-STATES; IRRIGATION; PRECIPITATION; DEPLETION; MISSION; SUSTAINABILITY; TEMPERATURE; MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE	Irrigation is a widely used water management practice that is often poorly parameterized in land surface and climate models. Previous studies have addressed this issue via use of irrigation area, applied water inventory data, or soil moisture content. These approaches have a variety of drawbacks including data latency, accurately prescribing irrigation intensity, and a lack of conservation of water volume for models using a prescribed soil moisture approach. In this study, we parameterize irrigation fluxes using satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) compared to ET from a suite of land surface models without irrigation. We then incorporate the irrigation flux into the Community Land Model (CLM) and use a systematic trial-and-error procedure to determine the ground- and surface-water withdrawals that are necessary to balance the new irrigation flux. The resulting CLM simulation with irrigation produces ET that matches the magnitude and seasonality of observed satellite ET well, with a mean difference of 6.3 mm month(-1) and a correlation of 0.95. Differences between the new CLM ET values and satellite-observed ET values are always less than 30 mm month(-1) and the differences show no pattern with respect to seasonality. The results reinforce the importance of accurately parameterizing anthropogenic hydrologic fluxes into land surface and climate models to assess environmental change under current and future climates and land management regimes.

Sensitivity analysis of polarimetric O-2 A-band spectra for potential cloud retrievals using OCO-2/GOSAT measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SOLAR-RADIATION MEASUREMENTS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; EFFECTIVE PARTICLE RADIUS; TOP HEIGHT; MICROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; BACKSCATTERED RADIANCES; OPTICAL-THICKNESS; WATER CLOUDS; OXYGEN; SCATTERING	Clouds play a crucial role in Earth's radiative budget, yet their climate feedbacks are poorly understood. The advent of space-borne high resolution spectrometers probing the O-2 A band, like GOSAT and OCO-2, could make it possible to simultaneously retrieve vertically resolved cloud parameters that play a vital role in Earth's radiative budget, thereby allowing a reduction of the corresponding uncertainty due to clouds. Such retrievals would also facilitate air mass bias reduction in corresponding measurements of CO2 columns. In this work, the hyperspectral, polarimetric response of the O-2 A band to mainly three important cloud parameters, viz., optical thickness, top height and droplet size has been studied, revealing a different sensitivity to each for the varying atmospheric absorption strength within the A band. Cloud optical thickness finds greatest sensitivity in intensity measurements, the sensitivity of other Stokes parameters being limited to low cloud optical thicknesses. Cloud height had a negligible effect on intensity measurements at non-absorbing wavelengths but finds maximum sensitivity at an intermediate absorption strength, which increases with cloud height. The same is found to hold for cloud geometric thickness. The geometry-dependent sensitivity to droplet size is maximum at non-absorbing wavelengths and diminishes with increasing absorption strength. It has been shown that significantly more information on droplet size can be drawn from multi-angle measurements. We find that, in the absence of sunglint, the backscatter hemisphere (scattering angle larger than 90 degrees) is richer in information on droplet size, especially in the glory and rainbow regions. It has been shown that I and Q generally have differing sensitivities to all cloud parameters. Thus, accurate measurements of two orthogonal components I-P and I-S (as in GOSAT) are expected to contain more information than measurements of only I, I-h or I-v (as in the case of OCO-2).

The feasibility of water vapor sounding of the cloudy boundary layer using a differential absorption radar technique	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MARINE STRATOCUMULUS; OCEAN; SIMULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; TRANSITION; PRESSURE; SYSTEMS; MODEL; LIDAR	The feasibility of differential absorption radar (DAR) for the spaceborne remote profiling of water vapor within the cloudy boundary layer is assessed by applying a radar instrument simulator to large eddy simulations (LES). Frequencies near the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line attenuate too strongly to penetrate the large vapor concentrations that are ubiquitous in the boundary layer. However it is shown that lower frequencies between 140 and 170 GHz in the water vapor absorption continuum and on the wings of the absorption line, which are attenuated less efficiently than those near the line center, still have sufficient spectral variation of gaseous attenuation to perform sounding. The high resolution LES allow for assessment of the potential uncertainty in the method due to natural variability in thermodynamic and dynamic variables on scales smaller than the instrument field of view. The (160, 170) GHz frequency pair is suggested to best maximize signal for vapor profiling while minimizing noise due to undesired spectral variation in the target extinction properties. Precision in the derived water vapor is quantified as a function of the range resolution and the instrument precision. Assuming an observational spatial scale of 500m vertical and 750 m full width at half maximum (FWHM) horizontal, measurement precision better that 1 gm(-3) is achievable for stratocumulus scenes and 3 gm(-3) for cumulus scenes given precision in radar reflectivity of 0.16 dBZ. Expected precision in the column water vapor (CWV) is achievable between 0.5 and 2 kgm(-2) on these same spatial scales. Sampling efficiency is quantified as a function of radar sensitivity. Mean biases in CWV due to natural variability in the target extinction properties do not exceed 0.25 kg m(-2). Potential biases due to uncertainty in the temperature and pressure profile are negligible relative to those resulting from natural variability. Assuming a -35 dBZ minimum detectable signal, 40 %(21.9 %) of stratocumulus( cumulus) atmospheric boundary layer range bins would be sampled. Simulated surface reflectivities are always greater than -5 dBZ, which implies the DAR technique could provide near spatially continuous observation of the CWV in subtropical boundary layers at a spatial resolution better than 1 km.

Theoretical study of the OH-initiated atmospheric oxidation mechanism of perfluoro methyl vinyl ether, CF3OCF=CF2	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							CF3O RADICALS; RATE CONSTANTS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; KINETICS; FATE; DECOMPOSITION; CHEMISTRY; CF3CF=CF2; WATER; THERMOCHEMISTRY	Product formation in the reaction of perfluorinated methyE vinyE ether, CF3OCF=CF2, with OH radicals is studied theoretically using the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T) Eevek of theory. The stable end-products in an oxidative atmosphere are predicted to be perfluorinated methyE formate, CF3OCFO, and fluorinated glycolaldehyde, CFOCF2OH, both with CF2O as coproduct. The prediction of glycolaldehyde as a product contrasts with experimental data, which found perfluoro glyoxal, CFOCFO, instead. The most likely explanation for this apparent disagreement is conversion of CFOCF2OH to CFOCFO, e.g. by multiple catalytic agents present in the reaction mixture, wall reactions, and/or photolysis. The formation routes for the glyoxal product proposed in eater work appear unlikely, and are not supported by theoretical or related experimental work.	[Vereecken, L.; Crowley, J.

Cation-pi interactions: computational analyses of the aromatic box motif and the fluorination strategy for experimental evaluation	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; VAN-DER-WAALS; NONCOVALENT INTERACTIONS; HISTONE H3K4ME3; AMINO-ACIDS; BINDING; RECOGNITION; CHROMODOMAIN; BENZENE; ION	Cation-pi interactions are common in biological systems, and many structural studies have revealed the aromatic box as a common motif. With the aim of understanding the nature of the aromatic box, several computational methods were evaluated for their ability to reproduce experimental cation-pi binding energies. We find the DFT method M06 with the 6-31G(d, p) basis set performs best of several methods tested. The binding of benzene to a number of different cations (sodium, potassium, ammonium, tetramethylammonium, and guanidinium) was studied. In addition, the binding of the organic cations NH4+ and NMe4+ to ab initio generated aromatic boxes as well as examples of aromatic boxes from protein crystal structures were investigated. These data, along with a study of the distance dependence of the cation-p interaction, indicate that multiple aromatic residues can meaningfully contribute to cation binding, even with displacements of more than an angstrom from the optimal cation-pi interaction. Progressive fluorination of benzene and indole was studied as well, and binding energies obtained were used to reaffirm the validity of the "fluorination strategy'' to study cation-pi interactions in vivo.

The effect of light rare earth element substitution in Yb14MnSb11 on thermoelectric properties	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; HIGH FIGURE; SEEBECK COEFFICIENT; ZINTL COMPOUNDS; PERFORMANCE; MERIT; SEMICONDUCTOR; EFFICIENCY; PHASES; ZT	After the discovery of Yb14MnSb11 as an outstanding p-type thermoelectric material for high temperatures (>= 900 K), site substitution of other elements has been proven to be an effective method to further optimize the thermoelectric properties. Yb14-xRExMnSb11 (RE = Pr and Sm, 0 < x < 0.55) compounds were prepared by powder metallurgy to study their thermoelectric properties. According to powder X-ray diffraction, these samples are iso-structural with Yb14MnSb11 and when more than 5% RE is used in the synthesis the presence of (Yb,RE)(4)Sb-3 is apparent after synthesis. After consolidation and measurement, (Yb, RE)Sb and (Yb,RE)(11)Sb-10 appear in the powder X-ray diffraction patterns. Electron microprobe analysis results show that consolidated pellets have small (Yb, RE) Sb domains and that the maximum amount of RE in Yb14-xRExMnSb11 is x = 0.55, however, (Yb,RE)(11)Sb-10 cannot be distinguished by electron microprobe analysis. By replacing Yb2+ with RE3+, one extra electron is introduced into Yb14MnSb11 and the carrier concentration is adjusted. Thermoelectric performance from room temperature to 1275 K was evaluated through transport and thermal conductivity measurements. The measurement shows that Seebeck coefficients initially increase and then remain stable and that electrical resistivity increases with substitutions. Thermal conductivity is slightly reduced. Substitution of Pr and Sm leads to enhanced zT. Yb13.82Pr0.18Mn1.01Sb10.9(has the best maximum zT value of similar to 1.2 at 1275 K, while Yb13.80Sm0.19Mn1.00Sb11.02 has its maximum zT of similar to 1.0 at 1275 K, respectively, similar to 45% and similar to 30% higher than Yb14MnSb11 prepared in the same manner.

A theory for the phase behavior of mixtures of active particles	SOFT MATTER			English	Article							BROWNIAN PARTICLES; SEPARATION; MOTION; HYDRODYNAMICS; PRESSURE; MATTER; DISKS	Systems at equilibrium like molecular or colloidal suspensions have a well-defined thermal energy kBT that quantifies the particles' kinetic energy and gauges how "hot" or "cold" the system is. For systems far from equilibrium, such as active matter, it is unclear whether the concept of a "temperature" exists and whether self-propelled entities are capable of thermally equilibrating like passive Brownian suspensions. Here we develop a simple mechanical theory to study the phase behavior and "temperature" of a mixture of self-propelled particles. A mixture of active swimmers and passive Brownian particles is an ideal system for discovery of the temperature of active matter and the quantities that get shared upon particle collisions. We derive an explicit equation of state for the active/passive mixture to compute a phase diagram and to generalize thermodynamic concepts like the chemical potential and free energy for a mixture of nonequilibrium species. We find that different stability criteria predict in general different phase boundaries, facilitating considerations in simulations and experiments about which ensemble of variables are held fixed and varied.

Here, we further investigate whether the current atmospheric models can quantitatively capture the characteristics of precipitation from the observation. The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) model is used to examine the historic simulation of the precipitation, in which the historic greenhouse gases and aerosols are included in the radiative forcing. The consistency between the historic GISS simulation and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation suggests that the model can qualitatively capture the temporal trends of precipitation over the wet and dry areas. However, the precipitation trends are weaker in the model than in the observation. The observed trends of precipitation do not appear in the control simulation with the fixed concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, which suggests that the global warming due to anthropogenic forcing can influence the temporal variations of precipitation over the wet and dry areas. Diagnostic studies of other variables from the model further suggest that enhanced rising air can increase the precipitation over the wet area.

Thus, they provide an experimental basis for revealing ancient solar activities represented by solar-wind implants in natural samples. We measured the first depth profile of He-4 in a Genesis collector; the shallow implantation (peaking at <20 nm) required us to use sputtered neutral mass spectrometry with post-photoionization by a strong field. The solar wind He fluence calculated using depth profiling is similar to 8.5 x 10(14) cm(-2). The shape of the solar wind He-4 depth profile is consistent with TRIM simulations using the observed He-4 velocity distribution during the Genesis mission. It is therefore likely that all solar-wind elements heavier than H are completely intact in this Genesis collector and, consequently, the solar particle energy distributions for each element can be calculated from their depth profiles. Ancient solar activities and space weathering of solar system objects could be quantitatively reproduced by solar particle implantation profiles.

In this study, we used molecular dynamics to examine the interaction of gallium corroles with Hsp90, and found that they can bind preferentially to the ATP-binding N-terminal site. We also found that structural variations of the corrole ring can influence the binding energies and affinities of the corrole to Hsp90. We predict that both the bis-carboxylated corrole (4-Ga) and a proposed 3,17-bis-sulfonated corrole (7-Ga) are promising alternatives to Ga(III) 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)-2,17-bis(sulfonic acid)-corrole (1-Ga) as anti-cancer agents.

Variability in Antarctic ozone loss in the last decade (2004-2013): high-resolution simulations compared to Aura MLS observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							POLAR VORTEX; WINTER; MODEL; HOLE; SCIAMACHY; KINETICS; EDGE; CLO	A detailed analysis of the polar ozone loss processes during 10 recent Antarctic winters is presented with high-resolution MIMOSA-CHIM (ModSle Isentrope du transport M,so-,chelle de l'Ozone Stratosph,rique par Advection avec CHIMie) model simulations and high-frequency polar vortex observations from the Aura microwave limb sounder (MLS) instrument. The high-frequency measurements and simulations help to characterize the winters and assist the interpretation of interannual variability better than either data or simulations alone. Our model results for the Antarctic winters of 2004-2013 show that chemical ozone loss starts in the edge region of the vortex at equivalent latitudes (EqLs) of 65-67A degrees S in mid-June-July. The loss progresses with time at higher EqLs and intensifies during August-September over the range 400-600 K. The loss peaks in late September-early October, when all EqLs (65-83A degrees S) show a similar loss and the maximum loss (> 2 ppmv - parts per million by volume) is found over a broad vertical range of 475-550 K. In the lower stratosphere, most winters show similar ozone loss and production rates. In general, at 500 K, the loss rates are about 2-3 ppbv sh(-1) (parts per billion by volume per sunlit hour) in July and 4-5 ppbv sh(-1) in August-mid-September, while they drop rapidly to 0 by mid-October. In the middle stratosphere, the loss rates are about 3-5 ppbv sh(-1) in July-August and October at 675 K. On average, the MIMOSA-CHIM simulations show that the very cold winters of 2005 and 2006 exhibit a maximum loss of similar to 3.5 ppmv around 550 K or about 149-173 DU over 350-850 K, and the warmer winters of 2004, 2010, and 2012 show a loss of similar to 2.6 ppmv around 475-500 K or 131-154 DU over 350-850 K. The winters of 2007, 2008, and 2011 were moderately cold, and thus both ozone loss and peak loss altitudes are between these two ranges (3 ppmv around 500 K or 150 +/- 10 DU). The modeled ozone loss values are in reasonably good agreement with those estimated from Aura MLS measurements, but the model underestimates the observed ClO, largely due to the slower vertical descent in the model during spring.

Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS): methodology and sample results with a focus on HCl, H2O, and O-3	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MICROWAVE LIMB SOUNDER; HALOGEN OCCULTATION EXPERIMENT; WATER-VAPOR; SAGE-II; TOTAL-COLUMN; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; TIME-SERIES; DATA SET; VALIDATION	We describe the publicly available data from the Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS) project and provide some results, with a focus on hydrogen chloride (HCl), water vapor (H2O), and ozone (O-3). This data set is a global long-term stratospheric Earth system data record, consisting of monthly zonal mean time series starting as early as 1979. The data records are based on high-quality measurements from several NASA satellite instruments and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on SCISAT. We examine consistency aspects between the various data sets. To merge ozone records, the time series are debiased relative to SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiments) values by calculating average offsets versus SAGE II during measurement overlap periods, whereas for other species the merging derives from an averaging procedure during overlap periods. The GOZCARDS files contain mixing ratios on a common pressure-latitude grid, as well as standard errors and other diagnostics; we also present estimates of systematic uncertainties in the merged products. Monthly mean temperatures for GOZCARDS were also produced, based directly on data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications. The GOZCARDS HCl merged product comes from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), ACE-FTS and lower-stratospheric Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data. After a rapid rise in upper-stratospheric HCl in the early 1990s, the rate of decrease in this region for 1997-2010 was between 0.4 and 0.7 % yr(-1). On 6-8-year timescales, the rate of decrease peaked in 2004-2005 at about 1 % yr(-1), and it has since levelled off, at similar to 0.5 % yr(-1). With a delay of 6-7 years, these changes roughly follow total surface chlorine, whose behavior versus time arises from inhomogeneous changes in the source gases. Since the late 1990s, HCl decreases in the lower stratosphere have occurred with pronounced latitudinal variability at rates sometimes exceeding 1-2 % yr(-1). Recent short-term tendencies of lower-stratospheric and column HCl vary substantially, with increases from 2005 to 2010 for northern midlatitudes and deep tropics, but decreases (increases) after 2011 at northern (southern) midlatitudes. For H2O, the GOZCARDS product covers both stratosphere and mesosphere, and the same instruments as for HCl are used, along with Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) MLS stratospheric H2O data (1991-1993). We display seasonal to decadal-type variability in H2O from 22 years of data. In the upper mesosphere, the anticorrelation between H2O and solar flux is now clearly visible over two full solar cycles. Lower-stratospheric tropical H2O has exhibited two periods of increasing values, followed by fairly sharp drops (the well-documented 2000-2001 decrease and a recent drop in 2011-2013). Tropical decadal variability peaks just above the tropopause. Between 1991 and 2013, both in the tropics and on a near-global basis, H2O has decreased by similar to 5-10 % in the lower stratosphere, but about a 10 % increase is observed in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. However, such tendencies may not represent longer-term trends. For ozone, we used SAGE I, SAGE II, HALOE, UARS and Aura MLS, and ACE-FTS data to produce a merged record from late 1979 onward, using SAGE II as the primary reference. Unlike the 2 to 3 % increase in near-global column ozone after the late 1990s reported by some, GOZCARDS stratospheric column O-3 values do not show a recent upturn of more than 0.5 to 1 %; long-term interannual column ozone variations from GOZCARDS are generally in very good agreement with interannual changes in merged total column ozone (Version 8.6) data from SBUV instruments. A brief mention is also made of other currently available, commonly formatted GOZCARDS satellite data records for stratospheric composition, namely those for N2O and HNO3.	[Froidevaux, L.; Fuller, R.

The impact of observing characteristics on the ability to predict ozone under varying polluted photochemical regimes	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ADJOINT SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; CHEMICAL KINETIC SYSTEMS; AIR-QUALITY; NOX EMISSIONS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; DATA ASSIMILATION; ZONAL STRUCTURE; UNITED-STATES; TROPICAL O-3	We conduct analyses to assess how characteristics of observations of ozone and its precursors affect air quality forecasting and research. To carry out this investigation, we use a photochemical box model and its adjoint integrated with a Lagrangian 4D-variational data assimilation system. Using this framework in conjunction with pseudo-observations, we perform an ozone precursor source inversion and estimate surface emissions. We then assess the resulting improvement in ozone air quality prediction. We use an analytical model to conduct uncertainty analyses. Using this analytical tool, we address some key questions regarding how the characteristics of observations affect ozone precursor emission inversion and in turn ozone prediction. These questions include what the effect is of choosing which species to observe, of varying amounts of observation noise, of changing the observing frequency and the observation time during the diurnal cycle, and of how these different scenarios interact with different photochemical regimes. In our investigation we use three observed species scenarios: CO and NO2; ozone, CO, and NO2; and HCHO, CO and NO2. The photochemical model was set up to simulate a range of summertime polluted environments spanning NOx-(NO and NO2)-limited to volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited conditions. We find that as the photochemical regime changes, here is a variation in the relative importance of trace gas observations to be able to constrain emission estimates and to improve the subsequent ozone forecasts. For example, adding ozone observations to an NO2 and CO observing system is found to decrease ozone prediction error under NOx- and VOC-limited regimes, and complementing the NO2 and CO system with HCHO observations would improve ozone prediction in the transitional regime and under VOC-limited conditions. We found that scenarios observing ozone and HCHO with a relative observing noise of lower than 33 % were able to achieve ozone prediction errors of lower than 5 ppbv (parts per billion by volume). Further, only observing intervals of 3 h or shorter were able to consistently achieve ozone prediction errors of 5 ppbv or lower across all photochemical regimes. Making observations closer to the prediction period and either in the morning or afternoon rush hour periods made greater improvements for ozone prediction: 0.2-0.3 ppbv for the morning rush hour and from 0.3 to 0.8 ppbv for the afternoon compared to only 0-0.1 ppbv for other times of the day. Finally, we made two complementary analyses that show that our conclusions are insensitive to the assumed diurnal emission cycle and to the choice of which VOC species emission to estimate using our framework. These questions will address how different types of observing platform, e.g. geostationary satellites or ground monitoring networks, could support future air quality research and forecasting.

S	Maire, M; Yu, SX; Perona, P		Cremers, D; Reid, I; Saito, H; Yang, MH		Maire, Michael; Yu, Stella X.; Perona, Pietro			Reconstructive Sparse Code Transfer for Contour Detection and Semantic Labeling	COMPUTER VISION - ACCV 2014, PT IV	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	12th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV)	NOV 01-05, 2014	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Singapore Tourism Board, Omron, Nvidia, Garena, Samsung, Adobe, ViSenze, Lee Fdn, Morpx, Microsoft Res, NICTA				We frame the task of predicting a semantic labeling as a sparse reconstruction procedure that applies a target-specific learned transfer function to a generic deep sparse code representation of an image. This strategy partitions training into two distinct stages. First, in an unsupervised manner, we learn a set of dictionaries optimized for sparse coding of image patches. These generic dictionaries minimize error with respect to representing image appearance and are independent of any particular target task. We train a multilayer representation via recursive sparse dictionary learning on pooled codes output by earlier layers. Second, we encode all training images with the generic dictionaries and learn a transfer function that optimizes reconstruction of patches extracted from annotated ground-truth given the sparse codes of their corresponding image patches. At test time, we encode a novel image using the generic dictionaries and then reconstruct using the transfer function. The output reconstruction is a semantic labeling of the test image. Applying this strategy to the task of contour detection, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art systems. Unlike almost all prior work, our approach obviates the need for any form of hand-designed features or filters. Our model is entirely learned from image and ground-truth patches, with only patch sizes, dictionary sizes and sparsity levels, and depth of the network as chosen parameters. To illustrate the general applicability of our approach, we also show initial results on the task of semantic part labeling of human faces. The effectiveness of our data-driven approach opens new avenues for research on deep sparse representations. Our classifiers utilize this representation in a novel manner. Rather than acting on nodes in the deepest layer, they attach to nodes along a slice through multiple layers of the network in order to make predictions about local patches. Our flexible combination of a generatively learned sparse representation with discriminatively trained transfer classifiers extends the notion of sparse reconstruction to encompass arbitrary semantic labeling tasks.

CONVEX OPTIMAL UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION	SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						convex optimization; uncertainty quantification; duality theory	OPTIMIZATION; INEQUALITIES; BOUNDS	Optimal uncertainty quantification (OUQ) is a framework for numerical extreme-case analysis of stochastic systems with imperfect knowledge of the underlying probability distribution. This paper presents sufficient conditions under which an OUQ problem can be reformulated as a finite-dimensional convex optimization problem, for which efficient numerical solutions can be obtained. The sufficient conditions include that the objective function is piecewise concave and the constraints are piecewise convex. In particular, we show that piecewise concave objective functions may appear in applications where the objective is defined by the optimal value of a parameterized linear program.

In these developments, sparsity is promoted through the addition of an L-1 norm (or related quantity) as a constraint or penalty in a variational principle. We apply this approach to partial differential equations that come from a variational quantity, either by minimization (to obtain an elliptic PDE) or by gradient flow (to obtain a parabolic PDE). Also, we show that some PDEs can be rewritten in an L-1 form, such as the divisible sandpile problem and signum-Gordon. Addition of an L-1 term in the variational principle leads to a modified PDE where a subgradient term appears. It is known that modified PDEs of this form will often have solutions with compact support, which corresponds to the discrete solution being sparse. We show that this is advantageous numerically through the use of efficient algorithms for solving L-1 based problems.

These basis elements are oftentimes found after a laborious process of scientific investigation and plain guesswork. Can this identification problem be facilitated? Is there a general recipe/decision framework for guiding the design of basis elements? We suggest that the answer to the above questions could be positive based on the reformulation of numerical homogenization as a Bayesian inference problem in which a given PDE with rough coefficients (or multiscale operator) is excited with noise (random right-hand side/source term) and one tries to estimate the value of the solution at a given point based on a finite number of observations. We apply this reformulation to the identification of bases for the numerical homogenization of arbitrary integro-differential equations and show that these bases have optimal recovery properties. In particular we show how rough polyharmonic splines can be rediscovered as the optimal solution of a Gaussian filtering problem.

A Match-based approach to the estimation of polar stratospheric ozone loss using Aura Microwave Limb Sounder observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS; ARCTIC WINTER; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; NITRIC-ACID; MLS OBSERVATIONS; UARS DATA; EOS MLS; DEPLETION; VORTEX; TRANSPORT	The well-established "Match" approach to quantifying chemical destruction of ozone in the polar lower stratosphere is applied to ozone observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on NASA's Aura spacecraft. Quantification of ozone loss requires distinguishing transport-and chemically induced changes in ozone abundance. This is accomplished in the Match approach by examining cases where trajectories indicate that the same air mass has been observed on multiple occasions. The method was pioneered using ozonesonde observations, for which hundreds of matched ozone observations per winter are typically available. The dense coverage of the MLS measurements, particularly at polar latitudes, allows matches to be made to thousands of observations each day. This study is enabled by recently developed MLS Lagrangian trajectory diagnostic (LTD) support products. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest influence on the ozone loss estimates are the value of potential vorticity (PV) used to define the edge of the polar vortex (within which matched observations must lie) and the degree to which the PV of an air mass is allowed to vary between matched observations. Applying Match calculations to MLS observations of nitrous oxide, a long-lived tracer whose expected rate of change is negligible on the weekly to monthly timescales considered here, enables quantification of the impact of transport errors on the Match-based ozone loss estimates. Our loss estimates are generally in agreement with previous estimates for selected Arctic winters, though indicating smaller losses than many other studies. Arctic ozone losses are greatest during the 2010/11 winter, as seen in prior studies, with 2.0 ppmv (parts per million by volume) loss estimated at 450 K potential temperature (similar to 18 km altitude). As expected, Antarctic winter ozone losses are consistently greater than those for the Arctic, with less interannual variability (e.g., ranging between 2.3 and 3.0 ppmv at 450 K). This study exemplifies the insights into atmospheric processes that can be obtained by applying the Match methodology to a densely sampled observation record such as that from Aura MLS.	[Livesey, N.

Measurements of stellar metallicity ([Fe/H]) typically require a spectrum, but spectroscopic surveys are limited to a fewx 10(6) targets; photometric surveys, on the other hand, have detected > 10(9) stars. I present a new machinelearning method to predict [Fe/H] from photometric colors measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The training set consists of,--,120,000 stars with SDSS photometry and reliable [Fe/H] measurements from the SEGUE Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). For bright stars (g' <= 18 mag), with 4500 K <= T-eff <= 7000 K, corresponding to those with the most reliable SSPP estimates, I find that the model predicts [Fe/H] values with a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of r similar to 0.27 dex. The RMSE from this machine-learning method is similar to the scatter in [Fe/H] measurements from low-resolution spectra.

The measured impedance spectra are found to be described well by an electrochemical model based on a generalized transmission model for a mixed conducting oxide, and all trends are consistent with a reaction pathway involving oxygen reduction over the LSM surface followed by diffusion through the film and into the electrolyte substrate. The surface activity is found to be correlated with the number of exposed grain boundary sites, which decreases with either increasing film thickness (at constant growth temperature) or increasing film growth temperature (at constant thickness). These findings suggest that exposed grain boundaries in LSM films are more active than exposed grains towards the rate-limiting surface process, and that oxygen ion diffusion through polycrystalline LSM films is faster than many prior studies have concluded.

Hydrogen bonding in the ethanol-water dimer	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SPECTRA	We report the first rotational spectrum of the ground state of the isolated ethanol-water dimer using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy between 8-18 GHz. With the aid of isotopic substitutions, and ab initio calculations, we identify the measured conformer as a water-donor/ethanol-acceptor structure. Ethanol is found to be in the gauche conformation, while the monomer distances and orientations likely reflect a cooperation between the strong (O-H center dot center dot center dot O) and weak (C-H center dot center dot center dot O) hydrogen bonds that stabilizes the measured conformer. No other conformers were assigned in an argon expansion, confirming that this is the ground-state structure. This result is consistent with previous vibrationally-resolved Raman and infrared work, but sheds additional light on the structure, due to the specificity of rotational spectroscopy.

The complexes display two bands in the visible region near 410-420 and 440-450 nm. The complexes are diamagnetic and show well defined H-1 NMR lines. They are electroactive in acetonitrile solution and exhibit a well defined Ru-II/Ru-III couple near 1.20 to 1.30 V and -1.40 to -1.50 V due to ligand reduction versus Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE). The solutions are also luminescent, with peaks are near 600 nm. All the complexes are electroluminescent in nature with peaks lying near 580 nm. L-1 and L-3 ligated complexes with two bpy co-ligands show weak photoluminescence (PL) but stronger electroluminescence (EL) compared to corresponding L-2 ligated analogues.

ESQUIREITE, BaSi6O13 center dot 7H(2)O, A NEW LAYER SILICATE FROM THE BARIUM SILICATE DEPOSITS OF CALIFORNIA	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						esquireite; new mineral; layer silicate; crystal structure; electron microprobe analysis; Big Creek - Rush Creek; Fresno County; California; USA; Trumbull Peak; Mariposa County; California; USA	EASTERN FRESNO COUNTY; BOND-VALENCE PARAMETERS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MARIPOSA COUNTY; MINERALS; ANALOG	Esquireite, BaSi6O13 center dot 7H(2)O, is a new mineral from the Esquire #1 claim along Rush Creek, eastern Fresno County, California, USA, and a Ba-silicate lens on the NW slope of Trumbull Peak, Mariposa County, California, USA. Esquireite is a low-temperature hydrothermal alteration product of sanbornite and is found on surfaces of sanbornite. The mineral occurs as colorless rectangular blades, elongated and striated parallel to [010] and flattened on {001}. The streak is white, the luster is vitreous to pearly, and the crystals are transparent. The Mohs hardness is about 2. The tenacity is somewhat flexible, but not elastic, with brittle failure. The fracture is irregular and there are two cleavages: perfect on {001} and fair on {100}. The measured and calculated densities are 2.18(2) g/cm(3) and 2.237 g/cm3, respectively. Esquireite is biaxial (+), with a 1.477(1), beta 1.481(1), gamma 1.492 (calc.) (white light); 2V(meas) = 63.8(6)degrees; no dispersion or pleochroism; optical orientation: Y = b; Z boolean AND c approximate to 22 degrees in obtuse beta. Six electron-microprobe analyses gave the following empirical formula, based on 20 O apfu: Ba0.95Si6.00O20H14.10. Esquireite is monoclinic, space group C2, with cell parameters a 13.601(4), b 4.9222(10), c 15.092(5) angstrom, beta 111.578(19)degrees, V 939.6(4) angstrom(3), and Z = 2. The eight strongest lines in the X-ray powder diffraction patterns are [d(obs) angstrom(I) (hkl)]: 7.02(38)(002), 5.11(33)(201), 4.649(66)(003, (2) over bar 03), 4.191(100)(111), 3.339(65)((4) over bar 02, (3) over bar 11, (3) over bar 12), 2.967(32)((2) over bar 05, (1) over bar 14,311), 2.343(33)(multiple), and 2.261(35)(multiple). The crystal structure (R-1 = 10.8% for 323 reflections with F-o > 4 sigma F) contains four-tetrahedra-thick [Si6O13](2-) silicate layers with Ba(H2O)(8)(2+) polyhedra between the layers.

All known building layers are dense layers in that they do not contain 8-membered ring (MR) or larger pores perpendicular to the two-dimensional layers. Herein, we report a new material (CIT-10) that consists of a two-dimensional layer (termed "rth" layer) that contains an 8 MR perpendicular to the layer. Calcination of CIT-10 forms pure-silica RTH (SSZ-50). CIT-10 can be pillared to form a new framework material with a three-dimensional pore system of 8 and 10 MRs, denoted CIT-11, that can be calcined to form a new microporous material, denoted CIT-12.

Performance assessment of a triple-frequency spaceborne cloud-precipitation radar concept using a global cloud-resolving model	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; PROFILING RADAR; PART II; ICE; DISTRIBUTIONS; CAPABILITIES; SIGNATURES; AGGREGATE; MISSION; NICAM	Multi-frequency radars offer enhanced detection of clouds and precipitation compared to single-frequency systems, and are able to make more accurate retrievals when several frequencies are available simultaneously. An evaluation of a spaceborne three-frequency Ku-/Ka-/W-band radar system is presented in this study, based on modeling radar reflectivities from the results of a global cloud-resolving model with a 875m grid spacing. To produce the reflectivities, a scattering model has been developed for each of the hydrometeor types produced by the model, as well as for melting snow. The effects of attenuation and multiple scattering on the radar signal are modeled using a radiative transfer model, while nonuniform beam filling is reproduced with spatial averaging. The combined effects of these are then quantified both globally and in six localized case studies. Two different orbital scenarios using the same radar are compared. Overall, based on the results, it is expected that the proposed radar would detect a high-quality signal in most clouds and precipitation. The main exceptions are the thinnest clouds that are below the detection threshold of the W-band channel, and at the opposite end of the scale, heavy convective rainfall where a combination of attenuation, multiple scattering and nonuniform beam filling commonly cause significant deterioration of the signal; thus, while the latter can be generally detected, the quality of the retrievals is likely to be degraded.

Multi-generational oxidation model to simulate secondary organic aerosol in a 3-D air quality model	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							VOLATILITY BASIS-SET; MASTER CHEMICAL MECHANISM; MCM V3 PART; TROPOSPHERIC DEGRADATION; NOX PHOTOOXIDATION; PHASE CHEMISTRY; EXPLICIT MODEL; SOA FORMATION; N-ALKANES; GAS	Multi-generational gas-phase oxidation of organic vapors can influence the abundance, composition and properties of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Only recently have SOA models been developed that explicitly represent multi-generational SOA formation. In this work, we integrated the statistical oxidation model (SOM) into SAPRC-11 to simulate the multi-generational oxidation and gas/particle partitioning of SOA in the regional UCD/CIT (University of California, Davis/California Institute of Technology) air quality model. In the SOM, evolution of organic vapors by reaction with the hydroxyl radical is defined by (1) the number of oxygen atoms added per reaction, (2) the decrease in volatility upon addition of an oxygen atom and (3) the probability that a given reaction leads to fragmentation of the organic molecule. These SOM parameter values were fit to laboratory smog chamber data for each precursor/compound class. SOM was installed in the UCD/CIT model, which simulated air quality over 2-week periods in the South Coast Air Basin of California and the eastern United States. For the regions and episodes tested, the two-product SOA model and SOM produce similar SOA concentrations but a modestly different SOA chemical composition. Predictions of the oxygen-to-carbon ratio qualitatively agree with those measured globally using aerosol mass spectrometers. Overall, the implementation of the SOM in a 3-D model provides a comprehensive framework to simulate the atmospheric evolution of organic aerosol.	[Jathar, S. H.; Cappa, C. D.; Wexler, A.

AN L-1 PENALTY METHOD FOR GENERAL OBSTACLE PROBLEMS	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						elliptic obstacles; two-phase membrane; Hele-Shaw; nonlinear elliptic equations; free boundary; exact penalty; L-1 optimization	MULTIPLICATIVE SCHWARZ METHOD; INEQUALITY APPROACH; CONVERGENCE RATE; ALGORITHMS	We construct an efficient numerical scheme for solving obstacle problems in divergence form. The numerical method is based on a reformulation of the obstacle in terms of an L-1-like penalty on the variational problem. The reformulation is an exact regularizer in the sense that for a large (but finite) penalty parameter, we recover the exact solution. Our formulation is applied to classical elliptic obstacle problems as well as some related free boundary problems, for example, the two-phase membrane problem and the Hele-Shaw model. One advantage of the proposed method is that the free boundary inherent in the obstacle problem arises naturally in our energy minimization without any need for problem specific or complicated discretization. In addition, our scheme also works for nonlinear variational inequalities arising from convex minimization problems.

Testing and analysis results by using the developed technique for dynamic surface conditions are presented.

We use a Weyl conformal factor to perturb the standard volume form and obtain the Laplacian that encodes the local geometric information. We use Connes' pseudodifferential calculus to explicitly compute the terms in the small time heat kernel expansion of the perturbed Laplacian which correspond to the volume and scalar curvature of T-theta(4). We establish the analogue of Weyl's law, define a noncommutative residue, prove the analogue of Connes' trace theorem, and find explicit formulas for the local functions that describe the scalar curvature of T. We also study the analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action for these spaces and show that metrics with constant scalar curvature are critical for this action.

Ionospheric electron density in the E region, and hence ionospheric conductivity, is significantly altered by precipitating particles from the magnetosphere. This has global impacts on the thermosphere-ionosphere because of the important role of conductivity on high-latitude Joule heating. Two high-speed stream (HSS) and two coronal mass ejection (CME) storms are examined with the COSMIC data. We find clear correlation between geomagnetic activity and electron density retrievals from COSMIC. At nighttime local times, the number of profiles with maximum electron densities in the E layer (below 200 km altitude) is well correlated with geomagnetic activity. We interpret this to mean that electron density increases due to precipitation are captured by the COSMIC profiles. These "E-layer-dominant ionosphere" (ELDI) profiles have geomagnetic latitudes that are consistent with climatological models of the auroral location. For the two HSS storms that occurred in May of 2011 and 2012, a strong hemispheric asymmetry is observed, with nearly all the ELDI profiles found in the Southern, less sunlit, Hemisphere. Stronger aurora and precipitation have been observed before in winter hemispheres, but the degree of asymmetry deserves further study. For the two CME storms, occurring in July and November of 2012, large increases in the number of ELDI profiles are found starting in the storm's main phase but continuing for several days into the recovery phase. Analysis of the COSMIC profiles was extended to all local times for the July 2012 CME storm by relaxing the ELDI criterion and instead visually inspecting all profiles above 50 degrees magnetic latitude for signatures of precipitation in the E region. For 9 days during the July 2012 period, we find a signature of precipitation occurs nearly uniformly in local time, although the magnitude of electron density increase may vary with local time. The latitudinal extent of the precipitation layers is generally consistent with auroral climatology. However, after the storm main phase on 14 July 2012 the precipitation tended to be somewhat more equatorward than the climatology (by about 5-10 degrees latitude) and equatorward of the auroral boundary data acquired from the SSUSI sensor onboard the F18 DMSP satellite. We conclude that, if analyzed appropriately, high-latitude COSMIC profiles have the potential to contribute to our understanding of MI coupling processes and extend and improve existing models of the auroral region.

GRACE storage-runoff hystereses reveal the dynamics of regional watersheds	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; SOIL-MOISTURE; MOUNTAIN HYDROLOGY; DATA ASSIMILATION; EL-NINO; SNOWPACK; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY	We characterize how regional watersheds function as simple, dynamic systems through a series of hysteresis loops using measurements from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. These loops illustrate the temporal relationship between runoff and terrestrial water storage in three regional-scale watersheds (> 150 000 km(2)) of the Columbia River Basin, USA and Canada. The shape and size of the hysteresis loops are controlled by the climate, topography, and geology of the watershed. The direction of the hystereses for the GRACE signals moves in opposite directions from the isolated groundwater hystereses. The subsurface water (soil moisture and groundwater) hystereses more closely resemble the storage-runoff relationship of a soil matrix. While the physical processes underlying these hystereses are inherently complex, the vertical integration of terrestrial water in the GRACE signal encapsulates the processes that govern the non-linear function of regional-scale watersheds. We use this process-based understanding to test how GRACE data can be applied prognostically to predict seasonal runoff (mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.91) and monthly runoff during the low flow/high demand month of August (mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.77) in all three watersheds. The global nature of GRACE data allows this same methodology to be applied in other regional-scale studies, and could be particularly useful in regions with minimal data and in trans-boundary watersheds.

Differential toxicity of gold-doxorubicin in cancer cells vs. cardiomyocytes as measured by real-time growth assays and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)	ANALYST			English	Article							INDUCED CARDIOTOXICITY; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RESPONSE CURVES; MELANOMA-CELLS; BREAST-CANCER; NANOPARTICLES; RELEASE; STIMULATION	The kinetics of toxicity of doxorubicin (Dox) and gold nanoparticle-conjugated doxorubicin (Au-Dox) were investigated in cultured B16 melanoma cells and cardiomyocytes using real-time cell-growth imaging. Both bolus exposure and continuous exposure were used. Modeling of the growth curve dynamics suggested patterns of uptake and/or expulsion of the drug that were different for the different cell lines and exposures. Dox alone in B16 cells fit to a model of slow drug buildup, whereas Au-Dox fit to a pattern of initial high drug efficacy followed by a decrease. In cardiomyocytes, the best fit was to a model of increasing drug concentration which then began to decrease, consistent with breakdown of the doxorubicin in solution. Cardiomyocytes were more sensitive than B16 cells to Dox alone (IC50 123 +/- 2 nM vs. 270 +/- 2 nM with continuous exposure), but were dramatically less sensitive to Au-Dox (IC50 1 +/- 0.1 mu M vs. 58 +/- 5 nM with continuous exposure). Bolus exposure for 40 min led to significant cell death in B16 cells but not in cardiomyocytes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) showed different patterns of uptake of Au-Dox in the two cell types that explained the differential toxicity. While Au-Dox concentrated in the nuclei of B16 cells, it remained endosomal in cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that stable conjugates of nanoparticles to doxorubicin may be useful for treating resistant cancers while sparing healthy tissue.

Theoretical Microrheology	COMPLEX FLUIDS IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS: EXPERIMENT, THEORY, AND COMPUTATION	Biological and Medical Physics Biomedical Engineering		English	Article; Book Chapter							PARTICLE-TRACKING MICRORHEOLOGY; BROWNIAN-MOTION; HARD-SPHERE; COLLOIDAL DISPERSIONS; VISCOELASTIC MODULI; LOCAL MEASUREMENTS; ELASTIC-LIKE; IN-VIVO; DIFFUSION; RHEOLOGY	The importance of microrheology in the study of biological systems has a long and rich history, tracing its roots to the work of the botanist Robert Brown in the early nineteenth century. Indeed, passive microrheology and Brownian motion are one and the same. Brown's observation of microscopic pollen grains dancing about in water was initially thought to reveal some sort of "fundamental life force." However, upon further investigation, it turned out the motion depended only on the microscopically small size of the particles. The mysterious phenomenon went unexplained until the turn of the next century when Einstein and Perrin utilized Brownian motion to prove the atomic nature of matter. In addition to this profound result, the foundation of modern-day passive microrheology had been laid. Einstein combined the theory of diffusion with the Stokes' solutions for creeping flow to yield the Stokes Einstein relation connecting observable particle motion diffusion to material properties: the viscosity. Perrin's experiments confirmed the theory. But Einstein's arguments and the Stokes Einstein relation rely on the existence of equilibrium and other narrow criteria. New approaches have extended the idea of tracking the motion of a Brownian particle to understand material properties far beyond this limited model. These advancements are critical to the study of many biological systems which conduct much of their function in a nonequilibrium condition. In this chapter we will see how one can study biological systems from a rheological perspective, showing the unique role played by microrheology in understanding such systems. In a sense, Brown's initial hypothesis was not too far off the mark: rather than being driven by life, Brownian motion plays the role of the invisible hand that drives many of the processes required for life to proceed and indeed may have played a role in the very origin of the life process.

This contributes to the balance in solar radiation reaching the sea surface in the northern and southern hemispheres. In the current study, we focus on the tropical Atlantic (30 degrees N-30 degrees S), which is characterized by significant amounts of Saharan dust dominating other aerosol species over the North Atlantic. Our main point is that, over the tropical Atlantic, Saharan dust not only is responsible for the pronounced hemispheric aerosol asymmetry, but also contributes to significant cloud cover along the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). Over the tropical Atlantic in July, along the SAL, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer CF data showed significant cloud cover (up to 0.8-0.9). This significant CF along SAL together with clouds over the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone contributes to the 20% hemispheric CF asymmetry. This leads to the imbalance in strong solar radiation, which reaches the sea surface between the tropical North and South Atlantic, and, consequently, affects climate formation in the tropical Atlantic. During the 10-year study period (July 2002-June 2012), NASA Aerosol Reanalysis (aka MERRAero) showed that, when the hemispheric asymmetry in dust aerosol optical thickness (AOT) was most pronounced (particularly in July), dust AOT averaged separately over the tropical North Atlantic was one order of magnitude higher than that averaged over the tropical South Atlantic. In the presence of such strong hemispheric asymmetry in dust AOT in July, CF averaged separately over the tropical North Atlantic exceeded that over the tropical South Atlantic by 20%. Both Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer measurements and MERRAero data were in agreement on seasonal variations in hemispheric aerosol asymmetry. Hemispheric asymmetry in total AOT over the Atlantic was most pronounced between March and July, when dust presence over the North Atlantic was maximal. In September and October, there was no noticeable hemispheric aerosol asymmetry between the tropical North and South Atlantic. During the season with no noticeable hemispheric aerosol asymmetry, we found no noticeable asymmetry in cloud cover.

The swim force as a body force	SOFT MATTER			English	Article							ACTIVE BROWNIAN PARTICLES; PHASE-SEPARATION; MOTION; STRESS; FIELD	Net (as opposed to random) motion of active matter results from an average swim (or propulsive) force. It is shown that the average swim force acts like a body force - an internal body force. As a result, the particle-pressure exerted on a container wall is the sum of the swim pressure [Takatori et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 113, 028103] and the 'weight' of the active particles. A continuum description is possible when variations occur on scales larger than the run length of the active particles and gives a Boltzmann-like distribution from a balance of the swim force and the swim pressure. Active particles may also display 'action at a distance' and accumulate adjacent to (or be depleted from) a boundary without any external forces. In the momentum balance for the suspension - the mixture of active particles plus fluid - only external body forces appear.

Investigating the usefulness of satellite-derived fluorescence data in inferring gross primary productivity within the carbon cycle data assimilation system	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; EDDY COVARIANCE TECHNIQUE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; CO2 ASSIMILATION; BIOSPHERE MODELS; C-3 PLANTS; SPACE; NITROGEN; LEAVES	Simulations of carbon fluxes with terrestrial biosphere models still exhibit significant uncertainties, in part due to the uncertainty in model parameter values. With the advent of satellite measurements of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), there exists a novel pathway for constraining simulated carbon fluxes and parameter values. We investigate the utility of SIF in constraining gross primary productivity (GPP). As a first test we assess whether SIF simulations are sensitive to important parameters in a biosphere model. SIF measurements at the wavelength of 755 nm are simulated by the Carbon-Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) which has been augmented by the fluorescence component of the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. Idealized sensitivity tests of the SCOPE model stand-alone indicate strong sensitivity of GPP to the carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) and of SIF to the chlorophyll AB content (C-ab) and incoming short wave radiation. Low sensitivity is found for SIF to V-cmax, however the relationship is subtle, with increased sensitivity under high radiation conditions and lower V-cmax ranges. CCDAS simulates well the patterns of satellite-measured SIF suggesting the combined model is capable of ingesting the data. CCDAS supports the idealized sensitivity tests of SCOPE, with SIF exhibiting sensitivity to C-ab and incoming radiation, both of which are treated as perfectly known in previous CCDAS versions. These results demonstrate the need for careful consideration of C-ab and incoming radiation when interpreting SIF and the limitations of utilizing SIF to constrain V-cmax in the present set-up in the CCDAS system.

Mechanisms and energetics of free radical initiated disulfide bond cleavage in model peptides and insulin by mass spectrometry	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER DISSOCIATION; TOP-DOWN CHARACTERIZATION; CAPTURE DISSOCIATION; DENSITY FUNCTIONALS; ULTRAVIOLET PHOTODISSOCIATION; THERMOCHEMICAL KINETICS; METAL-COMPLEXES; NONCOVALENT INTERACTIONS; DETACHMENT DISSOCIATION; SEQUENCING FRIPS	We investigate the mechanism of disulfide bond cleavage in gaseous peptide and protein ions initiated by a covalently-attached regiospecific acetyl radical using mass spectrometry (MS). Highly selective S-S bond cleavages with some minor C-S bond cleavages are observed by a single step of collisional activation. We show that even multiple disulfide bonds in intact bovine insulin are fragmented in the MS2 stage, releasing the A-and B-chains with a high yield, which has been challenging to achieve by other ion activation methods. Yet, regardless of the previous reaction mechanism studies, it has remained unclear why (1) disulfide bond cleavage is preferred to peptide backbone fragmentation, and why (2) the S-S bond that requires the higher activation energy conjectured in previously suggested mechanisms is more prone to be cleaved than the C-S bond by hydrogen-deficient radicals. To probe the mechanism of these processes, model peptides possessing deuterated beta-carbon(s) at the disulfide bond are employed. It is suggested that the favored pathway of S-S bond cleavage is triggered by direct acetyl radical attack at sulfur with concomitant cleavage of the S-S bond (S(H)2). The activation energy for this process is substantially lower by similar to 9-10 kcal mol(-1) than those of peptide backbone cleavage processes determined by density functional quantum chemical calculations. Minor reaction pathways are initiated by hydrogen abstraction from the alpha-carbon or the beta-carbon of a disulfide, followed by beta-cleavages yielding C-S or S-S bond scissions. The current mechanistic findings should be generally applicable to other radical-driven disulfide bond cleavages with different radical species such as the benzyl and methyl pyridyl radicals.

Stereoselective synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via a dual olefin metathesis and ethenolysis approach	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							RING-CLOSING METATHESIS; Z-SELECTIVE ETHENOLYSIS; ALPHA-HELICAL PEPTIDES; ALKYNE METATHESIS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; EFFICIENT SYNTHESIS; STAPLED PEPTIDES; CYCLIC-PEPTIDES; DRUG DISCOVERY; INHIBITOR	Macrocyclic compounds occupy an important chemical space between small molecules and biologics and are prevalent in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. The growing interest in macrocycles has been fueled, in part, by the design of novel synthetic methods to these compounds. One appealing strategy is ring-closing metathesis (RCM) that seeks to construct macrocycles from acyclic diene precursors using defined transition-metal alkylidene catalysts. Despite its broad utility, RCM generally gives rise to a mixture of E-and Z-olefin isomers that can hinder efforts for the large-scale production and isolation of such complex molecules. To address this issue, we aimed to develop methods that can selectively enrich macrocycles in E-or Z-olefin isomers using an RCM/ethenolysis strategy. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in the stereoselective formation of macrocyclic peptides, a class of compounds that have gained prominence as therapeutics in drug discovery. Herein, we report an assessment of various factors that promote catalyst-directed RCM and ethenolysis on a variety of peptide substrates by varying the olefin type, peptide sequence, and placement of the olefin in macrocycle formation. These methods allow for control over olefin geometry in peptides, facilitating their isolation and characterization. The studies outlined in this report seek to expand the scope of stereoselective olefin metathesis in general RCM.

One of the unique features of this model is that the height constraints of the stowed array do not limit the deployed diameter. Additional rings can be added to increase the deployed diameter while only minimally increasing the stowed diameter. Larger solar arrays may enable longer missions in space, manned missions to distant destinations, or clean energy sources for Earth. The novel folding design of the HanaFlex array introduces many new possibilities for space exploration. This paper demonstrates the performance of the HanaFlex array in four areas: deployed stiffness, deployed strength, stowed volume specific power, and mass specific power.

Investigating the links between ozone and organic aerosol chemistry in a biomass burning plume from a prescribed fire in California chaparral	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							THERMODYNAMIC-EQUILIBRIUM MODEL; MASTER CHEMICAL MECHANISM; MCM V3 PART; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; TRACE GASES; TROPOSPHERIC DEGRADATION; PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ABSORPTION-MODEL; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE	Within minutes after emission, complex photochemistry in biomass burning smoke plumes can cause large changes in the concentrations of ozone (O-3) and organic aerosol (OA). Being able to understand and simulate this rapid chemical evolution under a wide variety of conditions is a critical part of forecasting the impact of these fires on air quality, atmospheric composition, and climate. Here we use version 2.1 of the Aerosol Simulation Program (ASP) to simulate the evolution of O-3 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) within a young biomass burning smoke plume from the Williams prescribed fire in chaparral, which was sampled over California in November 2009. We demonstrate the use of a method for simultaneously accounting for the impact of the unidentified intermediate volatility, semi-volatile, and extremely low volatility organic compounds (here collectively called 'SVOCs') on the formation of OA (using the Volatility Basis Set - VBS) and O-3 (using the concept of mechanistic reactivity). We show that this method can successfully simulate the observations of O-3, OA, NOx, ethylene (C2H4), and OH to within measurement uncertainty using reasonable assumptions about the average chemistry of the unidentified SVOCs. These assumptions were (1) a reaction rate constant with OH of 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1); (2) a significant fraction (up to 50 %) of the RO2 + NO reaction resulted in fragmentation, rather than functionalization, of the parent SVOC; (3) 1.1 molecules of O-3 were formed for every molecule of SVOC that reacted; (4) 60 % of the OH that reacted with the unidentified non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) was regenerated as HO2; and (5) that 50 % of the NO that reacted with the SVOC peroxy radicals was lost, presumably to organic nitrate formation. Additional evidence for the fragmentation pathway is provided by the observed rate of formation of acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is consistent with our assumed fragmentation rate. However, the model overestimates peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) formation downwind by about 50 %, suggesting the need for further refinements to the chemistry. This method could provide a way for classifying different smoke plume observations in terms of the average chemistry of their SVOCs, and could be used to study how the chemistry of these compounds (and the O-3 and OA they form) varies between plumes.

Regional data assimilation of multi-spectral MOPITT observations of CO over North America	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							GEOS-CHEM MODEL; METHANE EMISSIONS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; CARBON-MONOXIDE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; TRANSPORT; INVERSION; IMPACT; TES; UNCERTAINTIES	Chemical transport models (CTMs) driven with high-resolution meteorological fields can better resolve small-scale processes, such as frontal lifting or deep convection, and thus improve the simulation and emission estimates of tropospheric trace gases. In this work, we explore the use of the GEOS-Chem four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system with the nested high-resolution version of the model (0.5A degrees x 0.67A degrees) to quantify North American CO emissions during the period of June 2004-May 2005. With optimized lateral boundary conditions, regional inversion analyses can reduce the sensitivity of the CO source estimates to errors in long-range transport and in the distributions of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the main sink for CO. To further limit the potential impact of discrepancies in chemical aging of air in the free troposphere, associated with errors in OH, we use surface-level multispectral MOPITT (Measurement of Pollution in The Troposphere) CO retrievals, which have greater sensitivity to CO near the surface and reduced sensitivity in the free troposphere, compared to previous versions of the retrievals. We estimate that the annual total anthropogenic CO emission from the contiguous US 48 states was 97 Tg CO, a 14 % increase from the 85 Tg CO in the a priori. This increase is mainly due to enhanced emissions around the Great Lakes region and along the west coast, relative to the a priori. Sensitivity analyses using different OH fields and lateral boundary conditions suggest a possible error, associated with local North American OH distribution, in these emission estimates of 20 % during summer 2004, when the CO lifetime is short. This 20 % OH-related error is 50 % smaller than the OH-related error previously estimated for North American CO emissions using a global inversion analysis. We believe that reducing this OH-related error further will require integrating additional observations to provide a strong constraint on the CO distribution across the domain. Despite these limitations, our results show the potential advantages of combining high-resolution regional inversion analyses with global analyses to better quantify regional CO source estimates.

Unusual stratospheric ozone anomalies observed in 22 years of measurements from Lauder, New Zealand	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SAGE-II; TRACE CONSTITUENTS; DATA SET; VALIDATION; TRENDS; TEMPERATURE; TRANSPORT; PROFILE; HALOE; MODEL	The Microwave Ozone Profiling Instrument (MOPI1) has provided ozone (O-3) profiles for the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) at Lauder, New Zealand (45.0A degrees S, 169.7A degrees E), since 1992. We present the entire 22-year data set and compare with satellite O-3 observations. We study in detail two particularly interesting variations in O-3. The first is a large positive O-3 anomaly that occurs in the mid-stratosphere ( 10-30 hPa) in June 2001, which is caused by an anticyclonic circulation that persists for several weeks over Lauder. This O-3 anomaly is associated with the most equatorward June average tracer equivalent latitude (TrEL) over the 36-year period (1979-2014) for which the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis is available. A second, longer-lived feature, is a positive O-3 anomaly in the mid-stratosphere (10 hPa) from mid-2009 until mid-2013. Coincident measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) show that these high O-3 mixing ratios are well correlated with high nitrous oxide (N2O) mixing ratios. This correlation suggests that the high O-3 over this 4-year period is driven by unusual dynamics. The beginning of the high O-3 and high N2O period at Lauder (and throughout this latitude band) occurs nearly simultaneously with a sharp decrease in O-3 and N2O at the equator, and the period ends nearly simultaneously with a sharp increase in O-3 and N2O at the equator.

Mechanism of the hydroxyl radical oxidation of methacryloyl peroxynitrate (MPAN) and its pathway toward secondary organic aerosol formation in the atmosphere	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LIQUID PHASE-SEPARATION; OH-INITIATED OXIDATION; ISOPRENE PHOTOOXIDATION; 2-METHYLGLYCERIC ACID; NOX; CHEMISTRY; KINETICS; PARTICLES; PRODUCTS; EPOXIDE	Methacryloyl peroxynitrate (MPAN), the acyl peroxynitrate of methacrolein, has been suggested to be an important secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursor from isoprene oxidation. Yet, the mechanism by which MPAN produces SOA through reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH) is unclear. We systematically evaluate three proposed mechanisms in controlled chamber experiments and provide the first experimental support for the theoretically-predicted lactone formation pathway from the MPAN + OH reaction, producing hydroxymethyl-methyl-a-lactone (HMML). The decomposition of the MPAN-OH adduct yields HMML + NO3 (similar to 75%) and hydroxyacetone + CO + NO3 (similar to 25%), out-competing its reaction with atmospheric oxygen. The production of other proposed SOA precursors, e.g., methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE), from MPAN and methacrolein are negligible (<2%). Furthermore, we show that the beta-alkenyl moiety of MPAN is critical for lactone formation. Alkyl radicals formed cold via H-abstraction by OH do not decompose to HMML, even if they are structurally identical to the MPAN-OH adduct. The SOA formation from HMML, from polyaddition of the lactone to organic compounds at the particle interface or in the condensed phase, is close to unity under dry conditions. However, the SOA yield is sensitive to particle liquid water and solvated ions. In hydrated inorganic particles, HMML reacts primarily with H2O to produce the monomeric 2-methylglyceric acid (2MGA) or with aqueous sulfate and nitrate to produce the associated organosulfate and organonitrate, respectively. 2MGA, a tracer for isoprene SOA, is semivolatile and its accommodation in aerosol water decreases with decreasing pH. Conditions that enhance the production of neutral 2MGA suppress SOA mass from the HMML channel.

Large-Area NbN Superconducting Nanowire Avalanche Photon Detectors with Saturated Detection Efficiency	ADVANCED PHOTON COUNTING TECHNIQUES IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advanced Photon Counting Techniques IX	APR 22-23, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Photodetector; Quantum-detector; Single-photon-detector; NbN-SNSPD; SNAP		Superconducting circuits comprising SNSPDs placed in parallel-superconducting nanowire avalanche photodetectors, or SNAPs-have previously been demonstrated to improve the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by increasing the critical current. In this work, we employ a 2-SNAP superconducting circuit with narrow (40 nm) niobium nitride (NbN) nanowires to improve the system detection efficiency to near-IR photons while maintaining high SNR. Additionally, while previous 2-SNAP demonstrations have added external choke inductance to stabilize the avalanching photocurrent, we show that the external inductance can be entirely folded into the active area by cascading 2-SNAP devices in series to produce a greatly increased active area. We fabricated series-2-SNAP (s2-SNAP) circuits with a nanowire length of 20 mu m with cascades of 2-SNAPs providing the choke inductance necessary for SNAP operation. We observed that (1) the detection efficiency saturated at high bias currents, and (2) the 40 nm 2-SNAP circuit critical current was approximately twice that for a 40 nm non-SNAP configuration.

Elaborate, high-precision simulation results for the short-time rotational self-diffusion coefficient, D-r, are discussed covering a broad range of fluid-phase state points in the HSY model phase diagram. The salient trends in the behavior of D-r as a function of reduced potential strength and range, and particle concentration, are systematically explored and physically explained. The simulation results are further used to assess the performance of two semi-analytic theoretical methods for calculating D-r. The first theoretical method is a revised version of the classical Beenakker-Mazur method (BM) adapted to rotational diffusion which includes a highly improved treatment of the salient many-particle hydrodynamic interactions. The second method is an easy-to-implement pairwise additivity (PA) method in which the hydrodynamic interactions are treated on a full two-body level with lubrication corrections included. The static pair correlation functions required as the only input to both theoretical methods are calculated using the accurate Rogers-Young integral equation scheme. While the revised BM method reproduces the general trends of the simulation results, it significantly underestimates D-r. In contrast, the PA method agrees well with the simulation results for D-r even for intermediately concentrated systems. A simple improvement of the PA method is presented which is applicable for large concentrations.

A quantitative analysis of the efficiency of solar-driven water-splitting device designs based on tandem photoabsorbers patterned with islands of metallic electrocatalysts	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							HYDROGEN-EVOLUTION; PHOSPHIDE; BEHAVIOR; SILICON; SIMULATION; KINETICS; NI	The trade-off between the optical obscuration and kinetic overpotentials of electrocatalyst films patterned onto the surface of tandem light-absorber structures in model photoelectrosynthetic water-splitting systems was investigated using a 0-dimensional load-line analysis and experimental measurements. The electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst at high current densities, normalized to the electrocatalyst surface area, is an important factor in the dependence of the optimal solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, eta(STH,opt), on the filling fraction (f(c)) of the patterned catalysts, because even under conditions that produce minority-carrier current densities of similar to 10 mA cm(-2) at the solid/liquid interface, the current density at catalyst-bearing sites can be >1-2 A cm(-2) in low filling-fraction films. A universal current-density versus potential relationship, up to current densities of 10 A cm(-2), was obtained experimentally for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) using patterned Pt ultramicroelectrode (UME) arrays with a range of filling fractions and disc diameters. The eta(STH,opt) of system designs that utilize patterned electrocatalysts located on the illuminated side of tandem photoabsorbers was then evaluated systematically. The maximum STH conversion efficiency, eta(STH,max), using a hypothetical electrocatalyst that was optically transparent but which nevertheless exhibited a current-density versus potential behavior that is characteristic of the most active Pt films measured experimentally regardless of their optical obscuration, was 26.7%. By comparison, the maximum eta(STH,opt) of 24.9% for real patterned Pt electrocatalyst films closely approached this ideal-case limit. The performance and materials utilization of the patterned electrocatalysts and of the uniformly coated electrocatalysts on tandem photoabsorbers were also compared in this study. Hence, patterned electrocatalysts with very low filling fractions can provide a potentially promising path to the realization of efficient large-scale photoelectrolysis systems while minimizing the use of scarce noble metals.

High-silica, heulandite-type zeolites prepared by direct synthesis and topotactic condensation	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; MOLECULAR-SIEVES; HIGH-RESOLUTION; CLINOPTILOLITE; PRECURSOR; CRYSTALLIZATION; CRYSTALS; FAMILY	There are both natural minerals and synthetic zeolites that possess the HEU framework topology. These materials have a limited compositional range (Si/Al < 6), and the natural zeolites often contain a large amount of impurities such as Fe3+. The preparation of impurity-free HEU-type zeolites with higher Si/Al ratio could open many areas of application, particularly in catalysis. Here, we report the first high-silica HEU-type zeolite that can be prepared via two different procedures. In the first method high-silica HEU (denoted CIT-8) is prepared using a topotactic condensation mechanism (layered precursor denoted CIT-8P); CIT-8P is obtained from a low-water synthesis in fluoride media. CIT-8 prepared in this manner has a product Si/Al ratio of 9.8 +/- 0.7 and a micropore volume of 0.10 cm(3) g(-1) (measured by nitrogen adsorption). The variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction shows that CIT-8 forms via topotactic condensation from CIT-8P along the b axis. Additionally, high-silica heulandite can be synthesized directly from a hydroxide-mediated reaction mixture (denoted CIT-8H), and has a Si/Al ratio of 6.4 +/- 0.3 and a micropore volume of 0.10 cm(3) g(-1). Both synthesis methods produce zeolites that expand the compositional range of HEU-type zeolites. These synthetic methods allow for the addition of other heteroatoms, and titanium-containing CIT-8 is prepared as an illustrative example.

Polar processing in a split vortex: Arctic ozone loss in early winter 2012/2013	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							LIMB SOUNDER MEASUREMENTS; EFFECTIVE DIFFUSIVITY; STRATOSPHERIC CLOUDS; CHLORINE ACTIVATION; NITRIC-ACID; UARS DATA; DEPLETION; TRANSPORT; CLIMATOLOGY; EVOLUTION	A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in early January 2013 caused the Arctic polar vortex to split and temperatures to rapidly rise above the threshold for chlorine activation. However, ozone in the lower stratospheric polar vortex from late December 2012 through early February 2013 reached the lowest values on record for that time of year. Analysis of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) trace gas measurements and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) data shows that exceptional chemical ozone loss early in the 2012/13 Arctic winter resulted from a unique combination of meteorological conditions associated with the early-January 2013 SSW: unusually low temperatures in December 2012, offspring vortices within which air remained well isolated for nearly 1 month after the vortex split, and greater-than-usual vortex sunlight exposure throughout December 2012 and January 2013. Conditions in the two offspring vortices differed substantially, with the one overlying Canada having lower temperatures, lower nitric acid (HNO3), lower hydrogen chloride, more sunlight exposure/higher ClO in late January, and a later onset of chlorine deactivation than the one overlying Siberia. MLS HNO3 and CALIPSO data indicate that PSC activity in December 2012 was more extensive and persistent than at that time in any other Arctic winter in the past decade. Chlorine monoxide (ClO, measured by MLS) rose earlier than previously observed and was the largest on record through mid-January 2013. Enhanced vortex ClO persisted until mid-February despite the cessation of PSC activity when the SSW started. Vortex HNO3 remained depressed after PSCs had disappeared; passive transport calculations indicate vortexaveraged denitrification of about 4 parts per billion by volume. The estimated vortex-averaged chemical ozone loss, similar to 0.7-0.8 parts per million by volume near 500K (similar to 21 km), was the largest December/January loss in the MLS record from 2004/05 to 2014/15.

The actuators are responsible for moving, manipulating, displacing, pushing and executing any action that is needed by the mechanism. There are many types and principles of actuation that are responsible for these movements ranging from electromagnetic, electroactive, thermo-mechanic, piezoelectric, electrostrictive etc. Actuators are readily available from commercial producers but there is a great need for reducing their size, increasing their efficiency and reducing their weight. Studies at JPL's Non Destructive Evaluation and Advanced Actuators (NDEAA) Laboratory have been focused on the use of piezoelectric stacks and novel designs taking advantage of piezoelectric's potential to provide high torque/force density actuation and high electromechanical conversion efficiency. The actuators/motors that have been developed and reviewed in this paper are operated by various horn configurations as well as the use of pre-stress flexures that make them thermally stable and increases their coupling efficiency. The use of monolithic designs that pre-stress the piezoelectric stack eliminates the use of compression stress bolt. These designs enable the embedding of developed solid-state motors/actuators in any structure with the only macroscopically moving parts are the rotor or the linear translator. Finite element modeling and design tools were used to determine the requirements and operation parameters and the results were used to simulate, design and fabricate novel actuators/motors. The developed actuators and performance will be described and discussed in this paper.

Methyloprofundus sedimenti gen. nov., sp nov., an obligate methanotroph from ocean sediment belonging to the 'deep sea-1' clade of marine methanotrophs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							TARGETED OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES; METHANE-OXIDIZING BACTERIUM; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; AEROBIC METHANOTROPHS; I METHANOTROPH; FATTY-ACID; DIVERSITY; METHYLOMONAS; IDENTIFICATION; METHYLOBACTER	We report the isolation and growth characteristics of a gammaproteobacterial methane-oxidizing bacterium (Methylococcaceae strain WF1(T), 'whale fall 1') that shares 98% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with uncultivated free-living methanotrophs and the methanotrophic endosymbionts of deep-sea mussels, <= 94.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with species of the genus Methylobacter and <= 93.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with species of the genera Methylomonas and Methylosarcina. Strain WF1(T) represents the first cultivar from the 'deep sea-1' clade of marine methanotrophs, which includes members that participate in methane oxidation in sediments and the water column in addition to mussel endosymbionts. Cells of strain WF1(T) were elongated cocci, approximately 1.5 mu m in diameter, and occurred singly, in pairs and in clumps. The cell wall was Gram-negative, and stacked intracytoplasmic membranes and storage granules were evident. The genomic DNA G+C content of WF1(T) was 40.5 mol%, significantly lower than that of currently described cultivars, and the major fatty acids were 16:0, 16:1 omega 9c, 16:1 omega 9t, 16:1 omega 8c and 16:2 omega 9,14. Growth occurred in liquid media at an optimal temperature of 23 degrees C, and was dependent on the presence of methane or methanol. Atmospheric nitrogen could serve as the sole nitrogen source for WF1(T), a capacity that had not been functionally demonstrated previously in members of Methylobacter. On the basis of its unique morphological, physiological and phylogenetic properties, this strain represents the type species within a new genus, and we propose the name Methyloprofundus sedimenti gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Methyloprofundus sedimenti is WF1(T) (=LMG 28393(T)=ATCC BAA-2619(T)).

NASA's uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) acquired airborne InSAR data from multiple vantage points during the early melt season in June 2012. We develop a Bayesian approach for inferring three-dimensional velocity fields from multiple InSAR acquisitions. The horizontal components generally agree with available GPS measurements wherever ice motion is well constrained by InSAR observations. We provide evidence that changes in volumetric moisture content near the glacier surface induce phase offsets that obfuscate the vertical component of the surface velocity fields, an effect that could manifest itself on any glacier that experiences surface melt. Spatial patterns in the InSAR-derived horizontal speeds are broadly consistent with the results of a simple viscous flow model, and the directionality of the InSAR-derived horizontal flow field is nearly everywhere consistent with the ice surface gradient. Significant differences between the InSAR-derived horizontal speed and the speed predicted by the viscous flow model suggest that basal slip accounts for more than half the observed outlet glacier flow.

However, all attempts at synthesis have failed. In order to validate the expected properties for these systems and to determine why these materials are too unstable to synthesize, we used the PBE flavor of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict the crystal structures for MTO and MTO3N and then we carried out DFT molecular dynamics simulations (DFT-MD) to determine the initial reaction mechanisms for decomposition. Klapotke estimated that MTO would have a density of rho = 1.859 g cm(-3) with an estimated detonation velocity (D-v) of 8.979 km s(-1), making it comparable to RDX (rho = 1.82 g cm(-3), D-v = 8.75 km s(-1)) and beta-HMX (rho = 1.91 g cm(-3), D-v = 9.10 km s(-1)). His estimated impact sensitivity >30 J, make it much better than HMX (7 J) and RDX (7.5 J). Our predicted crystal structure for MTO (P2((1)) space group) leads to rho = 1.859 g cm(-3), in good agreement with expectations. Our DFT-MD studies find that the first step in the decomposition of MTO is intermolecular hydrogen-transfer reaction (barrier 3.0 kcal mol(-1)) which is followed quickly by H2O and NO release with reaction barriers of 46.5 and 35.5 kcal mol(-1). In contrast for MTO3N (P2((1))/(c) predicted space group), we find that the first steps are a bimolecular decomposition to release NO2 (Delta H = 44.1 kcal mol(-1), Delta G = 54.7 kcal mol(-1)) simultaneous with unimolecular NO2 cleavage (Delta H = 59.9 and Delta G = 58.2 kcal mol(-1)) a unique initial reaction among EMs. These results suggest that MTO3N would be significantly more thermally stabile (barrier > 6.0 kcal mol(-1) higher) than RDX and HMX, making it an excellent candidate to be insensitive new green energetic materials. However we find that MTO leads to very favorable hydrogen transfer reactions that may complicate synthesis and crystallization, making MTO3N the more promising system.

The Selective Electrochemical Conversion of Preactivated CO2 to Methane	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							N-HETEROCYCLIC CARBENE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; MULTIELECTRON REDUCTION; CATALYSIS; INSIGHTS	This work reports the selective electrochemical conversion of CO2 to methane, the reverse reaction of fossil fuel combustion. This reaction is facilitated by preactivation of the CO2 molecule with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to form a zwitterionic species in the first step. In the presence of Ni(cyclam)(2+) and CF3CH2OH, this species is shown to undergo further electrochemical reduction of the bound-CO2 fragment at glassy carbon cathodes in dichloromethane electrolyte solution. Labeling studies confirm the origin of the carbon and protons in the methane product are the preactivated CO2 and trifluoroethanol respectively. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

MgF2 was deposited in a showerhead style ALD reactor using bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)magnesium and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) as precursors at substrate temperatures from 100 to 250 degrees C. The use of HF was observed to result in improved morphology and reduced impurity content compared to other reported MgF2 ALD approaches that use metal fluoride precursors as the fluorine-containing chemistry. Characterization of these films has been performed using spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for material deposited on silicon substrates. Films at all substrate temperatures were transparent at wavelengths down to 190 nm and the low deposition temperature combined with low surface roughness makes these coatings good candidates for a variety of optical applications in the far ultraviolet.

High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) samples diffusivity at a large number of spherical angles, to better resolve neural fibers that mix or cross. Here, we implemented a framework for advanced mathematical analysis of mouse 5-shell HARDI (b= 1000, 3000, 4000, 8000, 12000 s/mm(2)), also known as hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI). Using q-ball imaging (QBI) at ultra-high field strength (7 Tesla), we computed diffusion and fiber orientation distribution functions (dODF, fODF) to better detect crossing fibers. We also computed a quantitative anisotropy (QA) index, and deterministic tractography, from the peak orientation of the fODFs. We found that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the QA was significantly higher in single and multi-shell reconstructed data at the lower b-values (b= 1000, 3000, 4000 s/mm(2)) than at higher b-values (b= 8000, 12000 s/mm(2)); the b= 1000 s/mm(2) shell increased the SNR of the QA in all multi-shell reconstructions, but when used alone or in <5-shell reconstruction, it led to higher angular error for the major fibers, compared to 5-shell HYDI. Multi-shell data reconstructed major fibers with less error than single-shell data, and was most successful at reducing the angular error when the lowest shell was excluded (b= 1000 s/mm(2)). Overall, high-resolution connectivity mapping with 7T HYDI offers great potential for understanding unresolved changes in mouse models of brain disease.

Various types of noise in the system can result in error. To recover the data from the noisy signal, the error must be corrected by a fast and accurate signal processing algorithm. By considering the crosstalk effect of the neighboring channels, we have devised a multi-level thresholding method to set the threshold values based on the neighboring channel values. We compare the binary characterization performance of a neural network and the local multi-level adaptive thresholding method for decoding noisy transmission images. We show that the multi-thresholding implementation results in an average of 57.42% less binary characterization errors than the artificial neural network across twenty unique mixed noise optical conditions.

It is important to make sure the mission would securely contain any microbes that may possibly exist on Mars so that they would not be able to cause any adverse effects on Earth's environment. A brazing sealing and sterilizing technique has been proposed to break the Mars-to-Earth contamination chain. Thermal analysis of the brazing process was conducted for several conceptual designs that apply the technique. Control of the increase of the temperature of the Martian samples is a challenge. The temperature profiles of the Martian samples being sealed in the container were predicted by finite element thermal models. The results show that the sealing and sterilization process can be controlled such that the samples' temperature is maintained below the potentially required level, and that the brazing technique is a feasible approach to break the contamination chain.

A variety of proposed energy harvesting schemes could be used to extract energy from this environment but each of these has their own limitations that limit their practical use. Since vibrating piezoelectric structures are solid state and can be driven below their fatigue limit, harvesters based on these structures are capable of operating for very long lifetimes (decades); thereby, possibly overcoming a principle limitation of existing technology based on rotating turbo-machinery. An initial survey [1] identified that spline nozzle configurations can be used to excite a vibrating piezoelectric structure in such a way as to convert the abundant flow energy into useful amounts of electrical power. This paper presents current flow energy harvesting designs and experimental results of specific spline nozzle/ bimorph design configurations which have generated suitable power per nozzle at or above well production analogous flow rates. Theoretical models for non-dimensional analysis and constitutive electromechanical model are also presented in this paper to optimize the flow harvesting system.

Using self-organising maps to explore ozone profile validation results - SCIAMACHY limb compared to ground-based lidar observations	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; SATELLITE; SPECTROMETER; TEMPERATURE	Traditional validation of atmospheric profiles is based on the intercomparison of two or more data sets in pre-defined ranges or classes of a given observational characteristic such as latitude or solar zenith angle. In this study we trained a self-organising map (SOM) with a full time series of relative difference profiles of SCIAMACHY limb v5.02 and lidar ozone profiles from seven observation sites. Each individual observation characteristic was then mapped to the obtained SOM to investigate to which degree variation in this characteristic is explanatory for the variation seen in the SOM map. For the studied data sets, altitude-dependent relations for the global data set were found between the difference profiles and studied variables. From the lowest altitude studied (18 km) ascending, the most influencing factors were found to be longitude, followed by solar zenith angle and latitude, sensor age and again solar zenith angle together with the day of the year at the highest altitudes studied here (up to 45 km). After accounting for both latitude and longitude, residual partial correlations with a reduced magnitude are seen for various factors. However, (partial) correlations cannot point out which (combination) of the factors drives the observed differences between the ground-based and satellite ozone profiles as most of the factors are inter-related. Clustering into three classes showed that there are also some local dependencies, with for instance one cluster having a much stronger correlation with the sensor age (days since launch) between 36 and 42 km. The proposed SOM-based approach provides a powerful tool for the exploration of differences between data sets without being limited to a priori defined data subsets.	[van Gijsel, J. A.

Organic amines are predominantly nonfluorescent and are of analytical interest in agricultural and food science, biomedical applications, and biowarfare detection. Alexa Fluor 488 N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (AF488 NHS-ester) is an amine-specific fluorescent probe. Here, we demonstrate low limit of detection of long-chain (C-9 to C-18) primary amines and optimize AF488 derivatization of long-chain primary amines. The reaction was found to be equally efficient in all solvents studied (dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol, and N,N-dimethylformamide). While an organic base (N,N-diisopropylethylamine) is required to achieve efficient reaction between AF488 NHS-ester and organic amines with longer hydrophobic chains, high concentrations (>5mM) result in increased levels of ethylamine and propylamine in the blank. Optimal incubation times were found to be >12 hrs at room temperature. We present an initial capillary electrophoresis separation for analysis using a simple micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) buffer consisting of 12 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and 5 mM carbonate, pH 10. Limits of detection using the optimized labeling conditions and these separation conditions were 5-17 nM. The method presented here represents a novel addition to the arsenal of fluorescent probes available for highly sensitive analysis of small organic molecules.

At nano dimensions, surfaces (and interfaces) play a significant role in changing equilibrium thermodynamics and phase stability. In this work, it is shown that these surfaces at small dimensions affect the relative equilibrium thermodynamics of the different phases. The CALPHAD approach for material surfaces (also termed "nano-CALPHAD") is employed to investigate these changes in three binary systems by calculating their phase diagrams at nano dimensions and comparing them with their bulk counterparts. The surface energy contribution, which is the dominant factor in causing these changes, is evaluated using the spherical particle approximation. It is first validated with the Au-Si system for which experimental data on phase stability of spherical nano-sized particles is available, and then extended to calculate phase diagrams of similarly sized particles of Ge-Si and Al-Cu. Additionally, the surface energies of the associated compounds are calculated using DFT, and integrated into the thermodynamic model of the respective binary systems. In this work we found changes in miscibilities, reaction compositions of about 5 at%, and solubility temperatures ranging from 100-200 K for particles of sizes 5 nm, indicating the importance of phase equilibrium analysis at nano dimensions.

We present the method and preliminary results of in-situ measurements of optical measurements made using sonic-anemometers. We show the impact of correcting the raw data for aliasing, path averaging, pulse sequence delays and Taylors' hypothesis. Finally, we highlight the occurrence of non-Kolmogorov turbulence which complicates the quantitative impact of the measurements on the telescope's resolution.

The original model has a large number of parameters, making uncertainty quantification challenging. In this paper, we use variance-based global sensitivity analysis to reduce the number of model parameters, and apply randomised quasi-Monte Carlo methods to quantify parametric uncertainties for the reduced model. The Monte Carlo estimator used in these calculations is based on a control variate approach applied to the sensitivity derivative enhanced sampling. The chaparral fuel model, selected from Rothermel's 11 original fuel models, is studied as an example. We obtain numerical results that improve the crude Monte Carlo sampling by factors as high as three orders of magnitude.	[Liu, Yaning; Hussaini, M.

We describe an approach to wind energy harvesting that has the potential to resolve this disconnect by geographically distributing wind power generators in a manner that more closely mirrors the physical resource itself. To this end, technology development is focused on large arrays of small wind turbines that can harvest wind energy at low altitudes by using new concepts of biology-inspired engineering. This approach dramatically extends the reach of wind energy, as smaller wind turbines can be installed in many places that larger systems cannot, especially in built environments. Moreover, they have lower visual, acoustic, and radar signatures, and they may pose significantly less risk to birds and bats. These features can be leveraged to attain cultural acceptance and rapid adoption of this new technology, thereby enabling significantly faster achievement of state and national renewable energy targets than with existing technology alone. Favorable economics stem from an orders-of-magnitude reduction in the number of components in a new generation of simple, mass-manufacturable (even 3D-printable), vertical-axis wind turbines. However, this vision can only be achieved by overcoming significant scientific challenges that have limited progress over the past three decades. The following essay summarizes our approach as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with it, with the aim of motivating a concerted effort in basic and applied research in this area.

However, chemical models have identified chloronium, H2Cl+, as a relatively abundant species that is potentially detectable. H2Cl+ was predicted to be most abundant in the environments where the ultraviolet radiation is strong: in diffuse clouds, or near the surfaces of dense clouds illuminated by nearby O and B stars. The HIFI instrument on Herschel provided the first detection of H2Cl+ in the ISM. The 212-101 lines of ortho-H-2 Cl-35(+) and ortho-H-2 Cl-37(+) were detected in absorption toward NGC 6334I, and the 111-000 transition of para-H2 35Cl+ was detected in absorption toward NGC 6334I and Sgr B2(S). The derived HCl/H2Cl+ column density ratios, similar to 1-10, are within the range predicted by models of diffuse and dense Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs). However, the observed H2Cl+ column densities, in excess of 10(13) cm(-2), are significantly higher than the model predictions. These observations demonstrate the outstanding spectroscopic capabilities of HIFI for detecting new interstellar molecules and providing key constraints for astrochemical models.

Construction of the NO nu A experiment, situated off-axis in the upgraded NuMI beam, is almost complete. Over the coming years it will have significant power to probe the questions of the mass hierarchy, theta(23) octant, and the possibility of CP violation in the lepton sector. This paper gives an overview of the results from MINOS, and of the sensitivity of the NO nu A experiment.

A triply nested computational domain for WRF was chosen so that the innermost domain with 3.3 km grid spacing encompasses the entire mainland of Alaska and enables the substantial orography of the state to be represented by the underlying high-resolution topographic input field. Summary statistics of the WRF model performance on the 3.3 km grid indicate good overall agreement with quality-controlled surface and radiosonde observations. Two-meter temperatures are generally too cold by approximately 1.4 K in 2012 and 1.1 K in 2013, while 2 m dewpoint temperatures are too low (dry) by 0.2 K in 2012 and too high (moist) by 0.6 K in 2013. Wind speeds are biased too low by 0.2 m s(-1) in 2012 and 0.3 ms(-1) in 2013. Model representation of upper level variables is very good. These measures are comparable to model performance metrics of similar model configurations found in the literature. The high quality of these fine-resolution WRF meteorological fields inspires confidence in their use to drive STILT for the purpose of computing surface influences ("footprints") at commensurably increased resolution. Indeed, footprints generated on a 0.1 degrees grid show increased spatial detail compared with those on the more common 0.5 degrees grid, better allowing for convolution with flux models for carbon dioxide and methane across the heterogeneous Alaskan landscape. Ozone deposition rates computed using STILT footprints indicate good agreement with observations and exhibit realistic seasonal variability, further indicating that WRF-STILT footprints are of high quality and will support accurate estimates of CO2 and CH4 surface-atmosphere fluxes using CARVE observations.

The decrease in mid-stratospheric tropical ozone since 1991	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SAGE-II; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; VALIDATION; PROFILE; HALOE; NO2; CH4	While global stratospheric O-3 has begun to recover, there are localized regions where O-3 has decreased since 1991. Specifically, we use measurements from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) for the period 1991-2005 and the NASA Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) for the period 2004-2013 to demonstrate a significant decrease in O-3 near similar to 10 hPa in the tropics. O-3 in this region is very sensitive to variations in NOy, and the observed decrease can be understood as a spatially localized, yet long-term increase in NOy. In turn, using data from MLS and from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), we show that the NOy variations are caused by decreases in N2O which are likely linked to long-term variations in dynamics. To illustrate how variations in dynamics can affect N2O and O-3, we show that by decreasing the upwelling in the tropics, more of the N2O can photodissociate with a concomitant increase in NOy production (via N2O + O(D-1) -> 2NO) at 10 hPa. Ultimately, this can cause an O-3 decrease of the observed magnitude.	[Nedoluha, G. E.; Siskind, D.

Hydroxy nitrate production in the OH-initiated oxidation of alkenes	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							GAS-PHASE REACTIONS; NOX-AIR PHOTOOXIDATIONS; ALKYL PEROXY-RADICALS; RATE CONSTANTS; BETA-HYDROXYNITRATES; ORGANIC NITRATES; NITRIC-OXIDE; YIELDS; HOUSTON; TEXAS	Alkenes are oxidized rapidly in the atmosphere by addition of OH and subsequently O-2 leading to the formation of beta-hydroxy peroxy radicals. These peroxy radicals react with NO to form beta-hydroxy nitrates with a branching ratio alpha. We quantify alpha for C-2-C-8 alkenes at 295K +/- 3 and 993 hPa. The branching ratio can be expressed as alpha = (0.045 +/- 0.016) x N - (0.11 +/- 0.05) where N is the number of heavy atoms (excluding the peroxy moiety), and listed errors are 2 sigma. These branching ratios are larger than previously reported and are similar to those for peroxy radicals formed from H abstraction from alkanes. We find the isomer distributions of beta-hydroxy nitrates formed under NO-dominated peroxy radical chemistry to be different than the isomer distribution of hydroxy hydroperoxides produced under HO2-dominated peroxy radical chemistry. Assuming unity yield for the hydroperoxides implies that the branching ratio to form beta-hydroxy nitrates increases with substitution of RO2. Deuterium substitution enhances the branching ratio to form hydroxy nitrates in both propene and isoprene by a factor of similar to 1.5. The role of alkene chemistry in the Houston region is re-evaluated using the RONO2 branching ratios reported here. Small alkenes are found to play a significant role in present-day oxidant formation more than a decade (2013) after the 2000 Texas Air Quality Study identified these compounds as major contributors to photochemical smog in Houston.

Unassisted solar-driven photoelectrosynthetic HI splitting using membrane-embedded Si microwire arrays	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							JUNCTION SILICON ELECTRODE; ENERGY-CONVERSION; N-TYPE; SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRODES; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; HYDROGEN IODIDE; FUEL-CELL; PHOTOELECTROCHEMISTRY; PHOTOELECTROLYSIS; GENERATION	Free-standing, membrane-embedded, Si microwire arrays have been used to affect the solar-driven, unassisted splitting of HI into H-2 and I-3(-). The Si microwire arrays were grown by a chemical-vapor-deposition vapor-liquid-solid growth process using Cu growth catalysts, with a radial n(+) p junction then formed on each microwire. A Nafion proton-exchange membrane was introduced between the microwires and Pt electrocatalysts were then photoelectrochemically deposited on the microwires. The composite Si/Pt-Nafion membrane was mechanically removed from the growth substrate, and Pt electrocatalysts were then also deposited on the back side of the structure. The resulting membrane-bound Si microwire arrays spontaneously split concentrated HI into H-2(g) and I-3(-) under 1 Sun of simulated solar illumination. The reaction products (i.e. H-2 and I-3(-)) were confirmed by mass spectrometry and ultraviolet-visible electronic absorption spectroscopy.

Simulation and measurement of transcranial near infrared light penetration	OPTICAL INTERACTIONS WITH TISSUE AND CELLS XXVI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Interactions with Tissue and Cells XXVI	FEB 08-10, 2015	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		near-infrared light; transcranial penetration; LED array; finite element analysis	ADULT HEAD; PROPAGATION; SCATTERING; MODEL	We are studying the transmission of LED array-emitted near-infrared (NIR) light through human tissues. Herein, we simulated and measured transcranial NIR penetration in highly scattering human head tissues. Using finite element analysis, we simulated photon diffusion in a multilayered 3D human head model that consists of scalp, skull, cerebral spinal fluid, gray matter and white matter. The optical properties of each layer, namely scattering and absorption coefficient, correspond to the 850 nm NIR light. The geometry of the model is minimally modified from the IEEE standard and the multiple LED emitters in an array were evenly distributed on the scalp. Our results show that photon distribution produced by the array exhibits little variation at similar brain depth, suggesting that due to strong scattering effects of the tissues, discrete spatial arrangements of LED emitters in an array has the potential to create a quasi-radially symmetrical illumination field. Measurements on cadaveric human head tissues excised from occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal regions show that illumination with an 850 nm LED emitter rendered a photon flux that closely follows simulation results. In addition, prolonged illumination of LED emitted NIR showed minimal thermal effects on the brain.

Integrating these materials in an on-chip optical platform would create opportunities for highly integrated light-matter interfaces for quantum communication and quantum computing. Nano-photonic resonators with high quality factors and small mode volumes are required for efficient on-chip coupling to the small dipole moment of rare-earth ion transitions. However, direct fabrication of optical cavities in these crystals with current nanofabrication techniques is difficult and unparallelized, as either exotic etch chemistries or physical milling processes are required. We fabricated hybrid devices by mechanically transferring a nanoscale membrane of gallium arsenide (GaAs) onto a neodymium-doped yttrium silicon oxide (Y2SiO5) crystal and then using electron beam lithography and standard III-V dry etching to pattern nanobeam photonic crystal cavities and ring resonator cavities, a technique that is easily adapted to other frequency ranges for arbitrary dopants in any rare earth host system. Single crystalline GaAs was chosen for its low loss and high refractive index at the transition wavelength. We demonstrated the potential to evanescently couple between the cavity field and the 883 nm I-4(9/2)-F-4(3/2) transition of nearby neodymium impurities in the host crystal by examining transmission spectra through a waveguide coupled to the resonator with a custom-built confocal microscope. The prospects and requirements for using this system for scalable quantum networks are discussed.

On the comparisons of tropical relative humidity in the lower and middle troposphere among COSMIC radio occultations and MERRA and ECMWF data sets	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							WATER-VAPOR; ERA-INTERIM; VALIDATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPROVEMENT; RETRIEVALS; FORECASTS; AIRS	The spatial variability of the tropical tropospheric relative humidity (RH) throughout the vertical extent of the troposphere is examined using Global Positioning System Radio Occultation (GPSRO) observations from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) mission. These high vertical resolution observations capture the detailed structure and moisture budget of the Hadley Cell circulation. We compare the COSMIC observations with the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) climatologies. Qualitatively, the spatial pattern of RH in all data sets matches up remarkably well, capturing distinct features of the general circulation. However, RH discrepancies exist between ERA-Interim and COSMIC data sets that are noticeable across the tropical boundary layer. Specifically, ERA-Interim shows a drier Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) by 15-20% compared to both COSMIC and MERRA data sets, but this difference decreases with altitude. Unlike ECMWF, MERRA shows an excellent agreement with the COSMIC observations except above 400 hPa, where GPSRO observations capture drier air by 5-10 %. RH climatologies were also used to evaluate intraseasonal variability. The results indicate that the tropical middle troposphere at +/- 5-25 degrees is most sensitive to seasonal variations. COSMIC and MERRA data sets capture the same magnitude of the seasonal variability, but ERA-Interim shows a weaker seasonal fluctuation up to 10% in the middle troposphere inside the dry air subsidence regions of the Hadley Cell. Over the ITCZ, RH varies by maximum 9% between winter and summer.	[Vergados, P.; Mannucci, A. J.; Ao, C. O.; Jiang, J.

Validation of SCIAMACHY HDO/H2O measurements using the TCCON and NDACC-MUSICA networks	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC WATER-VAPOR; DELTA-D; RETRIEVALS; CALIBRATION; (H2O)-O-16; DEUTERIUM; IMPACT; MODEL; RATIO; O-18	Measurements of the atmospheric HDO/H2O ratio help us to better understand the hydrological cycle and improve models to correctly simulate tropospheric humidity and therefore climate change. We present an updated version of the column-averaged HDO/H2O ratio data set from the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). The data set is extended with 2 additional years, now covering 2003-2007, and is validated against co-located ground-based total column (delta D) over bar measurements from Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC, produced within the framework of the MUSICA project). Even though the time overlap among the available data is not yet ideal, we determined a mean negative bias in SCIAMACHY (delta D) over bar of -35 +/- 30% compared to TCCON and -69 +/- 15% compared to MUSICA (the uncertainty indicating the station-to-station standard deviation). The bias shows a latitudinal dependency, being largest (similar to-60 to -80 parts per thousand) at the highest latitudes and smallest (similar to-20 to -30%) at the lowest latitudes. We have tested the impact of an offset correction to the SCIAMACHY HDO and H2O columns. This correction leads to a humidity-and latitude-dependent shift in (delta D) over bar and an improvement of the bias by 27 parts per thousand, although it does not lead to an improved correlation with the FTS measurements nor to a strong reduction of the latitudinal dependency of the bias. The correction might be an improvement for dry, high-altitude areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau and the Andes region. For these areas, however, validation is currently impossible due to a lack of ground stations. The mean standard deviation of single-sounding SCIAMACHY-FTS differences is similar to 115 parts per thousand, which is reduced by a factor similar to 2 when we consider monthly means. When we relax the strict matching of individual measurements and focus on the mean seasonalities using all available FTS data, we find that the correlation coefficients between SCIAMACHY and the FTS networks improve from 0.2 to 0.7-0.8. Certain ground stations show a clear asymmetry in (delta D) over bar during the transition from the dry to the wet season and back, which is also detected by SCIAMACHY. This asymmetry points to a transition in the source region temperature or location of the water vapour and shows the added information that HDO/H2O measurements provide when used in combination with variations in humidity.

Developed as a technology demonstration, its objective was to experiment with space-to-ground optical communications transmissions from Low Earth Orbit. More than a dozen successful optical links were established between a Wrightwood, California-based ground telescope and the OPALS flight terminal from June 2014 to September 2014. Each transmission required precise bi-directional pointing to be maintained between the space-based transmitter and ground-based receiver. This was accomplished by acquiring and tracking a laser beacon signal transmitted from the ground telescope to the OPALS flight terminal on the ISS. OPALS demonstrated the ability to nominally acquire the beacon within three seconds at 25 degrees elevation and maintain lock within 140 mu rad (3 sigma) for the full 150-second transmission duration while slewing at rates up to 1 degrees/sec. Additional acquisition attempts in low elevation and weather-challenged conditions provided valuable insight on the optical link robustness under off-nominal operational conditions.

Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) Link Validation During Operations from the ISS	FREE-SPACE LASER COMMUNICATION AND ATMOSPHERIC PROPAGATION XXVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Free-Space Laser Communication and Atmospheric Propagation XXVII	FEB 08-09, 2015	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		ISS; lasercomm; downlink; bit-error-rate; beacon; 1550 nm; atmospheric transmission		In mid-2014 several day and nighttime links under diverse atmospheric conditions were completed using the Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) flight system on-board the International Space Station (ISS). In this paper we compare measured optical power and its variance at either end of the link with predictions that include atmospheric propagation models. For the 976 nm laser beacon mean power transmitted from the ground to the ISS the predicted mean irradiance of tens of microwatts per square meter close to zenith and its decrease with range and increased air mass shows good agreement with predictions. The irradiance fluctuations sampled at 100 Hz also follow the expected increase in scintillation with air mass representative of atmospheric coherence lengths at zenith at 500 nm in the 3-8 cm range. The downlink predicted power of hundreds of nanowatts was also reconciled within the uncertainty of the atmospheric losses. Expected link performance with uncoded bit-error rates less than 1E-4 required for the Reed-Solomon code to correct errors for video, text and file transmissions was verified. The results of predicted and measured powers and fluctuations suggest the need for further study and refinement.

Frequency combs were recently generated by micro resonators through nonlinear Kerr processes. However, the comb span from micro resonators was found to be limited by resonator dispersion and mode spectrum. While dispersion engineering has been reported in on-chip devices, monolithic crystalline resonators offer an advantage of high optical quality factor. Moreover, most resonators used for comb generation support many mode families, leading to unavoidable crossings in resonator spectrum. Such crossings strongly influence comb dynamics and may prevent stable coherent mode-locking and soliton states. We report a new crystalline resonator approach supporting dispersion control and single mode spectrum while maintaining high quality factor. Dispersion engineering by waveguide micro-structuring is used to flatten the dispersion in our MgF2 resonator. Both absolute magnitude of dispersion and its slopes can be altered over a wavelength span exceeding an octave. Dispersion flattening leads to generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb with repetition rate of 46 GHz and coupled pump power below 100 mW. We also demonstrate that the microstructuring dispersion engineering approach can be used to achieve flattened and anomalous dispersion in a CaF2 resonator near 1550 nm wavelength. In addition, we describe observation of discrete steps between the modulation instability states of the primary comb and on the three-stage comb unfolding dynamics. The micro-structured resonators may enable efficient low repetition rate coherent octave spanning frequency combs without external broadening, ideal for applications in optical frequency synthesis, metrology, spectroscopy, and communications.

Two lasers at different wavelengths are used for the differential detection. This method enhances the sensitivity through higher responsivity and noise cancelation. To reduce noise further, especially due to the unstable low cost laser diode output, we employed a referencing method in which a reference pixel value in each CMOS image frame is subtracted from all other pixels. To validate the designed structure and demonstrate the sensitivity of it, we perform refractive index measurements of fluids with our design. In this presentation, we will discuss our design, simulation results, and measurement results.

Comparisons of polar processing diagnostics from 34 years of the ERA-Interim and MERRA reanalyses	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ARCTIC OZONE DEPLETION; METEOROLOGICAL ANALYSES; STRATOSPHERIC CLOUDS; WINTER; VORTEX; ASSIMILATION; CHEMISTRY; MODEL; DENITRIFICATION; EVENTS	We present a comprehensive comparison of polar processing diagnostics derived from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim). We use diagnostics that focus on meteorological conditions related to stratospheric chemical ozone loss based on temperatures, polar vortex dynamics, and air parcel trajectories to evaluate the effects these reanalyses might have on polar processing studies. Our results show that the agreement between MERRA and ERA-Interim changes significantly over the 34 years from 1979 to 2013 in both hemispheres and in many cases improves. By comparing our diagnostics during five time periods when an increasing number of higher-quality observations were brought into these reanalyses, we show how changes in the data assimilation systems (DAS) of MERRA and ERA-Interim affected their meteorological data. Many of our stratospheric temperature diagnostics show a convergence toward significantly better agreement, in both hemispheres, after 2001 when Aqua and GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) radiances were introduced into the DAS. Other diagnostics, such as the winter mean volume of air with temperatures below polar stratospheric cloud formation thresholds (V-PSC) and some diagnostics of polar vortex size and strength, do not show improved agreement between the two reanalyses in recent years when data inputs into the DAS were more comprehensive. The polar processing diagnostics calculated from MERRA and ERA-Interim agree much better than those calculated from earlier reanalysis data sets. We still, however, see fairly large differences in many of the diagnostics in years prior to 2002, raising the possibility that the choice of one reanalysis over another could significantly influence the results of polar processing studies. After 2002, we see overall good agreement among the diagnostics, which demonstrates that the ERA-Interim and MERRA reanalyses are equally appropriate choices for polar processing studies of recent Arctic and Antarctic winters.

J	Hou, TY; Shi, ZQ; Tavallali, P				Hou, Thomas Y.; Shi, Zuoqiang; Tavallali, Peyman			SPARSE TIME FREQUENCY REPRESENTATIONS AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Sparse time frequency representations; order of nonlinearity; intrinsic mode function; dynamical system	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; AMPLITUDE	In this paper, we establish a connection between the recently developed data-driven time-frequency analysis [T.Y. Hou and Z. Shi, Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis, 3, 1-28, 2011], [T.Y. Hou and Z. Shi, Applied and Comput. Harmonic Analysis, 35, 284-308, 2013] and the classical second order differential equations. The main idea of the data-driven time-frequency analysis is to decompose a multiscale signal into the sparsest collection of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) over the largest possible dictionary via nonlinear optimization. These IMFs are of the form alpha(t) cos(theta(t)), where the amplitude a(t) is positive and slowly varying. The non-decreasing phase function.(t) is determined by the data and in general depends on the signal in a nonlinear fashion. One of the main results of this paper is that we show that each IMF can be associated with a solution of a second order ordinary differential equation of the form x+p(x, t)(x) overdot+q(x, t) - 0. Further, we propose a localized variational formulation for this problem and develop an effective l(1)-based optimization method to recover p(x, t) and q(x, t) by looking for a sparse representation of p and q in terms of the polynomial basis. Depending on the form of nonlinearity in p(x, t) and q(x, t), we can define the order of nonlinearity for the associated IMF. This generalizes a concept recently introduced by Prof. N. E. Huang et al. [N.E. Huang, M.-T. Lo, Z. Wu, and Xianyao Chen, US Patent filling number 12/241.565, Sept. 2011]. Numerical examples will be provided to illustrate the robustness and stability of the proposed method for data with or without noise. This manuscript should be considered as a proof of concept.

The high center of mass energy, the large number of simultaneous collision of beam particles in the experiments and the very high repetition rates of the collision events pose huge challenges. They result in extremely high particle fluxes, causing very high occupancies in the particle physics detectors operating at these machines. To reconstruct the physics events, the detectors have to make as much information as possible available on the final state particles. We discuss how timing information with a precision of around 10 ps and below can aid the reconstruction of the physics events under such challenging conditions. High energy photons play a crucial role in this context. About one third of the particle flux originating from high energy hadron collisions is detected as photons, stemming from the decays of neutral mesons. In addition, many key physics signatures under study are identified by high energy photons in the final state. They pose a particular challenge in that they can only be detected once they convert in the detector material. The particular challenge in measuring the time of arrival of a high energy photon lies in the stochastic component of the distance to the initial conversion and the size of the electromagnetic shower. They extend spatially over distances which propagation times of the initial photon and the subsequent electromagnetic shower which are large compared to the desired precision. We present studies and measurements from test beams and a cosmic muon test stand for calorimeter based timing measurements to explore the ultimate timing precision achievable for high energy photons of 10 GeV and above. We put particular focus on techniques to measure the timing with a precision of about 10 ps in association with the energy of the photon. For calorimeters utilizing scintillating materials and light guiding components, the propagation speed of the scintillation light in the calorimeter is important. We present studies and measurements of the propagation speed on a range of detector geometries. Finally, possible applications of precision timing in future high energy physics experiments are discussed.

Progress status for the Mu2e calorimeter system	16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CALORIMETRY IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS (CALOR 2014)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Calorimetry in High Energy Physics (CALOR)	APR 06-11, 2014	Justus Liebig Univ, Sci Campus, Giessen, GERMANY	HIC FAIR Helmholtz Int Ctr	Justus Liebig Univ, Sci Campus			The Mu2e experiment at FNAL aims to measure the charged-lepton flavor violating neutrinoless conversion of a negative muon into an electron. The conversion results in a monochromatic electron with an energy slightly below the muon rest mass (104.97 MeV). The calorimeter should confirm that the candidates reconstructed by the extremely precise tracker system are indeed conversion electrons while performing a powerful i/e particle identification. Moreover, it should also provide a high level trigger for the experiment independently from the tracker system. The calorimeter should also be able to keep functionality in an environment where the background delivers a dose of 10 krad/year in the hottest area and to work in the presence of 1 T axial magnetic field. These requirements translate in the design of a calorimeter with large acceptance, good energy resolution 0(5%) and a reasonable position (time) resolution of similar to <1 cm (<0.5ns). The baseline version of the calorimeter is composed by two disks of inner (outer) radius of 351 (660) mm filled by 1860 hexagonal BaF2 crystals of 20 cm length. Each crystal is readout by two large area APD's. In this paper, we summarize the experimental tests done so far as well as the simulation studies in the Mu2e environment.

Oscillations at the Si/electrolyte contact: Relation to Quantum Mechanics	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICAL MODELING IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES (IC-MSQUARE 2014)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Mathematical Modeling in Physical Sciences (IC-MSQUARE)	AUG 28-31, 2014	Madrid, SPAIN				MODEL; DISSOLUTION; ELECTROLYTE; SILICON	The basic process at the surface of the Si electrode is characterized by a cyclic oxidation of a thin silicon layer and the subsequent removal of the oxide by etching. Here, the oxide thickness evolves not uniformly due to cracks and nanopores. The mathematical model used to describe the phenomenon is based on a sequence of time dependent (oxide thickness) oscillator density functions that describes the passing of the (infinitesimal) oscillators through their minimum at each cycle. Two consecutive oscillator density functions are connected by a second order linear integral equation representing a Markov process. The kernel of the integral equation is a normalized Greens Function and represents the probability distribution for the periods of the oscillators during a cycle. Both, the oscillator density function and the two-dimensional probability density for the periods of the oscillators, define a random walk. A relation between the oscillator density functions and solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation can be constructed. This allows a connection of the oscillations, originally considered only for the description of a photo-electrochemical observation, to the Schrodinger equation. In addition, if the trajectory of a virtual particle, located at the silicon oxide electrode surface, is considered during one oscillatory cycle, then it can be shown that the displacement of the particle measured at the electrode surface performs a Brownian motion.

Rogozhin did this by finding the smallest known universal Turing machines at the time, both in terms of number of states and number of symbols.

The presented divider is based on a novel structure to overcome bandwidth limitations of traditional dynamic frequency divider design. On-wafer measurement shows that the divider operates with the input frequency from 528.0 GHz to 529.2 GHz with bias voltage tuning, while consuming P-DC <= 196 mW. A driver amplifier, integrated for testing purpose, dissipates 348 mW of dc power.

Parametric decay of parallel and oblique Alfven waves in the expanding solar wind	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS			English	Article							TURBULENCE-DRIVEN MODEL; FINITE-AMPLITUDE; RADIAL EVOLUTION; MHD TURBULENCE; INSTABILITY; ORIGIN; ECHO; MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS; DISCONTINUITIES; FLUCTUATIONS	The long-term evolution of large-amplitude Alfven waves propagating in the solar wind is investigated by performing two-dimensional MHD simulations within the expanding box model. The linear and nonlinear phases of the parametric decay instability are studied for both circularly polarized waves in parallel propagation and for arc-polarized waves in oblique propagation. The non-monochromatic case is also considered. In the oblique case, the direct excitation of daughter modes transverse to the local background field is found for the first time in an expanding environment, and this transverse cascade seems to be favored for monochromatic mother waves. The expansion effect reduces the instability growth rate, and it can even suppress its onset for the lowest frequency modes considered here, possibly explaining the persistence of these outgoing waves in the solar wind.

The methods combine a Lagrangian approach for the Vlasov solver with a fast spectral method for the solution of the Landau operator. To this goal, new modified spectral methods for the Landau integral which are capable to capture correctly the Maxwellian steady state are introduced. A particular care is devoted to the construction of Implicit-Explicit and Exponential Runge-Kutta methods that permit to achieve high-order and efficient time integration of the collisional step. Several numerical tests are reported which show the high accuracy of the numerical schemes here presented.

The impact of temperature vertical structure on trajectory modeling of stratospheric water vapor	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE LAYER; RADIO OCCULTATION; TRANSPORT; DEHYDRATION; SIMULATIONS; ATMOSPHERE; OZONE	Lagrangian trajectories driven by reanalysis meteorological fields are frequently used to study water vapor (H2O) in the stratosphere, in which the tropical cold-point temperatures regulate the amount of H2O entering the stratosphere. Therefore, the accuracy of temperatures in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is of great importance for understanding stratospheric H2O abundances. Currently, most reanalyses, such as the NASA MERRA (Modern Era Retrospective - analysis for Research and Applications), only provide temperatures with similar to 1.2 km vertical resolution in the TTL, which has been argued to miss finer vertical structure in the tropopause and therefore introduce uncertainties in our understanding of stratospheric H2O. In this paper, we quantify this uncertainty by comparing the Lagrangian trajectory prediction of H2O using MERRA temperatures on standard model levels (traj.MER-T) to those using GPS temperatures at finer vertical resolution (traj.GPS-T), and those using adjusted MERRA temperatures with finer vertical structures induced by waves (traj.MER-Twave). It turns out that by using temperatures with finer vertical structure in the tropopause, the trajectory model more realistically simulates the dehydration of air entering the stratosphere. But the effect on H2O abundances is relatively minor: compared with traj.MER-T, traj.GPS-T tends to dry air by similar to 0.1 ppmv, while traj.MER-Twave tends to dry air by 0.2-0.3 ppmv. Despite these differences in absolute values of predicted H2O and vertical dehydration patterns, there is virtually no difference in the interannual variability in different runs. Overall, we find that a tropopause temperature with finer vertical structure has limited impact on predicted stratospheric H2O.	[Wang, T.; Dessler, A.

Improving satellite-retrieved aerosol microphysical properties using GOCART data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MATTER COMPONENT CONCENTRATIONS; REMOTE-SENSING OBSERVATIONS; OPTICAL DEPTH; AIR-QUALITY; ANGSTROM EXPONENT; MINERAL DUST; AERONET; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; ABSORPTION	The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard the NASA Earth Observing System's Terra satellite can provide more reliable aerosol optical depth (AOD) and better constraints on particle size (Angstrom exponent, or ANG), sphericity, and single-scattering albedo (SSA) than many other satellite instruments. However, many aerosol mixtures pass the algorithm acceptance criteria, yielding a poor constraint, when the particle-type information in the MISR radiances is low, typically at low AOD. We investigate adding value to the MISR aerosol product under these conditions by filtering the list of MISR-retrieved mixtures based on agreement between the mixture ANG and absorbing AOD (AAOD) values, and simulated aerosol properties from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model. MISR-GOCART ANG difference and AAOD ratio thresholds for applying GOCART constraints were determined based on coincident AOD, ANG, and AAOD measurements from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). The results were validated by comparing the adjusted MISR aerosol optical properties over the contiguous USA between 2006 and 2009 with additional AERONET data. The correlation coefficient (r) between the adjusted MISR ANG derived from this study and AERONET improves to 0.45, compared to 0.29 for the MISR Version 22 standard product. The ratio of the adjusted MISR AAOD to AERONET increases to 0.74, compared to 0.5 for the MISR operational retrieval. These improvements occur primarily when AOD < 0.2 for ANG and AOD < 0.5 for AAOD. Spatial and temporal differences among the aerosol optical properties of MISR V22, GOCART, and the adjusted MISR are traced to (1) GOCART underestimation of AOD and ANG in polluted regions; (2) aerosol mixtures lacking in the MISR Version 22 algorithm climatology; (3) low MISR sensitivity to particle type under some conditions; and (4) parameters and thresholds used in our method.

Assessment of the consistency among global microwave land surface emissivity products	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SOIL-MOISTURE; AMSR-E; TEMPERATURE; ASSIMILATION; SENSITIVITY; VEGETATION	The goal of this work is to intercompare four global land surface emissivity products over various land-cover conditions to assess their consistency. The intercompared land emissivity products were generated over a 5-year period (2003-2007) using observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), and WindSat. First, all products were reprocessed in the same projection and spatial resolution as they were generated from sensors with various configurations. Then, the mean value and standard deviations of monthly emissivity values were calculated for each product to assess the spatial distribution of the consistencies/inconsistencies among the products across the globe. The emissivity products were also compared to soil moisture estimates and a satellite-based vegetation index to assess their sensitivities to changes in land surface conditions. Results show the existence of systematic differences among the products. Also, it was noticed that emissivity values in each product have similar frequency dependency over different land-cover types. Monthly means of emissivity values from AMSR-E in the vertical and horizontal polarizations seem to be systematically lower than the rest of the products across various land-cover conditions which may be attributed to the 01:30/13:30 LT overpass time of the sensor and possibly a residual skin temperature effect in the product. The standard deviation of the analyzed products was lowest (less than 0.01) in rain forest regions for all products and highest at northern latitudes, above 0.04 for AMSR-E and SSM/I and around 0.03 for WindSat. Despite differences in absolute emissivity estimates, all products were similarly sensitive to changes in soil moisture and vegetation. The correlation between the emissivity polarization differences and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values showed similar spatial distribution across the products, with values close to the unit except over densely vegetated and desert areas.

Cross-validation of IASI/MetOp derived tropospheric delta D with TES and ground-based FTIR observations	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; WATER-VAPOR; EMISSION SPECTROMETER; HDO/H2O; PROFILES; RETRIEVALS; RESOLUTION; H2O; SIMULATIONS; SATELLITE	The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) flying onboard MetOpA and MetOpB is able to capture fine isotopic variations of the HDO to H2O ratio (delta D) in the troposphere. Such observations at the high spatio-temporal resolution of the sounder are of great interest to improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling humidity in the troposphere. In this study we aim to empirically assess the validity of our error estimation previously evaluated theoretically. To achieve this, we compare IASI delta D retrieved profiles with other available profiles of delta D, from the TES infrared sounder onboard AURA and from three ground-based FTIR stations produced within the MUSICA project: the NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) sites Kiruna and Izana, and the TCCON site Karlsruhe, which in addition to near-infrared TCCON spectra also records mid-infrared spectra. We describe the achievable level of agreement between the different retrievals and show that these theoretical errors are in good agreement with empirical differences. The comparisons are made at different locations from tropical to Arctic latitudes, above sea and above land. Generally IASI and TES are similarly sensitive to delta D in the free troposphere which allows one to compare their measurements directly. At tropical latitudes where IASI's sensitivity is lower than that of TES, we show that the agreement improves when taking into account the sensitivity of IASI in the TES retrieval. For the comparison IASI-FTIR only direct comparisons are performed because the sensitivity profiles of the two observing systems do not allow to take into account their differences of sensitivity. We identify a quasi negligible bias in the free troposphere (-3 parts per thousand) between IASI retrieved delta D with the TES, which are bias corrected, but important with the ground-based FTIR reaching -47 parts per thousand. We also suggest that model-satellite observation comparisons could be optimized with IASI thanks to its high spatial and temporal sampling.

A MULTISCALE DATA-DRIVEN STOCHASTIC METHOD FOR ELLIPTIC PDEs WITH RANDOM COEFFICIENTS	MULTISCALE MODELING & SIMULATION			English	Article						stochastic partial differential equations; multiscale problems; data-driven methods; Karhunen-Loeve expansion; uncertainty quantification; model reduction	PARTIAL-DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; DYNAMICALLY BIORTHOGONAL METHOD; UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; MODEL-REDUCTION; COLLOCATION; SIMULATIONS; COMPUTATION; ALGORITHMS; DIFFUSION	In this paper, we propose a multiscale data-driven stochastic method (MsDSM) to study stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) in the multiquery setting. This method combines the advantages of the recently developed multiscale model reduction method [M. L. Ci, T. Y. Hou, and Z. Shi, ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 48 (2014), pp. 449-474] and the data-driven stochastic method (DSM) [M. L. Cheng et al., SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 1 (2013), pp. 452-493]. Our method consists of offline and online stages. In the offline stage, we decompose the harmonic coordinate into a smooth part and a highly oscillatory part so that the smooth part is invertible and the highly oscillatory part is small. Based on the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion of the smooth parts and oscillatory parts of the harmonic coordinates, we can derive an effective stochastic equation that can be well-resolved on a coarse grid. We then apply the DSM to the effective stochastic equation to construct a data-driven stochastic basis under which the stochastic solutions enjoy a compact representation for a broad range of forcing functions. In the online stage, we expand the SPDE solution using the data-driven stochastic basis and solve a small number of coupled deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs) to obtain the expansion coefficients. The MsDSM reduces both the stochastic and the physical dimensions of the solution. We have performed complexity analysis which shows that the MsDSM offers considerable savings over not only traditional methods but also DSM in solving multiscale SPDEs. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for several multiscale stochastic problems without scale separation.

The model is derived using the Wigner transform and Weyl quantization, and the central idea is to evolve the entire Wigner matrix rather than just the diagonal entries as was done previously in the adiabatic case. The off-diagonal entries of the Wigner matrix suitably describe the nonadiabatic transition, such as the Berry connection, for avoided crossings. We study the numerical approximation issues of the model, and then conduct numerical experiments to validate the model.

Similarly to other CNT foams, HCNT foams exhibit preconditioning effects in response to cyclic loading; however, their fundamental deformation mechanisms are unique. In quasistatic compression, HCNT foams exhibit strain localization and collective structural buckling, nucleating at different weak sections throughout their thickness. In dynamic compression, they undergo progressive crushing, governed by the intrinsic density gradient along the thickness of the sample. HCNT microbundles often undergo brittle fracture that originates from nanoscale defects. Regardless of this microstructural damage, bulk HCNT foams exhibit super-compressibility and recover more than 90% of large compressive strains (up to 80%). When subjected to striker impacts, HCNT foams mitigate impact stresses more effectively compared to other CNT foams comprised of non-helical CNTs (similar to 50% improvement). The unique mechanical properties we revealed demonstrate that the HCNT foams are ideally suited for applications in packaging, impact protection, and vibration mitigation.

In VCS data, each frame comes from first subsampling the original video data in space and then averaging the subsampled sequence in time. This results in a large linear system of equations whose inversion is ill-posed. We introduce a convex regularizer to invert the system, where the spatial component is regularized by the total variation seminorm, and the temporal component is regularized by enforcing sparsity on the difference between the spatial gradients of each frame. Since the regularizers are L-1 -like norms, the model can be written in the form of an easy-to-solve saddle point problem. The saddle point problem is solved by the primaldual algorithm, whose implementation calls for nearly pointwise operations (i.e., no direct linear inversion) and has a simple parallel version. Results show that our model decompresses videos more accurately than other popular models, with PSNR gains of several dB.

In the present study, we prepared, characterized, and evaluated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as carriers for epirubicin hydrochloride (EPI) in order to improve the antitumor efficacy of this drug. MSNs were prepared and functionalized with phosphonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyethylenimine-polyethylene glycol (PEI-PEG) groups. Different nanoparticulate formulations were loaded with Ell. The in vitro cytotoxicity and the in vivo antitumor efficacy of MSNs containing EPI were evaluated versus free EPI. The EPI release from nanoparticles was shown to be pH-dependent. The size of MSNs functionalized with polyethyleneimine-polyethylene glycol (MSN-PEI-PEG) was 123.8 +/- 4.8 nm. This formulation showed the best antitumor effects at an EPI dose of 9 mg/kg in C-26 colon carcinoma model. The biodistribution results proved that MSN-PEI-PEG-EPI had a higher tumor accumulation compared to free EPI, 3 h after drug administration. The results indicated that this formulation could be effective nanocarriers for anti-tumor therapies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a challenging environment to provide such services due to the resource constraints and the increased likelihood of nodes to be captured. Various key management techniques were proposed that trade off resilience to node capture and overhead in terms of communication and memory. We identify the main factors influencing the design space of key management protocols for sensor networks and describe representative protocols that trade off the number of links established, communication overhead, and resilience to node capture. These trade-offs are due to using direct, pathbased, or multipath-based communication to establish secure links. We propose a new multipath protocol relying on an encoding scheme tailored for WSNs and analyze the effects of key pre-distribution on multipath key establishment. We provide extensive simulations to understand the trade-offs between resilience to node compromise and communication overhead under numerous network scenarios. This comparison highlights the trade-offs between these vastly different key management schemes.

Stratospheric and mesospheric HO2 observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SOLAR SPECTRAL IRRADIANCE; DEFICIT PROBLEM; OZONE DEFICIT; MODEL; MLS; O-3; OH; ALGORITHMS; CHEMISTRY; H2O	This study introduces stratospheric and mesospheric hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) estimates from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) using an offline retrieval (i.e. run separately from the standard MLS algorithm). This new data set provides two daily zonal averages, one during daytime from 10 to 0.0032 hPa (using day-minus-night differences between 10 and 1 hPa to ameliorate systematic biases) and one during nighttime from 1 to 0.0032 hPa. The vertical resolution of this new data set varies from about 4 km at 10 hPa to around 14 km at 0.0032 hPa. A description of the methodology and an error analysis are presented. Comparisons against the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) and the Far Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS-2) measurements, as well as photochemical simulations, demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval and indicate that the retrieval is sensitive enough to detect mesospheric HO2 layers during both day and night. This new data set is the first long-term HO2 stratospheric and mesospheric satellite record and it provides needed constraints to help resolve the O-3 deficit problem and the "HOx dilemma".

Chiappinoite-(Y), Y2Mn(Si3O7)(4), a new layer silicate found in peralkaline syenitic ejecta from the Agua de Pau volcano, Azores	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY			English	Article						Chiappinoite-(Y); new mineral; crystal structure; layer silicate; rare-earth elements; Agua de Pau volcano; Azores	SAO-MIGUEL	Chiappinoite-(Y) (IMA2014-040), ideally Y2Mn(Si3O7)(4), is a new mineral found in peralkaline syenitic ejecta from the Agua de Pau volcano, San Miguel Island, Azores District, Portugal. It was discovered by collector Luigi Chiappino of Milan, Italy, after whom the mineral is named. It occurs as colourless, thin to thick prisms, up to 1 mm long, with blunt chisel-like terminations, and exhibits the forms {100}, (010}, {001}, {110} and {011}. Crystals are transparent with vitreous lustre. The Mohs hardness is about 6 and the mineral is brittle with uneven fracture and one perfect cleavage on {001}. The measured and calculated densities are 3.09(2) and 3.073 g/cm(3), respectively. Chiappinoite-(Y) is biaxial (-) and the refractive indices (white light) are alpha = 1.590(1), beta = 1.5978(10), gamma = 1.5982(10); 2V(meas) = 24(1)degrees and 2V(calc) = 25 degrees. The mineral exhibits no dispersion and is nonpleochroic. The optical orientation is X = c, Y = b, Z = a. The empirical formula on 28 0 apfu is (Y(1.17)Ce(0.18)Dy(0.10)Na(0.10)Nd(0.09)Er(0.08)La(0.07)G(0.07)Yb(0.06) Sm0.03Pr0.02)(Sigma 1.97)(Mn0.612+Ca0.25Fe0.092+)(Sigma 0.95) Si12.07O28. The eight strongest reflections in the X-ray diffraction pattern [d(obs). in angstrom (I) (hkl)] are: 9.84 (90) (002), 4.129 (52) (024), 3.977 (48) (114), 3.544 (100) (211,042,202), 3.203 (48) (222), 2.999 (71) (044,204), 2.478 (67) (310,046,206) and 2.065 (57) (multiple). The mineral is orthorhombic, Ibam, with a = 7.5549(3), b = 15.2342(5), c = 19.6418(14) angstrom, V = 2260.6(2) angstrom(3) and Z = 4. The structure of chiappinoite-(Y) contains 3-tetrahedra-thick silicate layers consisting of sinuous batisite-like chains, above and below which are four-membered silicate rings. Eight-coordinate Y and Mn sites are located between the silicate layers. The structure is essentially identical to that of the synthetic phases PrNaSi6O14 and NdNaSi6O14, except that the latter phases have an additional 12-coordinate Na site within the "cage" in the silicate layer.

J	Hoffman, PT; Postel-Vinay, G; Rosenthal, JL				Hoffman, Philip T.; Postel-Vinay, Gilles; Rosenthal, Jean-Laurent			Entry, information, and financial development: A century of competition between French banks and notaries'	EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY			English	Article						Financial markets; Banks; Intermediaries; Financial development; France	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MARKETS	Poorly developed financial markets are widely believed to block economic growth, because only modern financial intermediaries such as banks can mobilize large amounts of financial capital at low cost. This claim is supported by cross country regressions, but the regressions assume that credit intermediation is measured accurately before modern financial intermediaries arrive. If traditional intermediaries were mobilizing large amounts of financial capital before banks or other modern intermediaries appear, then the strength of the relationship between financial development and economic growth would be cast into doubt. Using an original panel dataset from nineteenth-century France, we provide the first estimates of how much financial capital key traditional intermediaries (notaries) were mobilizing for an entire economy during its first century of economic growth, and we analyze the lending that the notaries made possible in French mortgage market. The amount of capital they mobilized turns out to be large. We then analyze the effect that financial deepening had on the notaries as banks spread and find that the banks' and notaries' services were in all likelihood complements. The implication is that the link between financial development and economic growth may therefore be weaker than is assumed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Surging and plunging oscillations of an airfoil at low Reynolds number	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						aerodynamics; separated flows; vortex dynamics	IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD; HEAVING AIRFOIL; FLAT-PLATE; LIFT; GENERATION; MECHANISMS; FLOWS; WINGS; MODEL	We investigate the forces and unsteady flow structures associated with harmonic oscillations of an airfoil in the streamwise (surging) and transverse (plunging) directions in two-dimensional simulations at low Reynolds number. For the surging case, we show that there are specific frequencies where the wake instability synchronizes with the unsteady motion of the airfoil, leading to significant changes in the mean forces. Resonant behaviour of the time-averaged forces is observed near the vortex shedding frequency and its subharmonic; the behaviour is reminiscent of the dynamics of the generic nonlinear oscillator known as the Arnol'd tongue or the resonance horn. Below the wake instability frequency, there are two regimes where the fluctuating forces are amplified and attenuated, respectively. A detailed study of the flow structures associated with leading-edge vortex (LEV) growth and detachment are used to relate this behaviour with the LEV acting either in phase with the quasi-steady component of the forces for the amplification case, or out of phase for the attenuation case. Comparisons with wind tunnel measurements show that phenomenologically similar dynamics occur at higher Reynolds number. Finally, we show that qualitatively similar phenomena occur during both surging and plunging.

Dependence of the vertical distribution of bromine monoxide in the lower troposphere on meteorological factors such as wind speed and stability	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							OZONE DEPLETION EVENTS; ARCTIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; POLAR SUNRISE; BRO; SNOW; ACTIVATION; ICE; SPECTROSCOPY; DESTRUCTION	Multiple axis differential absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements of bromine monoxide (BrO) probed the vertical structure of halogen activation events during March-May 2012 at Barrow, Alaska. An analysis of the BrO averaging kernels and degrees of freedom obtained by optimal-estimation-based inversions from raw MAX-DOAS measurements reveals the information is best represented by reducing the retrieved BrO profile to two quantities: the integrated column from the surface through 200m (VCD200m), and the lower tropospheric vertical column density (LT-VCD), which represents the integrated column of BrO from the surface through 2 km. The percentage of lower tropospheric BrO in the lowest 200m was found to be highly variable ranging from shallow layer events, where BrO is present primarily in the lowest 200 m, to distributed column events where BrO is observed at higher altitudes. The highest observed LT-VCD events occurred when BrO was distributed throughout the lower troposphere, rather than concentrated near the surface. Atmospheric stability in the lowest 200m influenced the percentage of LT-VCD that is in the lowest 200 m, with inverted temperature structures having a first-to-third quartile range (Q1-Q3) of VCD200m/LT-VCD from 15-39 %, while near-neutral-temperature structures had a Q1-Q3 range of 7-13 %. Data from this campaign show no clear influence of wind speed on either lower tropospheric bromine activation (LT-VCD) or the vertical distribution of BrO, while examination of seasonal trends and the temperature dependence of the vertical distribution supported the conclusion that the atmospheric stability affects the vertical distribution of BrO.

Identifying fire plumes in the Arctic with tropospheric FTIR measurements and transport models	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							BIOMASS BURNING PLUMES; BOREAL FOREST-FIRES; POLLUTION TRANSPORT; TRACE GASES; ATMOSPHERIC BUDGETS; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; FTS OBSERVATION; TOTAL COLUMNS; EMISSIONS; HCN	We investigate Arctic tropospheric composition using ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar absorption spectra, recorded at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL, Eureka, Nunavut, Canada, 80 degrees 05'N, 86 degrees 42'W) and at Thule (Greenland, 76 degrees 53'N, -68 degrees 74'W) from 2008 to 2012. The target species, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), formic acid (HCOOH), and formaldehyde (H2CO) are emitted by biomass burning and can be transported from mid-latitudes to the Arctic. By detecting simultaneous enhancements of three biomass burning tracers (HCN, CO, and C2H6), ten and eight fire events are identified at Eureka and Thule, respectively, within the 5-year FTIR time series. Analyses of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model back-trajectories coupled with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspot data, Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model footprints, and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) UV aerosol index maps, are used to attribute burning source regions and travel time durations of the plumes. By taking into account the effect of aging of the smoke plumes, measured FTIR enhancement ratios were corrected to obtain emission ratios and equivalent emission factors. The means of emission factors for extratropical forest estimated with the two FTIR data sets are 0.40 +/- 0.21 g kg(-1) for HCN, 1.24 +/- 0.71 g kg(-1) for C2H6, 0.34 +/- 0.21 g kg(-1) for C2H2, and 2.92 +/- 1.30 g kg(-1) for HCOOH. The emission factor for CH3OH estimated at Eureka is 3.44 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1). To improve our knowledge concerning the dynamical and chemical processes associated with Arctic pollution from fires, the two sets of FTIR measurements were compared to the Model for OZone And Related chemical Tracers, version 4 (MOZART-4). Seasonal cycles and day-to-day variabilities were compared to assess the ability of the model to reproduce emissions from fires and their transport. Good agreement in winter confirms that transport is well implemented in the model. For C2H6, however, the lower wintertime concentration estimated by the model as compared to the FTIR observations highlights an underestimation of its emission. Results show that modeled and measured total columns are correlated (linear correlation coefficient r > 0.6 for all gases except for H2CO at Eureka and HCOOH at Thule), but suggest a general underestimation of the concentrations in the model for all seven tropospheric species in the high Arctic.

A new model for the global biogeochemical cycle of carbonyl sulfide - Part 1: Assessment of direct marine emissions with an oceanic general circulation and biogeochemistry model	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							AIR-SEA EXCHANGE; PHOTOCHEMICAL PRODUCTION; SURFACE WATERS; COEFFICIENTS; COS; DMS	The global budget of tropospheric carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is believed to be at equilibrium because background air concentrations have remained roughly stable over at least the last decade. Since the uptake of OCS by leaves (associated with photosynthesis) and soils have been revised significantly upwards recently, an equilibrated budget can only be obtained with a compensatory source of OCS. It has been assumed that the missing source of OCS comes from the low-latitude ocean, following the incident solar flux. The present work uses parameterizations of major production and removal processes of organic compounds in the NEMO-PISCES (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies) ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model to assess the marine source of OCS. In addition, the OCS photo-production rates computed with the NEMO-PISCES model were evaluated independently using the UV absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (derived from satellite ocean color data) and apparent quantum yields available in the literature. Our simulations show global direct marine emissions of OCS in the range of 5733997 GgS yr(-1), depending mostly on the quantification of the absorption rate of chromophoric dissolved organic matter. The high estimates of that range are unlikely, as they correspond to a formulation that most likely overestimate photo-production process. Low and medium (813 GgS yr(-1)) estimates derived from the NEMO-PISCES model are however consistent spatially and temporally with the suggested missing source of Berry et al.

Impacts of updated spectroscopy on thermal infrared retrievals of methane evaluated with HIPPO data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; TRANSFER MODEL LBLRTM; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS; CHEMICAL TRACERS; WATER-VAPOR; TES; SPACE; CH4; CO2	Errors in the spectroscopic parameters used in the forward radiative transfer model can introduce spatially, temporally, and altitude-dependent biases in trace gas retrievals. For well-mixed trace gases such as methane, where the variability of tropospheric mixing ratios is relatively small, reducing such biases is particularly important. We use aircraft observations from all five missions of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study to evaluate the impact of updates to spectroscopic parameters for methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O), and nitrous oxide (N2O) on thermal infrared retrievals of methane from the NASA Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES). We find that updates to the spectroscopic parameters for CH4 result in a substantially smaller mean bias in the retrieved CH4 when compared with HIPPO observations. After an N2O-based correction, the bias in TES methane upper tropospheric representative values for measurements between 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N decreases from 56.9 to 25.7 ppbv, while the bias in the lower tropospheric representative value increases only slightly (from 27.3 to 28.4 ppbv). For retrievals with less than 1.6 degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS), the bias is reduced from 26.8 to 4.8 ppbv. We also find that updates to the spectroscopic parameters for N2O reduce the errors in the retrieved N2O profile.	[Alvarado, M. J.; Cady-Pereira, K. E.; Hegarty, J.

While a variety of DNA nanotubes have been synthesized and employed as models for natural biopolymers, an extensive investigation of DNA nanotube kinetics and thermodynamics has been lacking. Using total internal reflection microscopy, DNA nanotube polymerization was monitored in real time at the single filament level over a wide range of free monomer concentrations and temperatures. The measured polymerization rates were subjected to a global nonlinear fit based on polymerization theory in order to simultaneously extract kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. For the DNA nanotubes used in this study, the association rate constant is (5.99 +/- 0.15) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1), the enthalpy is 87.9 +/- 2.0 kcal mol(-1), and the entropy is 0.252 +/- 0.006 kcal mol(-1) K-1. The qualitative and quantitative similarities between the kinetics of DNA nanotubes, actin filaments, and microtubules polymerization highlight the prospect of building complex dynamic systems from DNA molecules inspired by biological architecture.

For example, items in the visual field compete for processing resources, and attention controls their priority (biased competition). The inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of sensory signals yields another form of competition: distinct perceptual interpretations compete for access to awareness. Rivalry, where two equally likely percepts compete for dominance, explicates the latter form of competition. Building upon the similarity between attention and rivalry, we propose to model rivalry by a generic competitive circuit that is widely used in the attention literature-a winner-take-all (WTA) network. Specifically, we show that a network of two coupled WTA circuits replicates three common hallmarks of rivalry: the distribution of dominance durations, their dependence on input strength ("Levelt's propositions"), and the effects of stimulus removal (blanking). This model introduces a form of memory by forming discrete states and explains experimental data better than competitive models of rivalry without memory. This result supports the crucial role of memory in rivalry specifically and in competitive processes in general. Our approach unifies the seemingly distinct phenomena of rivalry, memory, and attention in a single model with competition as the common underlying principle.

Quantifying mass balance processes on the Southern Patagonia Icefield	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							NET ACCUMULATION RATES; GLACIAR JORGE MONTT; PIO-XI GLACIER; CHILEAN PATAGONIA; CALVING GLACIERS; MORENO GLACIER; PERITO MORENO; SATELLITE; RETREAT; CORE	We present surface mass balance simulations of the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI) driven by downscaled reanalysis data. The simulations were evaluated and interpreted using geodetic mass balances, measured point balances and a complete velocity field of the icefield for spring 2004. The high measured accumulation of snow of up to 15.4m w.e. yr(-1) (meters water equivalent per year) as well as the high measured ablation of up to 11m w.e. yr(-1) is reproduced by the model. The overall modeled surface mass balance was positive and increasing during 1975-2011. Subtracting the surface mass balance from geodetic balances, calving fluxes were inferred. Mass losses of the SPI due to calving were strongly increasing from 1975-2000 to 2000-2011 and higher than losses due to surface melt. Calving fluxes were inferred for the individual glacier catchments and compared to fluxes estimated from velocity data. Measurements of ice thickness and flow velocities at the glaciers' front and spatially distributed accumulation measurements can help to reduce the uncertainties of the different terms in the mass balance of the Southern Patagonia Icefield.

Decoupled Range and Orientation Sensing in Long-Range Magnetoquasistatic Positioning	IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS			English	Article						Electromagnetic fields; magnetoquasistatics; radio position measurement	IMAGE THEORY	A technique using magnetoquasistatic fields has been shown to enable accurate ranging in non-line-of-sight environments. Due to the nonlinear field coupling equations, the technique suffers when extended to 2-D and 3-D due to the coupling of range and orientation errors combined with the nonlinear convergence of the solution. Using a 2-axis transmit receive concept, a theory is presented to decouple range and orientation. The results are linear orientation-invariant ranging and linear range-invariant orientation sensing. Measurements inverted using the decoupled equations demonstrate peak orientation-invariant range errors of 0.2-0.4 m for a range of up to over 40 m, and peak range-invariant orientation errors of 1 degrees-7 degrees.

The branched CoP nanostructures were synthesized by reacting cobalt(II) acetylacetonate with trioctylphosphine in the presence of trioctylphosphine oxide. Electrodes comprised of the branched CoP nanostructures deposited at a loading density of similar to 1 mg cm(-2) on Ti electrodes required an overpotential of -117 mV to produce a current density of similar to 20 mA cm(-2) in 0.50 M H2SO4. Hence the branched CoP nanostructures belong to the growing family of highly active non-noble-metal HER electrocatalysts. Comparisons with related CoP systems have provided insights into the impact that shape-controlled nanoparticles and nanoparticle-electrode interactions have on the activity and stability of nanostructured HER electrocatalysts.

However, current electrocatalysts are not adequate (high overpotential, lack of selectivity toward O-2 production, catalyst degradation). We propose here mechanistic guidelines for experimental examination of modified catalysts based on the dependence of kinetic rates on the solvent dielectric constant. To illustrate the procedure we consider the fcc(111) platinum surface and show that the individual steps for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) change systematically with the polarizability of the medium. Thus changing this environmental variable can be used to tune the rate determining steps and the barriers, providing a means for screening and validating new systems to optimize the rate determining steps for the ORR and OER reaction pathways.

The device dark current stays diffusion limited in the 150K-325K temperature range and becomes dominated by generation-recombination processes at lower temperatures.

New technologies are enabling the detection, transmission, and storage of data of hitherto unimaginable quantity and quality across the electromagnetic, gravity and particle spectra. The observational data obtained during this decade alone will supersede everything accumulated over the preceding four thousand years of astronomy. Currently there are 4 large-scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys underway, each generating and/or utilizing hundreds of terabytes of data per year. Some will focus on the static universe while others will greatly expand our knowledge of transient phenomena. Maximizing the science from these programs requires integrating the processing pipeline with high-performance computing resources. These are coupled to large astrophysics databases while making use of machine learning algorithms with near real-time turnaround.

From these computed delays, the delay of any path can be calculated. Moreover, a comparison of the fine-grained delays allows a detailed understanding of the amount and type of process variation that exists in the FPGA. To obtain these delays, Timing Extraction measures, using only resources already available in the FPGA, the delay of a small subset of the total paths in the FPGA. We apply Timing Extraction to the Logic Array Block (LAB) on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA to obtain a view of the delay down to near-individual LUT SRAM cell granularity, characterizing components with delays on the order of tens to a few hundred picoseconds with a resolution of +/- 3.2ps, matching the expected error bounds. This information reveals that the. 65nm process used has, on average, random variation of sigma/mu = 4.0% with components having an average maximum spread of 83ps. Timing Extraction also shows that as V-DD decreases from 1.2V to 0.9V in a Cyclone IV 60nm FPGA, paths slow down, and variation increases from sigma/mu = 4.3% to 5.8%, a clear indication that lowering VDD magnifies the impact of random variation.

The SPectrometre InfraRouge d'Absorption a Lasers Embarques (SPIRALE) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) balloon-borne instruments have flown in the tropics and in the polar Arctic, and ground-based measurements have been performed by the Qualite de l'Air (QualAir) Fourier Transform Spectrometer in Paris. Partial and total columns and vertical profiles have been obtained to study OCS variability with altitude, latitude, and season. The annual total column variation in Paris reveals a seasonal variation with a maximum in April-June and a minimum in November-January. Total column measurements above Paris and from SWIR balloon-borne instrument are compared with several MkIV measurements, several Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) stations, aircraft, ship, and balloon measurements to highlight the OCS total column decrease from tropical to polar latitudes. OCS high-resolution in situ vertical profiles have been measured for the first time in the altitude range between 14 and 30 km at tropical and polar latitudes. OCS profiles are compared with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) satellite measurements and show good agreement. Using the correlation between OCS and N2O from SPIRALE, the OCS stratospheric lifetime has been accurately determined. We find a stratospheric lifetime of 68 +/- 20 years at polar latitudes and 58 +/- 14 years at tropical latitudes leading to a global stratospheric sink of 49 +/- 14 Gg S y(-1).

Static Laboratory Earthquake Measurements with the Digital Image Correlation Method	EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS			English	Article						Digital image correlation; Dynamic rupture; Earthquake mechanics; Remote sensing	STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS; SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS; GROUND MOTION; STRESS-FIELDS; CRACK-GROWTH; PULSE-LIKE; DEFORMATION; NUCLEATION; RUPTURES; STRAIN	Mapping full-field displacement and strain changes on the Earth's surface following an earthquake is of paramount importance to enhance our understanding of earthquake mechanics. Currently, aerial and satellite images taken pre- and post-earthquake can be processed with sub-pixel correlation algorithms to infer the co-seismic ground deformations (e.g., [1, 2]). However, the interpretation of this data is not straightforward due to the inherent complexity of natural faults and deformation fields. To gain understanding into rupture mechanics and to help interpret complex rupture features occurring in nature, we develop a laboratory earthquake setup capable of reproducing displacement and strain maps similar to those obtained in the field, while maintaining enough simplicity so that clear conclusions can be drawn. Earthquakes are mimicked in the laboratory by dynamic rupture propagating along an inclined frictional interface formed by two Homalite plates under compression (e.g., [3]). In our study, the interface is partially glued, in order to confine the rupture before it reaches the ends of the specimen. The specimens are painted with a speckle pattern to provide the surface with characteristic features for image matching. Images of the specimens are taken before and after dynamic rupture with a 4 Megapixels resolution CCD camera. The digital images are analyzed with two software packages for sub-pixel correlation: VIC-2D (Correlated Solutions Inc.) and COSI-Corr [1]. Both VIC-2D and COSI-Corr are able to characterize the full-field static displacement of the experimentally produced dynamic shear ruptures. The correlation analysis performed with either software clearly shows (i) the relative displacement (slip) along the frictional interface, (ii) the rupture arrest on the glued boundaries, and (iii) the presence of wing cracks. The obtained displacement measurements are converted to strains, using non-local de-noising techniques; stresses are obtained by introducing Homalite's constitutive properties. This study is a first step towards using the digital image correlation method in combination with high-speed photography to capture the highly transient phenomena involved in dynamic rupture.

Diffraction-Assisted Image Correlation for Three-Dimensional Surface Profiling	EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS			English	Article						Digital image correlation; Diffraction; Surface profile measurement; Image distortion calibration	SHAPE MEASUREMENT; DISPLACEMENT; RECONSTRUCTION; STRAIN; DEPTH	The recently developed Diffraction-Assisted Image Correlation (DAIC) method (Xia et al. Exp Mech 53(5):755-765, 2013) provides a simple and accurate means for three-dimensional (3D) full-field deformation measurement. In the DAIC method, a test specimen is viewed through a transmission diffraction grating, resulting in multiple diffracted views of the same specimen that encode 3D geometric information. Here, we extend the original DAIC method to permit quantitative measurement of 3D surface profiles. We show, through a pinhole projection model, that the 3D shape of an object surface can be reconstructed by simply performing two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) analysis between the negative and positive first-order diffracted views. Test results on a Barbie doll's face and a set of well-defined cylindrical, conical and step surfaces are presented to illustrate the implementation and performance of the proposed surface profiling method.

Sensitivity of top-down CO source estimates to the modeled vertical structure in atmospheric CO	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CARBON-MONOXIDE; ISOPRENE EMISSIONS; GEOS-CHEM; CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT; SATELLITE DATA; ADJOINT; MOPITT; ASSIMILATION; INSTRUMENT; CONSTRAINT	We assessed the sensitivity of regional CO source estimates to the modeled vertical CO distribution by assimilating multi-spectral MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution In The Troposphere) V5J CO retrievals with the GEOS-Chem model. We compared the source estimates obtained by assimilating the CO profiles and the surface layer retrievals from June 2004 to May 2005. Because the surface layer retrievals are less sensitive to CO in the free troposphere, it is expected that they should provide constraints in the CO source estimates that are less sensitive to the vertical structure of CO in the free troposphere. The inferred source estimates all suggest a reduction in CO emissions in the tropics and subtropics, and an increase in the extratropics over the a priori estimates. The tropical decreases were particularly pronounced for regions where the biogenic source of CO was dominant, suggesting an overestimate of the a priori isoprene source of CO in the model. We found that the differences between the regional source estimates inferred from the profile and surface layer retrievals for 2004-2005 were small, generally less than 10% for the main continental regions, except for estimates for southern Asia, North America, and Europe. Because of discrepancies in convective transport in the model, the CO source estimates for India and southeastern Asia inferred from the CO profiles were significantly higher than those estimated from the surface layer retrievals during June-August 2004. On the other hand, the profile inversion underestimated the CO emissions from North America and Europe compared to the assimilation of the surface layer retrievals. We showed that vertical transport of air from the North American and European boundary layers is slower than from other continental regions, and thus air in the free troposphere from North America and Europe in the model is more chemically aged, which could explain the discrepancy between the source estimates inferred from the profile and surface layer retrievals. We also examined the impact of the OH distribution on the source estimates and found that the discrepancies between the source estimates obtained with two OH fields were larger when using the profile data, which is consistent with greater sensitivity to the more chemically aged air in the free troposphere. Our findings indicate that regional CO source estimates are sensitive to the vertical CO structure. They suggest that diagnostics to assess the age of air from the continental source regions should help interpret the results from CO source inversions. Our results also suggest that assimilating a broader range of composition measurements to provide better constraint on tropospheric OH and the biogenic sources of CO is essential for reliable quantification of the regional CO budget.

We map variations in present-day lithospheric structure across the region using Ps and Sp receiver functions at permanent stations of the Southern California Seismic Network as well as ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) data gathered by the Asthenospheric and Lithospheric Broadband Architecture from the California Offshore Region Experiment (ALBACORE), which enhances coverage of the borderland and provides first direct constraints on the structure of the Pacific plate west of the Patton Escarpment. Noisiness of OBS data makes strict handpicking and bandpass filtering necessary in order to obtain interpretable receiver functions. Using H-kappa and common-conversion point stacking, we find pronounced lithospheric differences across structural blocks, which we interpret as indicating that the Outer Borderland has been translated with little to no internal deformation, while the Inner Borderland underwent significant lithospheric thinning, most likely related to accommodating the 90 degrees clockwise rotation of the Western Transverse Range block. West of the Patton Escarpment, we find that the transition to typical oceanic crustal thickness takes place over a lateral distance of similar to 50 km. We detect an oceanic seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere transition at 58 km depth west of the Patton Escarpment, consistent with only weak age-dependence of the depth to the seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere transition. Sp common-conversion point stacks confirm wholesale lithospheric thinning of the Inner Borderland and suggest the presence of a slab fragment beneath the Outer Borderland.

Measurements are made on correlation functions of the ambient seismic wavefield at 2-8 Hz recorded by a dense array at the site of the Pinon Flat Observatory, Southern California. The key observation is the dependence of the response on the component of wave motion and coda lapse time . Measurements on the vertical correlation component indicate reduced wave speeds during periods of volumetric compression, whereas data from horizontal components show the opposite behavior, compatible with previous observations. These effects are amplified by the directional sensitivities of the different surface wave types constituting the early coda of vertical and horizontal correlation components to the anisotropic behavior of the compliant layer. The decrease of the velocity (volumetric) strain sensitivity S with indicates that this response is constrained to shallow depths. The observed velocity dependence on strain implies nonlinear behavior, but conclusions regarding elasticity are more ambiguous. The anisotropic response is possibly associated with inelastic dilatancy of the unconsolidated, low-velocity material above the granitic basement. However, equal polarity of vertical component velocity changes and deformation in the vertical direction indicate that a nonlinear Poisson effect is similarly compatible with the observed response pattern. Peak relative velocity changes at small are 0.03%, which translates into an absolute velocity strain sensitivity of S approximate to 5 x 10(3) and a stress sensitivity of 0.5 MPa-1. The potentially evolving velocity strain sensitivity of crustal and fault zone materials can be studied with the method introduced here.

GPS as an independent measurement to estimate terrestrial water storage variations in Washington and Oregon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						GPS; water variation; Washington; Oregon; time-variable water change	ELASTIC RESPONSE; EARTH; DEFORMATION; CALIFORNIA; ASSIMILATION; MASS; HARMONICS; SYSTEM; MODEL; ZONE	The Global Positioning System (GPS) measures elastic ground loading deformation in response to hydrological mass variations on or near Earth's surface. We present a time series of change in terrestrial water storage as a function of position in Washington and Oregon estimated using GPS measurements of vertical displacement of Earth's surface. The distribution of water variation inferred from GPS is highly correlated with physiographic provinces: the seasonal water is mostly located in the mountain areas, such as the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains, and is much smaller in the basin and valley areas of the Columbia Basin and Harney Basin. GPS is proven to be an independent measurement to distinguish between hydrological models. The drought period of 2008-2010 (maximum in 2010) and the recovery period of 2011-2012 in the Cascade Range are well recovered with GPS-determined time-variable monthly water mass series. The GPS-inferred water storage variation in the Cascade Range is consistent with that derived from JPL's GRACE monthly mass grid solutions. The percentage of RMS reduction is similar to 62% when we subtract GRACE water series from GPS-derived results. GPS-determined water storage variations can fill gaps in the current GRACE mission, also in the transition period from the current GRACE to the future GRACE Follow-on missions. We demonstrate that the GPS-inferred water storage variations can determine and verify local scaling factors for GRACE measurements; in the Cascade Range, the RMS reduction between GRACE series scaled by GPS and scaled by the hydrological model-based GRACE Tellus gain factors is up to 90.5%.

Effects of two large solar energetic particle events on middle atmosphere nighttime odd hydrogen and ozone content: Aura/MLS and TIMED/SABER measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						SEP; middle atmosphere; ozone destruction; odd hydrogen	PROTON EVENTS; JANUARY 2005; INTERPLANETARY SHOCKS; PRECIPITATION EVENTS; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; ION CHEMISTRY; SEP EVENTS; SATELLITE; CYCLE; DEPENDENCE	It is well established that large solar energetic particle (SEP) events affect ozone in the middle atmosphere through chemical reactions involving odd hydrogen (HOx) species. We analyze global middle atmospheric effects at local nighttime for two large SEP events during the intervals of 7-17 November 2004 and 20-30 August 2005. Properties of the SEP events and concomitant geomagnetic storms are discussed using in situ measurements. Temporal dynamics and latitudinal distribution of HOx and ozone densities inferred from measurements by the Aura/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) instrument are analyzed. We show statistically significant increases of nighttime hydroxyl (OH) density in the middle atmosphere up to 5 degrees 10(6)cm(-3) in the latitude range from 70 degrees down to 50 degrees latitude in northern and to -40 degrees latitude in southern hemispheres in connection with peaks in proton fluxes of >10MeV energy range measured by GOES spacecraft. During the storm main phases, the nighttime OH density increases were observed around 50 degrees in southern and northern hemispheres in the altitude range of 65-80km. There is a correspondence between averaged nighttime OH partial column density (in 0.005 to 0.1hPa pressure range) in the polar latitudes and energetic proton (>10MeV) fluxes. Corresponding statistically significant nighttime ozone destructions up to 45% are observed from 70 degrees down to 60 degrees latitude in the northern and southern hemispheres. The SEP impulsive phases correspond to onsets of ozone density depletions. Larger relative ozone destructions are observed in the northern hemisphere in November and in the southern hemisphere in August. Simultaneous measurements of ozone density by the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics/Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) instrument independently confirm the MLS results.

Plasmaspheric hiss properties: Observations from Polar	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						plasmasphere; hiss; Polar	WAVE DISTRIBUTION-FUNCTIONS; DISCRETE CHORUS EMISSIONS; OBSERVED ONBOARD GEOS-1; ELF HISS; PARTICLE INTERACTIONS; SUDDEN COMMENCEMENTS; GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; PONDEROMOTIVE FORCE; MAGNETIC DECREASES; ALFVEN WAVES	In the region between L=2 to 7 at all Magnetic Local Time (MLTs) plasmaspheric hiss was detected 32% of the time. In the limited region of L=3 to 6 and 15 to 21 MLT (dusk sector), the wave percentage detection was the highest (51%). The latter plasmaspheric hiss is most likely due to energetic similar to 10-100 keV electrons drifting into the dusk plasmaspheric bulge region. On average, plasmaspheric hiss intensities are an order of magnitude larger on the dayside than on the nightside. Plasmaspheric hiss intensities are considerably more intense and coherent during high-solar wind ram pressure intervals. A hypothesis for this is generation of dayside chorus by adiabatic compression of preexisting 10-100keV outer magnetospheric electrons in minimum B pockets plus chorus propagation into the plasmasphere. In large solar wind pressure events, it is hypothesized that plasmaspheric hiss can also be generated inside the plasmasphere. These new generation mechanism possibilities are in addition to the well-established mechanism of plasmaspheric hiss generation during substorms and storms. Plasmaspheric hiss under ordinary conditions is of low coherency, with small pockets of several cycles of coherent waves. During high-solar wind ram pressure intervals (positive SYM-H intervals), plasmaspheric hiss and large L hiss can have higher intensities and be coherent. Plasmaspheric hiss in these cases is typically found to be propagating obliquely to the ambient magnetic field with (kB0) similar to 30 degrees to 40 degrees. Hiss detected at large L has large amplitudes (similar to 0.2nT) and propagates obliquely to the ambient magnetic field ((kB0) similar to 70 degrees) with 2:1 ellipticity ratios. A series of schematics for plasmaspheric hiss generation is presented.

Localized thermosphere ionization events during the high-speed stream interval of 29 April to 5 May 2011	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						thermosphere; ionosphere; aurora; HSS; particle precipitation	SOLAR-WIND STREAMS; GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; RADIATION BELT; ATOMIC OXYGEN; NITRIC-OXIDE; STORMS; DENSITY; ENERGY; IONOSPHERE	We analyze localized ionospheric-thermospheric (IT) events in response to external driving by a high-speed stream (HSS) during the ascending phase of the Solar Cycle 24. The HSS event occurred from 29 April to 5 May, 2011. The HSS itself (and not the associated corotating interaction region) caused a moderate geomagnetic storm with peak SYM-H=-55 nT and prolonged auroral activity. We analyze TIMED (Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics)/SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) measurements of nitric oxide (NO) cooling emission during the interval as a measure of thermospheric response to auroral heating. We identify several local cooling emission (LCE) events in high to subauroral latitudes. Individual cooling emission profiles during these LCE events are enhanced at ionospheric E layer altitudes. For the first time, we present electron density profiles in the vicinity of the LCE events using collocated COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate) radio occultation (RO) measurements. Measurements at local nighttime show the formation of an enhanced E layer (about 2.5 times increase over the undisturbed value) at 100km altitude. Daytime electron density profiles show relatively smaller enhancements in the E layer. We suggest that the IT response is due to additional ionization caused by medium energy electron (>10keV) precipitation into the subauroral to high-latitude atmosphere associated with geomagnetic activity during the HSS event.

Antarctic radio frequency albedo and implications for cosmic ray reconstruction	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						Antarctica; surface roughness; albedo; interferometry; cosmic ray	ULTRAHIGH-ENERGY NEUTRINOS	We describe herein a measurement of the Antarctic surface roughness performed by the balloon-borne ANITA (Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna) experiment. Originally purposed for cosmic ray astrophysics, the radio frequency (RF) receiver ANITA gondola, from its 38 km altitude vantage point, can scan a disk of snow surface 600 km in radius. The primary purpose of ANITA is to detect RF emissions from cosmic rays incident on Antarctica, such as neutrinos which penetrate through the atmosphere and interact within the ice, resulting in signal directed upward which then refracts at the ice-air interface and up and out to ANITA, or high-energy nuclei (most likely irons or protons), which interact in the upper atmosphere (at altitudes below ANITA) and produce a spray of down-coming RF which reflects off the snow surface and back up to the gondola. The energy of such high-energy nuclei can be inferred from the observed reflected signal only if the surface reflectivity is known. We describe herein an attempt to quantify the Antarctic surface reflectivity, using the Sun as a constant, unpolarized RF source. We find that the reflectivity of the surface generally follows the expectations from the Fresnel equations, lending support to the use of those equations to give an overall correction factor to calculate cosmic ray energies for all locations in Antarctica. The analysis described below is based on ANITA-II data. After launching from McMurdo Station in December 2008, ANITA-II was aloft for a period of 31 days with a typical instantaneous duty cycle exceeding 95%.	[Besson, D.

The project progresses at a rate that depends on the agents' efforts, and it generates a pay-off upon completion. I show that agents work harder the closer the project is to completion, and members of a larger team work harder than members of a smaller team-both individually and on aggregate-if and only if the project is sufficiently far from completion. I apply these results to determine the optimal size of a self-organized partnership, and to study the manager's problem who recruits agents to carry out a project, and must determine the team size and its members' incentive contracts. The main results are: (i) that the optimal symmetric contract compensates the agents only upon completing the project; and (ii) the optimal team size decreases in the expected length of the project.

Pressure-Dependent, Infrared-Emitting Phenomenon in Hypervelocity Impact	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							INDUCED VAPOR CLOUDS; AMBIENT ATMOSPHERE	A series of hypervelocity impact experiments were conducted with variable target chamber atmospheric pressure ranging from 0.9 to 21.5 Torr. Using a two-stage light-gas gun, 5.7 mg nylon 6/6 right-cylinders were accelerated to speeds ranging between 6.0 and 6.3 km/s to impact 1.5 mm thick 6061-T6 aluminum plates. Full-field images of near-IR emission (0.9 to 1.7 mu m) were measured using a high-speed spectrograph system with image exposure times of 1 mu s. The radial expansion of an IR-emitting impact-generated phenomenon was observed to be dependent upon the ambient target chamber atmospheric pressures. Higher chamber pressures demonstrated lower radial expansions of the subsequently measured IR-emitting region uprange of the target. Dimensional analysis, originally presented by Taylor to describe the expansion of a hemispherical blast wave, is applied to describe the observed pressure-dependence of the IR-emitting cloud expansion. Experimental results are used to empirically determine two dimensionless constants for the analysis. The maximum radial expansion of the observed IR-emitting cloud is described by the Taylor blast-wave theory, with experimental results demonstrating the characteristic nonlinear dependence on atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, the edges of the measured IR-emitting clouds are observed to expand at extreme speeds ranging from approximately 13 to 39 km/s. In each experiment, impact ejecta and debris are simultaneously observed in the visible range using an ultrahigh-speed laser shadowgraph system. For the considered experiments, ejecta and debris speeds are measured between 0.6 and 5.1 km/s.

J	Bokelmann, KA; Russell, RP; Lantoine, G				Bokelmann, Kevin A.; Russell, Ryan P.; Lantoine, Gregory			Periodic Orbits and Equilibria Near Jovian Moons Using an Electrodynamic Tether	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							PLANETARY MOONS; 3-BODY PROBLEM; STABILITY; JUPITER; EUROPA; PLANAR; POWER	Various researchers have proposed the use of electrodynamic tethers for power generation and capture from interplanetary transfers. In this paper, the effect of tether forces on periodic orbits in the Jupiter-Io system is investigated. A series of simplifications to the Lorentz force-perturbed circular-restricted three-body problem allows the development of a conservative formulation that admits a Jacobi integral. Although the conservative approximation introduces a modest magnitude error in the regions of interest, the correct perturbation direction is preserved. The presence of the Jacobi integral is amenable to the search for equilibria, periodic orbits, and the use of dynamic tools such as zero-velocity curves. The perturbed equations of motion lead to modified equilibrium positions, which are found at both Io and Metis. New families of modified Lyapunov orbits are generated at Io as functions of tether size and Jacobi integral from preexisting families as well as the new modified equilibrium points. Stability analyses are used to evaluate the dynamical properties of tether-modified orbits, and several stable orbits are identified. Multiple new families are archived with unique dynamical properties, including orbits with multiple loops and orbits that directly lead the moon.

Gradient dopant profiling and spectral utilization of monolithic thin-film silicon photoelectrochemical tandem devices for solar water splitting	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; CELL; SI; OPTIMIZATION	A cost-effective and earth-abundant photocathode based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) is demonstrated to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar energy. A monolithic a-SiC:H photoelectrochemical (PEC) cathode integrated with a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-SiC:H)/nano-crystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) double photovoltaic (PV) junction achieved a current density of -5.1 mA cm(-2) at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The a-SiC:H photocathode used no hydrogen-evolution catalyst and the high current density was obtained using gradient boron doping. The growth of high quality nc-Si:H PV junctions in combination with optimized spectral utilization was achieved using glass substrates with integrated micro-textured photonic structures. The performance of the PEC/PV cathode was analyzed by simulations using Advanced Semiconductor Analysis (ASA) software.	[Han, Lihao; Buijs, Thom W. F.; Zeman, Miro; Smets, Arno H.

Updated Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Ozone Monitoring Instrument (SAO OMI) formaldehyde retrieval	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MAX-DOAS OBSERVATIONS; ROTATIONAL RAMAN-SCATTERING; ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; COLUMNS; GOME; SCIAMACHY; PRESSURE	We present and discuss the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) formaldehyde (H2CO) retrieval algorithm for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) which is the operational retrieval for NASA OMI H2CO. The version of the algorithm described here includes relevant changes with respect to the operational one, including differences in the reference spectra for H2CO, the fit of O-2-O-2 collisional complex, updates in the high-resolution solar reference spectrum, the use of a model reference sector over the remote Pacific Ocean to normalize the retrievals, an updated air mass factor (AMF) calculation scheme, and the inclusion of scattering weights and vertical H2CO profile in the level 2 products. The setup of the retrieval is discussed in detail. We compare the results of the updated retrieval with the results from the previous SAO H2CO retrieval. The improvement in the slant column fit increases the temporal stability of the retrieval and slightly reduces the noise. The change in the AMF calculation has increased the AMFs by 20 %, mainly due to the consideration of the radiative cloud fraction. Typical values for retrieved vertical columns are between 4 x 10(15) and 4 x 10(16) moleculescm(-2), with typical fitting uncertainties ranging between 45 and 100 %. In high-concentration regions the errors are usually reduced to 30 %. The detection limit is estimated at 1 x 10(16) moleculescm(-2).	[Abad, G.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2): spectrometer performance evaluation using pre-launch direct sun measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTROMETER; GASES OBSERVING SATELLITE; CO2 RETRIEVAL; VALIDATION	The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), launched on 2 July 2014, is a NASA mission designed to measure the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction, X-CO2. Towards that goal, it will collect spectra of reflected sunlight in narrow spectral ranges centered at 0.76, 1.6 and 2.0 mu m with a resolving power (lambda/Delta lambda) of 20 000. These spectra will be used in an optimal estimation framework to retrieve X-CO2. About 100 000 cloud free soundings of X-CO2 each day will allow estimates of net CO2 fluxes on regional to continental scales to be determined. Here, we evaluate the OCO-2 spectrometer performance using pre-launch data acquired during instrument thermal vacuum tests in April 2012. A heliostat and a diffuser plate were used to feed direct sunlight into the OCO-2 instrument and spectra were recorded. These spectra were compared to those collected concurrently from a nearby high-resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer that was part of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Using the launch-ready OCO-2 calibration and spectroscopic parameters, we performed total column scaling fits to all spectral bands and compared these to TCCON results. On 20 April, we detected a CO2 plume from the Los Angeles basin at the JPL site with strongly enhanced short-term variability on the order of 1% (3-4 ppm). We also found good (< 0.5 ppm) inter-footprint consistency in retrieved X-CO2. The variations in spectral fitting residuals are consistent with signal-to-noise estimates from instrument calibration, while average residuals are systematic and mostly attributable to remaining errors in our knowledge of the CO2 and O-2 spectroscopic parameters. A few remaining inconsistencies observed during the tests may be attributable to the specific instrument setup on the ground and will be re-evaluated with in-orbit data.

The framework structure is determined from a combination of rotation electron diffraction and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. The structure has 10 crystallographically unique tetrahedral atoms (T-atoms) in the unit cell, and can be described as an ordered arrangement of the [4(2)5(4)6(2)] mtw building unit and a previously unreported [4(4)5(2)] building unit. The framework contains a 2-dimensional pore system that is bounded by 10 T-atom rings (10-ring, 5.1 angstrom x 6.2 angstrom opening) that are connected with oval 8-rings (2.9 angstrom x 5.5 angstrom opening) through medium-sized cavities (similar to 7.9 angstrom) at the channel intersections. CIT-7 can be synthesized over a broad range of compositions including pure-silica and heteroatom, e.g., aluminosilicate and titanosilicate, containing variants.

Desorption electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify intermediates of the catalytic cycle and delineate differences in substrate reactivity. Our findings provide evidence for the catalytic cycle proceeding through formation of an arylpalladium(II) cation, subsequent formation of an arylpalladium-enone complex, and, ultimately, formation of the new C-C bond. Reaction monitoring in both positive and negative ion modes revealed that 4-iodophenylboronic acid formed a relatively stable trimeric species under the reaction conditions.

Continued Fraction Digit Averages and Maclaurin's Inequalities	EXPERIMENTAL MATHEMATICS			English	Article						continued fractions; metric theory of continued fractions; arithmetic mean; geometric mean; AM-GM inequality; Maclaurin's inequalities; phase transition; quadratic surds		A classical result of Khinchin says that for almost all real numbers a, the geometric mean of the first n digits a(i) (alpha) in the continued fraction expansion of alpha converges to a number K approximate to 2.6854520 ... (Khinchin's constant) as n -> infinity. On the other hand, for almost all alpha, the arithmetic mean of the first n continued fraction digits a(i) (alpha) approaches infinity as n -> infinity. There is a sequence of refinements of the AM-GM inequality, Maclaurin's inequalities, relating the 1/kth powers of the kth elementary symmetric means of n numbers for 1 <= k <= n. On the left end (when k = n), we have the geometric mean, and on the right end (k = 1), we have the arithmetic mean. We analyze what happens to the means of continued fraction digits of a typical real number in the limit as one moves f (n) steps away from either extreme. We prove sufficient conditions on f (n) to ensure divergence when one moves f (n) steps away from the arithmetic mean and convergence when one moves f (n) steps away from the geometric mean. We show for almost all alpha and appropriate k as a function of n that S(alpha, n, k)(1/k) is of order log(n/k). For typical alpha, we find the limit for f (n) = cn, 0 < c < 1. We also study the limiting behavior of such means for quadratic irrational alpha, providing rigorous results, as well as numerically supported conjectures.

When presented with two carbon sources, microorganisms first consume the carbon substrate that supports the highest growth rate (e.g., glucose) and then switch to the secondary carbon source (e.g., galactose), a paradigm known as the Monod model. Sequential sugar utilization has been attributed to transcriptional repression of the secondary metabolic pathway, followed by activation of this pathway upon depletion of the preferred carbon source. In this work, we demonstrate that although Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells consume glucose before galactose, the galactose regulatory pathway is activated in a fraction of the cell population hours before glucose is fully consumed. This early activation reduces the time required for the population to transition between the two metabolic programs and provides a fitness advantage that might be crucial in competitive environments.

In this study, we tested a futuristic parameter, lesion flow coefficient (LFC, defined as the ratio of percent coronary area stenosis (% AS) to the square root of the ratio of the pressure drop across the stenosis to the dynamic pressure in the throat region), that combines both the anatomical (% AS) and functional measurements (pressure and flow) for application in a clinical setting. In 51 vessels, simultaneous pressure and flow readings were obtained using a 0.014. Combowire (Volcano Corporation). Anatomical details were assessed using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow reserve (CFR), hyperemic stenosis resistance index (HSR), and hyperemic microvascular index (HMR) were obtained at baseline and adenosine-induced hyperemia. QCA data were corrected for the presence of guidewire and then the LFC values were calculated. LFC was correlated with FFR, CFR, HSR, and HMR, individually and in combination with % AS, under both baseline and hyperemic conditions. Further, in 5 vessels, LFC group mean values were compared between pre-PCI and post-PCI groups. P<.05 was considered statistically significant. LFC measured at hyperemia correlated significantly when the pressure-based FFR, flow-based CFR, and anatomically measured % AS were combined (r = 0.64; P<.05). Similarly, LFC correlated significantly when HSR, HMR, and % AS were combined (r = 0.72; P<.05). LFC was able to significantly distinguish between pre-PCI and post-PCI groups (0.42 +/- 0.05 and 0.05 +/- 0.004, respectively; P<.05). Similar results were obtained for the LFC at baseline conditions. LFC, a futuristic parameter that combines both the anatomical and functional endpoints, has potential for application in a clinical setting for stenosis evaluation, under both hyperemic and baseline conditions.

Although the classical and the quantum problems are very much related to each other, the quantum problem is much richer due to the additional optimization over the measurement basis. A goodness of fit test for i.i.d quantum states is developed and a max-min characterization for the optimal measurement is introduced. We find the quantum measurement which leads both to the maximal Pitman and Bahadur efficiencies, and determine the associated divergence rates. We discuss the relationship of the quantum goodness of fit test to the problem of estimating multiple parameters from a density matrix. These problems are found to be closely related and we show that the largest error of an optimal strategy, determined by the smallest eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix, is given by the divergence rate of the goodness of fit test.

Applying flux and colour cuts to the mid-infrared photometry efficiently selects galaxies at z similar to 1.5 in the stellar mass range 10(10)-10(11)M(circle dot), making this sample the largest used so far to study such a distant population. We measure the angular correlation function in different flux-limited samples at scales >6 arcsec (corresponding to physical distances >0.05 Mpc) and thereby map the one-and two-halo contributions to the clustering. We fit halo occupation distributions and determine how the central galaxy's stellar mass and satellite occupation depend on the halo mass. We measure a prominent peak in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at a halo mass of log (M-halo/M-circle dot) = 12.44 +/- 0.08, 4.5 times higher than the z = 0 value. This supports the idea of an evolving mass threshold above which star formation is quenched. We estimate the large-scale bias in the range b(g) = 2-4 and the satellite fraction to be f(sat) similar to 0.2, showing a clear evolution compared to z = 0. We also find that, above a given stellar mass limit, the fraction of galaxies that are in similar mass pairs is higher at z = 1.5 than at z = 0. In addition, we measure that this fraction mildly increases with the stellar mass limit at z = 1.5, which is the opposite of the behaviour seen at low redshift.

Low-temperature surface formation of NH3 and HNCO: hydrogenation of nitrogen atoms in CO-rich interstellar ice analogues	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						astrochemistry; solid state: volatile; methods: laboratory; ISM: atoms; ISM: molecules; infrared: ISM	SPITZER SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SOLID-STATE CHEMISTRY; ISOCYANIC ACID HNCO; INFRARED-SPECTRUM; AMMONIA FORMATION; N-2 MATRIX; H-ATOMS; FTIR; OCN; FORMALDEHYDE	Solid-state astrochemical reaction pathways have the potential to link the formation of small nitrogen-bearing species, like NH3 and HNCO, and prebiotic molecules, specifically amino acids. To date, the chemical origin of such small nitrogen-containing species is still not well understood, despite the fact that ammonia is an abundant constituent of interstellar ices towards young stellar objects and quiescent molecular clouds. This is mainly because of the lack of dedicated laboratory studies. The aim of this work is to experimentally investigate the formation routes of NH3 and HNCO through non-energetic surface reactions in interstellar ice analogues under fully controlled laboratory conditions and at astrochemically relevant temperatures. This study focuses on the formation of NH3 and HNCO in CO-rich (non-polar) interstellar ices that simulate the CO freeze-out stage in dark interstellar cloud regions, well before thermal and energetic processing start to become relevant. We demonstrate and discuss the surface formation of solid HNCO through the interaction of CO molecules with NH radicals - one of the intermediates in the formation of solid NH3 upon sequential hydrogenation of N atoms. The importance of HNCO for astrobiology is discussed.

Measuring polarization in microlensing events	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						polarization; Galaxy: bulge	CIRCUMSTELLAR ENVELOPES; GALACTIC BULGE; GIANT BRANCH; LENS; M31; GRAINS; CUSPS	We reconsider the polarization of the star light that may arise during microlensing events due to the high gradient of magnification across the atmosphere of the source star, by exploring the full range of microlensing and stellar physical parameters. Since it is already known that only cool evolved giant stars give rise to the highest polarization signals, we follow the model by Simmons et al. to compute the polarization as due to the photon scattering on dust grains in the stellar wind. Motivated by the possibility to perform a polarization measurement during an ongoing microlensing event, we consider the recently reported event catalogue by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) collaboration covering the 2001-2009 campaigns (OGLE-III events), that makes available the largest and more comprehensive set of single-lens microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge. The study of these events, integrated by a Monte Carlo analysis, allows us to estimate the expected polarization profiles and to predict for which source stars and at which time is most convenient to perform a polarization measurement in an ongoing event. We find that about two dozens of OGLE-III events (about 1 per cent of the total) have maximum polarization degree in the range 0.1 < P-max < 1 per cent, corresponding to source stars with apparent magnitude I less than or similar to 14.5, being very cool red giants. This signal is measurable by using the FOcal Reducer and lowdispersion Spectrograph (FORS2) polarimeter at Very Large Telescope (VLT) telescope with about 1 h integration time.

Predicting oculomotor behaviour from correlated populations of posterior parietal neurons	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							INFERENCE	Oculomotor function critically depends on how signals representing saccade direction and eye position are combined across neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of the posterior parietal cortex. Here we show that populations of parietal neurons exhibit correlated variability, and that using these interneuronal correlations yields oculomotor predictions that are more accurate and also less uncertain. The structure of LIP population responses is therefore essential for reliable read-out of oculomotor behaviour.	[Graf, Arnulf B.

The IR quantum mechanical models resulting from the BLG-model and the ABJM-model compactified on a torus are N = 16 and N = 12 superconformal gauged quantum mechanics. After integrating out the auxiliary gauge fields we find OSp(16 vertical bar 2) and SU(1, 1 vertical bar 6) quantum mechanics from the reduced systems. The curved Riemann surface is taken as a holomorphic curve in a Calabi-Yau space to preserve supersymmetry and we present a prescription of the topological twisting.

One relies on the science instrument hosting program onboard geostationary commercial satellites, while the other takes advantage of recent developments in the aerospace industry that result in dramatic satellite and launching vehicle cost reductions for a dedicated geosynchronous mission. To achieve the required level of disturbance free-fall onboard these large and heavy platforms, we propose a new drag-free system, which we have named "two-stage" drag-free. It incorporates the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor (developed at Stanford University) and does not rely on the use of mu N thrusters. Although both mission concepts are characterized by different technical and programmatic challenges, individually they could be flown and operated at a cost significantly lower than those of previously envisioned gravitational wave missions, and in the year 2015 we will perform at JPL a detailed selecting mission analysis.

In the current work, a drop-tower experimental setup was developed for the impact testing of 2D assembly of cylinders and 3D assembly of spheres with impactor velocity of around 6 m/s. This drop tower setup was used to load 2D granular assembly of polyurethane and polycarbonate cylinders of 1.25 '' length with 3 different diameters of 1/4 '', 3/8 '' and 1/2 ''. A high speed camera was used for recording the images of approx. 800 x 800 resolution at speeds between 10,000 and 15,000 fps to monitor the deformation of the cylinders. The recorded images were used to obtain the granular fabric and kinematics for each grain and average strains were obtained from images using digital image correlation. The experimental data was subsequently used to infer the interparticle forces between individual grains in the assembly using a Granular Element Method based optimization process.

J	Bower, DJ; Gurnis, M; Flament, N				Bower, Dan J.; Gurnis, Michael; Flament, Nicolas			Assimilating lithosphere and slab history in 4-D Earth models	PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS			English	Article						Mantle structure; Plate history; Mantle convection; Subduction; Dynamic topography; Data assimilation	SEA-LEVEL; MANTLE CONVECTION; DYNAMIC TOPOGRAPHY; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; SUBDUCTED SLABS; FLAT SUBDUCTION; NORTH-AMERICA; OCEAN; CONSTRAINTS; VISCOSITY	We develop methods to incorporate paleogeographical constraints into numerical models of mantle convection. Through the solution of the convection equations, the models honor geophysical and geological data near the surface while predicting mantle flow and structure at depth and associated surface deformation. The methods consist of four constraints determined a priori from a plate history model: (1) plate velocities, (2) thermal structure of the lithosphere, (3) thermal structure of slabs in the upper mantle, and (4) velocity of slabs in the upper mantle. These constraints are implemented as temporally- and spatially-dependent conditions that are blended with the solution of the convection equations at each time step. We construct Earth-like regional models with oceanic and continental lithosphere, trench migration, oblique subduction, and asymmetric subduction to test the robustness of the methods by computing the temperature, velocity, and buoyancy flux of the lithosphere and slab. Full sphere convection models demonstrate how the methods can determine the flow associated with specific tectonic environments (e.g., back-arc basins, intraoceanic subduction zones) to address geological questions and compare with independent data, both at present-day and in the geological past (e.g., seismology, residual topography, stratigraphy). Using global models with paleogeographical constraints we demonstrate (1) subduction initiation at the Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin and flat slab subduction beneath North America, (2) enhanced correlation of model slabs and fast anomalies in seismic tomography beneath North and South America, and (3) comparable amplitude of dynamic and residual topography in addition to improved spatial correlation of dynamic and residual topography lows.

J	Lapointe, S; Bobbitt, B; Blanquart, G				Lapointe, Simon; Bobbitt, Brock; Blanquart, Guillaume			Impact of chemistry models on flame-vortex interaction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Chemistry modeling; Premixed combustion; Flame-vortex interaction	HEAT	In numerical simulations of turbulent combustion, accurate modeling of the fuel chemistry is a critical component of capturing the relevant physics. Various chemical models are currently being used including detailed chemistry, tabulated chemistry, one-step chemistry, and rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium. However, the differences between these models and their impacts on the fluid dynamics are not well understood. Towards that end, the interaction between a laminar premixed hydrogen-air flame and a two-dimensional monopole vortex is investigated through simulations using the four previously-mentioned chemistry models. In these simulations, the flame speed, viscosity, diffusivity, conductivity, heat capacity, density ratio, and initial vortex characteristics are virtually identical providing a comparison of the effects of each chemical model alone. The results with each model are compared by considering the evolution of the flame structure and the characteristics of the vortex. All four models predict very similar results for the interaction with a small, fast vortex. In the interaction with a large, slow vortex, results from one-step chemistry are different due to a different flame thickness. The large, fast vortex case showcases differences in the flame structure and larger discrepancies between the modeling approaches. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.
