SAFARI's detectors are based on superconducting Transition Edge Sensors (TES) to provide the extreme sensitivity (dark NEP <= 2x10(-19) W/v Hz) needed to take advantage of SPICA's cold (<8 K) telescope. In order to read out the total of similar to 3500 detectors we use frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) with baseband feedback. In each multiplexing channel, a two-stage SQUID preamplifier reads out 160 detectors. We describe the detector system and discuss some of the considerations that informed its design.

Ultra-Thin Large-Aperture Vacuum Windows for Millimeter Wavelengths Receivers	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy IX	JUN 12-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipments Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		Millimeter Wavelengths; Vacuum Windows; Polymer Materials; Cosmic Microwave Background; Primordial Gravitational Waves; Polarization; BICEP; Keck Array		Targeting faint polarization patterns arising from Primordial Gravitational Waves in the Cosmic Microwave Background requires excellent observational sensitivity. Optical elements in small aperture experiments such as Bicep3 and Keck Array are designed to optimize throughput and minimize losses from transmission, reflection and scattering at millimeter wavelengths. As aperture size increases, cryostat vacuum windows must withstand larger forces from atmospheric pressure and the solution has often led to a thicker window at the expense of larger transmission loss. We have identified a new candidate material for the fabrication of vacuum windows: with a tensile strength two orders of magnitude larger than previously used materials, woven high-modulus polyethylene could allow for dramatically thinner windows, and therefore significantly reduced losses and higher sensitivity. In these proceedings we investigate the suitability of high-modulus polyethylene windows for ground-based CMB experiments, such as current and future receivers in the Bicep/Keck Array program. This includes characterizing their optical transmission as well as their mechanical behavior under atmospheric pressure. We find that such ultra-thin materials are promising candidates to improve the performance of large-aperture instruments at millimeter wavelengths, and outline a plan for further tests ahead of a possible upcoming field deployment of such a science-grade window.

This experiment replaces the five Bicep2 style receivers that compose the Keck Array with four larger Bicep3 style receivers observing at six frequencies from 30 to 270GHz. The 95GHz and 150GHz receivers will continue to push the already deep Bicep/Keck CMB maps while the 30/40GHz and 220/270GHz receivers will constrain the synchrotron and galactic dust foregrounds respectively. Here we report on the design and performance of the Bicep Array instruments focusing on the mount and cryostat systems.

LSPE is a novel project that combines ground-based (STRIP) and balloon-borne (SWIPE) polarization measurements of the microwave sky on large angular scales to attempt a detection of the "B-modes" of the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization. STRIP will observe approximately 25% of the Northern sky from the "Observatorio del Teide" in Tenerife, using an array of forty-nine coherent polarimeters at 43 GHz, coupled to a 1.5 m fully rotating crossed-Dragone telescope. A second frequency channel with six-elements at 95 GHz will be exploited as an atmospheric monitor. At present, most of the hardware of the STRIP instrument has been developed and tested at sub-system level. System-level characterization, starting in July 2018, will lead STRIP to be shipped and installed at the observation site within the end of the year. The on-site verification and calibration of the whole instrument will prepare STRIP for a 2-years campaign for the observation of the CMB polarization.

The CMOS ASIC spectrometer design, developed at JPL and UCLA, has dramatically lower power consumption than current approaches that generally employ Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Particularly for space missions and for small satellites, power consumption is a major issue. The order of magnitude lower power consumption of the ASIC approach is thus critical for future missions employing large-format focal plane arrays. Our task was to evaluate this 1024 channel, 1.3-GHz bandwidth CMOS spectrometer in terms of stability and filter shape. The chip was to be tested largely at half-maximum speed to allow for use of the polyphase filter bank. The results of this testing show that the ASIC spectrometer can be made to perform largely as expected based on its design parameters, however, they suggest that more testing of the spectrometer chip could be beneficial. Follow-up tests and newer versions of the chip are discussed at the end of the proceeding.

Currently, coherent Schottky receivers are far too large and consume too much power to be considered for deployment on any smaller forms of space-based satellites. Using an already existing design for a modular 520-600 GHz receiver designed at JPL, we have used novel packaging methods to condense this receiver into an integrated system. This integrated receiver has shown to have a volume and power consumption significantly smaller than the current state of the art. We will further present the designs of a similar integrated receiver for the first excited state of water vapor operating at the 1040-1200 GHz range. Finally, we discuss future plans for the combined mixer system and its potential for use in cubesat interferometry systems.

It is comprised of four 550 mm aperture refractive telescopes observing the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 30/40, 95, 150 and 220/270 GHz with over 30,000 detectors. We present an overview of the receiver, detailing the optics, thermal, mechanical, and magnetic shielding design. Bicep Array follows Bicep3 's modular focal plane concept, and upgrades to 6" wafer to reduce fabrication with higher detector count per module. The first receiver at 30/40GHz is expected to start observing at the South Pole during the 2019-20 season. By the end of the planned Bicep Array program, we project 0.002 less than or similar to sigma(r) less than or similar to 0.006, assuming current modeling of polarized Galactic foreground and depending on the level of delensing that can be achieved with higher resolution maps from the South Pole Telescope.

Bicep3's focal plane is populated with modularized tiles of antenna-coupled transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers. Bicep3 was deployed to the South Pole during 2014-15 austral summer and has been operational since. During the 2016-17 austral summer, we implemented changes to optical elements that lead to better noise performance. We discuss this upgrade and show the performance of Bicep3 at its full mapping speed from the 2017 and 2018 observing seasons. Bicep3 achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in mapping speed compared to a Keck 95GHz receiver. We demonstrate 6.6 mu K root s noise performance of the Bicep3 receiver.

A unique approach is employed in which curved gratings are used in parallel plate waveguides to focus and diffract broadband light from feed horns toward detector arrays. TIME will measure singly ionized carbon fluctuations from 5 < z < 9 with an imaging spectrometer. 32 independent spectrometers are assembled into two stacks of 16, one per polarization. Each grating has 210 facets and provides a resolving power R of similar to 200 over the 186-324 GHz frequency range. The dispersed light is detected using 2-D arrays of transition edge sensor bolometers. The instrument is housed in a closed-cycle 4K-1K-300mK cryostat. The spectrometers and detectors are cooled using a dual-stage 250/300 mK refrigerator.	[Li, Chao-Te; Wei, Tashun; Cheng, Jen-Chieh] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei, Taiwan; [Bradford, C.

The detection of the B-mode signal will be extremely challenging; QUBIC has been designed to address this with a novel approach, namely bolometric interferometry. The receiver cryostat is exceptionally large and cools complex optical and detector stages to 40 K, 4 K, 1 K and 350 mK using two pulse tube coolers, a novel He-4 sorption cooler and a double-stage He-3/He-4 sorption cooler. We discuss the thermal and mechanical design of the cryostat, modelling and thermal analysis, and laboratory cryogenic testing.

Simulations and performance of the QUBIC optical beam combiner	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy IX	JUN 12-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipments Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		CMB; B-modes; bolometric interferometry; QUBIC; physical optics	DESIGN	QUBIC, the Q & U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology, is a novel ground-based instrument that aims to measure the extremely faint B-mode polarisation anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background at intermediate angular scales (multipoles of l = 30 - 200). Primordial B-modes are a key prediction of Inflation as they can only be produced by gravitational waves in the very early universe. To achieve this goal, QUBIC will use bolometric interferometry, a technique that combines the sensitivity of an imager with the immunity to systematic effects of an interferometer. It will directly observe the sky through an array of back-to-back entry horns whose beams will be superimposed using a cooled quasi-optical beam combiner. Images of the resulting interference fringes will be formed on two focal planes, each tiled with transition-edge sensors, cooled down to 320 mK. A dichroic filter placed between the optical combiner and the focal planes will select two frequency bands (centred at 150 GHz and 220 GHz), one frequency per focal plane. Polarization modulation will be achieved using a cold stepped half-wave plate (HWP) and polariser in front of the sky-facing horns. The full QUBIC instrument is described elsewhere(1,2,3,4); in this paper we will concentrate in particular on simulations of the optical combiner (an off-axis Gregorian imager) and the feedhorn array. We model the optical performance of both the QUBIC full module and a scaled-down technological demonstrator which will be used to validate the full instrument design. Optical modelling is carried out using full vector physical optics with a combination of commercial and in-house software. In the high-frequency channel we must be careful to consider the higher-order modes that can be transmitted by the horn array. The instrument window function is used as a measure of performance and we investigate the effect of, for example, alignment and manufacturing tolerances, truncation by optical components and off-axis aberrations. We also report on laboratory tests carried on the QUBIC technological demonstrator in advance of deployment to the observing site in Argentina.	[O'Sullivan, C.; Burke, D.; Gayer, D.; Murphy, J.

Primordial B-modes are a key prediction of Inflation as they can only be produced by gravitational waves in the very early universe. To achieve this goal, QUBIC will use bolometric interferometry, a technique that combines the sensitivity of an imager with the systematic error control of an interferometer. It will directly observe the sky through an array of 400 back-to-back entry horns whose signals will be superimposed using a quasi-optical beam combiner. The resulting interference fringes will be imaged at 150 and 220 GHz on two focal planes, each tiled with NbSi Transition Edge Sensors, cooled to 320 mK and read out with time-domain multiplexing. A dichroic filter placed between the optical combiner and the focal planes will select the two frequency bands. A very large receiver cryostat will cool the optical and detector stages to 40 K, 4 K, 1 K and 320 mK using two pulse tube coolers, a novel 4He sorption cooler and a double-stage 3He/4He sorption cooler. Polarisation modulation and selection will be achieved using a cold stepped half-wave plate (HWP) and polariser, respectively, in front of the sky-facing horns. A key feature of QUBIC's ability to control systematic effects is its 'self-calibration' mode where fringe patterns from individual equivalent baselines can be compared. When observing, however, all the horns will be open simultaneously and we will recover a synthetic image of the sky in the I, Q and U Stokes' parameters. The synthesised beam pattern has a central peak of approximately 0.5 degrees in width, with secondary peaks further out that are damped by the 13-degree primary beam of the horns. This is Module 1 of QUBIC which will be installed in Argentina, near the city of San Antonio de los Cobres, at the Alto Chorrillos site (4869 m a.s.l.), Salta Province. Simulations have shown that this first module could constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio down to sigma(r) = 0.01 after a two-year survey. We aim to add further modules in the future to increase the angular sensitivity and resolution of the instrument. The QUBIC project is proceeding through a sequence of steps. After an initial successful characterisation of the detection chain, a technological demonstrator is being assembled to validate the full instrument design and to test it electrically, thermally and optically. The technical demonstrator is a scaled-down version of Module 1 in terms of the number of detectors, input horns and pulse tubes and a reduction in the diameter of the combiner mirrors and filters, but is otherwise similar. The demonstrator will be upgraded to the full module in 2019. In this paper we give an overview of the QUBIC project and instrument.

We report the approach, design optimization, and partial characterization of a 300 channel filterbank covering the 185 to 315 GHz frequency band that targets a resolving power R similar to 310, and fits on a 3.5 similar to 5.5 cm chip. SuperSpec uses a lens and broadband antenna to couple radiation into a niobium microstrip that feeds a bank of niobium microstrip half-wave resonators for frequency selectivity. Each half-wave resonator is coupled to the inductor of a titanium nitride lumped-element kinetic inductance detector (LEKID) that detects the incident radiation. The device was designed for use in a demonstration instrument at the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT).	[Redford, J.; Hailey-Dunsheath, S.; Bradford, C.

Performance of NbSi Transition-Edge Sensors readout with a 128 MUX factor for the QUBIC experiment	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy IX	JUN 12-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipments Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		Bolometric Interferometry; CMB instrumentation; Cosmic Microwave Background; SiGe Application Specific Integrated Circuit; Superconducting QUantum Interference Device; the QUBIC experiment; Time Domain Multiplexing; Transition-Edge Sensor	ARRAY	QUBIC (the Q&U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology) is a ground-based experiment which seeks to improve the current constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. It exploits the unique technique, among Cosmic Microwave Background experiments, of bolometric interferometry, combining together the sensitivity of bolometric detectors with the control of systematic effects typical of interferometers. QUBIC will perform sky observations in polarization, in two frequency bands centered at 150 and 220 GHz, with two kilo pixel focal plane arrays of NbSi Transition-Edge Sensors (TES) cooled down to 350 mK. A subset of the QUBIC instrument, the so called QUBIC Technological Demonstrator (TD), with a reduced number of detectors with respect to the full instrument, will be deployed and commissioned before the end of 2018. The voltage-biased TES are read out with Time Domain Multiplexing and an unprecedented multiplexing (MUX) factor equal to 128. This MUX factor is reached with two-stage multiplexing: a traditional one exploiting Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) at 1 K and a novel SiGe Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) at 60K. The former provides a MUX factor of 32, while the latter provides a further 4. Each TES array is composed of 256 detectors and read out with four modules of 32 SQUIDs and two ASICs. A custom software synchronizes and manages the readout and detector operation, while the TES are sampled at 780 Hz (100kHz/128 MUX rate). In this work we present the experimental characterization of the QUBIC TES arrays and their multiplexing readout chain, including time constant, critical temperature, and noise properties.

In this paper, we give an overview of the BICEP Array science and instrument, with a focus on the detector module. We designed corrugations in the metal frame of the module to suppress unwanted interactions with the antenna-coupled detectors that would otherwise deform the beams of edge pixels. This design reduces the residual beam systematics and temperature-to-polarization leakage due to beam steering and shape mismatch between polarized beam pairs. We report on the simulated performance of single-and wide-band corrugations designed to minimize these effects. Our optimized design alleviates beam differential ellipticity caused by the metal frame to about 7% over 57% bandwidth (25 to 45 GHz), which is close to the level due the bare antenna itself without a metal frame. Initial laboratory measurements are also presented.	[Soliman, A.; Aikin, R. W.; Bock, J. J.; Brevik, J. A.; Hildebrandt, S.

A CubeSat offers a cost-effective potential solution for observing these emissions, which cannot be observed from the ground, given it has a lens which can offer a significant effective collecting area at that frequency. To this end, we investigate designs for a lens by using transmission line theory to model a flat, lightweight, dielectrically embedded mesh lens which can be fabricated using layers of photolithographically etched material. We demonstrate that, using commercially available material, transmittances of over 95% may be achieved.

A comprehensive study of cluster formation and evolution	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: individual: M51, NGC 5194; galaxies: star clusters: general; galaxies: star formation	INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; GALACTIC OPEN CLUSTERS; LARGE-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; GALAXIES NGC 4038/4039; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; ANTENNAE GALAXIES; STELLAR CLUSTERS; AGE DISTRIBUTIONS; FORMATION HISTORY; SPIRAL GALAXIES	Recently acquired WFC3 UV (F275W and F336W) imaging mosaics under the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS), combined with archival ACS data of M51, are used to study the young star cluster (YSC) population of this interacting system. Our newly extracted source catalogue contains 2834 cluster candidates, morphologically classified to be compact and uniform in colour, for which ages, masses and extinction are derived. In this first work we study the main properties of the YSC population of the whole galaxy, considering a mass-limited sample. Both luminosity and mass functions follow a power-law shape with slope -2, but at high luminosities and masses a dearth of sources is observed. The analysis of the mass function suggests that it is best fitted by a Schechter function with slope -2 and a truncation mass at 1.00 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) M-circle dot . Through Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm this result and link the shape of the luminosity function to the presence of a truncation in the mass function. A mass limited age function analysis, between 10 and 200 Myr, suggests that the cluster population is undergoing only moderate disruption. We observe little variation in the shape of the mass function at masses above 1 x 10(4) M-circle dot over this age range. The fraction of star formation happening in the form of bound clusters in M51 is similar to 20 per cent in the age range 10-100 Myr and little variation is observed over the whole range from 1 to 200 Myr.

Galaxy bias from galaxy-galaxy lensing in the DES science verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; large-scale structure of Universe; cosmology: observations	COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; DEEP SURVEY; NOISE BIAS; SHEAR; STATISTICS; CFHTLENS; SYSTEMATICS	We present a measurement of galaxy-galaxy lensing around a magnitude-limited (i(AB) < 22.5) sample of galaxies from the dark energy survey science verification (DES-SV) data. We split these lenses into three photometric-redshift bins from 0.2 to 0.8, and determine the product of the galaxy bias b and cross-correlation coefficient between the galaxy and dark matter overdensity fields r in each bin, using scales above 4 h(-1) Mpc comoving, where we find the linear bias model to be valid given our current uncertainties. We compare our galaxy bias results from galaxy-galaxy lensing with those obtained from galaxy clustering and CMB lensing for the same sample of galaxies, and find our measurements to be in good agreement with those in Crocce et al., while, in the lowest redshift bin (z similar to 0.3), they show some tension with the findings in Giannantonio et al. We measure b.r to be 0.87 +/- 0.11, 1.12 +/- 0.16 and 1.24 +/- 0.23, respectively, for the three redshift bins of width Delta z = 0.2 in the range 0.2 < z < 0.8, defined with the photometric-redshift algorithm BPZ. Using a different code to split the lens sample, TPZ, leads to changes in the measured biases at the 10-20 per cent level, but it does not alter the main conclusion of this work: when comparing with Crocce et al. we do not find strong evidence for a cross-correlation parameter significantly below one in this galaxy sample, except possibly at the lowest redshift bin (z similar to 0.3), where we find r = 0.71 +/- 0.11 when using TPZ, and 0.83 +/- 0.12 with BPZ.

Gas becomes increasingly rotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest mass galaxies (M-star < 10(8)M(circle dot)), gas fails to form a morphological disc and is primarily dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses (M-star = 10(8-10)M(circle dot)), galaxies display a wide range of gas kinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating discs to irregular spheroids with negligible net rotation. All the high-mass (M-star = 10(10-11)M(circle dot)) galaxies form rotationally supported gas discs. Many of the haloes whose galaxies fail to form discs harbour high angular momentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the specific angular momentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark matter halo increases significantly with galaxy mass, from < j(gas)> / < j(DM)> similar to 0.1 at M-star = 10(6-7)M(circle dot) to < j(gas)> / < j(DM)> similar to 2 at M-star = 10(10-11)M(circle dot). The reduced rotational support in the lowest mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the UV background suppressing the accretion of high angular momentum gas at late times, and (b) stellar feedback driving large non-circular gas motions. We broadly reproduce the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation velocity, size and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of disky, high angular momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses (M-star = (10(6)-2 x x 10(7)) M-circle dot). Stars form preferentially from low angular momentum gas near the galactic centre and are less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption that stars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates the simulated galaxies' stellar angular momentum, particularly at low masses.

J	Abdelsalam, SI; Bhatti, MM				Abdelsalam, Sara I.; Bhatti, Muhammad Mubashir			The impact of impinging TiO2 nanoparticles in Prandtl nanofluid along with endoscopic and variable magnetic field effects on peristaltic blood flow	MULTIDISCIPLINE MODELING IN MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Peristalsis; Blood flow; Endoscope; Homotopy perturbation solution; Prandtl fluid; Variable magnetic field	DRIVEN HEAT-TRANSFER; BOUNDARY-LAYER-FLOW; STRETCHING SHEET; PERMEABLE WALLS; POROUS-MEDIUM; FLUID; TRANSPORT; MODEL; CHANNEL; CAVITY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the variable magnetic field and endoscope effects on peristaltic blood flow of nanofluid containing TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a porous annulus. The Prandtl fluid model is taken into account for the present flow. The mathematical modelling comprises the temperature, continuity, NP concentration, and equations of motion which are further simplified by taking a long peristaltic wave and creeping flow regime. Design/methodology/approach After using the long wavelength approximation, the obtained highly non-linear partial differential equations are solved using the homotopy perturbation scheme. The inclusion of the pertinent parameters is discussed mathematically and graphically for the pressure rise, friction forces, temperature profile, and concentration profile. The trapping phenomenon is also investigated with the help of contours. Findings Results show that the maximum velocity distribution exists near the centre of the annulus, whereas the average time flow boosts the velocity profile. It has also been shown that flow can pass readily without enormous pressure gradient imposed on the endoscope tube unlike the case of the slim section of the problem. Practical implications The nanofluids containing titanium NPs are increasingly utilised since such type of NPs is used by several manufacturers in sunscreen blockers and different types of endoscopy. In endoscopy, the variable magnetic field is used at the tip in order to detect or treat diseases. The NPs are used since they acquire specific thermal properties as compared with base fluids. The present study provides qualitative results showing the effect of inner tube of annulus on the fluid flow, the effect of variable magnetic field, and the change in the temperature profile on the flow field. Originality/value A new model is introduced that shows the utmost pressure that works against the positive peristaltic pump. It studies the blood flow that results in extremely non-linear partial differential equations that are solved by the homotopy perturbation method. The titanium NPs are being used in blocking the rays that penetrate the epidermis causing skin burns and short ultraviolet ageing rays that cause visible wrinkles, and thus are used in the manufacturing of sunscreens that are partially absorbed through the skin.

Changes in Greenland's peripheral glaciers linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							MASS-BALANCE; ICE-SHEET; PRECIPITATION; FLUCTUATIONS; TIME	Glaciers and ice caps peripheral to the main Greenland Ice Sheet contribute markedly to sea-level rise(1-3). Their changes and variability, however, have been difficult to quantify on multi-decadal timescales due to an absence of long-term data(4). Here, using historical aerial surveys, expedition photographs, spy satellite imagery and new remote-sensing products, we map glacier length fluctuations of approximately 350 peripheral glaciers and ice caps in East and West Greenland since 1890. Peripheral glaciers are found to have recently undergone a widespread and significant retreat at rates of 12.2 m per year and 16.6 m per year in East and West Greenland, respectively; these changes are exceeded in severity only by the early twentieth century post-Little-Ice-Age retreat. Regional changes in ice volume, as reflected by glacier length, are further shown to be related to changes in precipitation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with a distinct east-west asymmetry; positive phases of the NAO increase accumulation, and thereby glacier growth, in the eastern periphery, whereas opposite effects are observed in the western periphery. Thus, with projected trends towards positive NAO in the future(5,6), eastern peripheral glaciers may remain relatively stable, while western peripheral glaciers will continue to diminish.	[Bjork, A.

Hemifield columns co-opt ocular dominance column structure in human achiasma	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							VISUAL PATHWAYS; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; BOLD; ACTIVATION; STABILITY; BRAIN	In the absence of an optic chiasm, visual input to the right eye is represented in primary visual cortex (V1) in the right hemisphere, while visual input to the left eye activates V1 in the left hemisphere. Retinotopic mapping In V1 reveals that in each hemisphere left and right visual hemifield representations are overlaid (Hoffmann et al., 2012). To explain how overlapping hemifield representations in V1 do not impair vision, we tested the hypothesis that visual projections from nasal and temporal retina create interdigitated left and right visual hemifield representations in V1, similar to the ocular dominance columns observed in neurotypical subjects (Victor et al., 2000). We used high-resolution fMRI at 7 T to measure the spatial distribution of responses to left-and right-hemifield stimulation in one achiasmic subject. T-2-weighted 2D Spin Echo images were acquired at 0.8 mm isotropic resolution. The left eye was occluded. To the right eye, a presentation of flickering checkerboards alternated between the left and right visual fields in a blocked stimulus design. The participant performed a demanding orientation-discrimination task at fixation. A general linear model was used to estimate the preference of voxels in V1 to left- and right-hemifield stimulation. The spatial distribution of voxels with significant preference for each hemifield showed interdigitated clusters which densely packed V1 in the right hemisphere. The spatial distribution of hemifield-preference voxels in the achiasmic subject was stable between two days of testing and comparable in scale to that of human ocular dominance columns. These results are the first in vivo evidence showing that visual hemifield representations interdigitate in achiasmic V1 following a similar developmental course to that of ocular dominance columns in V1 with intact optic chiasm.

Residue-Specific Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids for Protein Engineering	NONCANONICAL AMINO ACIDS: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Noncanonical amino acids; Residue-specific incorporation; Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; Azidonorleucine; Medium shift; Bioconjugation; Strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition; Unnatural amino acids	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BIOSYNTHESIS	The incorporation of noncanonical amino acids has given protein chemists access to an expanded repertoire of amino acids. This methodology has significantly broadened the scope of protein engineering allowing introduction of amino acids with non-native functionalities, such as bioorthogonal reactive handles (azides and alkynes) and hydrophobic fluorinated side chains. Here, we describe the efficient residue-specific replacement of methionine by azidonorleucine in an engineered green fluorescent protein using a bacterial expression system to introduce a single reactive site for the strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition.

Testing of the LSST's photometric calibration strategy at the CTIO 0.9 meter telescope	OBSERVATORY OPERATIONS: STRATEGIES, PROCESSES, AND SYSTEMS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Observatory Operations - Strategies, Processes, and Systems VII	JUN 11-15, 2018	Austin, TX	SPIE, 4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment, Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel, Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst, Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		LSST; Photometric Calibration	SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC STANDARDS; PANSTARRS; STARS; STIS	The calibration hardware system of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is designed to measure two quantities: a telescope's instrumental response and atmospheric transmission, both as a function of wavelength. First of all, a "collimated beam projector" is designed to measure the instrumental response function by projecting monochromatic light through a mask and a collimating optic onto the telescope. During the measurement, the light level is monitored with a NIST-traceable photodiode. This method does not suffer from stray light effects or the reflections (known as ghosting) present when using a flat-field screen illumination, which has a systematic source of uncertainty from uncontrolled reflections. It allows for an independent measurement of the throughput of the telescope's optical train as well as each filter's transmission as a function of position on the primary mirror. Second, CALSPEC stars can be used as calibrated light sources to illuminate the atmosphere and measure its transmission. To measure the atmosphere's transfer function, we use the telescope's imager with a Ronchi grating in place of a filter to configure it as a low resolution slitless spectrograph. In this paper, we describe this calibration strategy, focusing on results from a prototype system at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 0.9 meter telescope. We compare the instrumental throughput measurements to nominal values measured using a laboratory spectrophotometer, and we describe measurements of the atmosphere made via CALSPEC standard stars during the same run.

To perform the 5000 sq-degree wide field and 30 sq-degree supernova surveys, the DES Collaboration built the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 3 square-degree, 570-Megapixel CCD camera that was installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). DES has completed its third observing season out of a nominal five. This paper describes DES "Year 4" (Y4) and "Year 5" (Y5), the survey strategy, an outline of the survey operations procedures, the efficiency of operations and the causes of lost observing time. It provides details about the quality of these two-season's data, a summary of the overall status, and plans for the final survey season.	[Diehl, H.

As the astronomy community continues to advance scientific boundaries and push beyond original specifications, the stability of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) instrument is paramount. The Instrument Team (IST) monitors the pointing accuracy, temperature, and calibration and provides the information in a timely manner to observers. The IRAC IST created a calibration trending web page, available to the general astronomy community, where the team posts updates of three most pertinent scientific stability measures of the IRAC data: calibration, bias, and bad pixels. In addition, photometry and telescope properties from all the staring observations (>1500 as of April 2018) are trended to examine correlations with changes in the age or thermal properties of the telescope. A long, well-sampled baseline established by consistent monitoring outside anomalies and space weather events allows even the smallest changes to be detected.

The combination of MIRI's sensitivity and angular resolution over the 5-28.5 mu m wavelength range will enable investigations into many different science topics, ranging from the local to the high-redshift Universe. The MIRI team has defined and published a set of "Recommended Strategies" to help observers optimally plan and execute their science programs. Some of these recommendations are generic and applicable to any science case; others are tailored to specific observing modes. Here we summarize key generic recommendations for MIRI observers, with emphasis on detector usage.

After depleting the cryogen onboard in 2009 observatory operations were altered in order to run the mission on a budget totaling less than 1/3 that of the cryogenic mission. These changes included decreasing the number of approved science programs and funding to the community while encouraging very large programs (>1000 hours). We present here insights on how Spitzer's operational changes have altered how people publish the data, and present metrics about data use and re-usage for the entire mission in published papers. Spitzer is a community driven observatory and our observing programs vary in number of hours and number of observations depending on the science, and so a comparison between various methods of presenting publication statistics is discussed.

The project anticipated a maximum extended mission of about four years when the first mission extension was proposed. The robustness of the observatory hardware and the creativity of the project engineers and scientists in overcoming hurdles to operations has enabled a substantially longer mission lifetime. This has led to more challenges with an aging ground-system due to resource reductions and decisions made early in the extended mission based on a shorter planned lifetime. We provide an overview of the extended mission phases, challenges met in maintaining and enhancing the science productivity, and what we would have done differently if the extended mission was planned from the start to be nearly twice as long as the prime mission.

Its main goal is to characterize young extra-solar planetary systems and exozodiacal dust around southern main-sequence stars. In this paper, we present an update of the project and key technology pathways to improve the contrast achieved by the VLTI. In particular, we discuss the possibility to use integrated optics, proven in the near-infrared, in the thermal near-infrared (L and M bands, 3-5 p.m) and advanced fringe tracking strategies. We also address the strong exoplanet science case (young exoplanets, planet formation, and exozodiacal disks) offered by this wavelength regime as well as other possible science cases such as stellar physics (fundamental parameters and multiplicity) and extragalactic astrophysics (active galactic nuclei and fundamental constants). Synergies and scientific preparation for other potential future instruments such as the Planet Formation Imager are also briefly discussed.	[Defrere, D.; Absil, O.; de Xivry, G.

Here, we will present an update on the work of the Science Working Group (SWG), including new simulations of dust structures during the assembly phase of planet formation and quantitative detection efficiencies for accreting and non-accreting young exoplanets as a function of mass and age. We use these results to motivate two reference PFI designs consisting of a) twelve 3m telescopes with a maximum baseline of 1.2 km focused on young exoplanet imaging and b) twelve 8 m telescopes optimized for a wider range of young exoplanets and protoplanetary disk imaging out to the 150 K H2O ice line. Armed with 4 x 8 m telescopes, the ESO/VLTI can already detect young exoplanets in principle and projects such as MATISSE, Hi-5 and Heimdallr are important PFI pathfinders to make this possible. We also discuss the state of technology development needed to make PFI more affordable, including progress towards new designs for inexpensive, small field-of-view, large aperture telescopes and prospects for Cubesat-based space interferometry.

Although successful discovery technologies are now populating exoplanetary catalogs into the thousands, contemporary astronomy is still poorly equipped to answer the basic question of whether there are any rocky planets orbiting any particular star system. Toliman will make a first study of stars within 10 PC of the sun by deploying an innovative optical and signal encoding architecture that leverages the most promising technology to deliver data on this critical stellar sample: high precision astrometric monitoring. Here we present results from the Foundational Mission Study, jointly funded by the Breakthrough Prize Foundation and the University of Sydney which has translated innovative underlying design principles into error budgets and potential spacecraft systems designs.

Its goal is to directly image and spectroscopically characterize planetary systems in the habitable zone around nearby sun-like. Additionally, HabEx will perform a broad range of general astrophysics science enabled by 100 to 2500 nm spectral range and 3 x 3 arc-minute FOV. To achieve its exoplanet science goals, HabEx is baselining both an internal coronagraph and a star-shade. But, an internal coronagraph requires an ultra-stable wavefront. Achieving this stability imposes never before required performance specifications upon the telescope and requires a new approach systems engineering. The telescope and coronagraph must be specified and designed as an integrated system. This paper describes a two-step systems engineering process that can be applied to any potential telescope/coronagraph combination. The first step is to determine the coronagraph's performance metrics of core throughput, raw contrast and stability of raw contrast. The second step is to calculate the sensitivity of the coronagraph's performance metric to its telescope's optical performance (e.g. wavefront stability). To illustrate the process, four representative architectures are evaluated: two vector-vortex and a hybrid Lyot coronagraph in combination with an off-axis monolithic telescope; and, an apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph with an on-axis hexagonal segment telescope (similar to the Webb Telescope aperture or the potential Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) decadal mission).

This generally implies the use of more optical elements and a consequent loss of throughput and performances. With the recent development of curved sensor this can be avoided. This new technology has been gathering more and more attention from a very broad community, as the potential applications are multiple: from low-cost commercial to high impact scientific systems, to mass-market and on board cameras, defense and security, and astronomical community. We describe here the first concave curved CMOS detector developed within a collaboration between CNRS-LAM and CEA-LETI. This fully-functional detector 20 Mpix (CMOSIS CMV20000) has been curved down to a radius of R-c =150 mm over a size of 24x32 mm(2). We present here the methodology adopted for its characterization and describe in detail all the results obtained. We also discuss the main components of noise, such as the readout noise, the fixed pattern noise and the dark current. Finally we provide a comparison with the flat version of the same sensor in order to establish the impact of the curving process on the main characteristics of the sensor.

We demonstrate both of the effects on example of two optical designs. The first one is a rotationally-symmetrical lens with focal length of 25 mm, f-ratio of 3.5 and field of view equal to 72 degrees, working in the visible domain.

Photoacoustic microscopy enables multilayered histological imaging of human breast cancer without staining	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2018	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 28-FEB 01, 2018	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments, Inc		Cancer; translational research; photoacoustic imaging; microscopy; label-free; histology		In 2016, an estimated similar to 250,000 new cases of invasive and non-invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in US women. About 60-75% of these cases were treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) as the initial therapy. To reduce the local recurrence rate, the goal of BCS is to excise the tumor with a rim of normal surrounding tissue, so that no cancer cells remain at the cut margin, while preserving as much normal breast tissue as possible. Therefore, patients with remaining cancer cells at the cut margin commonly require a second surgical procedure to obtain clear margins. Different approaches have been used to decrease the positive margin rate to avoid re-excision. However, these techniques are variously ineffective in reducing the re-operative rate, difficult to master by surgeons, or time-consuming for large specimens. Thus, 20-60% of patients undergoing BCS still require second surgeries due to positive surgical margins. The ideal tool for margin assessment would provide the same information as histological analysis, without the need for processing specimens. To achieve this goal, we have developed and refined label-free photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) for breast specimens. Exploiting the intrinsic optical contrast of tissue, ultraviolet (UV) laser illumination can highlight cell nuclei, thus providing the same contrast as hematoxylin labeling used in conventional histology and measuring features related to the histological landscape without the need for labels. We demonstrate that our UV-PAM system can provide label-free, high-resolution, and histology-like imaging of fixed, unprocessed breast tissue.	[Wong, Terence T.

Whole-organ atlas imaged by label-free high-resolution photoacoustic microscopy assisted by a microtome	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2018	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 28-FEB 01, 2018	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments, Inc		Brain; photoacoustic imaging; microscopy; label-free; histology; microtome; whole-organ atlas		In biomedical imaging, all optical techniques face a fundamental trade-off between spatial resolution and tissue penetration. Therefore, obtaining an organelle-level resolution image of a whole organ has remained a challenging and yet appealing scientific pursuit. Over the past decade, optical microscopy assisted by mechanical sectioning or chemical clearing of tissue has been demonstrated as a powerful technique to overcome this dilemma, one of particular use in imaging the neural network. However, this type of techniques needs lengthy special preparation of the tissue specimen, which hinders broad application in life sciences. Here, we propose a new label-free three-dimensional imaging technique, named microtomy-assisted photoacoustic microscopy (mPAM), for potentially imaging all biomolecules with 100% endogenous natural staining in whole organs with high fidelity. We demonstrate the first label-free mPAM, using UV light for label-free histology-like imaging, in whole organs (e.g., mouse brains), most of them formalin-fixed and paraffin- or agarose-embedded for minimal morphological deformation. Furthermore, mPAM with dual wavelength illuminations is also employed to image a mouse brain slice, demonstrating the potential for imaging of multiple biomolecules without staining With visible light illumination, mPAM also shows its deep tissue imaging capability, which enables less slicing and hence reduces sectioning artifacts. mPAM could potentially provide a new insight for understanding complex biological organs.

While originally focused on supporting NASA's planetary missions, the use of SPICE has slowly grown to include most worldwide planetary missions, and it has also been finding application in heliophysics and other space science disciplines. This paper peeks under the covers to see what new capabilities are being developed or planned at SPICE headquarters to better support the future of space science. The SPICE system is implemented and maintained by NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California (http://naifjpl.nasa.gov).

QUantum plasmonics investigate the quantum properties of single surface plasmons, trying to reproduce fundamental and landmark quantum optics experiment that would benefit from the light-confinement properties of nanophotonic systems, thus paving the way towards the design of basic components dedicated to quantum experiments with sizes inferior to the diffraction limit. Several groups have recently reproduced fundamental quantum optics experiments with single surface plasmons polaritons (SPPs). We have investigated two situations of quantum interference of single SPPs on lossy beamsplitters : a plasmonic version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment, and the observation of plasmonic N00N states interferences. We numerically designed and fabricated several beamsplitters that reveal new quantum interference scenarios, such as the coalescence and the anti-coalescence of SPPs, or quantum non-linear absorption. Our work show that losses can be seen as a new degree of freedom in the design of plasmonic devices.

These two adjustments are designed to alleviate internal planar stresses that cause delamination between deposited layers and peeling off the substrate. Decreasing the distance between Ti interlayers helps to eliminate delamination between deposited layers. Through high speed camera measurements, the reaction propagation speed of an RMF sample with preheating is 42% slower than the same RMF that was not preheated, indicating a slower heat release rate. The preliminary experiments on brazing Ti-6Al-4V coated with BAlSi-4 brazing material revealed dendritic structure branching out from the RMF surface into the brazing material. The dendrite structures most likely form because of rapid melting and solidification of the brazing material. However, this rapid melting and solidification cycle does not appear to occur uniformly across the BAlSi-4RMF interface which is linked to its low bonding strength. When the Ti-6Al-4V substrate is heated to 150 degrees C prior to ignition, the strength increases to 0.47 MPa when the total RMF thickness is 84 mu m and 15 MPa of pressure is applied.

Accurate Evaluation of the Conductor Loss in Rectangular Microstrip Patch Reflectarrays	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M			English	Article								In the moment method solution of the integral equations for currents of a rectangular microstrip patch reflectarray, the Leontovich boundary condition is employed to determine the conductor loss. If the basis functions contain edge conditions that approach infinity, the moment matrix elements will have diverging integrals in the Galerkin technique. In this paper, we present a criterion to stop the evaluation of these integrals at a distance before the edge, thereby avoiding the divergence problem. The stopping distance derived here is found to work for a range of values of permittivity, loss tangent, and thickness of the substrate, polarization, angles of incidence of the plane wave source, and also for superstrates. Our computed results are in good agreement with measured results and those computed by HFSS.

While designed primarily to reduce HSC Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) data, it is also the recommended pipeline for reducing general-observer HSC data.

This yields a 15 sigma detection of the mean Planck cluster mass density profile. The five Planck clusters span a relatively wide mass range, M-WL,M-500c = (2-30) x 10(14) M-circle dot with a mean mass of M-WL,M-500c = (4.15 +/- 0.61) x 10(14) M-circle dot. The ratio of the stacked Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mass to the stacked WL mass is < M-SZ > / < M-WL > = 1 - b = 0.80 +/- 0.14. This mass bias is consistent with previous WL mass calibrations of Planck clusters within the errors. We discuss the implications of our findings for the calibration of SZ cluster counts and the much discussed tension between Planck SZ cluster counts and Planck Lambda CDM cosmology.

The wide-field corrector delivers sharp images of 0.'' 2 (FWHM) in the HSC-i band over the entire 1.degrees 5 diameter field of view. The collimation of the camera with respect to the optical axis of the primary mirror is done with hexapod actuators, the mechanical accuracy of which is a few microns. Analysis of the remaining wavefront error in off-focus stellar images reveals that the collimation of the optical components meets design specifications. While there is a flexure of mechanical components, it also is within the design specification. As a result, the camera achieves its seeing-limited imaging on Maunakea during most of the time; the median seeing over several years of observing is 0.'' 67 (FWHM) in the i band. The sensors use p-channel, fully depleted CCDs of 200 mu m thickness (2048 x 4176 15 mu m square pixels) and we employ 116 of them to pave the 50 cm diameter focal plane. The minimum interval between exposures is 34 s, including the time to read out arrays, to transfer data to the control computer, and to save them to the hard drive. HSC on Subaru uniquely features a combination of a large aperture, a wide field of view, sharp images and a high sensitivity especially at longer wavelengths, which makes the HSC one of the most powerful observing facilities in the world.

Estimating surface soil moisture from SMAP observations using a Neural Network technique	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Soil moisture remote sensing; SMAP; Data assimilation; Microwave radiometer	CATCHMENT-BASED APPROACH; RETRIEVAL; MICROWAVE; SMOS; ASSIMILATION; VALIDATION; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; INFILTRATION; METHODOLOGY	A Neural Network (NN) algorithm was developed to estimate global surface soil moisture for April 2015 to March 2017 with a 2-3 day repeat frequency using passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, surface soil temperatures from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling system, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based vegetation water content. The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.

Here, we present the first global data set of DASF/CSC and examine the potential of CSC and SIF for providing complementary information on the controversially discussed vegetation seasonality in Amazon forests. A comparison between near-infrared SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instrument and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) (overpass time in the morning and noon, respectively) reveals the response of SIF to instantaneous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Large-scale seasonal swings of GOME-2 SIF amount up to 21% (regarding the annual maximum) and peak in October and around February, while 000-2 SIF peaks in February. However, both time series agree very well if SIF is normalized by overpass time and wavelength. We further examine anistropic reflectance characteristics with the finding that the hot spot effect significantly impacts observed GOME-2 SIF values. On the contrary, our sensitivity analysis suggests that CSC is highly independent of sun-sensor geometry as well as atmospheric effects. The slight annual variability of CSC (3%) shows no clear seasonal cycle, while a relatively high spatial standard deviation points to a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in our study domain within the central Amazon Basin.

Non-Gaussian tails of spectral response functions can be difficult to characterize in the laboratory, and calibration can shift during deployment. Consequently, in-flight techniques are useful for validating and updating laboratory measurements. Our approach exploits predictable changes in the shape of the oxygen A band across varying surface elevation, with diverse scene content providing numerical leverage to characterize spectral response tails 3-4 orders of magnitude below the peak. We present a correction to recover the nominal response function, and show case studies based on NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). Corrected radiances are better conditioned for downstream analysis by sensitive atmospheric codes. We evaluate accuracy using multiple independent standards: simulation studies; consistency with laboratory measurements; elimination of a surface pressure retrieval bias; better alignment of retrieved reflectance with ground reference data; and statistics of over 250 flightlines from a campaign across the Indian Subcontinent showing consistent improvements in atmospheric correction.

Development and assessment of the SMAP enhanced passive soil moisture product	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAP; Enhanced; Soil moisture; Passive; Retrieval; Validation; Assessment	L-BAND; RADIOMETER DATA; PERFORMANCE; RETRIEVALS; VALIDATION	Launched in January 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory was designed to provide frequent global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every two to three days using a radar and a radiometer operating at L-band frequencies. Despite a hardware mishap that rendered the radar inoperable shortly after launch, the radiometer continues to operate nominally, returning more than two years of science data that have helped to improve existing hydrological applications and foster new ones. Beginning in late 2016 the SMAP project launched a suite of new data products with the objective of recovering some high-resolution observation capability loss resulting from the radar malfunction. Among these new data products are the SMAP Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product that was released in December 2016, followed by the SMAP/Sentinel-1 Active-Passive Soil Moisture Product in April 2017. This article covers the development and assessment of the SMAP Level 2 Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E). The product distinguishes itself from the current SMAP Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P) in that the soil moisture retrieval is posted on a 9 km grid instead of a 36 km grid. This is made possible by first applying the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique to the antenna temperature (T-A) data in the original SMAP Level 1B Brightness Temperature Product to take advantage of the overlapped radiometer footprints on orbit. The resulting interpolated TA data then go through various correction/calibration procedures to become the SMAP Level 1C Enhanced Brightness Temperature Product (L1C_TB_E). The L1C_TB_E product, posted on a 9 km grid, is then used as the primary input to the current operational SMAP baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm to produce L2_SM_P_E as the final output. Images of the new product reveal enhanced visual features that are not apparent in the standard product. Based on in situ data from core validation sites and sparse networks representing different seasons and biomes all over the world, comparisons between L2_SM_P_E and in situ data were performed for the duration of April 1, 2015-October 30, 2016. It was found that the performance of the enhanced 9 km L2_SM_P_E is equivalent to that of the standard 36 km L2_SM_P, attaining a retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and a correlation coefficient above 0.800. This assessment also affirmed that the Single Channel Algorithm using the V-polarized T-B channel (SCA-V) delivered the best retrieval performance among the various algorithms implemented for L2_SM_P_E, a result similar to a previous assessment for L2_SM_P.

The study of non-Newtonian nanofluid with hall and ion slip effects on peristaltically induced motion in a non-uniform channel	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							INDUCED MAGNETIC-FIELD; WATER NANOFLUID; JEFFREY FLUID; FLOW; TRANSPORT; MODEL	In this study, we considered the unsteady peristaltic motion of a non-Newtonian nanofluid under the influence of a magnetic field and Hall currents. The simultaneous effects of ion slip and chemical reaction were also taken into consideration. The flow problem was suggested on the basis of the continuity, thermal energy, linear momentum, and nanoparticle concentration, which were further reduced with the help of Ohm's law. Mathematical modelling was executed using the lubrication approach. The resulting highly nonlinear partial differential equations were solved semi-analytically using the homotopy perturbation technique. The impacts of all the pertinent parameters were investigated mathematically and graphically. Numerical calculations have been used to calculate the expressions for the pressure increase and friction forces along the whole length of the channel. The results depict that for a relatively large value of the Brownian parameter, the chemical reaction has a dual behaviour on the concentration profile. Moreover, there is a critical point of the magnetic parameter at which the behaviours of the pressure increase and friction forces are reversed for progressive values of the power law index. The present investigation provides a theoretical model that estimates the impact of a wide range of parameters on the characteristics of blood-like fluid flows.

This fundamental prototype reaction plays an important role in atmospheric and combustion chemistry, motivating studies for accurate determination of the reaction rate coefficient and its pressure and temperature dependence at thermal reaction conditions. This intricate dependence can be traced directly to details of the underlying dynamics (formation, isomerization, and dissociation) involving the reactive intermediates cis-andtrans-HOCO, which can only be observed transiently. Using time-resolved frequency comb spectroscopy, comprehensive mechanistic elucidation of the kinetics of the isotopic analog deuteroxyl radical (OD) with CO has been realized. By monitoring the concentrations of reactants, intermediates, and products in real time, the branching and isomerization kinetics and absolute yields of all species in the OD + CO reaction are quantified as a function of pressure and collision partner.

We give a brief overview of these sensors and focus on the development and assessment of sounder data products, which include vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor, cloud and surface parameters, and in the case of infrared sounders also trace gas estimates and for microwave sounders precipitation as well. The baseline AIRS data product "retrieval system" was developed by the AIRS science team and has been undergoing continuous maintenance and upgrade in close collaboration with the sounder team at JPL. To support that process, the JPL team has developed a broad range of assessment tools and techniques, which can be applied to data from other sounders as well and can range from simple "sanity check" analysis to thorough "validation" analysis. An example of the less complex testing is the preliminary assessment of products generated by new retrieval systems operating on data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) flying on the Suomi NPP and JPSS satellites. These retrieval systems are developed by individual investigators funded by NASA research grants and are delivered to a Sounder "Science Investigator Processing System" (SIPS) located at JPL for integration, testing and delivery to a NASA data processing center and eventual release to the public, but only limited resources are available to the SIPS for the assessment, which therefore must be relatively superficial. An example of thorough assessment is the quantification of the impact on AIRS products of the failure of the AMSU-A2 microwave sounder 2 years ago. The baseline AIRS retrieval system used initially data from the companion microwave sounders, the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AMSU-Al and AMSU-A2, to provide a "first guess" and support "cloud clearing". As these instruments suddenly failed (HSB) or gradually deteriorated (AMSU), some effort was devoted to develop a version that did not depend on microwave data. It was considered somewhat inferior to the baseline system and was kept in reserve and therefore not fully assessed. When AMSU-A2 failed, this AIRS-only system became the primary version, and a substantial effort was undertaken to fully assess its performance. We discuss details of that assessment. These capabilities have resulted from substantial investments NASA has made over the years in support of AIRS and can now be applied to next-generation systems as well.

They are: a) Instrument 1, wavelength centered at 756 nm for oxygen and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations, b) Instrument 2, centered at 1629 nm, for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) observation, c) Instrument 3, centered at 2062 nm for carbon dioxide and d) Instrument 4, centered at 2328 for carbon monoxide (CO) and methane. From low-Earth orbit, these instruments have a field-of-view of 10 to 15 degrees, and a spatial resolution of 2 km square. These instruments have a spectral resolving power ranging from ten to twenty thousand, and can monitor column-average dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) at 1.5 ppm, and methane (XCH4) at 7 ppb. These new instruments will advance the use of immersion grating technology in spectrometer instruments in order to reduce the size of the instrument, while improving performance. These compact, capable instruments are envisioned to be compatible with small satellites, yet modular to be configured to address the particular science questions at hand Here we report on the current status of the instrument design and fabrication, focusing primarily on Instruments 1 and 2. We will describe the key science and engineering requirements and the instrument performance error budget. We will discuss the optical design with particular emphasis on the immersion grating, and the advantages this new technology affords compared to previous instruments. We will also discuss the status of the focal plane array and the detector electronics and housing. Finally, we report on a new approach - developed during this instrument design process - which enables simultaneous measurement of both orthogonal polarization states (S and P) over the field-of-view and optical bandpass. We believe this polarization sensing capability will enable science observations which were previously limited by instrumental and observational degeneracies.

The P-band UAS SoOp sensor for Hydrology (UASHydro) would operate on the S2 aircraft developed by Black Swift Technologies for sensing of SWE and RZSM with a spatial resolution of about 10m. Root-zone soil moisture and snow water storage in land are critical parameters of the water cycle. The long-term goal of our development would be to use small UAS to perform regional high resolution observation of two key hydrological measurements to improve the estimation of terrestrial water storage for water management, crop production and forecasts of natural hazard The UASHydro concept utilizes passive receivers to detect the reflection of strong existing P-band radio signals at the 360-380 MHz band from geostationary Mobile Use Objective System (MUOS) communication satellites launched by the US Navy. The SWE remote sensing measurement principle using the P-band SoOp is based on the propagation delay (or phase change) of radio signals through the snowpack. The time delay of the reflected signal due to the snowpack with respect to snow-free conditions is directly proportional to the snowpack SWE, while the soil moisture can be retrieved from the reflectivity at the P-band frequencies for MUOS. We have been conducting ground-based campaigns to test the instrumentation and data processing methods at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado since February 2016. The field campaign data has provided support to the measurement concept. To install the SoOp technologies on the UAS, a lightweight antenna has been built and interfaces with the S2 built by Black Swift Technologies have been completed. A set of flights have been planned starting April 2018 through the end of 2018 in Colorado.

The application of computational models to social neuroscience: promises and pitfalls	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Computational modeling; fMRI; social learning; social decision-making	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PREDICTION ERRORS; COLLECTIVE DECISION; REWARD; BRAIN; REINFORCEMENT; IMITATION	Interactions with conspecifics are key to any social species. In order to navigate this social world, it is crucial for individuals to learn from and about others. From learning new skills by observing parents perform them tomaking complex collective decisions, understanding the mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we review studies that have used computational modelling techniques, combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several strategies tolearn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference, where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These computations are implemented indistinct neural networks, which may be recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and other social factors.

The key to its longevity has been its design as a toolkit written in ANSI-C, with each tool performing one distinct task, for easy integration into scripts, pipelines and workflows. The same code base now supports Windows, JavaScript and Python by taking advantage of recent advances in compilers. The design has led to applicability of Montage far beyond what was anticipated when Montage was first built, such as supporting observation planning for the JWST. Moreover, Montage is highly scalable and is in wide use within the IT community to develop advanced, fault-tolerant cyber-infrastructure, such as job schedulers for grids, workflow orchestration, and restructuring techniques for processing complex workflows and pipelines.

IRIS includes three natural guide star (NGS) On-Instrument Wavefront Sensors (OIWFS) to measure tip/tilt and focus errors in the instrument focal plane. NFIRAOS also has an internal natural guide star wavefront sensor, and IRIS and NFIRAOS must precisely coordinate the motions of their wavefront sensor positioners to track the locations of NGSs while the telescope is dithering (offsetting the telescope to cover more area), to avoid a costly re-acquisition time penalty. First, we present an overview of the sequencing strategy for all of the involved subsystems. We then predict the motion of the telescope during dithers based on finite-element models provided by TMT, and finally analyze latency and jitter issues affecting the propagation of position demands from the telescope control system to individual motor controllers.

The imager will have a 34 arcsec x 34 arcsec field of view with 4 milliarcsecond (mas) pixels. The IFS consists of a lenslet array and slicer, enabling four plate scales from 4 mas to 50 mas, multiple gratings and filters, which in turn will operate hundreds of individual modes. IRIS, operating in concert with NFIRAOS will pose many challenges for the data reduction system (DRS). Here we present the updated design of the real-time and post-processing DRS. The DRS will support two modes of operation of IRIS: (1) writing the raw readouts sent from the detectors and performing the sampling on all of the readouts for a given exposure to create a raw science frame; and (2) reduction of data from the imager, lenslet array and slicer IFS. IRIS is planning to save the raw readouts for a given exposure to enable sophisticated processing capabilities to the end users, such as the ability to remove individual poor seeing readouts to improve signal-to-noise, or from advanced knowledge of the point spread function (PSF). The readout processor (ROP) is a key part of the IRIS DRS design for writing and sampling of the raw readouts into a raw science frame, which will be passed to the TMT data archive. We discuss the use of sub-arrays on the imager detectors for saturation/persistence mitigation, on-detector guide windows, and fast readout science cases (< 1 second).

The resulting numerical diffraction performance predictions are quantitatively compared to that of both ideal monolithic circular pupils and classical annular pupils with straight secondary mirror struts.

SPHEREx has a simple, high-heritage design with large optical throughput to maximize spectral mapping speed. While the legacy data products will provide a rich archive of spectra for the entire astronomical community to mine, the instrument is optimized for three specific scientific goals: to probe inflation through the imprint primordial non-Gaussianity left on today's large-scale cosmological structure; to survey the Galactic plane for water and other biogenic ices through absorption line studies; and to constrain the history of galaxy formation through power spectra of background fluctuations as measured in deep regions near the ecliptic poles. The aluminum telescope consists of a heavily baffled, wide-field off-axis reflective triplet design. The focal plane is imaged simultaneously by two mosaics of H2RG detector arrays separated by a dichroic beamsplitter. SPHEREx assembles spectra through the use of mass and volume efficient linear variable filters (LVFs) included in the focal plane assemblies, eliminating the need for any dispersive or moving elements. Instead, spectra are constructed through a series of small steps in the spacecraft attitude across the sky, modulating the location of an object within the FOV and varying the observation wavelength in each exposure. The spectra will cover the wavelength range between 0.75 and 5.0 mu m at spectral resolutions ranging between R=35 and R=130. The entire telescope is cooled passively by a series of three V-groove radiators below 80K. An additional stage of radiative cooling is included to reduce the long wavelength focal plane temperature below 60K, controlling the dark current. As a whole, SPHEREx requires no new technologies and carries large technical and resource margins on every aspect of the design.

Imprinted by the history of stellar emission, the EBL in the near infrared traces light back to the birth of the first stars in the Universe and can allow tight constraints on structure formation models. Recent studies using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the first Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER-1) find that there are excess fluctuations in the EBL on large scales which have been attributed to either high redshift galaxies and quasars, or to stars that were stripped from their host galaxies during merging events. To help disentangle these two models, multi-wavelength data can be used to trace their distinctive spectral features. Following the success of CIBER-1, CIBER-2 is designed to identify the sources of the EBL excess fluctuations using data in six wavebands covering the optical and near infrared. The experiment consists of a cryogenic payload and is scheduled to launch four times on a recoverable sounding rocket. CIBER-2 has a 28.5 cm telescope coupled with an optics system to obtain wide-field images in six broad spectral bands between 0.5 and 2.5 mu m simultaneously. The experiment uses 2048 x 2048 HAWAII-2RG detector arrays and a cryogenic star tracker. A prototype of the cryogenic star tracker is under construction for a separate launch to verify its performance and star tracking algorithm. The mechanical, optical, and electrical components of the CIBER-2 experiment will have been integrated into the payload by mid-2018. Here we present the final design of CIBER-2 and our team's instrument characterization efforts. The design and analysis of the optical focus tests will be discussed. We also report on the performance of CIBER-2 support systems, including the cooling mechanisms and deployable components. Finally, we outline the remaining tasks required to prepare the payload for launch.

"Concept-1" is a cold (4 K) 9 m space telescope with five instruments, while "concept 2" consists of a cold 5.9 m telescope and four instruments, providing imaging and spectroscopic capabilities between 5 mu m and 600 mu m. The sensitivity provided by the observatory will be a three to four orders of magnitude improvement over currently achieved observational capabilities, allowing to address a wide range of new and so far inaccessible scientific questions, ranging from bio-signatures in the atmospheres of exo-planets to the production of the first metals in the universe right after the end of re-ionization. Here we present the Far Infrared Imager and Polarimeter (FIP) for OST. The camera will cover four bands, 50 mu m, 100 mu m, 250 mu m, and 500 mu m. In the "concept 1" version of the instrument, FIP will allow for differential polarimetry with the ability to observe two colors simultaneously, while all four bands can be observed simultaneously in total power mode. The confusion limit in the total power mode will be reached in only 8 ms at 500 mu m, while at 50 mu m the source density in the sky is so low that at OST's angular resolution of similar to 2" in this band the source confusion limit will only be reached after about two hours of integration with the "concept-2" version of FIP ("concept-1" FIP will not be confusion limited at 50 mu m, no matter how long it integrates). Science topics that can be addressed by the camera include, but are not limited to, galactic and extragalactic magnetic field studies, deep galaxy surveys, and outer Solar System objects.

The toplevel science objectives are to probe the physics of the Big Bang by measuring or constraining the energy scale of inflation, probe fundamental physics by measuring the number of light particles in the Universe and the sum of neutrino masses, to measure the reionization history of the Universe, and to understand the mechanisms driving the cosmic star formation history, and the physics of the galactic magnetic field. PICO would have multiple frequency bands between 21 and 799 GHz, and would survey the entire sky, producing maps of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation, of galactic dust, of synchrotron radiation, and of various populations of point sources. Several instrument configurations, optical systems, cooling architectures, and detector and readout technologies have been and continue to be considered in the development of the mission concept. We will present a snapshot of the baseline mission concept currently under development.

Although there have been failures and degraded instrument performance due to contamination, contamination control methods have been largely successful to date. However, due to improvements in technology and the desire for more sensitive science measurements, spacecraft are no longer clean enough to meet more stringent contamination requirements. New contamination control engineering methods will require institutional investments. As a first step toward identifying appropriate areas for these investments, a "brainstorming" exercise is performed addressing some of the more important areas where improvements are needed.

The approach taken to meet this requirement is to identify and model for each Mars 2020 mission phase the TOC sources, model TOC transport from sources to sample contacting surfaces, and combine them into an end-to-end model that calculates the TOC in each sample during the mission. The calculations show that Mars 2020 can achieve the TOC sample cleanliness requirement because the project has adopted specific TOC mitigations strategies.

Non-Invasive Electrical Impedance Tomography for Multi-Scale Detection of Liver Fat Content	THERANOSTICS			English	Article						Fatty Liver; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Electrical Impedance Tomography; Fat Volume Fraction	DISEASE; SPECTROSCOPY; EIT; WATER; STEATOHEPATITIS; QUANTIFICATION; MICROSCOPY; OBESITY; BODY	Introduction: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive gold standard to detect fatty liver, we demonstrate a low-cost and portable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) approach with circumferential abdominal electrodes for liver conductivity measurements. Methods and Results: A finite element model (FEM) was established to simulate decremental liver conductivity in response to incremental liver lipid content. To validate the FEM simulation, we performed EIT imaging on an ex vivo porcine liver in a non-conductive tank with 32 circumferentially-embedded electrodes, demonstrating a high-resolution output given a priori information on location and geometry. To further examine EIT capacity in fatty liver detection, we performed EIT measurements in age- and gender-matched New Zealand White rabbits (3 on normal, 3 on high-fat diets). Liver conductivity values were significantly distinct following the high-fat diet (p = 0.003 vs. normal diet, n = 3), accompanied by histopathological evidence of hepatic fat accumulation. We further assessed EIT imaging in human subjects with MRI quantification for fat volume fraction based on Dixon procedures, demonstrating average liver conductivity of 0.331 S/m for subjects with low Body-Mass Index (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)) and 0.286 S/m for high BMI (> 25 kg/m(2)). Conclusion: We provide both the theoretical and experimental framework for a multi-scale EIT strategy to detect liver lipid content. Our preliminary studies pave the way to enhance the spatial resolution of EIT as a marker for fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome.

One approach to answering that question could be a very compact, lightweight and robust microscope that is capable of rapidly imaging the contents of a 3-dimensional sample volume. To this end, we have been developing deployable digital holographic microscopes, which can also be used in the short term for terrestrial field work. A very stable "common-mode" microscope, in which two adjacent beams share several optics, has shown very good imaging performance, and has been deployed successfully to several field sites, including Greenland and Alaska. A more compact approach is our version of the lensless digital holographic microscope, which uses gradient index rod lenses to produce a pair of high numerical-aperture input beams. Sub-micron resolution has been obtained with both systems, and further performance improvements are possible.

These materials are of interest because they are pervasive in the real world, requiring the robotic vehicle to determine when to traverse or avoid them.

The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper, we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Like with all space-borne instruments, payload size, weight, and power are critically restricted by the launch vehicle capacity and available solar power. A custom integrated circuit (IC) approach naturally prevails over FPGA-based discrete solutions in these areas. Rather than concocting a system out of circuitries intended for different applications, as in [2], each component in this work is optimized along the operating principle of radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy. Running at 2.6 GHz, the presented spectrometer features a three-bit flash ADC, an 8192-point polyphase filter bank (PFB), a 2048-point FFT processor, and a billion-count accumulator (ACC), all running off clocks derived from an integrated phase locked loop (PLL). The entire system consumes a peak power of 650 mW. It achieves the highest level of integration and best efficiency among current spectrometer solutions, and serves as the baseline component for upcoming NASA astrophysics spectroscopy missions.

Despite this critical role, the importance of safety and safety culture in the natural gas industry has not been adequately highlighted. The absence of strict regulations and lack of attention towards precautionary measures have allowed the industry to persevere with insufficient urgency for implementing innovative technologies and safety-first protocols. On October 23, 2015, the Aliso Canyon natural gas accident highlighted how the lack of regulatory oversight in a low probability, high consequence industry could have such impactful and unpredictable repercussions. This paper analyzes the concatenation of events that led to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. It adopts the AcciMap methodology, which was originally introduced by Rasmussen in 1997 as an accident investigation framework, to conduct a systematic root-cause analysis and capture different involved socio-technical factors that contributed to the leak.

A thorough investigation into the lack of robustness of the narrowband algorithm has now shown that this results from systematic errors (similar to 20 nm on average) that are wavelength-dependent. We show that the seemingly continuous distribution of these chromatic errors in fact results from (at least) two independent causes. The largest and most problematic effects are due to "plateaus" of unremoved material that were covered by supports during the ion beam figuring of three of the segments, but other smaller chromatic effects are also shown to be present and these are not yet understood. If the purely chromatic effects can be eliminated, we show that the intrinsic accuracy of the narrowband algorithm is about 6 nm (surface).

We have established partnerships with several organizations to utilize the UKIRT for science projects and to support its operation. Our main partners are the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO), the East Asian Observatory (EAO), and the UKIRT microlensing team (JPL/IPAC/OSU/Vanderbilt). The USNO is working on deep northern hemisphere surveys in the H and K bands and the UKIRT microlensing team is running a monitoring campaign of the Galactic bulge. EAO, UH, and USNO have individual P.I. research programs. Most of the observations are using the Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), but the older suite of cassegrain instruments are still fully operational. Data processing and archiving continue to be done CASU and WSA in the UK. We are working on a concept to upgrade the WFCAM with new larger infrared detector arrays for substantially improved survey efficiency.	[Hodapp, K. W.; Kerr, T.; Varricatt, W.; Hall, D. N.

Radiation and conduction are the predominant heat transfer mechanisms with convection effects being minimal and difficult to characterize at 35-40 km. This greatly constrains the thermal design options and makes predicting flight thermal behaviour very difficult. Due to the limited power available on long duration balloon flights, efficient heater control is an important factor in minimizing power consumption. SuperBIT, or the Super-pressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope, aims to study weak gravitational lensing using a 0.5m modified Dall-Kirkham telescope capable of achieving 0.02 '' stability(1) and capturing deep exposures from visible to near UV wavelengths. To achieve the theoretical stratospheric diffraction-limited resolution of 0.25 '',(2) mirror deformation gradients must be kept to within 20 nm. The thermal environment must be stable on time scales of an hour and the thermal gradients on the telescope must be minimized. During its 2018 test-flight, SuperBIT will implement two types of thermal parameter solvers: one for post-flight characterization and one for in-flight control. The payload has 85 thermistors as well as pyranometers and far-infrared sensors which will be used post-flight to further understand heat transfer in the stratosphere. This document describes the in-flight thermal control method, which predicts the thermal circuit of components and then auto-tunes the heater PID gains. Preliminary ground testing shows the ability to control the components to within 0.01 K.	[Redmond, Susan; Damaren, Christopher J.; Romualdez, L.

The infrared is a powerful tool for probing transient events in dusty regions that have high optical extinction, and for detecting the coolest of stars that are bright only at these wavelengths. The fundamental roadblocks in studying the infrared time-domain have been the overwhelmingly bright sky background (250 times brighter than optical) and the narrow field-of-view of infrared cameras (largest is VISTA at 0.6 sq deg). To address these challenges, Palomar Gattini-IR is currently under construction at Palomar Observatory and we propose a further low risk, economical, and agile instrument to be located at Siding Spring Observatory, as well as further instruments which will be located at the high polar regions to take advantage of the low thermal sky emission, particularly in the 2.5 micron region.

It has long been believed that this process results in segments with little or no edge effects. As a result, this same general approach is planned for segment manufacturing for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). However, recent measurements at the Keck telescope suggest that at least some of the Keck segments have significant aberrations within 60 mm of the edge. These aberrations impact the telescope phasing and the overall telescope image quality. We present interferometric measurements of multiple Keck segments, characterizing the surface errors near the edges over spatial periods from similar to 5 cm down to similar to 1 mm. We show that the largest phasing and image quality effects are due to plateaus of unremoved material, left behind after IBF as a result of obscuration by the IBF supports. Apart from these plateaus, the edge quality is relatively good, though not as good as in the segment interiors. Some residual phasing and image quality effects remain, and these are not currently understood.

Teledyne has successfully completed the fabrication, testing, and delivery of 24 science-grade flight candidate SCAs to the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). These SCAs were made with Teledyne's TRL-9 substrate-removed MBE mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) 2.3 mu m cutoff detector material and low-noise H2RG CMOS readout chip. The SCAs are mounted on a buttable molybdenum package that enables close packing of the 16 flight SCAs in the NISP focal plane. In this paper, we present the test results of the 24 Euclid flight candidate SCAs. The key detector performance parameters that are critical to the NISP instrument are: high in-band quantum efficiency with good spatial uniformity, low readout noise, low dark current with tight distribution, low pixel crosstalk, low persistence, and good detector surface metrology profile. All 24 SCAs exceed the Euclid NISP performance and interface requirements. The additional acceptance testing at JPL and NASA Goddard's Detector Characterization Lab has also been completed. 20 flight SCAs have been delivered to European Space Agency (ESA).

Here we present a scene generator that fulfills many of these functions. Based on a modern smartphone, it has a number of good features, including high spatial resolution (13 um), high dynamic range (similar to 10(4)), near-Poisson limited illumination stability over time periods from 100 ms to many days, and no background noise. The system does not require any moving parts and may be constructed at modest cost. We present the optical, mechanical, and software design, test data validating the performance, and application examples.

The light incident on the detector from these distant exoplanets is estimated to be on the order of a few photons per pixel per hour. To measure such small signals, the project has baselined the CCD201 detector made by e2v, a low-noise and high-efficiency electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), and has instituted a rigorous test and modeling program to characterize the device prior to flight. An important consideration is detector performance degradation over the proposed mission lifetime due to radiation exposure in space. To quantify this estimated loss in performance, the project has built a detector trap model that takes into account detailed trap interactions at the sub-pixel level, including stochastic trap capture and release, and the deferment of charge into subsequent pixels during parallel and serial clocking of the pseudo-two-phase CCD201 device. This paper describes recent detector trap model improvements and modeling results.

Since its launch, NuSTAR has been the preeminent instrument for spectroscopic analysis of the hard X-ray sky over the 3-80 keV bandpass. The low energy side of the bandpass is limited by the absorption along the photon path as well as by the ability of the pixels to trigger on incident photons. The on-board calibration source does not have a low-energy line that we can use to calibrate this part of the response, so instead we use the "nearest-neighbor" readout in the NuSTAR detector architecture to calibrate the individual pixel thresholds for all 8 flight detectors on both focal plane modules (FPMs). These threshold measurements feed back into the quantum efficiency of the detectors at low (<5 keV) energies and, once well-calibrated, may allow the use of NuSTAR data below the current 3 keV limit.

SPARCS is a 6U cubesat designed to monitor M stars (0.1 - 0.6 solar masses) in two photometric bands in the near UV and far UV (S-NUV, 260-300 nm; S-FUV, 150-170 nm). SPARCS targets range in mass and age, including young stars (10-20 Myr), which are likely forming terrestrial planets, to old stars with known transiting planets, allowing us to map the evolution of UV emission and flare rates. The spectral slope, variability and evolution of a host star's high-energy radiation would provide realistic input stellar fluxes to planet atmospheric models, which would aide in understanding the evolution and habitability of a planet and in interpreting its transmission and emission spectrum. The baseline S-NUV detector is a 2D-doped (delta-doped or superlattice-doped) charge coupled device (CCD) optimized with a custom antireflection (AR) coating to achieve quantum efficiency (QE)>70% throughout the S-NUV band. The S-NUV detector would be coupled with a stand-alone red-blocking filter that provides at least three orders of magnitude (i.e., >= OD3) out-of-band suppression, critical for the observations of such cool, red stars. Their combined throughput would be >25% (peak) in the S-NUV. The baseline S-FUV detector is a 2D-doped CCD optimized for the S-FUV band; it includes an integrated filter designed to maximize in-band throughput with good red-leak suppression. As designed, the solar-blind silicon detector achieves peak QE>35% in the S-FUV band and >= OD2 out-of-band suppression. SPARCS has baselined a dichroic design that allows for simultaneous S-NUV and S-FUV observation. SPARCS would advance 2D-doped detectors and detector-integrated out-of-band-rejection filter technologies for their potential application in future mission concepts such as LUVOIR and HabEx.

The use of these designs in combination with a classical flat sensor implies an overall degradation of throughput and system performances to obtain the proper corrected image. With the recent development of curved sensor this can be avoided. This new technology has been gathering more and more attention from a very broad community, as the potential applications are multiple: from low-cost commercial to high impact scientific systems, to mass-market and on board cameras, defense and security, and astronomical community. We describe here the first concave curved CMOS detector developed within a collaboration between CNRS-LAM and CEA-LETI. This fully-functional detector 20 Mpix (CMOSIS CMV20000) has been curved down to a radius of R-c = 150 mm over a size of 24x32 mm(2). We present here the methodology adopted for its characterization and describe in detail all the results obtained. We also discuss the main components of noise, such as the readout noise, the fixed pattern noise and the dark current. Finally we provide a comparison with the flat version of the same sensor in order to establish the impact of the curving process on the main characteristics of the sensor.

The Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) is a near-infrared ultra stable precision radial velocity (RV) spectrograph commissioned on 10-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA. HPF uses a Teledyne H2RG array detector. In order to achieve the high-precision (similar to 1 m/s) RV measurements from the NIR spectrum of HPF's science target stars, it is vital to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and to accurately propagate the uncertainties. Here we present the algorithms we have developed to significantly improve the quality of flux images calculated from the up-the-ramp readout mode of H2RG. The algorithms in the tool HxRGproc presented in this manuscript are used for HPF's bias noise removal, non-linearity correction, cosmic ray correction, slope/flux and variance image calculation.

It is a fixed pattern of high frequency QE variations along 3 directions generally thought to be related to the crystal structure of HgCdTe. The pattern is evident in detectors used in WFC3/IR, WISE, JWST, and in candidate detectors for Euclid and WFIRST. Using undersampled point sources projected onto a HAWAII-2RG detector, we show that the pattern induces photometric variations that are not removed by a flat-field calibration, thus demonstrating that the QE variations occur on scales smaller than the 18 micron pixels. Our testbed is the Precision Projector Laboratory's astronomical scene generator, which can rapidly characterize the full detector by scanning thousands of undersampled spots. If not properly calibrated, detectors showing strong crosshatch may induce correlated errors in photometry, astrometry, spectroscopy, and shape measurements.

To minimize pixel overhead, the Reset Gate pulse is generated inside the dewar by a pin driver controlled by a very short pulse using an LVDS interface. Overlapping serial clocks spanning the entire pixel are made entirely triangular with slopes tuned to cancel substrate return current and minimize high frequency content to improve common rejection by the fully differential signal path. We document the trade between settling time after charge dump and linearity and illustrate the desirability of generating both Summing Well and Reset Gate edge close to the CCD. The parallel clocking overhead is exacerbated in ZTF by ganging multiple CCDs but is hidden by overlapping the parallel shift with pixel readout. To suppress fixed pattern due to the concurrent parallel clocks, slow overlapped triangular waveforms panning the entire line time are employed to null the substrate current, in the same manner as the serials. Both noise and speed requirements are exceeded on all 64 channels, with margin. At all pixel rates the median noise is as good as can be expected for differential transmission being root 2 times the single sided noise published in the data sheet for the CCD231-C6 CCDs. Linearity is preserved even at 840 ns pixel time, and crosstalk is less than 10 ppm.

Furthermore, CGI will serve as a path finder for future exo-Earth imaging and characterization missions by demonstrating wavefront control, coronagraphy, and spectral retrieval in a new contrast regime, and by validating instrument and telescope models at unprecedented levels of precision. To achieve this jump in performance, it is critical to draw on the experience of ground-based high-contrast facilities. We discuss several areas of relevant commonalities, including: wavefront control, post-processing of integral field unit data, and calibration and observing strategies.

The Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization Complex Mask Coronagraph (PIAACMC) is an attractive coronagraph option for the next generation of large space telescopes optimized for habitable exoplanet imaging: PIAACMC offers high throughput, small inner working angle (IWA) with little loss in image quality. PIAACMC is also compatible with segmented apertures, preserving much of the throughput and resolution of a full pupil. Coronagraph compatibility with segmented apertures is essential for the success of habitable planet characterization with future large apertures, such as the Large UV /Optical/Infrared (LUVOIR) concept currently under way to inform the 2020 decadal survey. We present a design of PIAACMC for a segmented aperture, using the segmented aperture currently considered for LUVOIR as a representative case. This design is optimized to be resilient to tip/tilt jitter and large stellar angular sizes. This also enables it to have improved tolerance to polarization-specific aberrations, which are dominated by low-order modes such as tip-tilt and astigmatism. We simulate and study the performance of this design using a simplified instrument model. These simulations include wavefront control and tip-tilt errors. We characterize the performance of our design in monochromatic as well as broadband light in terms of throughput, inner working angle, contrast, area of the dark zone, and sensitivity to low-order aberrations.

The finding of rocky planets in temperate orbits among our immediate stellar neighbors will be a signature discovery. Our mission will deliver relative measurements of stellar position and motion at sub-micro arcsecond precision. These data, in turn, will reveal the presence of orbiting exoplanets. For the case of our primary targets Alpha Centauri A & B, objects below one Earth mass will be accessible when the end-of-mission astrometric precision requirement of 0.4 micro arcsecond is achieved. TOLIMAN will directly reveal the presence of sub-earth mass planets and constrain it orbit and mass This paper describes the optical and mechanical architecture of the mission, and first order instrument design. We also explain the instrument stability requirements imposed by the diffractive pupil post-processing calibration limitations. Our design baseline is a stable two-mirror telescope that images the field directly on CCD camera minimizing the number of reflections and optical components.

Six wideband grating modules combine to cover the full band at R=300, each couples a long slit with 60-190 beams on the sky. OSS will have a total of 120,000 background-limited detector pixels in the six 2-D arrays which provide spatial and spectral coverage. The suite of grating modules can be used for pointed observations of targets of interest, and are particularly powerful for 3-D spectral spectral surveys. To chart the transition from interstellar material, particularly water, to planetary systems, two high-spectral-resolution modes are included. The first incorporates a Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) in front of the gratings providing resolving power of 25,000 (delta v = 12 km/s) at 179 mu m to resolve water emission in protoplanetary disk spectra. The second boosts the FTS capability with an additional etalon (Fabry-Perot interferometer) to provide 2 km/s resolution in this line to enable detailed structural studies of disks in the various water and HD lines. Optical, thermal, and mechanical designs are presented, and the system approach to the detector readout enabling the large formats is described.	[Bradford, C.

Observations using space telescopes are necessary to achieve these levels of diffracted and scattered light control. The highly reflecting metal mirrors and their coatings needed to image these very faint exoplanets introduce polarization into the wavefront, which, in turn affects image quality and reduces exoplanet yield unless corrected. To identify & create the technologies and the electro-optical/mechanical-spacecraft systems models that will achieve these levels, NASA is currently developing two mission concepts, each with their own hardware vision. These are: The Habex, a habitable planet explorer and the LUVOIR, a Large Ultra-Violet Optical-Infrared space telescope system. This paper reports the results of polarization ray-tracing the HabEx detailed optical prescription provided by the project to the authors in the fall of 2017. Diattenuation and retardance across both the exit pupil associated with the occulting mask and the exit pupil associated with the coronagraph image plane are given as well as the corresponding Jones pupil matrices. These are calculated assuming isotropic coatings on all mirrors. Analysis and physical measurements indicates that the specification of the primary mirror for exoplanet coronagraphs will need to include a constraint on spatially varying polarization reflectivity (anisotropic coatings). The Jones exit-pupil phase terms, phi XX and phi YY just before the occulting mask differ in shape and are displaced one from the other by about 10 milli-waves. This shows that A/O, which corrects for geometric path differences, cannot completely correct for wavefront errors introduced by polarization for this particular prescription for HabEx. We suggest that these differences may be corrected by adjusting the opto-mechanical design to change angles of incidence on mirrors and corrected by adjusting the design of the dielectric coatings on the highly-reflecting mirror surfaces. Super-posing the phase of XX onto the phase of YY and then correcting using A/O will assure maximum power transmittance through the system and best contrast. These aspects require further investigation.	[Breckinridge, J. B.; Kupinski, M.; Davis, J.; Daugherty, B.; Chipman, R. A.] Univ Arizona, Coll Opt Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Breckinridge, J.

Optical spectra are required to provide evidence of a life-supporting environment. Exoplanets are very faint and their optical spectra are contaminated by the spectrum of the parent star. High angular resolution provided by large apertures is needed to distinguish between the spectrum of the exoplanet and its star. Today, large aperture telescopes use segmented primary mirrors that employ close-packed hexagonal segments. The telescope primary mirror is periodically discontinuous with straight lines. These discontinuities scatter unwanted radiation from the much brighter parent star across the field of view to obscure the light from the very faint terrestrial exoplanet. These discontinuities, which mimic a diffraction grating, result in a non-uniform distribution of background light across the image plane. This non-uniformity masks or hides exoplanets from view, to reduce the number of exoplanets that can be observed with a large aperture telescope or to reduce the quality of spectra and thus lead to misinterpretation of data. Here we introduce the concept of the pinwheel pupil whose unique diffraction pattern significantly reduces the non-uniform distribution of background radiation. Diffraction patterns from pinwheel pupils are compared to the monolithic filled aperture, the classical Cassegrain, the 60-degree symmetry of the hexagonal segments (JWST, E-ELT, etc.). Diffraction "spikes" are reduced by at least 10(5). We discuss the "pinwheel pupil" advantages to spectroscopy, image processing, and observatory operations. We show that, segment fabrication of curved-sided mirrors is not more difficult than fabrication of hexagonal mirror segments. This is the report of quantitative study of Fraunhofer (far field) diffraction patterns produced by three different topologies or architectures of mirror segmentation, when illuminated by a plane wave of monochromatic white-light. A plot, in angular units of the intensity as a function of azimuth, Phi phi within annular rings at different FOVs, centered on the system axis of the diffraction pattern will be presented. The advantages of the segmented pinwheel pupil is discussed.

High-dispersion coronagraphy (HDC) may allow detection and characterization to be done simultaneously, as well as relax the starlight suppression requirements of the telescope and coronagraph. However, similar to other direct imaging techniques, HDC faces challenging thermal and/or exozodiacal background levels. In this paper, we present simulations of coronagraphic observations using a variety of space telescope apertures ranging in diameter from 1 to 15 m, specifically incorporating thermal and exozodiacal background. We investigate the effects of instrument temperature and aperture on the maximum usable wavelength, as well as the effects of exozodiacal disk inclination and thickness on observational SNR. We then identify the spectral resolutions which maximize observational SNR subject to detector noise and the required starlight suppression levels for the detection of various potential biomarker molecules (H2O, O2, CO2, and CH4).

Previous studies have investigated the effects of the inter-DM Fresnel number on achievable contrast, throughput, and tip/tilt sensitivity for apodized coronagraphs augmented with DMs to suppress diffraction from struts and segment gaps. In this paper, we build upon that previous work by directly suppressing tip/tilt sensitivity with the controller, both for coronagraphs with and without apodizers. We also explore the effects of other important design parameters such as actuator density and tip/tilt controller weighting on performance. These comprehensive coronagraph design studies are enabled by the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO) software toolbox, which provides rapid re-calculation of the DM response matrix for a variety of coronagraphs.

It is made of a 1.5-m Ritchey-Chretien telescope with a field of view of solid angle 0.4 deg(2). The wavelength range is at least 1 mu m to 4 mu m with a goal of 0.9 mu m to 5 mu m. Average resolution is 600 but with a possible trade-off to get 1000 at the longer wavelengths. The ATLAS Probe instrument is made of 4 identical spectrographs each using a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) as a multi-object mask. It builds on the work done for the ESA SPACE and Phase-A EUCLID projects. Three-mirror fore-optics re-image each sub-field on its DMD which has 2048 x 1080 mirrors 13.6 mu m wide with 2 possible tilts, one sending light to the spectrograph, the other to a light dump. The ATLAS Probe spectrographs use prisms as dispersive elements because of their higher and more uniform transmission, their larger bandwidth, and the ability to control the resolution slope with the choice of glasses. Each spectrograph has 2 cameras. While the collimator is made of 4 mirrors, each camera is made of only one mirror which reduces the total number of optics. All mirrors are aspheric but with a relatively small P-V with respect to their best fit sphere making them easily manufacturable. For imaging, a simple mirror to replace the prism is not an option because the aberrations are globally corrected by the collimator and camera together which gives large aberrations when the mirror is inserted. An achromatic grism is used instead. There are many variations of the design that permit very different packaging of the optics. ATLAS Probe will enable ground-breaking science in all areas of astrophysics. It will (1) revolutionize galaxy evolution studies by tracing the relation between galaxies and dark matter from the local group to cosmic voids and filaments, from the epoch of reionization through the peak era of galaxy assembly; (2) open a new window into the dark universe by mapping the dark matter filaments to unveil the nature of the dark Universe using 3D weak lensing with spectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energy and modification of gravity using cosmic large-scale structure; (3) probe the Milky Way's dust-shrouded regions, reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and (4) characterize asteroids and other objects in the outer solar systems.

Coronagraphs are designed to block the star's flux and obtain a high-dynamic-range image of the exoplanet. The contrast of an optical system is calculated using the point spread function (PSF). Contrast quantifies starlight suppression of an imaging system at a given separation of the two objects. Contrast requirements can be as small as 10 for earth-like planets. This work reports an analysis of the September 2017 Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) end-to-end optical system prescription for geometric and polarization aberrations across the 450 to 550 nm channel. The Lyot coronagraph was modeled with a vector vortex charge 6 mask but without adaptive optics (AO) to correct the phase of the Jones pupil. The detector plane irradiance was calculated for three states of the telescope/coronagraph system: (1) free of geometric and polarization aberrations; (2) isotropic mirror coatings throughout the end-to-end system; and (3) isotropic mirrors with form birefringence on the primary mirror. For each of these three states the system response both with and without a coronagraph mask was calculated. Two merit functions were defined to quantify the system's ability to attenuate starlight: (1) normalized polychromatic irradiance (NPI), and (2) starlight suppression factor (SSF). Both of these are dimensionless and their values are functions of position across the focal plane. The NPI is defined as the irradiance point-by-point across the detector plane with a coronagraph mask divided by the value of the on-axis irradiance without a coronagraph mask. The SSF is the irradiance point-by-point across the detector plane with a coronagraph mask divided by the point-by-point value of the irradiance across the detector plane without a coronagraph mask. Both the NPI and the SSF provide insights into coronagraph performance. Deviations from the aberration-free case are calculated and summarized in table 2. The conclusions are: (1) the HabEx optical system is well-balanced for both geometric and polarization aberrations; (2) the spatially dependent polarization reflectivity for the HabEx primary mirror should be specified to ensure the coating is isotropic; (3) AO to correct the two orthogonal polarization-dependent wavefront errors is essential.

We executed the HOSTS (Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems) survey to determine the typical amount of such exozodiacal dust around a sample of nearby main sequence stars. The majority of the data have been analyzed and we present here an update of our ongoing work. Nulling interferometry in N band was used to suppress the bright stellar light and to detect faint, extended circumstellar dust emission. We present an overview of the latest results from our ongoing work. We find seven new N band excesses in addition to the high confidence confirmation of three that were previously known. We find the first detections around Sun-like stars and around stars without previously known circumstellar dust. Our overall detection rate is 23%. The inferred occurrence rate is comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decreases from 71(-20)(+11) % for stars with previously detected mid- to far-infrared excess to 11(-4)(+9) % for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at high confidence. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal luminosity function of the dust, we find upper limits on the median dust level around all stars without previously known mid to far infrared excess of 11.5 zodis at 95% confidence level. The corresponding upper limit for Sun-like stars is 16 zodis. An LBTI vetted target list of Sun-like stars for exo-Earth imaging would have a corresponding limit of 7.5 zodis. We provide important new insights into the occurrence rate and typical levels of habitable zone dust around main sequence stars. Exploiting the full range of capabilities of the LBTI provides a critical opportunity for the detailed characterization of a sample of exozodiacal dust disks to understand the origin, distribution, and properties of the dust.

Furthering our knowledge of galaxy formation requires uniform surveys of star-forming galaxies over a large range of redshifts and environments to accurately describe star formation, supermassive black hole growth, and interactions between these processes in galaxies. The GEP design includes a 2 m diameter SiC telescope actively cooled to 4 K and two instruments: (1) An imager to detect star-forming galaxies and measure their redshifts photometrically using emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It will cover wavelengths from 10 to 400 mu m, with 23 spectral resolution R = 8 filter-defined bands from 10 to 95 mu m and five R = 3.5 bands from 95 to 400 mu m. (2) A 24 - 193 mu m, R = 200 dispersive spectrometer for redshift confirmation, identification of active galactic nuclei, and interstellar astrophysics using atomic fine-structure lines. The GEP will observe from a Sun-Earth L2 orbit, with a design lifetime of four years, devoted first to galaxy surveys with the imager and second to follow-up spectroscopy. The focal planes of the imager and the spectrometer will utilize KIDs, with the spectrometer comprised of four slit-coupled diffraction gratings feeding the KIDs. Cooling for the telescope, optics, and KID amplifiers will be provided by solar-powered cryocoolers, with a multi-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator providing 100 mK cooling for the KIDs.

Apart from providing direct access to a number of significant bio-signatures, direct-imaging in the mid-infrared can provide 1000 times or more relaxation to contrast requirements while greatly shortening the time-scales over which the system must be stable. This in turn enables tremendous relief to optical manufacturing, control and stability tolerances bringing them inline with current technology state of the art. In this paper, we explore a reference design that co-optimizes a large, segmented, linearized aperture telescope using one-dimensional phase-induced aperture apodization to provide high-contrast imaging for spectroscopic analysis. By rotating about a parent star, the chemical signatures of its planets are characterized while affording additional means for background suppression.

Correcting Distortions in the Infrared Array Camera during the Cryogenic Mission of the Spitzer Space Telescope	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2018: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 10-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope, SPIE		Spitzer Space Telescope		We describe our ongoing efforts to model the field distortions of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) during the cryogenic portion of the Spitzer Space Telescope's operations. We have compared over two million measured source positions in similar to 35,000 IRAC images with their positions in Gaia Data Release 1. Fitting 3rd and 5th order polynomials to the measured offsets, we find systematic uncertainties in IRAC-measured positions that are in the 50-60 milliarcsecond range for the 3.6 micron array, and 120-150 milliarcsecond range for the 4.5 micron array. A 5th-order fit does not appear to significantly improve the results over a 3rd order fit. However, this may be due at least partly to the failure of our current centroiding technique to account for variations in the Point Response Functions across each detector. We anticipate making several improvements in our continuing analysis, including (i) the refitting of the positions and position angles of each IRAC image using the Gaia catalog, (ii) making use of a less position-sensitive centroiding algorithm, (iii) correcting where possible for the proper motions of detected sources, and (iv) significantly increasing the number of source position measurements. Once finalized, the resulting distortion corrections will be incorporated into the headers of the archived images.

The Atacama Large Millimeter Array has produced stunning images from the ground of planetary systems in the process of formation but cannot observe the key molecules of water or O-2, due to the presence of Earth's atmosphere. The concept presented here will enable interferometric imaging with sub-arcsecond resolution of water and other key far infrared molecular species from space at a cost far lower than the flagship class interferometric missions previously proposed (i.e. ESA's ESPRIT). We present a concept for a far infrared interferometer based on a constellation of CubeSat antenna elements with a central ESPA-class correlator satellite optimized for the imaging of water in protoplanetary systems. Such a mission would produce groundbreaking images of newly forming planetary systems in a key astrophysical and astrobiological tracer, the 557 GHz ground state line of water. By leveraging recent developments in CubeSat technology, inflatable reflectors, miniaturized receiver systems and low power CMOS digital electronics, such a mission could be implemented at an Explorer level budget. In addition to the proposed astrophysics application, the developments proposed here could also find application in planetary science (FIR spectroscopy of comets and small bodies) and Earth observing (high resolution imaging of Earth from geostationary orbit).

Modeling non-scalar diffraction in the Princeton starshade testbed	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2018: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 10-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope, SPIE		Starshade; High Contrast Imaging; Optical Modeling; Vector Diffraction		Starshades provide a leading technology to enable the direct detection and spectroscopic characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. Two key aspects to advancing starshade technology are the demonstration of starlight suppression at science-enabling levels and validation of optical models at this high level of suppression. These technologies are addressed in current efforts underway at the Princeton Starshade Testbed. Recent experimental data suggest we are observing the effects of vector (non-scalar) diffraction, which are limiting the starshade's performance and preventing the scalar optical models from agreeing with experimental results at the deepest levels of suppression. This report outlines a model developed to simulate vector diffraction in the testbed using a full solution to Maxwell's equations propagating through narrow features of the starshade. We find that experimental results can be explained by vector diffraction as light traverses the thickness of the starshade mask and that our model is in rough agreement with observations. We provide simulation results of a number of starshade geometries as a first attempt to understand the relation of these effects to properties of the starshade masks. Finally, we outline a number of possible solutions aimed to minimize vector effects and to allow us to reach our milestone of 10(-9) suppression.	[Harness, Anthony; Kasdin, N.

Spitzer/IRAC Precision Photometry: A Machine Learning Approach	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2018: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 10-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope, SPIE		Spitzer; calibration; algorithms; intra-pixel sensitivity; precision photometry; exoplanets; machine learning; k-nearest neighbors	KERNELS; IRAC	The largest source of noise in exoplanet and brown dwarf photometric time series made with Spitzer/IRAC is the coupling between intra-pixel gain variations and spacecraft pointing fluctuations. Observers typically correct for this systematic in science data by deriving an instrumental noise model simultaneously with the astrophysical light curve and removing the noise model. Such techniques for self-calibrating Spitzer photometric datasets have been extremely successful, and in many cases enabled near-photon-limited precision on exoplanet transit and eclipse depths. Self-calibration, however, can suffer from certain limitations: (1) temporal astrophysical signals can become aliased as part of the instrument model; (2) for some techniques adequate model estimation often requires a high degree of intra-pixel positional redundancy (multiple samples with nearby centroids) over long time spans; (3) many techniques do not account for sporadic high frequency telescope vibrations that smear out the point spread function. We have begun to build independent general-purpose intra-pixel systematics removal algorithms using three machine learning techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (with kernel regression), Random Decision Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks. These methods remove many of the limitations of self-calibration: (1) they operate on a dedicated calibration database of approximately one million measurements per IRAC waveband (3.6 and 4.5 microns) of non-variable stars, and thus are independent of the time series science data to be corrected; (2) the database covers a large area of the "Sweet Spot, so the methods do not require positional redundancy in the science data; (3) machine learning techniques in general allow for flexibility in training with multiple, sometimes unorthodox, variables, including those that trace PSF smear. We focus in this report on the K-Nearest Neighbors with Kernel Regression technique. (Additional communications are in preparation describing Decision Forests and Neural Networks.)

For Guaranteed Time and Early Release Science Observations, over 500 hours of JWST time have been allocated to time series observations (TSOs) of transiting exoplanets. Several dedicated observing modes are available in the instrument suite, whose operations are specifically tailored to these challenging observations. MIRI, the only JWST instrument covering the wavelength range longwards of 5 mu m on JWST, will offer TSOs in two of its modes: the low resolution spectrometer, and the imager. In this paper we will describe these modes for MIRI, and discuss how they differ operationally from regular (non-TSO) observations. We will show performance estimates based on ground testing and modeling, discuss the most relevant detector effects for high precision (spectro-)photometry, and provide some guidelines for planning MIRI TSOs.

Our motivation is to be informed so that we can mitigate the impact of changing thermal conditions on science. Monitoring current trends allows us to predict future instrument performance and to adjust our recommended suite of best practices and calibrations accordingly. From this database we show that instrumental effects detrimental to high precision photometry either remain stable or improve. A uniform reduction of all IRAC light curves has never before been published, and will enable powerful science including accurate comparative studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. IRAC has been performing well throughout the warm mission and we expect performance to remain excellent.

At the same time, the models have increased in fidelity as additional parameters have been added, such as time-dependent pupil shear and mid-spatial-frequency deformations of the primary and secondary mirrors, detector effects, and reaction-wheel-speed-dependent pointing and wavefront jitter.

A primary science directive of HabEx would be to image and characterize potential habitable exoplanets around nearby stars. As such, the baseline design of the HabEx observatory includes two complimentary starlight suppression systems that reveal the reflected light from the exoplanet - an internal coronagraph instrument, and an external, formation-flying starshade occulter. In addition, two general astrophysics instruments are baselined: a high-resolution ultraviolet spectrograph, and an ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared (UV/Vis/NIR), multi-purpose, wide-field imaging camera and spectrograph.

A model of the JWST three mirror anastigmat is realized with three lenses in the form of a Cooke triplet, which provides JWST-like optical quality over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module. An Iris AO hexagonally segmented mirror stands in for the JWST primary. This setup successfully produces images extremely similar to expected JWST in-flight point spread functions (PSFs), and NIRCam images from cryotesting, in terms of the PSF morphology and sampling relative to the diffraction limit. The segmentation of the primary mirror into subapertures introduces complexity into wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) of large space based telescopes like JWST. JOST provides a platform for independent analysis of WFS&C scenarios for both commissioning and maintenance activities on such observatories. We present an update of the current status of the testbed including both single field and wide-field alignment results. We assess the optical quality of JOST over a wide field of view to inform the future implementation of different wavefront sensing algorithms including the currently implemented Linearized Algorithm for Phase Diversity (LAPD). JOST complements other work at the Makidon Laboratory at the Space Telescope Science Institute, including the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, that investigates coronagraphy for segmented aperture telescopes. Beyond JWST we intend to use JOST for WFS&C studies for future large segmented space telescopes such as LUVOIR.

How did the universe evolve in response to its changing ingredients? How common are life-bearing planets? To accomplish its scientific objectives, OST will operate at mid-and far-infrared wavelengths and offer superlative sensitivity and new spectroscopic capabilities. The OST study team will present a scientifically compelling, executable mission concept to the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astrophysics. To understand the concept solution space, our team studied two alternative mission concepts.

Our current computer model was generated for LUVOIR Architecture Option A with a 15-meter aperture, 120-segment primary mirror. The methodology and simulation results will be presented and analyzed. JPL has a long history of technology development in laser metrology and edge sensors, including work in SIM [7], Keck and TMT [8], CCAT [3] and LUVOIR [1]. We will discuss our current efforts of LUVOIR laser metrology and edge-sensor models development, showing sensitivities of sensor measurements to various LUVOIR mirror eigen-modes, removing global modes and strengthening weak modes by performing joint (hybrid) laser-metrology and edge sensing. We will define and derive an important performance metric called wavefront error multiplier (WEM), and show that WEM provides a simple link between sensor errors and the closed-loop (controlled) system wavefront error. We will show WEM values for several hybrid sensor configuration options studied. We will discuss an algorithm for mirror shape control and maintenance through segment state and wavefront estimations using joint edge-metrology sensing. We will compare simulated performance of mirror state estimation, wavefront estimation and wavefront control based on joint edge-metrology sensing among several sensor configurations, and show the impact of sensor error distributions on the segmented mirror alignment performance. Mirror shape control performance will also be evaluated in the context of imaging contrast between inner working angles (IWA) and outer working angles (OWA) of a LUVOIR coronagraph.

HabEx's Architecture A concept utilizes microthrusters as the main actuators for the attitude control system pointing mode and a fine steering piezo-electric-operated mirror is utilized in the inner fine-pointing loop of the attitude control system. Sensing is undertaken using a high-resolution, low-noise focal-plane camera that can support high readout speeds (> 100 Hz), in addition to a state-of-the-art low-order wavefront sensor, which is currently under technology development for NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).

The telescope baseline design includes a high-contrast coronagraph and a starshade to enable the direct optical detection of exoplanets as close as 70 mas to their star. In addition to the study of exoplanets, HabEx carries two dedicated instruments for general astrophysics. The first instrument is a camera enabling imaging on a 3 arc minute field of view in two bands stretching from the UV at 150 nm to the near infrared at 1800 nm. The same instrument can also be operated as a multi-object spectrograph, with resolution of 2000. The second instrument is a high-resolution UV spectrograph operating from 300 nm down to 115 nm with up to 60,0000 resolution. HabEx would provide the highest resolution UV/optical images ever obtained. Diffraction limited at 0.4 mu m, it would outperform all current and approved facilities, including the 30 m class ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs), which will achieve similar to 0.01 arcsecond resolution at near-infrared (IR) wavelengths with adaptive optics, but will be seeing-limited at optical wavelengths. HabEx would observe wavelengths inaccessible from the ground, including the UV and in optical/near-IR atmospheric absorption bands. Operating at L2, far above the Earth's atmosphere and free from the large thermal swings inherent to HST's low-Earth orbit, HabEx would provide an ultra-stable platform that will enable science ranging from precision astrometry to the most sensitive weak lensing maps ever obtained. Here we discuss the design concepts of the general astrophysics optical instruments for the proposed observatory.

The starshade is an external occulter which would be 72 m in diameter and fly some 124,000 km ahead of the telescope. A starshade instrument on board the telescope enables formation flying to maintain the starshade within 1 m of the line of sight to the star. The starshade instrument has various modes, including imaging from the near UV through to the near infrared and integral field spectroscopy in the visible band. The coronagraph would provide imaging and integral field spectroscopy in the visible band and would reach out to 1800 nm for low resolution spectroscopy in the near infrared. To provide the necessary stability for the coronagraph, the telescope would be equipped with a laser metrology system allowing measurement and control of the relative positions of the principal mirrors. In addition, a fine guidance sensor is needed for precision attitude control. The requirements for telescope stability for coronagraphy are discussed. The design and requirements on the starshade will also be discussed.

While in SPC mode, multiple sets of shaped pupil masks and focal plane masks would be available for various imaging tasks. The disk science mask set (SPC-DSM) is designed for exozodiacal disk science. With a 360 degree high contrast field of view, extending up to 20 lambda/D, the SPC-DSM provides a powerful tool to study exozodiacal dust clouds associated with stellar debris disks to gain insight of the exoplanet formation and stellar disk dynamics. We will describe the performance verification and demonstration of the SPC-DSM coronagraph as tested in the high contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at JPL. The goal of the testbed demonstration is an average contrast of 5e-9 over a 10% bandwidth centered at 565nm, in a field of view extending from 6.5 lambda/D to 20 lambda/D. We will discuss electric field conjugation, performance metrics, and model agreement as applied to the SPC-DSM.	[Marx, David; Cady, Eric; Riggs, A. J.

This talk will present a mission and instrument concept that would enable an accurate measurement of the D/H ratio on not one but several dozens of comets in a four-year mission lifetime. The instrument would utilize advanced cryogenic detectors that would allow us to measure the abundance of the para and ortho spin states of water and its isotopologues.

OST will survey the most distant galaxies to discern the rise of metals and dust and to unveil the co-evolution of galaxy and blackhole formation, study the Milky Way to follow the path of water from the interstellar medium to habitable worlds in planetary systems, and measure biosignatures from exoplanets. This paper describes the science drivers and how they drove key requirements for OST Mission Concept 2, which will operate between similar to 5 and similar to 600 microns with a JWST sized telescope. Mission Concept 2 for the OST study optimizes the engineering for the key science cases into a powerful and more economical observatory compared to Mission Concept 1.

One science case enabled by the CGI will be taking visible images and (R similar to 50) spectra of faint interplanetary dust structures present in the habitable zone of nearby sunlike stars (similar to 10 pc) and within the snow-line of more distant ones (similar to 20 pc), down to dust brightness levels commensurate with that of the solar system zodiacal cloud. Reaching contrast levels below 10(-7) at sub-arcsecond angular scales for the first time, CGI will cross an important threshold in debris disks physics, accessing disks with low enough optical depths that their structure is dominated by transport mechanisms rather than collisions. Hence, CGI will help us understand how exozodiacal dust grains are produced and transported in low-density disks around mature stars. Additionally, CGI will be able to measure the brightness level and constrain the degree of asymmetry of exozodiacal clouds around individual nearby sunlike stars in the optical, at the similar to 3x solar zodiacal emission level. This information will be extremely valuable for optimizing the observational strategy of possible future exo-Earth direct imaging missions, especially those planning to operate at optical wavelengths as well, such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR).

A key priority for the HabEx mission concept would be to leverage affordable telescope solutions that can meet challenging telescope performance requirements with a demanding program timeline. The baseline approach for HabEx is to use an unobscured, monolithic primary mirror with a coronagraph to optimize system performance. NASA is performing an initial study to investigate the feasibility of a HabEx Lite concept which would not leverage a coronagraph and would therefore, have lower exoEarth yield as a consequence, but could provide system mass, cost, and schedule advantages. The HabEx Lite concept leverages replicated, ULE (R) mirror segments to provide an attractive, alternative telescope architecture to meet the HabEx threshold mission needs. We present the initial mirror design and performance assessment for the HabEx Lite concept.

The GEP telescopes and instruments are planned to be actively cooled with the system in a sun-earth L2 halo orbit. A detailed description of the GEP mission concept is documented in [1]. Crucial to the scientific performance of GEP is the thermal architecture; it must support a range of cryogenic elements, ranging from the full telescope optical assembly at around 4 K to the far-IR focal planes consisting of kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays cooled to 100 mK. Given the mass operating at these low temperatures, the thermal system is one of the main drivers of mission cost and complexity. We present a solution to the GEP thermal design that is realizable within a probe-class envelope. The baseline system utilizes a multi-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) for the 100mK base; the ADR system also provides an intercept at 1K. ADR systems similar to that in our design have flown, and among sub-K options, ADRs offer high Carnot efficiency. The ADR rejects heat to a hybrid Joule Thompson (JT) and Stirling or PT Cryocooler with a low-temperature stage at 4 K as well as an intercept at 20 K. These coolers are also mature systems with flight heritage on most subcomponents.	[Moore, Bradley; Bradford, C.

In this paper, we examine mirror surface scatter and particulate contamination scatter as sources of background light or noise signal in large aperture terrestrial exoplanet telescope/coronagraph systems. Scattered light control to one part in 10(+10) or better is required for exoplanet exploration. We will discuss the optical fabrication tolerances necessary to minimize narrow-angle forward scatter and their relative effects upon direct imaging coronagraph instruments used to characterize terrestrial exoplanets.

Its main goal is the discovery and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. The baseline HabEx concept would use both a coronagraph and a starshade for exoplanet science. We describe an alternative, "HabEx Lite" concept, which would use a starshade (only) for exoplanet science. The benefit is lower cost: by deleting the complex coronagraph instrument; by lowering observatory mass; by relaxing tolerances and stability requirements; by permitting use of a compact on-axis telescope design; by use of a smaller launch vehicle. The scientific penalty of this lower cost option is a smaller number of detected exoplanets of all types, including exoEarth candidates, and a smaller fraction of exoplanets with measured orbits. Our approach uses a non-deployed segmented primary mirror, whose manufacture is within current capabilities.

The goal of FALCO is to provide a free, modular framework for the simulation or testbed operation of several common types of coronagraphs. FALCO includes routines for pair-wise probing estimation of the complex electric field and Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) control, and we ask the community to contribute other wavefront correction algorithms. FALCO utilizes and builds upon PROPER, an established optical propagation library. The key innovation in FALCO is the rapid computation of the linearized response matrix for each deformable mirror (DM), which facilitates re-linearization after each control step for faster DM-integrated coronagraph design and wavefront correction experiments. FALCO is freely available as source code in MATLAB at github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab and will be available later this year in Python 3 at github.com/ajeldorado/falco-python.	[Riggs, A. J.

It is well known that pupil obscurations degrade coronagraphic performance and complicate coronagraph design, so HabEx is planned to have an off-axis, unobscured primary mirror. We utilize the circular symmetry of the aperture to investigate 1D-radial coronagraph optimization methods that are prohibitively time-consuming or intractable in 2D, such as diffractive pupil remapping and concurrent, multi-plane optimization. We also directly constrain sensitivities to dynamic, low-order Zernike aberrations, which are separable in polar coordinates and can thus be propagated as 1D-radial integrals. The mask technologies in our designs claim heritage from the extensive modeling and testbed experiments performed by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) project. In this paper, we detail our optimization methods and outline future work to complete our design survey.	[Riggs, A. J.

In order to characterize, predict, and optimize the performance of the instrument, we present a detailed model of the IFS in the context of the new OS6 observing scenario. The simulation includes spatial, spectral, and temporal variations of the speckle field on the IFS detector plane, which allows us to explore several post-processing methods and assess what gains can be expected.

The quest for the optimal optical coronagraph designs has made rapid progress in recent years thanks to the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) initiative led by the Exoplanet Exploration Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a result, several types of high-performance designs have emerged that make use of dual deformable mirrors to (1) correct for optical aberrations and (2) suppress diffracted starlight from obstructions and discontinuities in the telescope pupil. However, the algorithms used to compute the optimal deformable mirror surface tend to be computationally intensive, prohibiting large scale design surveys. Here, we utilize the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO), a tool that allows for rapid optimization of deformable mirror shapes, to explore trade-offs in coronagraph designs for obstructed and segmented space telescopes. We compare designs for representative shaped pupil Lyot and vortex coronagraphs, two of the most promising concepts for the LUVOIR space mission concept. We analyze the optical performance of each design, including their throughput and ability to passively suppress light from partially resolved stars in the presence of low-order aberrations. Our main result is that deformable mirror based apodization can sufficiently suppress diffraction from support struts and inter-segment gaps whose widths are on the order of similar to 0.1% of the primary mirror diameter to detect Earth-sized planets within a few tens of milliarcseconds from the star.

In this first installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from off-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would benefit our community to clearly define quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection significance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise.

Since its birth in 2016, this testbed, named as Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed, has demonstrated several crucial technological milestones: Broadband high contrast demonstration in both Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and Shape Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) modes while the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem senses and corrects the dynamic flight-like wavefront disturbances. In this paper, we present up-to-date progress of HLC mode demonstration in the OMC testbed. While injecting the fiight-like low photon flux starlight with expected Line of Sight (LoS) and Wavefront Error (WFE) perturbation to the OMC testbed, we demonstrate generating high contrast dark hole images. We first study the expected photon flux in actual flight environment, and estimate detection noise and estimation accuracy of the complex electric field if the wavefront sensing algorithm is used based on the pair-wise difference imaging. Then, we introduce our improved scheme to mitigate this photon-starved flight-like low flux environment. As a result, we generate a dark hole that meets the WFIRST raw contrast requirements using the 2nd magnitude star light. We establish the key ideas, describe test setups, and demonstrate test results with data analysis.

The WFIRST CGI LOWFS/C subsystem will use the Zernike wavefront sensor, which has a phase-shifting disk combined with the coronagraph's focal plane mask, to sense the low-order wavefront drift and line-of-sight (LoS) error using the rejected starlight. The dynamic tests on JPL's Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) Testbed have demonstrated that LOWFS/C can maintain coronagraph contrast to better than 10(-8) in presence of WFIRST-like line of sight and low order wavefront disturbances in both Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) and Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) modes. However, the previous dynamic tests have been done using a bright source with photon flux equivalent to stellar magnitude of M-V = -3.5. The LOWFS/C technology development on the OMC testbed has since then concentrated in evaluating and improving the LOWFS/C performance under the realistic photon flux that is equivalent to WFIRST Coronagraph target stars. Our recent testbed tests have demonstrated that the LOWFS/C can work cohesively with the stellar light suppression wavefront control, which brings broad band coronagraph contrast from similar to 1x10(-6) to 6x10(-9), while LOWF/C is simultaneously suppressing the WFIRST like LoS and low order wavefront drift disturbances on a source that photon flux is equivalent to a M-V = 2 star. This lab demonstration mimics the CGI initial dark hole establish process on a bright reference star. We have also demonstrated on the testbed that LOWFS/C can maintain the coronagraph contrast by suppressing the WFIRST like line-of-sight disturbances on a fainter M-V = 5 star. This mimics scenario of CGI science target observations. In this paper we will present the recent dynamic testbed performance results of LOWFS/C LoS loops and low order wavefront error correction loop on the flight like photon flux.

FALCO rapidly calculates the linearized deformable mirror (DM) response matrices, also called control Jacobians, and can be used for the design, simulation, or testbed operation of several types of coronagraphs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optical propagation used in FALCO is accurate and matches PROPER. In addition, we demonstrate the drastic reduction in runtime when using FALCO for DM Jacobian calculations instead of the conventional method used, for example with a model of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). We then compare the relative accuracy between optical models in FALCO and PROPER.	[Sidick, Erkin; Riggs, A. J.

In such a system the actuators of the deformable mirrors would be used for two purposes: To flatten the overall wavefront errors at a system pupil, and to create "dark-holes". The actuators have limited stroke ranges. Therefore, if the pupil phase errors are relatively large, flattening them completely could use up a significant portion of the actuator stroke, sometimes leaving insufficient stroke for creating the dark-holes. We have investigated the impact of partially-corrected pupil phase errors on a Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) broadband contrast performance. The predicted broadband contrast floor agrees well with those measured on the HLC testbed.

The majority of nearby FGK stars are located in multi-star systems, including the Alpha Centauri stars which may represent the best quality targets for the CGI on account of their proximity and brightness potentially allowing the direct imaging of rocky planets. However, a binary system exhibits additional leakage from the off-axis companion star that may be brighter than the target exoplanet. Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is a wavefront-control technique that allows suppression of starlight of both stars in a binary system thus enabling direct imaging of circumstellar planets in binary star systems such as Alpha Centauri. We explore the capabilities of the WFIRST CGI instrument to directly image multi-star systems using MSWC. We consider several simulated scenarios using the WFIRST CGI's Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) Wide-Field Imaging Mode. First, we consider close binaries such as Mu Cassiopeia that require no modifications to the WFIRST CGI instrument and can be implemented as a purely algorithmic solution. Second, we consider wide binaries such as Alpha Centauri that require a diffraction grating to enable suppression of the off-axis starlight leakage at Super-Nyquist separations. We demonstrate via simulation dark holes in 10% broadband compatible with the WFIRST CGI.

However, the increased complexity of their aperture geometry, due to the central obstruction, support structures and segment gaps, makes high-contrast imaging very challenging. The High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed was designed to study and develop solutions for such telescope pupils using wavefront control and coronagraphic starlight suppression. The testbed design has the flexibility to enable studies with increasing complexity for telescope aperture geometries starting with off-axis telescopes, then on-axis telescopes with central obstruction and support structures - e.g. the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) - up to on-axis segmented telescopes, including various concepts for a Large UV, Optical, IR telescope (LUVOIR). In the past year, HiCAT has made significant hardware and software updates in order to accelerate the development of the project. In addition to completely overhauling the software that runs the testbed, we have completed several hardware upgrades, including the second and third deformable mirror, and the first custom Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) optimized for the HiCAT aperture, which is similar to one of the possible geometries considered for LUVOIR. The testbed also includes several external metrology features for rapid replacement of parts, and in particular the ability to test multiple apodizers readily, an active tip-tilt control system to compensate for local vibration and air turbulence in the enclosure. On the software and operations side, the software infrastructure enables 24/7 automated experiments that include routine calibration tasks and high-contrast experiments. In this communication we present an overview and status update of the project, both on the hardware and software side, and describe the results obtained with APLC wavefront control.

One NASA mission concept that could serve as the platform to realize this scientific breakthrough is the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR). Such a mission would also address a broad range of topics in astrophysics with a multi-wavelength suite of instruments. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph design families that the community is assessing as part of NASAs Exoplanet Exploration Program Segmented aperture coronagraph design and analysis (SCDA) team. The APLC is a Lyot-style coronagraph that suppresses starlight through a series of amplitude operations on the on-axis field. Given a suite of seven plausible segmented telescope apertures, we have developed an object-oriented software toolkit to automate the exploration of thousands of APLC design parameter combinations. This has enabled us to empirically establish relationships between planet throughput and telescope aperture geometry, inner working angle, bandwidth, and contrast level. In parallel with the parameter space exploration, we have investigated several strategies to improve the robustness of APLC designs to fabrication and alignment errors. We also investigate the combination of APLC with wavefront control or complex focal plane masks to improve inner working angle and throughput. Preliminary scientific yield evaluations based on design reference mission simulations indicate the APLC is a very competitive concept for surveying the local exoEarth population with a mission like LUVOIR.

The Venus Airglow Measurements and Orbiter for Seismicity (VAMOS) mission concept uses the fact that the dense Venusian atmosphere conducts seismic vibrations from the surface to the airglow layer of the ionosphere, as observed on Earth. Similarly, atmospheric gravity waves have been observed by the European Venus Express's Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) instrument. Such observations would enable VAMOS to determine the crustal structure and ionospheric variability of Venus without approaching the surface or atmosphere. Equipped with an instrument of modest size and mass, the baseline VAMOS spacecraft is designed to fit within an ESPA Grande form factor and travel to Venus predominantly under its own power. Trade studies have been conducted to determine mission architecture robustness to launch and rideshare opportunities. The VAMOS mission concept was studied at JPL as part of the NASA Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program, which has not only produced a viable and exciting mission concept for a Venus SmallSat, but has also examined many issues facing the development of SmallSats for planetary exploration, such as SmallSat solar electric propulsion, autonomy, telecommunications, and resource management that can be applied to various inner solar system mission architectures.

PICO will probe the physics of the Big Bang and the energy scale of inflation, constrain the sum of neutrino masses, measure the growth of structures in the universe, and constrain its reionization history by making full sky maps of the cosmic microwave background with sensitivity 80 times higher than the Planck space mission. With bands at 21-799 GHz and arcmin resolution at the highest frequencies, PICO will make polarization maps of Galactic synchrotron and dust emission to observe the role of magnetic fields in Milky Way's evolution and star formation. We discuss PICO's optical system, focal plane, and give current best case noise estimates. The optical design is a two-reflector optimized open-Dragone design with a cold aperture stop. It gives a diffraction limited field of view (DLFOV) with throughput of 910 cm(2)sr at 21 GHz. The large 82 square degree DLFOV hosts 12,996 transition edge sensor bolometers distributed in 21 frequency bands and maintained at 0.1 K. We use focal plane technologies that are currently implemented on operating CMB instruments including three-color multi-chroic pixels and multiplexed readouts. To our knowledge, this is the first use of an open-Dragone design for mm-wave astrophysical observations, and the only monolithic CMB instrument to have such a broad frequency coverage. With current best case estimate polarization depth of 0.65 mu K-CMB-arcmin over the entire sky, PICO is the most sensitive CMB instrument designed to date.

To accomplish this, the optical system must suppress diffracted light from the star to reveal point sources approximately ten orders of magnitude fainter than the host star at small angular separation. Coronagraphs with microdot apodizers achieve the theoretical performance needed to image Earth-like planets with a range of possible telescope designs, including those with obscured and segmented pupils. A test microdot apodizer with various bulk patterns (step functions, gradients, and sinusoids) and 4 different dot sizes (3 mu m, 5 rho m, 7 mu m, and 10 mu m) made of small chrome squares on anti-reflective glass was characterized with microscopy, optical laser interferometry, as well as transmission and reflectance measurements at wavelengths lambda=600 nm and lambda=800 nm. Microscopy revealed the microdots were fabricated to high precision. Results from laser interferometry showed that the phase shifts observed in reflection vary with the local microdot fill factor. This effect is not explained purely by interference between reflected fields from the chrome and glass portions. Transmission measurements showed that microdot fill factor and transmission were linearly related for dot sizes >= 5 mu m. However, anomalously high transmittance was measured when the dot size is <5x the wavelength (i.e. similar to 3 mu m) and the fill factor is approximately 50%, where the microdot pattern becomes periodic. The transmission excess is not as prominent in the case of larger dot sizes suggesting that it is likely to be caused by the interaction between the incident field and electronic resonances in the surface of the metallic microdots.

Built upon features of recently testbed validated model, it is further refined to combine a full Fresnel propagation diffraction model for high accuracy contrast truth evaluation, and an economical compact model for WFC purposes. Extensive individual raw contrast error sensitivities are evaluated systematically, both as known imperfections and as unknown calibration errors, for two CGI modes: spectroscopy mode and wide field-of-view mode with shaped pupil coronagraph. More than 90 distinct error items were identified, including system aberrations, optical misalignment, component fabrication errors, telescope interface related errors, etc. The result forms the basis for raw contrast error budget flow down to a sub-system level, where detailed specifications needed to aid in component design and manufacturing, mechanical alignment and instrument integration, and verification and validation operations. Evaluations are automated, making it relatively easy for repeat runs of revised design or at new desired error quantity. Observations from the comprehensive analysis and top error sensitivities and contrast floor contributors are noted and discussed. Error budget flowdown process is also briefly described.

After having sketched the elementary definitions, we introduce the advanced notion of conditional expectation of a random variable with respect to a given sigma-field. The intuitive meaning of the conditional expectation is the best prediction we can do about the values taken by the random variable, once we have observed the family of events inside the sigma-field. The conditional expectation is widely used in the theory of stochastic processes we will present in the following chapters.

The description of Markov chains will allow us to introduce the central topic of thermalization and approach to equilibrium of random motions, that is the existence of asymptotic laws to which the Markov chains converge, in a sense that will be made rigorous.

Sampling a random variable X, for example real valued, means using a random number generator to generate n real numbers (x(1), ... , x(n)), realizations of a sample (X-1, ... , X-n) of independent and identically distributed random variables sharing the same law as X. The ability of sampling is crucial to deal with integrals in high dimensions, appearing in quantum mechanics and in statistical physics, and gives the possibility to simulate physical systems. We first introduce simple tools to sample random variables, that can be used only in quite special situations. In the last part of the chapter, we will introduce and discuss a very general sampling technique, relying on the Metropolis theorem.

Starting from the study of the randomly-driven motion of a pollen grain, first observed by the botanist Robert Brown, the brownian motion has become the cornerstone of the theory of stochastic processes in the continuum. The brownian motion is a sort of meeting point of several aspects of abstract mathematics, theoretical physics and real-world applications. We present first an heuristic description of it due to Einstein's genius, and then we provide a rigorous definition, taking the opportunity to introduce important definitions of stochastic processes theory. Afterwards, we define the transition probability, the generalization of the transition matrix of Markov chains. We also present the intriguing connection with Feynman's path integral and Quantum Mechanics: the brownian motion is the free particle motion in (imaginary time) quantum mechanics. Finally, we start exploring a deep connection existing between the theory of stochastic processes and the theory of partial differential equations: the brownian motion is related to the celebrated heat equation.

Stochastic processes describe time-dependent random phenomena, generalizing the usual deterministic evolution. The description of the latter requires the notions of differential and integral, which need to be properly extended to stochastic properties. Stochastic calculus is the branch of mathematics dealing with this important topic. The reason why traditional calculus is not suitable for stochastic processes is revealed by the Brownian motion. Since Var(B-t) = t, implying that B-t "scales" as root t, its trajectories are not differentiable in the usual sense. The stochastic calculus allows us to introduce generalized notions of differential and integral, notwithstanding this difficulty. Moreover, it allows to write differential equations involving stochastic processes, providing thus a powerful generalization of ordinary differential equations to study phenomena evolving in time in a non deterministic way.

In particular we will introduce the generalized heat equation, as well as the more general Feynman-Kac equation, underlying the path integral formalism and the Schrodinger equation in imaginary time.

The single-photon-counting detector arrays that are used to sense this beacon under photon-starved conditions may be count-rate limited due to blocking from detector quench times and other readout circuit constraints. This blocking effect reduces the effective detection efficiency in a non-uniform manner over the array, changing the photon counting channel model and degrading the performance of uplink centroiding algorithms. In this paper, we discuss an uplink beacon centroiding algorithm and the impact of detector blocking on this algorithm. Statistical models of detector output data and centroiding observables are presented based upon analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and measured laboratory data, incorporating realistic effects such as beacon signal parameters and Earth background. A simple blocking compensation algorithm is presented and shown to mitigate the effect of blocking, allowing one to maintain sub-microradian centroiding errors under channel conditions representative of deep space optical links.

FPGA design rules such as power conditioning and signal integrity for properly interfacing high speed FPGA with its interface circuits are discussed in this paper as it relates to aerospace systems. Signal integrity to avoid crosstalk within a FPGA has not been a great concern because most of the attention over the years had been on signal integrity at the PCB level.

The spacecraft contains a ground penetrating radar, consisting of an array of four VHF antennas, that will characterize the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa. Measured far-field radiation patterns and reflection coefficients above a 50x80m perfect ground plane are compared to predicted results using commercial software. Normalized Far-Field radiation pattern cuts are measured utilizing a biconical antenna and receiver mounted on a flying drone. Simulations of the radiation pattern show that the number of lobes increases with the distance of the antenna from the ground due to the ground-bounce phenomenon. In addition, the measured and simulated reflection coefficients stay unchanged for height above 2 meters, which matches the predicted calculation of the reactive-near field region of this antenna. However, the antenna electrical parameters are optimized for use on the spacecraft and become detuned in the presence of a ground plane. Simulated and measured return loss discrepancy less than 0.5 dB is presented. Radiation pattern comparisons show similar agreement when taking into account the effect of far-field measurement uncertainties.

It was independently proved by Shapley, Folkman and Starr (1969) and by Emerson and Greenleaf (1969) that A(k) approaches the convex hull of A in the Hausdorff distance induced by the Euclidean norm as k goes to infinity. We explore in this survey how exactly A(k) approaches the convex hull of A, and more generally, how a Minkowski sum of possibly different compact sets approaches convexity, as measured by various indices of non-convexity. The non-convexity indices considered include the Hausdorff distance induced by any norm on R-n, the volume deficit (the difference of volumes), a non-convexity index introduced by Schneider (1975), and the effective standard deviation or inner radius. After first clarifying the interrelationships between these various indices of non-convexity, which were previously either unknown or scattered in the literature, we show that the volume deficit of A(k) does not monotonically decrease to 0 in dimension 12 or above, thus falsifying a conjecture of Bobkov et al. (2011), even though their conjecture is proved to be true in dimension 1 and for certain sets A with special structure. On the other hand, Schneider's index possesses a strong monotonicity property along the sequence A(k), and both the Hausdorff distance and effective standard deviation are eventually monotone (once k exceeds n). Along the way, we obtain new inequalities for the volume of the Minkowski sum of compact sets (showing that this is fractionally superadditive but not supermodular in general, but is indeed supermodular when the sets are convex), falsify a conjecture of Dyn and Farkhi (2004), demonstrate applications of our results to combinatorial discrepancy theory, and suggest some questions worthy of further investigation.

The complex mask is a multi-zone, phase-shifting mask comprised of tiled hexagons which vary in depth. Complex masks can be difficult to fabricate as there are many micron-scale hexagonal zones (> 500 on average) with continuous depths ranging over a few microns. Ensuring the broadband PIAACMC design performance carries through to fabricated devices requires that these complex masks are manufactured to within well-defined tolerances. We report on a simulated tolerance analysis of a "toy" PIAACMC design which characterizes the effect of common microfabrication errors on on-axis contrast performance using a simple Monte Carlo method. Moreover, the tolerance analysis provides crucial information for choosing a fabrication process which yields working devices while potentially reducing process complexity. The common fabrication errors investigated are zone depth discretization, zone depth errors, and edge artifacts between zones.

This contribution is the final part of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the workshop, and presents an overview of novel optical technologies and systems that are implemented or considered for high-contrast imaging instruments on both ground-based and space telescopes. The overall objective of high contrast instruments is to provide direct observations and characterizations of exoplanets at contrast levels as extreme as 10(-)(10). We list shortcomings of current technologies, and identify opportunities and development paths for new technologies that enable quantum leaps in performance. Specifically, we discuss the design and manufacturing of key components like advanced deformable mirrors and coronagraphic optics, and their amalgamation in "adaptive coronagraph" systems. Moreover, we discuss highly integrated system designs that combine contrast-enhancing techniques and characterization techniques (like high-resolution spectroscopy) while minimizing the overall complexity. Finally, we explore extreme implementations using all-photonics solutions for ground-based telescopes and dedicated huge apertures for space telescopes.

The primary function of a starshade is to suppress light from a target star such that its orbiting planets are revealed. In order to do so, the optical edges of the starshade must maintain their precise in-plane profile to produce the necessary apodization function. However, an equally important consideration is the interaction of these edges with light emanating from our own Sun as scattered and/or diffracted sunlight can significantly degrade the achievable contrast. This paper describes the technical efforts performed to obtain precision, low-scatter optical edges for future starshades. Trades between edge radius (i.e. sharpness) and surface reflectivity have been made and small-scale coupons have been produced using scalable manufacturing processes. A custom scattered light testbed has been developed to quantify the magnitude of scattered light over all sun angles. Models have also been developed to make predictions on the level of reflected and/or diffracted light for various edge architectures. The results of these studies have established a current baseline approach which implements photochemical etching techniques on thin metal foils.

These concepts currently call for apertures as large as 15 m (LUVOIR), and operational temperatures as low as 4 Kelvin (OST). Advanced mirror technologies, such as those implementing a high degree of actuation at the primary, can help to overcome the challenges associated with these missions by providing in-situ wavefront correction capabilities. Active mirrors can also greatly reduce the cost/complexity associated with mirror fabrication as well as system I&T as on-orbit performance specifications can be achieved under a variety of test conditions (i.e. room/cryogenic temperatures, 0g/lg). JPL has significant experience in this area for visible/near-infrared applications, however future mission requirements create a new set of challenges for this technology. This paper presents design, analysis, and test results for lightweight silicon-carbide mirrors with integrated actuation capabilities. In particular, studies have been performed to test the performance of these mirrors at cryogenic temperatures.

This transition was motivated by the cost and complexity of large, monolithic optical surfaces. Space telescopes, driven by the same practicalities, are beginning to make this same transition. The challenge is to accurately phase these apertures such that they behave as a single monolithic mirror. Here we introduce a new method for this co-alignment based upon a classic knife-edge technique. The advantage of this method is: 1) it has a very large dynamic range, 2) it works with broadband light and is therefore very photon efficient, 3) it requires only a single mechanism and single sensor, 4) it works equally well with sparsely filled apertures as well as filled apertures, 5) it phases all the segments simultaneously, 6) requires no additional segment motion diversity for sensing. In this paper, we review the knife-edge method, provide context for the segment phasing problem, perform numerical simulations of the sensor, and provide preliminary laboratory confirmation of this method with a demonstration with a segmented deformable mirror.

The receiver front end features a subharmonic Schottky diode mixer that is driven by a high output all-Schottky multiplier local oscillator (LO) source. The multiplier chain consists of a 38 GHz oscillator followed by cascaded triplers at 114 GHz, 343 GHz and 1.03 THz to produce similar to 1 mW of LO power. The receiver is characterized for sensitivity between room temperature and 70 K. Additional data is presented demonstrating the receiver stability in terms of Allan time.

It is expected that the resulting increase in temperature causes up regulation of cellular mechanisms, e.g. increased rate of action potential (AP) generation. However, some studies have demonstrated the opposite. Here we show, using a simple computer model of a neuron, the passive cell parameters (affected by MMW exposure) that might be responsible for the suppression of action potentials (AP) even with temperature increases of as much as 10 degrees C.

Super-resolution is performed in time using a variational approach. By temporal super-resolution, we mean recovering rapidly evolving events that were corrupted by the induced blur of the sensor. A blurred sequence of observations is assumed to have been generated by convolution of a physical scene with a temporal rectangular convolution kernel whose support is the sensor exposure time. We solve the deconvolution problem using the Split-Bregman method. Such methodology is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing, which lead to unprecedented efficiencies for solving image reconstruction problems. We test our method using a simulated temporally blurred and noisy temporal precipitation sequence and show that our method significantly reduces the errors in the corrupted sequence.

Detection is typically accomplished in less one second. The detection method is solar blind and can be employed at standoff distances up to 5 m or more without interference from natural or man-made light sources. By this method, unknown suspicious powders, that potentially contain biological hazards, are automatically triaged using a four-step sequential iteration of Principal Component Analysis methods using pre-determined eigenvector sets to: 1) detect and differentiate whether a sample is bio or non-bio; 2) whether the detected bio is microbial, protein, or plant; 3) if microbial, whether the sample is a bacterial cell or spore, yeast, fungi, or fungal spore; and 4) to provide some higher level of cellular differentiability. The same method is also applicable to a wide range of chemical agents and explosives materials. The method and related instruments employ sample excitation at 248.6 nm and detection over a spectral range from 250 nm to below 350 nm, a spectral region blind to solar and most man-made light sources. Detection and classification is accomplished in less a few seconds. Sample detection and classification rates can be over 20 per second. Fully integrated and self-contained hand-held instruments are presently under development with an overall weight less than about 8 lbs, including a battery for over 8 hours of typical use. The standoff detection range is nominally 5 cm to 5 m.	[Hug, W. F.; Sijapati, K.; Nguyen, Q.; Oswal, P.; Reid, R.

We propose an explicit conjectural description for the rectangular colored homology of torus knots, and identify the new gradings in this context. While some of these structures have a natural interpretation in the physical realization of knot homologies based on counting supersymmetric configurations (BPS states, instantons, and vortices), others are completely new. They suggest new geometric and physical realizations of colored HOMFLYPT homology as the Hochschild homology of the category of branes in a Landau-Ginzburg B-model or, equivalently, in the mirror A-model. Supergroups and supermanifolds are surprisingly ubiquitous in all aspects of this work.

The contrast function is supposed to have a compact support, while the infinite interface is a local perturbation of the xi-axis. For an acoustically impenetrable interface, the scattering phenomenon occurs in one half-plane only and the impedance (Robin) boundary value problem is investigated. In the penetrable case, we study a transmission problem in two half-planes. Our approach for forward scattering is based on the finite element method in a truncated bounded domain coupled with the boundary element method. Numerical experiments are tested to verify our scheme. For the inverse problem, we prove that the near-field data of a finite number of incoming plane waves or a single point source wave uniquely determine the shape of a rectangular cavity of impedance-type.

The dual problem, where the parity check matrix has a support constraint, comes up in the design of locally repairable codes. The central problem here is to design codes with the largest possible minimum distance, subject to the given support constraint on the generator matrix. An upper bound on the minimum distance can be obtained through a set of singleton bounds, which can be alternatively thought of as a cut-set bound. Furthermore, it is well known that, if the field size is large enough, any random generator matrix obeying the support constraint will achieve the maximum minimum distance with high probability. Since random codes are not easy to decode, structured codes with efficient decoders, e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, are much more desirable. The GM-MDS conjecture of Dau et al states that the maximum minimum distance over all codes satisfying the generator matrix support constraint can be obtained by a Reed Solomon code. If true, this would have significant consequences. The conjecture has been proven for several special case: when the dimension of the code k is less than or equal to five, when the number of distinct support sets on the rows of the generator matrix m, say, is less than or equal to three, or when the generator matrix is sparsest and balanced. In this paper, we report on further progress on the GM-MDS conjecture.(1) In particular, we show that the conjecture is true for all m less than equal to six. This generalizes all previous known results (except for the sparsest and balanced case, which is a very special support constraint).

A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek et al., alongside novel applications in DNA storage, have reignited the interest in this longstanding open problem. In spite of recent advances, the amount of redundancy in existing codes is still orders of magnitude away from being optimal. In this paper, a novel approach for constructing binary two-deletion correcting codes is proposed. By this approach, parity symbols are computed from indicator vectors (i.e., vectors that indicate the positions of certain patterns) of the encoded message, rather than from the message itself. Most interestingly, the parity symbols and the proof of correctness are a direct generalization of their counterparts in the Varshamov-Tenengolts construction. Our techniques require 7 log(n) + o(log(n) redundant bits to encode an n-bit message, which is near-optimal.

Quadratically Constrained Channels with Causal Adversaries	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUN 17-22, 2018	Vail, CO	IEEE, IEEE Informat Theory Soc, NSF, Huawei, Qualcomm			CAPACITY	We consider the problem of communication over a channel with a causal jamming adversary subject to quadratic constraints. A sender Alice wishes to communicate a message to a receiver Bob by transmitting a real-valued length-n codeword x = (x(1), ... , x(n)) through a communication channel. Alice and Bob do not share common randomness. Knowing Alice's encoding strategy, a jammer James chooses a real-valued length-n adversarial noise sequence s = (s(1), ... , s(n)) in a causal manner: each s(t) (1 <= t <= n) can only depend on (x(1), ... , x(t)). Bob receives y, the sum (over R) of Alice's transmission x and James' jamming vector s, and is required to reliably estimate Alice's message from this sum. In addition, Alice and James's transmission powers are restricted by quadratic constraints P > 0 and N > 0 such that Sigma(n)(t=1) x(t)(2) <= nP and Sigma(n)(t=1) s(t)(2) <= nN. In this work, we characterize the channel capacity for such a channel as the limit superior of the optimal values C-n (P/N) of a series of optimizations. Upper and lower bounds on C-n (P/N) are provided both analytically and numerically. Interestingly, unlike many communication problems, in this causal setting Alice's optimal codebook may not have a uniform power allocation - for certain SNR a codebook with a two-level uniform power allocation results in a strictly higher rate than a codebook with a uniform power allocation would.

We present an exact performance analysis of a recently proposed convex-optimization-formulation for this problem, known as PhaseMax. Standard convex-relaxation-based methods in phase retrieval resort to the idea of "lifting" which makes them computationally inefficient, since the number of unknowns is effectively squared. In contrast, PhaseMax is a novel convex relaxation that does not increase the number of unknowns. Instead it relies on an initial estimate of the true signal which must be externally provided. In this paper, we investigate the required number of measurements for exact recovery of the signal in the large system limit and when the linear measurement matrix is random with iid standard normal entries. If n denotes the dimension of the unknown complex signal and m the number of phaseless measurements, then in the large system limit, m/n > 4/cos(2)(theta) measurements is necessary and sufficient to recover the signal with high probability, where theta is the angle between the initial estimate and the true signal. Our result indicates a sharp phase transition in the asymptotic regime which matches the empirical result in numerical simulations.

Linear Rate-Compatible Codes with Degree-1 Extending Variable Nodes Under Iterative Decoding	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUN 17-22, 2018	Vail, CO	IEEE, IEEE Informat Theory Soc, NSF, Huawei, Qualcomm			PARITY-CHECK CODES; RAPTOR CODES	rate-compatible (RC) code first transmits a set of symbols corresponding to the highest rate. These symbols form the highest-rate code (HRC). If requested by the receiver, the transmitter subsequently sends symbols that lower the rate of the code. Additional symbols are sent until the decoder decodes to a codeword or all symbols of the RC code are exhausted. Consider linear, RC low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed using extending variable nodes of degree 1. That is, every symbol of incremental redundancy (IR) is a linear combination only of symbols of the HRC. We study the convergence of such codes under iterative decoding. We show that the convergence criterion considered after each iteration need only check whether the HRC variable nodes have converged to a codeword. Specifically, there is no need to consider whether the parity checks that generate the IR symbols are satisfied. We substantiate these claims with simulation results of protograph-based raptor-like LDPC (PBRL) codes, which are a family of protograph RC-LDPC codes with the extending structure under consideration. Furthermore, we demonstrate using examples that this extending structure for protograph RC codes is not very far from the optimal extension for a protograph RC code by providing examples of iterative decoding thresholds for PBRL protographs and protographs extended using the optimal degrees for incremental variable nodes.

This work studies encoder cooperation in the setting of a discrete multiple access channel with two encoders and a single decoder. A node in the network that is connected to both encoders via rate-limited links, referred to as the cooperation facilitator (CF), enables the cooperation strategy. Previously, the authors presented a class of multiple access channels where the average-error sum-capacity has an infinite derivative in the limit where CF output link capacities approach zero. The authors also demonstrated that for some channels, the maximal-error sum-capacity is not continuous at the point where the output link capacities of the CF equal zero. This work shows that the average-error sum-capacity is continuous when CF output link capacities converge to zero; that is, the infinite derivative of the average-error sum-capacity is not a result of its discontinuity as in the maximal-error case.

Inspired by the model recently introduced for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters by Polyanskiy, we assume that the channel is invariant to permutations on its inputs, and that all active transmitters employ identical encoders. Unlike Polyanskiy, we consider a scenario in which neither the transmitters nor the receiver know which or how many transmitters are active. We refer to this agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel, or RAC. Limited feedback is used to ensure that the collection of active transmitters remains fixed during each epoch. The decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of active transmitters (k) and their messages but not which transmitter sent which message. The central result of this work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is first-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. While prior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require 2(k) - 1 simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold rule and achieves the same dispersion.

Gaussian random variables. We consider lossy compression of a block of n samples of the Gauss-Markov source under squared error distortion. We obtain the Gaussian approximation for the Gauss-Markov source with excess-distortion criterion for any distortion d > 0, and we show that the dispersion has a reverse waterfilling representation. This is the first finite blocklength result for lossy compression of sources with memory. We prove that the finite blocklength rate-distortion function R(n, d, epsilon) approaches the rate-distortion function R(d) as R(n, d, epsilon) = R(d) + root V(d)/nQ(-1) (epsilon) + o (1/root n), where V(d) is the dispersion, epsilon is an element of (0, 1) is the excess-distortion probability, and Q(-1) is the inverse of the Q-function. We give a reverse waterfilling integral representation for the dispersion V(d), which parallels that of the rate-distortion functions for Gaussian processes. Remarkably, for all 0 < d <= sigma(2)/(1+vertical bar a vertical bar)(2), R(n, d, epsilon) of the Gauss-Markov source coincides with that of Zi, the i.i.d. Gaussian noise driving the process, up to the second-order term. Among novel technical tools developed in this paper is a sharp approximation of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of n samples of the Gauss-Markov source, and a construction of a typical set using the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter a based on n observations.

We investigate what types of behaviors lead to asymptotic learning, where agents will eventually converge to the right action in probability. It is known that for rational agents and bounded signals, there will not be asymptotic learning. Does it help if the agents can be cooperative rather than act selfishly? This is simple to achieve if the agents are allowed to use randomized protocols. In this paper, we provide the first deterministic protocol under which asymptotic learning occurs. In addition, our protocol has the advantage of being much simpler than previous protocols.

One possible feature of interest, that has recently gained renewed attention, is private information retrieval (PIR). A PIR protocol enables a user to obtain a data entry from a storage system without revealing the identity of the requested entry to sets of colluding servers. In this paper we suggest a simple PIR protocol for graph based replication systems, which guarantees perfect secrecy against any set of colluding servers that does not induce a cycle. Furthermore, it is shown that the secrecy deteriorates gracefully with the number of cycles in the colluding set, and that the upload complexity can be reduced for graphs of certain specialized structure.

In particular, it is often compared to the Brunn-Minkowski inequality in convex geometry. In this article, we further strengthen the relationships between the EPI and geometric inequalities. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between a strong form of reverse EPI and the hyperplane conjecture, which is a long-standing conjecture in high-dimensional convex geometry. We also provide a simple proof of the hyperplane conjecture for a certain class of distributions, as a straightforward consequence of the EPI.

In parallel, the rise of large-scale distributed systems has motivated the study of computing in the presence of stragglers, i.e., servers that are slow to respond or unavailable. This paper addresses storage systems that employ linear codes over extension fields. A common task in such systems is the reconstruction of the entire dataset using sequential symbol transmissions from multiple servers, which are received concurrently at a central data collector. However, a key bottleneck in the reconstruction process is the possible presence of stragglers, which may result in excessive latency. To mitigate the straggler effect, the reconstruction should be possible given any sufficiently large set of sequentially received symbols, regardless of their source. In what follows, an algebraic framework for this scenario is given, and a number of explicit constructions are provided. Our main result is a construction that uses a recursive composition of generalized Reed-Solomon codes over smaller fields. In addition, we show links of this problem to Gabidulin codes and to universally decodable matrices.

In principle, a computational task is divided into subtasks which are distributed over a cluster operated by a taskmaster. One issue faced in practice is the delay incurred due to the presence of slow machines, known as stragglers. Several schemes, including those based on replication, have been proposed in the literature to mitigate the effects of stragglers and more recently, those inspired by coding theory have begun to gain traction. In this work, we consider a distributed gradient descent setting suitable for a wide class of machine learning problems. We adopt the framework of Tandon et al. [1] and present a deterministic scheme that, for a prescribed per-machine computational effort, recovers the gradient from the least number of machines f theoretically permissible, via an O(f(2)) decoding algorithm. The idea is based on a suitably designed Reed-Solomon code that has a sparsest and balanced generator matrix. We also provide a theoretical delay model which can be used to minimize the expected waiting time per computation by optimally choosing the parameters of the scheme. Finally, we supplement our theoretical findings with numerical results that demonstrate the efficacy of the method and its advantages over competing schemes.

This observation played a crucial role in the discovery of the double stranded helix structure by Watson and Crick. However, this symmetry was also observed in single stranded DNA. This phenomenon was termed as the 2nd Chargaff Rule. This symmetry has been verified experimentally in genomes of several different species not only for mononucleotides but also for reverse complement pairs of larger lengths upto a small error. While the symmetry in double stranded DNA is related to base pairing and replication mechanisms, the symmetry in a single stranded DNA is still a mystery in its function and source. In this work, we define a sequence generation model based on reverse complement tandem duplications. We show that this model generates sequences that satisfy the 2nd Chargaff Rule even when the duplication lengths are very small when compared to the length of sequences. We also provide estimates on the number of generations that are needed by this model to generate sequences that satisfy the 2nd Chargaff Rule. We provide theoretical bounds on the disruption in symmetry for different values of duplication lengths under this model. Moreover, we experimentally compare the disruption in the symmetry incurred by our model with what is observed in human genome data.

More precisely, we consider the system Xn+1 = A(n)X(n) + W-n - U-n, where the A(n) 's are drawn independently at random at each time n from a known distribution with unbounded support, and where the controller receives at most R bits about the system state at each time from an encoder. We provide a time-varying achievable strategy to stabilize the system in a second-moment sense with fixed, finite R. While our previous result provided a strategy to stabilize this system using a variable-rate code, this work provides an achievable strategy using a fixed-rate code. The strategy we employ to achieve this is time-varying and takes different actions depending on the value of the state. It proceeds in two modes: a normal mode (or zoom-in), where the realization of A(n) is typical, and an emergency mode (or zoom-out), where the realization of A(n) is exceptionally large.

Proteins that evolved naturally for biological function did so by exploiting the chemistries of the canonical amino acids; however, when proteins are repurposed for biomedical and pharmacological applications, they are often subject to conditions different from those characteristic of their original biological environments. Non-canonical amino acids can impart properties that are inaccessible within canonical protein sequence space, and can thereby lead to improved or new functionality. We describe simple methods for global replacement of canonical amino acids by their non-canonical counterparts in recombinant proteins made in high yield in bacterial expression hosts. These methods can be used to engineer both chemical and physical properties of recombinant proteins.

The sensor was fabricated with integrated excitation and receiver circuitry in a 65nm bulk CMOS process. It operates between 770MHz and 1.45GHz, has an effective sensing area of 200 mu m x 200 mu m, and reliably and continuously detects single 4.5 mu m magnetic label beads without significant drift over time periods notably longer than previously reported works.

The growing body of published research and scholarship on effective teaching of writing and communication in biology can help inform such work, but there are also local resources available to support writing within biology courses that may be unfamiliar to science faculty and instructors. In this article, we discuss common on-campus resources biology faculty can make use of when incorporating writing and communication into their teaching. We present the missions, histories, and potential collaboration outcomes of three major on-campus writing resources: writing across the curriculum and writing in the disciplines initiatives (WAC/WID), writing programs, and writing centers. We explain some of the common misconceptions about these resources in order to help biology faculty understand their uses and limits, and we offer guiding questions faculty might ask the directors of these resources to start productive conversations. Collaboration with these resources will likely save faculty time and effort on curriculum development and, more importantly, will help biology students develop and improve their critical reading, writing, and communication skills.

A scaling relation between seismic moment (M-0) and rupture area (A) currently in use for ground motion prediction in Japan features a transition regime of the form M-0-A(2), between the well-recognized small (self-similar) and very large (W-model) earthquake regimes, which has counter-intuitive attributes and uncertain theoretical underpinnings. Here, we investigate the mechanical origin of this transition regime via earthquake cycle simulations, analytical dislocation models and numerical crack models on strike-slip faults. We find that, even if stress drop is assumed constant, the properties of the transition regime are controlled by surface rupture effects, comprising an effective rupture elongation along-dip due to a mirror effect and systematic changes of the shape factor relating slip to stress drop.

Studies of this earthquake have revealed complex features of its rupture process. In particular, the shallow parts of the fault (near the trench) hosted large slip and long period seismic wave radiation, whereas the deep parts of the rupture (near the coast) hosted smaller slip and strong radiation of short period seismic waves. Understanding such depth-dependent feature of the rupture process of the Tohoku earthquake is necessary as it may occur during future mega-thrust earthquakes in this and other regions. In this study, we investigate the "characterized source model'' of the Tohoku earthquake through dynamic rupture simulations. This source model divides the fault plane into several parts characterized by different size and frictional strength (main asperity, background area, etc.) and is widely used in Japan for the prediction of strong ground motion and tsunami through kinematic rupture simulations. Our characterized source model of the Tohoku earthquake comprises a large shallow asperity with moderate frictional strength, small deep asperities with high frictional strength, a background area with low frictional strength, and an area with dynamic weakening close to the trench (low dynamic friction coefficient as arising from, e.g., thermal pressurization). The results of our dynamic rupture simulation reproduce the main depth-dependent feature of the rupture process of the Tohoku earthquake. We also find that the width of the area close to the trench (equal to the distance from the trench to the shallow asperity, interpreted as the size of the accretionary prism) and the presence of dynamic weakening in this area have a significant influence on the final slip distribution. These results are useful to construct characterized source models for other subduction zones with different scale of the accretionary prism, such as the Chile subduction zone and the Nankai Trough. Dynamic rupture simulations based on the characterized source model might provide useful insights for hazard assessment associated with future mega-thrust earthquakes.

Disaggregation for Networked Power Systems	2018 POWER SYSTEMS COMPUTATION CONFERENCE (PSCC)			English	Proceedings Paper	Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC)	JUN 11-15, 2018	Dublin, IRELAND				FLOW PROBLEM	Electricity data such as supply, demand, prices, and line flows, are sensitive. Utility companies, understandably do not want to, in fact often cannot, make this data publicly available. However, such data is critical in many fundamental areas in power systems research. As a compromise, aggregated data sets are sometimes made available. In such a setting it may be the case that data is aggregated over a geographical region and time. This forces researchers to try and "invert" the data to obtain disaggregated data sets. In this paper we rigorously formulate the disaggregation problem for networked power systems and present two algorithms that provide solutions to the DC version of the problem. We show that it is possible to invert the data, but that does not imply that ground truth solutions are obtained, thus the utility companies maintain a notion of privacy. The aim of this paper is to highlight the potential benefits to both the research community and utility companies of releasing aggregated data.

Recent studies have applied the closed-loop control (adaptive DBS or aDBS) using feedback from local field potential (LFP) signals. However, current aDBS practices focus on simple feedback like beta band power and thresholding, without optimized control or classification algorithms. In this work, we study the capacity of several classifiers including automatic shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to predict motor impairment. We use 20 features extracted from both monopolar and bipolar LFPs in 12 PD patients. In our best setting, we achieve a median accuracy of 70:2%, sensitivity of 81:2% and prediction lead time of 0:1 s across patients. By including relevant features other than beta power, a 13:6% improvement in accuracy is achieved. Moreover, the Hjorth parameters and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) features perform best according to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) p-value and classifier weights. These results suggest a great potential to improve current aDBS system for PD, by implementing a classifier with multiple features.

ROBUSTNESS OF COARRAYS OF SPARSE ARRAYS TO SENSOR FAILURES	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	APR 15-20, 2018	Calgary, CANADA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Signal Proc Soc		Sparse arrays; robustness; essentialness; fragility	DOA ESTIMATION	Sparse arrays can identify O(N-2) uncorrelated sources using N physical sensors. This property is because the difference coarray, defined as the differences between sensor locations, has uniform linear array (ULA) segments of length O(N-2). It is empirically known that, for sparse arrays like minimum redundancy arrays, nested arrays, and coprime arrays, this O(N-2) segment is susceptible to sensor failure, which is an important issue in practical systems. This paper presents the (k-)essentialness property, which characterizes the combinations of the failing sensors that shrink the difference coarray. Based on this, the notion of fragility is proposed to quantify the reliability of sparse arrays with faulty sensors, along with comprehensive studies of their properties. It is demonstrated through examples that there do exist sparse arrays that are as robust as ULA and at the same time, they enjoy O(N-2) consecutive elements in the difference coarray.

While there exist convex relaxations for the low-rank completion problem, the underlying problem is inherently non-convex, and most algorithms (alternating projection, Riemannian optimization, etc.) heavily depend on the initialization. This paper proposes an improved initialization that relies on successive rank-1 updates. Further, the paper proposes theoretical guarantees under which the proposed initialization is closer to the unknown optimal solution than the all zeros initialization in the Frobenius norm. To cope with the problem of local minima, the paper introduces and uses random norms to change the position of the local minima while preserving the global one. Using a Riemannian optimization routine, simulation results reveal that the proposed solution succeeds in completing Gaussian partially observed matrices with a random set of revealed entries close to the information-theoretical limits, thereby significantly improving on prior methods.

Polynomial graph filters studied in the context of graph signal processing are inadequate to analyze signals on this type of networks. This is due to the fact that the basic shift on a graph requires all the nodes to communicate at the same time, which cannot be assumed in an autonomous setting. In order to analyze these type of networks, this paper studies an asynchronous power iteration that updates the values of only a subset of nodes. This paper further reveals the close connection between asynchronous updates and the notion of smooth signals on the graph. The paper also shows that a cascade of random asynchronous updates smooths out any arbitrary signal on the graph.	[Teke, Oguzhan; Vaidyanathan, P.

When the problem dimension is large, computational and/or memory constraints make it desirable, or even necessary, to perform the task in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we consider a common scenario in which a taskmaster intends to solve a large-scale system of linear equations by distributing subsets of the equations among a number of computing machines/cores. We propose a new algorithm called Accelerated Projection-based Consensus (APC) for this problem. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in detail and analytically shown to compare favorably with the convergence rate of alternative distributed methods, namely distributed gradient descent, distributed versions of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent and heavy-ball method, the block Cimmino method, and ADMM. On randomly chosen linear systems, as well as on real-world data sets, the proposed method offers significant speed-up relative to all the aforementioned methods.

To avoid solving the computationally expensive reinforcement learning problems in reward learning, we propose a function approximation method to ensure that the Bellman Optimality Equation always holds, and then estimate a function to maximize the likelihood of the observed motion. The time complexity of the proposed method is linearly proportional to the cardinality of the action set, thus it can handle large state spaces efficiently. We test the proposed method in a simulated environment on reward learning, and show that it is more accurate than existing methods and significantly better in scalability. We also show that the proposed method can extend many existing methods to large state spaces. We then apply the method to evaluating the effect of rehabilitative stimulations on patients with spinal cord injuries based on the observed patient motions.

The ability to quantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used for map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor setup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data correctly in instances where range measurements are taken from different vantage points or with different sensors. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the range error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and validate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system.

Robust Visual Localization for Hopping Rovers on Small Bodies	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 21-25, 2018	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, CSIRO, Australian Govt, Dept Def Sci & Technol, DJI, Queensland Univ Technol, Woodside, Baidu, Bosch, Houston Mechatron, Kinova Robot, KUKA, Hit Robot Grp, Honda Res Inst, iRobot, Mathworks, NuTonomy, Ouster, Uber				We present a collaborative visual localization method for rovers designed to hop and tumble across the surface of small Solar System bodies, such as comets and asteroids. In a two-phase approach, an orbiting primary spacecraft first maps the surface of a body by capturing images from various poses and illumination angles; these images are processed to create a prior map of 3D landmarks. In the second phase, a hopping rover is deployed to the surface where it uses a camera to relocalize to the prior map and to perform onboard visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Small bodies present several unique challenges to existing visual SLAM algorithms, such as high-contrast shadows that move quickly over the surface due to the short (e.g. 1-12 hour) rotational periods, and large changes in visual appearance between orbit and the surface, where image scale varies by many orders of magnitude (kilometers to centimeters). In this work, we describe how to augment ORB-SLAM2-a state of the art visual SLAM implementation-to handle large variations in illumination by fusing prior images with varying illumination angles. We demonstrate how a hopping rover can use a wide field of view (FOV) camera to relocalize to prior maps captured by an orbiting spacecraft with a narrow FOV camera, and how the growth of pose and scale errors can be bounded by periodic loop closures during large hops. The proposed method is evaluated with sequences of images captured around a mock asteroid; it is shown to be robust to varying illumination angles, scene scale changes, and off-nadir camera pointing angles.

Towards Restoring Locomotion for Paraplegics: Realizing Dynamically Stable Walking on Exoskeletons	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 21-25, 2018	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, CSIRO, Australian Govt, Dept Def Sci & Technol, DJI, Queensland Univ Technol, Woodside, Baidu, Bosch, Houston Mechatron, Kinova Robot, KUKA, Hit Robot Grp, Honda Res Inst, iRobot, Mathworks, NuTonomy, Ouster, Uber				This paper presents the first experimental results of crutch-less dynamic walking with paraplegics on a lower-body exoskeleton: ATALANTE, designed by the French start-up company Wandercraft. The methodology used to achieve these results is based on the partial hybrid zero dynamics (PHZD) framework for formally generating stable walking gaits. A direct collocation optimization formulation is used to provide fast and efficient generation of gaits tailored to each patient. These gaits are then implemented on the exoskeleton for three paraplegics. The end result is dynamically stable walking in an exoskeleton without the need for crutches. After a short period of tuning by the engineers and practice by the subjects, each subject was able to dynamically walk across a room of about 10 m up to a speed of 0.15 m/s (0.5 km/h) without the need for crutches or any other kind of assistance.

NTP takes as input a task specification (e.g., video demonstration of a task) and recursively decomposes it into finer sub-task specifications. These specifications are fed to a hierarchical neural program, where bottom-level programs are callable subroutines that interact with the environment. We validate our method in three robot manipulation tasks. NTP achieves strong generalization across sequential tasks that exhibit hierarchal and compositional structures. The experimental results show that NTP learns to generalize well towards unseen tasks with increasing lengths, variable topologies, and changing objectives. stanfordvl.github.io/ntp/	[Xu, Danfei; Zhu, Yuke; Gao, Julian; Garg, Animesh; Li Fei-Fei; Savarese, Silvio] Stanford Vis & Learning Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Nair, Suraj] Caltech, CS, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA	Xu, DF (corresponding author), Stanford Vis & Learning Lab, Pasadena, CA USA.							33	2	2	1	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA	1050-4729		978-1-5386-3081-5	IEEE INT CONF ROBOT			2018							3795	3802					8	Automation & Control Systems; Robotics	Automation & Control Systems; Robotics	BL0QZ	WOS:000446394502137					2020-09-15

Data-driven Bayesian models describe these quantities, which enables subsequent behaviors to depend on confidence of the learned models. Experiments were conducted using the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) RoboSimian to lift a variety of cumbersome objects ranging in mass from 7kg to 25kg. The position of a supporting second manipulator was determined using a particle set and heuristics that were derived from inferred object properties. The supporting manipulator decreased the initial manipulator's load and distributed the wrench load more equitably across each manipulator, for each bulky object. Knowledge of the objects came from pure proprioception (i.e. without reliance on vision or other exteroceptive sensors) throughout the experiments.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach for manipulation event segmentation and manipulation event parsing. The proposed framework incorporates hand pose kinematics and contact forces using a low-cost easy-to-replicate tactile glove. We use a temporal grammar model to capture the hierarchical structure of events, integrating extracted force vectors from the raw sensory input of poses and forces. The temporal grammar is represented as a temporal And-Or graph (T-AOG), which can be induced in an unsupervised manner. We obtain the event labeling sequences by measuring the similarity between segments using the Dynamic Time Alignment Kernel (DTAK). Experimental results show that our method achieves high accuracy in manipulation event segmentation, recognition and parsing by utilizing both pose and force data.

Previous works have treated quadrotors as differentially flat systems, and this property has been exploited widely to design simple algorithms that generate dynamically feasible trajectories and to enable hierarchical control. The differentially flat property allows the full state of the quadrotor to be extracted from the reduced dimensional space of x, y, z, yaw and their derivatives. This differential flatness transformation has a number of singularities, however, as well as stability issues when controlling near these singularities. Many methods have been described in the literature to address these; however, they all have limitations when exploring the full flight envelope of a quadrotor, including roll or pitch angles past 90 degrees, and during inverted flight. In this paper, we review these existing methods and then introduce our method, which combines multiple methods to provide a highlyrobust differential flatness transformation that addresses most of these issues. Our approach is demonstrated enabling highlyaggressive quadrotor flight in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Jahangir			Throughput Maximization in Cloud Radio Access Networks using Network Coding	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (ICC WORKSHOPS)	IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) / Workshop on Integrating UAVs into 5G	MAY 20-24, 2018	Kansas City, MO	IEEE, Sprint, Qualcomm, Cisco, Huawei, Natl Instruments, Nokia, Comput Res Assoc Women, GARMIN, Juniper Networks, NSF		Cloud Radio Access Networks; instantly decodable network coding; rate adaptation; coordinated scheduling	COMPRESSION	This paper is interested in maximizing the total throughput of cloud radio access networks (CRANs) in which multiple radio remote heads (RRHs) are connected to a central computing unit known as the cloud. The transmit frame of each RRH consists of multiple radio resources blocks (RRBs), and the cloud is responsible for synchronizing these RRBS and scheduling them to users. Unlike previous works that consider allocating each RRB to only a single user at each time instance, this paper proposes to mix the flows of multiple users in each RRB using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). The proposed scheme is thus designed to jointly schedule the users to different RRBs, choose the encoded file sent in each of them, and the rate at which each of them is transmitted. Hence, the paper maximizes the throughput which is defined as the number of correctly received bits. To jointly fulfill this objective, we design a graph in which each vertex represents a possible user-RRB association, encoded file, and transmission rate. By appropriately choosing the weights of vertices, the scheduling problem is shown to be equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem over the newly introduced graph. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed scheme and reveal that it largely outperforms coding free solutions.	[Al-Abiad, Mohammed S.; Hossain, M. D.

Unfortunately, none of these existing 3D memory cubes are ready for harsh space environments. This paper presents a new memory cube architecture for space, based on vertical integration of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), 3D stacked, DRAM memory devices with a custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller offering high memory capacity, robust reliability and low latency. Validation and evaluation of the ASIC controller will be conducted prior to tape-out on a custom FPGA-based emulator platform integrating the 3D-stack.

This protection would require "breaking the chain of contact (BTC)", where any returned material reaching Earth for further analysis would have to be sealed inside a container with extremely high confidence. Therefore, the acquired samples would need to be contained while destroying any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of the container. A novel process that could be used to contain returning samples has been developed and demonstrated in a quarter scale size. The process consists of brazing using non-contact induction heating that synchronously separates, seams, seals and sterilizes (S4) the container. The use of brazing involves melting at temperatures higher than 500 degrees C and this level of heating assures sterilization of the exposed areas since all carbon bonds (namely, organic materials) are broken at this temperature. The mechanism consists of a double wall container with inner and outer shells having Earth-clean interior surfaces. The process consists of two-steps, Step-1: the double wall container halves are fabricated and brazed (equivalent to production on Earth); and Step-2 is the S4 process and it is the equivalent to the execution on-orbit around Mars. In a potential future mission, the double wall container would be split into two halves and prepared on Earth. The potential on-orbit execution would consist of inserting the orbiting sample (OS) container into one of the halves and then mated to the other half and brazed. The latest results of this effort will be described and discussed in this manuscript.

The model relies on remnant strain and polarization as independent variables. Innovative experimental and numerical model identification procedures are developed for the characterization of the coupled electro-mechanical, multi-axial nonlinear constitutive law. Experiments were conducted on thin PZT-5A4E plates subjected to cross-thickness electric field. Unimorph structures with different thickness ratios between PZT-5A4E plate and substrate were tested, to subject the piezo plates to coupled electro-mechanical fields. Material state histories in electric field-strain-polarization space and stress-strain-polarization space were recorded. An optimization procedure is employed for the determination of the model parameters, and the calibrated constitutive law predicts both the uncoupled and coupled experimental observations accurately.

On primitive variable behaviour near shocks in ensemble-averaged methods	JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE			English	Article						Turbulence modelling: Reynolds averaged; supersonic turbulent flows; compressible turbulence; Reynolds averaged Navier-stokes	ISOTROPIC TURBULENCE; SIMULATION; REYNOLDS; WAVES	Models for averaged shock corrugation effects and the impact of turbulent entropy or acoustic modes on the energy equation are presented, for application in Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes(RANS) simulations of shock-turbulence interactions. Unlike previous work that has focused the modification of turbulent statistics by the shock, the proposed models are introduced to capture the effects of the turbulence on the profiles of primitive variables - mean density, velocity, and pressure. By producing accurate profiles for the primitive variables, it is shown that the proposed models improve numerical convergence behaviour with mesh refinement about a shock, and introduce the physical effects of shock asphericity in a converging shock geometry. These effects are achieved by local closures to turbulent statistics in the averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and can be applied in conjunction with existing Reynolds stress closures that have been constructed for broader applications beyond shock-turbulence interactions.

The theory of pseudo-differential operators on the noncommutative n-torus	XXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS AND QUANTUM SYMMETRIES (ISQS-25)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Conference on Integrable Systems and Quantum Symmetries (ISQS)	JUN 06-10, 2017	Czech Tech Univ, Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Dept Math, Joint Inst Nucl Res, Bogoliubov Lab Theoret Phys	Czech Tech Univ		SCALAR CURVATURE; GEOMETRY	The methods of spectral geometry are useful for investigating the metric aspects of noncommutative geometry and in these contexts require extensive use of pseudo-differential operators. In a foundational paper, Connes showed that, by direct analogy with the theory of pseudo-differential operators on finite-dimensional real vector spaces, one may derive a similar pseudo-differential calculus on noncommutative n-tori, and with the development of this calculus came many results concerning the local differential geometry of noncommutative tori for n=2,4, as shown in the groundbreaking paper in which the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the noncommutative two-torus is proved and later papers. Certain details of the proofs in the original derivation of the calculus were omitted, such as the evaluation of oscillatory integrals, so we make it the objective of this paper to fill in all the details. After reproving in more detail the formula for the symbol of the adjoint of a pseudo-differential operator and the formula for the symbol of a product of two pseudo-differential operators, we extend these results to finitely generated projective right modules over the noncommutative n-torus. Then we define the corresponding analog of Sobolev spaces and prove equivalents of the Sobolev and Rellich lemmas.

Networked ICS components now called the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are at the heart of the "smart city'', controlling critical infrastructure, such as CCTV security networks, electric grids, water networks, and transportation systems. Without the continuous, reliable functioning of these assets, economic and social disruption will ensue. Unfortunately, IIoT are hackable and difficult to secure from cyberattacks. This leaves our future smart cities in a state of perpetual uncertainty and the risk that the stability of our lives will be upended. The Local government has largely been absent from conversations about cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, despite its importance. One reason for this is public administrators do not have a good way of knowing which assets and which components of those assets are at the greatest risk. This is further complicated by the highly technical nature of the tools and techniques required to assess these risks. Using artificial intelligence planning techniques, an automated tool can be developed to evaluate the cyber risks to critical infrastructure. It can be used to automatically identify the adversarial strategies (attack trees) that can compromise these systems. This tool can enable both security novices and specialists to identify attack pathways. We propose and provide an example of an automated attack generation method that can produce detailed, scalable, and consistent attack trees-the first step in securing critical infrastructure from cyberattack.

Challenges pertaining to the introduction of an AD tool based on operator overloading have been studied in the past. However, in order to assess possible performance gains or to verify derivative values, it is advantageous to be able to apply more than one AD tool to a given code. Hence, in this work, we investigate usability issues when exchanging AD tools. Our study is based on the NASA/JPL/UCI Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) which currently employs the AD tool ADOL-C. We introduce CoDiPack to ISSM, a more recent AD tool offering a similar set of features while promising performance improvements. In addition to the obvious type change for the AD-augmented float type, this transition requires the change to a different adjoint MPI library, adaptation of the MUMPS solver wrapper, and changes to the derivative seeding and extraction routines. We believe that these issues are fairly generic for numerical simulation software, and the issues we report on provide a blueprint for similar undertakings. We also believe that our experiences provide guidance towards the development of AD interfaces that support AD tool interoperability. In addition, we improve upon the memory management of the existing ADOL-C instrumentation, which exhibited considerable runtime problems for higher mesh resolutions. We conduct serial and parallel ISSM model runs on a 2D mass transport benchmark as well as a model of the Pine Island Glacier to verify the derivatives computed by both tools and report on runtime performance and memory usage. In comparison, the CoDiPack AD variant of ISSM runs faster with less memory overhead than the ADOL-C variant and, thus, enables future model runs with an increased number of mesh elements. But the existence of two different AD implementations provides added confidence in the correctness of derivatives, in particular for future AD tool versions.

Experimental Investigation of the Shearing Resistance of Soda-Lime Glass at Pressures of 9 GPa and Strain Rates of 10(6)s(-1)	SHOCK COMPRESSION OF CONDENSED MATTER - 2017	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	20th Biennial Conference of the Topical-Group of the American-Physical-Society (APS) on Shock Compression of Condensed Matter (SCCM)	JUL 09-14, 2017	St Louis, MO	Amer Phys Soc, Top Grp, Specialised Imaging				Pressure-Shear Plate Impact (PSPI) experiments were conducted to measure the high-rate shearing resistance of soda-lime glass at pressures of 9 GPa and at shearing rates of approximately 10(6)s(-1). Samples of soda lime glass, 5 mu m thick, were sandwiched between pure tungsten carbide (WC) plates and impacted by pure WC flyers. Impacting plates were inclined to the direction of approach by an angle of 18 degrees. Normal stress and shearing resistance of the sample were calculated from measured free surface velocities using 1D elastic wave theory. The experimental results show that, at a pressure of 9GPa, the shear stress increases almost linearly up to 1 GPa and then falls quickly to approximately 0.3 GPa - after which it decreases slowly to approximately 0.17 GPa. Comparisons with results of previous experiments on nominally identical samples, impacted to generate lower peak pressures, showed the peak shearing resistance to be much higher at higher pressures; however, the sharp fall in shearing resistance occurs at comparable shear strains (1.5-2).

A novel heterodyne diffracted beam photonic Doppler velocimeter (DPDV) has also been developed for simultaneous measurement of the normal and transverse particle velocity histories using the +/- 1st order diffracted beams produced by a 400 lines/mm diffraction grating deposited onto the polished rear surface of the impacted target plate. We present and interpret the results of a PSPI experiment conducted on a 5 mu m thick soda-lime glass sample subjected to a normal stress of 30 GPa and a shear strain rate of 4.10(7) s(-1). Transverse particle velocity measurements reveal a peak shear stress level of 1.25 GPa up to a shear strain value of 2.2, followed by a precipitous drop in stress and complete loss of shear strength.

Alternative interferometer schemes feature a dual beam VISAR arrangement [2] and a recently developed all fiber-optic TDI-NDI/PDV configuration [3]. Here, we present a heterodyne diffracted beam PDV (DPDV) which interferes a pair of symmetrically diffracted 1st order beams produced by a thin, specular, metallic grating deposited on the rear surface of the target plate. Each beam is collected by a fiber-optic probe and directed to interfere with a reference beam of a slightly increased wavelength to create an upshifted carrier signal frequency at zero particle velocity. Signal frequencies are extracted from the two fringe records using a moving-window DFT algorithm and then linearly combined in a post processing step to decouple the normal and transverse velocities. The 0th order beam can also be interfered in a heterodyne PDV to obtain an additional independent measurement of the normal particle velocity [4]. An overview of the DPDV configuration is presented along with a derivation of the interferometer sensitivities to transverse and normal particle velocities. Results from a normal impact experiment conducted on y-cut alpha-quartz are presented as experimental validation.

In this paper, we contribute to the state of the art of control synthesis for temporal logic properties by computing and quantifying a less conservative gridding of the continuous state space of linear stochastic dynamic systems and by giving a new approach for control synthesis and verification that is robust to the incurred approximation errors. The approximation errors are expressed as both deviations in the outputs of the gMDPs and in the probabilistic transitions.

For each mathematical technique, we identify the multi-agent coordination tasks it can be applied to, and we analyze its scalability, bandwidth use, and demonstrated maturity. We highlight how versatile techniques such as artificial potential functions can be used for applications ranging from low-level position control to high-level coordination and task allocation, we discuss possible reasons for the slow adoption of complex distributed coordination algorithms in the field, and we highlight areas for further research and development.

EchinoBase (www.echinobase.org) is an echinoderm-specific genome database and web information system that provides a platform for the interrogation and exploration of echinoderm genomic data. This chapter outlines the datasets available on EchinoBase; from assembled genomes and genome annotations, to spatial and quantitative expression data, as well as functional genomics datasets. We also highlight the bioinformatic tools available on the website to facilitate rapid inquiries using these data (genome browsers, precompiled BLAST databases, etc.), and suggest optimized strategies for performing these inquiries. We conclude with a perspective on how one could integrate various genomic resources to predict putative noncoding regulatory regions. The available datasets and analyses they permit provide the basic components required for developing an understanding of how echinoderm genomes are regulated, especially during early development, and provides a platform for comparative genomic inquiries among species in this phylum.

The radar operates in a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) mode with a bandwidth, pulse repetition interval, and coherent integration time chosen to achieve better than 10 m range resolution, 0.1 m/s velocity resolution, 5.1 km maximum unambiguous range, and 46 m/s maximum unambiguous velocity span. With an ultra-high transmit/receive isolation exceeding 85 dB, the radar operates with thermal-noise-limited sensitivity even with 1 Watt of continuous transmit power and a 540 K noise-temperature receiver sharing a single, 15 cm diameter monostatic aperture. Experimental testing has verified the radar's range-Doppler remote sensing capabilities using a developing rain shower as a dynamic and distributed target.

After the immense success of these radars, two new spaceborne atmospheric radars, the EarthCARE Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) [5], and the Radar in a CubeSat (RainCube) [6] have been developed and will be launched in the upcoming years, and several new radar concepts have been developed and are being considered for a variety of mission concepts. For example, spaceborne precipitation and cloud radars operating at multiple frequencies (e.g., Ku-, Ka- and W-band simultaneously) with a single antenna, and that provide scanning, polarimetric and Doppler capabilities at all frequencies; extremely compact radar architectures that enable accommodation of this category of radars in spacecrafts as small as a 6U CubeSats, as well as Doppler-capable millimeter-wave weather radars for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, are being defined and developed. These new instrument concepts are intended to fill the current observational gaps in the advancement of weather and climate models, and leverage on the TRMM, GPM and CloudSat experiences.

The robotic spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004 after a 7-year flight from Earth, dropped a European Space Agency (ESA) parachuted probe named Huygens to study the atmosphere and surface of Saturn's big moon Titan, and commenced making astonishing discoveries. NASA's Cassini spacecraft explored the Saturn system for over 13 years, finally vaporizing in Saturn's atmosphere on 15 September 2017 to protect the ocean worlds, Enceladus and Titan, where it discovered potential habitats for life. During those 13 years in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini-Huygens mission made some amazing discoveries and revealed the breathtaking beauty of the Saturn system. Some of Cassini's most surprising scientific discoveries came from encounters with Saturn's intriguing moons. Those discoveries include icy jets emanating from the south pole of tiny Enceladus, a moon that harbors a subsurface global ocean and hydrothermal activity. On giant Titan, methane rain carves river channels and fills lakes and seas with hydrocarbons, mixed with complex pre-biotic chemicals that form in its atmosphere and rain to the surface. These discoveries have fundamentally altered many of our concepts of where life might be found in our own solar system and beyond. Some of Cassini's other amazing findings include a myriad of three-dimensional structures in the dynamic rings driven by interactions with Saturn's moons and interior; a giant Saturn storm that circled the entire planet for most of 2011, while a long-lived hexagonal jet stream discovered by Voyager in 1981 continues to encircle the north pole. Cassini solved the mystery of Iapetus' dual bright-dark surface, while uncovering another: the true rotation rate of Saturn's interior, thought to be precisely determined by Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers, remains unknown. Cassini's findings at Saturn have also fundamentally altered many of our concepts of how planets form around other stars. This flagship mission was a cooperative undertaking by NASA, ESA, and the Italian space agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI)).

The Problem of the High Iron Abundance in Accretion Disks around Black Holes	WORKSHOP ON ASTROPHYSICAL OPACITIES	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Astrophysical Opacities	AUG 01-04, 2017	Western Michigan Univ, Foster Ctr, Kalamazoo, MI	Western Michigan Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Western Michigan Univ, Dept Phys	Western Michigan Univ, Foster Ctr		X-RAY REFLECTION; SUZAKU OBSERVATIONS; SPIN; SPECTRUM; BINARIES; DENSITY	In most accreting black-hole systems the copious X-rays commonly observed from the inner-most regions are accompanied by a reflection spectrum. The latter is the signature of energetic photons reprocessed by the optically thick material of an accretion disk. Given their abundance and fluorescence yield, the iron K-shell lines are the most prominent features in the X-ray reflected spectrum. Their line profiles can be grossly broadened and skewed by Doppler effects and gravitational redshift. Consequently, modeling the reflection spectrum provides one of the best methods to measure, among other physical quantities, the black-hole spin. At present the accuracy of the spin estimates is called into question because the data fits require very high iron abundances: typically several times the solar value. No plausible physical explanation has been concurrently proffered for these black-hole systems to be so iron rich. The most likely explanation for the supersolar iron abundances is model shortfall at very high densities (> 10(18) cm(-3)) due to atomic data shortcomings in this regime. We review the current observational evidence for the iron supersolar abundance in many black hole systems, and show the effects of high density in state-of-the-art reflection models. We also briefly discuss our current efforts to produce new atomic data for high-density plasmas, which are required to refine the photoionization models.	[Garcia, J.

In systems and software engineering, ICDs are key artifacts that specify the interface(s) to a system or subsystem, and are used to control the documentation of these interfaces. ICDs enable independent teams to develop connecting systems that use the specified interfaces. In the context of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), interface control documents also act as contracts for delivered subsystems. The Alignment and Phasing system (APS) is one such subsystem. APS is required to implement a particular interface, and formulates requirements for the interfaces to be provided by other components of TMT that interface with APS. As the design of APS matures, these interfaces are frequently refined, making it necessary for related ICDs to be updated. In current systems engineering practice, ICDs are maintained manually. This manual maintenance can lead to a loss in integrity and accuracy of the documents over time, resulting in the documents no longer reflecting the actual state of the interfaces of a system. We show how a system model in SysML (TM) can be used to generate ICDs automatically. The method is demonstrated through application to interface control documents pertaining to APS. Specifically, we apply the method to the interface of APS to the primary mirror control system (M1CS) and of APS to the Telescope Control System (TCS). We evaluate the newly introduced method through application to two case studies.	[Herzig, Sebastian J.

Its content has emerged from the system level modeling effort on the European Framework Program 6 (FP6) and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The TMT MBSE approach applied the Executable Systems Engineering Method (ESEM) and the open-source Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE) to specify, analyze, and verify requirements of TMT's Alignment and Phasing System (APS) and the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS). In these applications, implicit dependencies are made explicit in a formal model through the use of ESEM, OpenMBEE, and SysML modeling constructs. The value proposition for applying this MBSE approach was to establish precise requirements and fine-grained traceability to system designs, and to verify key requirements beginning early in development. The integration of ESEM and the OpenMBEE tooling infrastructure (providing linked-data and web-operability) is a significant added value for the MBSE approach. The APS is responsible for the overall pre-adaptive optics wavefront quality, using starlight to measure wavefront errors and align the TMT optics. In the formally integrated and executable SysML model, simulations are performed to analyze the impact of changed requirements and verify specified constraints for various operational scenarios. The APS team used several modeling patterns to capture information such as the requirements, the operational scenarios, involved subsystems and their interaction points, the estimated or required time durations, and the mass and power consumption. Adaptive optics systems are designed to sense real-time atmospheric turbulence and correct the telescope's optical beam to remove its effect. The system model for the adaptive optics operational modes was developed to capture sequence behaviors and operational scenarios to run Monte-Carlo simulations for verifying acquisition time, observing efficiency, and operational behavior requirements. The model is particularly useful for investigating the effect of parallelization, identifying interface issues, and re-ordering sequence acquisition tasks. A former version of the Cookbook (which is now updated to MBSE challenges, goals, and lessons learned) included modeling guidelines and conventions for all system aspects, hierarchy levels, and views, which were developed during for the Active Phasing Experiment (APE), an opto-mechatronical system technology demonstrator for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The Cookbook utilizes the above mentioned system models as real-world case-studies to demonstrate and document the applications of the recipes, providing also instructional examples and addressing the available tooling support. The Cookbook is accompanied by a number of SysML models and aodel libraries which facilitate model authoring and maintenance. The Cookbook covers the different aspects of Systems Engineering such as management of Requirements, Design (behavior and structure), Interfaces, Interdisciplinary Integration, Analysis, Trade Studies, and Technical Resources. This paper presents the background, motivation, architecture, and highlights some key content of the Cookbook. For example, interface management, error budget management, requirements verification, Monte Carlo driven analysis, and timing analysis of operational scenarios. The paper discusses how the capabilities of OpenMBEE contributed significantly to the adoption of executable systems engineering.

The TMT alignment is performed by the Global Metrology System (GMS) and the Alignment and Phasing System (APS). The GMS first measures the locations of the telescope optics and instruments as a function of elevation angle. These initial measurements will be used to adjust the optics positions and build initial elevation look-up tables. Then the telescope is aligned using starlight as the input for the APS at multiple elevation angles. APS measurements are used to refine the telescope alignment to build elevation and temperature dependent look-up tables. Due to the number of degrees of freedom in the telescope (over 10,000), the ability of the primary mirror to correct aberrations on other optics, the tight optical performance requirements and the multiple instrument locations, it is challenging to develop, test and validate these alignment procedures. In this paper, we consider several GMS and APS operational scenarios. We apply the alignment procedures to the model-generated TMT, which consists of various quasi-static errors such as polishing errors, passive supports errors, thermal and gravity deformations and installation position errors. Using an integrated optical model and Monte-Carlo framework, we evaluate the TMT's aligned states using optical performance metrics at multiple instrument and field of view locations. The optical performance metrics include the Normalized Point Source Sensitivity (PSSN), RMS wavefront error before and after Adaptive Optics (AO) correction, pupil position change, and plate scale distortion.

It is a medium resolution, multi object, wide field optical spectrograph. Since 2005 the conceptual design of the instrument has focused on a slit-mask based, grating exchange design that will be mounted at the Nasmyth focus of TMT. Based on the experience with ESI, MOSFIRE and DEIMOS for Keck we know flexure related image motion will be a major problem with such a spectrograph and a compensation system is required to mitigate these effects. We have developed a Flexure Compensation and Simulation (FCS) tool for TMT-WFOS that provides an interface to accurately simulate the effects of instrument flexure at the WFOS detector plane (e.g image shifts) using perturbation of key optical elements and also derive corrective motions to compensate the image shifts caused by instrument flexure. We are currently using the tool to do mote-carlo simulations to validate the optical design of a slit-mask concept we call Xchange-WFOS, and to optimize the flexure compensation strategy. We intend to use the tool later in the design process to predict the actual flexure by replacing the randomized inputs with the signed displacement and rotations of each element predicted by global Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model on the instrument.

The search for liquid water in our solar system has revealed that several moons of the outer solar system harbor oceans beneath their icy shells. Halogen salts serve as a key indicator of whether or not these liquid water environments could satisfy the latter two requirements for life. The presence of salts within these oceans is, and can be, an indicator of water-rock interactions between liquid water and silicate, halogen-rich, seafloors. In some cases, seafloor cycling within these moons may be sufficient to drive low-, or possibly even high-temperature hydrothermalism. Here I review the current state of knowledge of these oceans beyond Earth and provide both empirical and modelling constraints on halogens within these environments. Past, present, and future spacecraft missions to these worlds are described, and the implications for future discoveries of astrobiological importance is discussed.

Current aerospace qualified primary battery technologies cannot adequately meet the mass and volume requirements of proposed missions. Although they have not been used in prior deep space landed missions, lithium carbon-fluoride (Li/CFx) technologies were identified as a potentially viable option, both with and without blends of manganese dioxide (MnO2). To meet the performance requirements over the intended operating conditions of future NASA missions requires further development of this technology, in particular in the delivery of a high specific energy at moderate to low temperatures, and low discharge rates. A cell development effort was therefore pursued with an industrial battery cell manufacturer. Low (50 mA) and medium (250 mA) discharge rates were used to assess the performance of D-size cells under mission relevant conditions, between 0 degrees C and -40 degrees C. Select AA-size and C-size cells were also evaluated using similar rates scaled to the lower cell capacities. Developmental Li/CFx-MnO2 D-size cells designed for higher specific energy over these conditions were fabricated and tested, targeting operation between 0 and -40 degrees C and a 50 mA constant discharge current, as the baseline operating condition.

A significant factor driving this under-utilization is fluctuation of the aggregate power demand, resulting in unused "spot (power) capacity". In this paper, we tap into spot capacity for improving power infrastructure utilization in multi-tenant data centers, an important but under-explored type of data center where multiple tenants house their own physical servers. We propose a novel market, called SpotDC, to allocate spot capacity to tenants on demand. Specifically, SpotDC extracts tenants' rack-level spot capacity demand through an elastic demand function, based on which the operator sets the market price for spot capacity allocation. We evaluate SpotDC using both testbed experiments and simulations, demonstrating that SpotDC improves power infrastructure utilization and creates a "win-win" situation: the data center operator increases its profit (by nearly 10%), while tenants improve their performance (by 1.2-1.8x on average compared to the no spot capacity case, yet at a marginal cost).

While it has shown substantial success for use with eukaryotes, it has proven challenging for bacterial imaging because of low contrast and sources of noise intrinsic to the method (e.g. laser speckle). This paper describes a custom written MATLAB routine using machine-learning algorithms to obtain three-dimensional trajectories of live, lab-grown bacteria as they move within an essentially unrestrained environment with more than 90% precision. A fully annotated version of the software used in this work is available for public use.

Several authors already modeled the geodetic data in terms of the mechanical interaction of the events in the seismic sequence. Liquefaction has been extensively observed, suggesting an important role of fluids in the sequence. In this work, we focus on the poroelastic effects induced by the two mainshocks. In particular, the target of this work is to model the influence of fluids and pore-pressure changes on surface displacements and on the Coulomb failure function (CFF). The fluid flow and poroelastic modeling was performed in a 3D half-space whose elastic and hydraulic parameters are depth dependent, in accordance with the geology of the Emilia-Romagna subsoil. The model provides both the poroelastic displacements and the pore-pressure changes induced coseismically by the two mainshocks at subsequent periods and their evolution over time. Modeling results are then compared with postseismic InSAR and GPS displacement time series: the InSAR data consist of two SBAS series presented in previous works, while the GPS signal was detected adopting a variational Bayesian independent component analysis (vbICA) method. Thanks to the vbICA, we are able to separate the contribution of afterslip and poroelasticity on the horizontal surface displacements recorded by the GPS stations. The poroelastic GPS component is then compared to the modeled displacements and shown to be mainly due to drainage of the shallowest layers. Our results offer an estimation of the poroelastic effect magnitude that is small but not negligible and mostly confined in the near field of the two mainshocks. We also show that accounting for a 3D fault representation with a nonuniform slip distribution and the elastic-hydraulic layering of the half-space has an important role in the simulation results.

Separating targets from background clutter with high precision is a challenging operation for both humans and computers. Currently, segmenting objects from IR images is done by tedious manual work. The implementation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to perform precision segmentation of multi-band IR video images is presented. A customized pix2pix DNN with multiple layers of generative encoder/decoder and discriminator architecture is used in the IR image segmentation process. Real and synthetic images and ground truths are employed to train the DNN. Iterative training is performed to achieve optimum accuracy of segmentation using a minimal number of training data. Special training images are created to enhance the missing features and to increase the segmentation accuracy of the objects. Retraining strategies are developed to minimize the DNN training time. Single pixel accuracy has been achieved in IR target boundary segmentation using DNNs. The segmentation accuracy between the customized pix2pix DNN and simple thresholding, GraphCut, simple neural network and ResNet models are compared.

A unique approach to training segmentation is to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with a minimal amount of initial labeled training samples. The procedure involves creating synthetic data and using image registration to calculate affine transformations to apply to the synthetic data. The method takes a small dataset and generates a high quality augmented reality synthetic dataset with strong variance while maintaining consistency with real cases. Results illustrate segmentation improvements in various target features and increased average target confidence.

Support for reducing these risks is important. We built a partially occluded object reconstruction method on augmented reality glasses for first responders. We used a deep learning based on conditional generative adversarial networks to train associations between the various images of flammable and hazardous objects and their partially occluded counterparts. Our system then reconstructed an image of a new flammable object. Finally, the reconstructed image was superimposed on the input image to provide "transparency". The system imitates human learning about the laws of physics through experience by learning the shape of flammable objects and the flame characteristics.

Where there is a potential risk for interference or permanent damage, further analysis is required to evaluate the feasibility of mitigation schemes, such as mechanical reconfiguration of antennas or additional RF filtering.

Methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO): an important missing organic in current astrochemical networks	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Astrochemistry; methods: statistical; ISM: abundances; ISM: evolution; ISM: molecules	PROTOSTAR IRAS 16293-2422; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS; GAS-PHASE; DESORPTION; MOLECULES; CHEMISTRY; KINETICS; MODELS; COMETS	Methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO) is one of the important complex organic molecules detected on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by Rosetta's Philae lander. It was also detected in hot cores around high-mass protostars along with a recent detection in the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. We propose here a gas-grain chemical model to form CH3NCO after reviewing various formation pathways with quantum chemical computations. We have used NAUTILUS three-phase gas-grain chemical model to compare observed abundances in the IRAS 16293-2422. Our chemical model clearly indicates the ice phase origin of CH3NCO.

We find that the amplification histories, saturation values and morphologies of the magnetic fields vary considerably depending on the baryonic physics employed, primarily because of differences in the gas density distribution. In particular, adiabatic runs and runs with a subgrid (effective equation of state) stellar feedback model yield lower saturation values and morphologies that exhibit greater large-scale order compared with runs that adopt explicit stellar feedback and runs with cooling and star formation but no feedback. The discrepancies mostly lie in gas denser than the galactic average, which requires cooling and explicit fragmentation to capture. Independent of the baryonic physics included, the magnetic field strength scales with gas density as B alpha n(2/3), suggesting isotropic flux freezing or equipartition between the magnetic and gravitational energies during the field amplification. We conclude that accurate treatments of cooling, star formation and stellar feedback are crucial for obtaining the correct magnetic field strength and morphology in dense gas, which, in turn, is essential for properly modelling other physical processes that depend on the magnetic field, such as cosmic ray feedback.

Other than a brief period, this responsibility was carried by the primary X-Band TWTA. Over the course of the very nearly 20 years of operation between launch and the end-of-mission, the prime Cassini X-Band TWTA operated without problem and with remarkable stability.

Thus, the integrity of a levee is an important issue that needs to be checked frequently. This can be achieved by long-term monitoring of the subsidence of the levee to identify potential weak sections and prioritize maintenance efforts. This paper presents the use of affordable sensing technologies, such as satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), to monitor the settlement of the New Orleans area. Data from TerraSAR-X, the German Space Agency's X-band satellite, was processed with the interferometric point target analysis technique in the gamma remote sensing software for widespread settlement monitoring. The time frame of the data is from 2009 to 2014. In situ measurements from GPS and extensometers are used to verify the remote sensing results, and a good agreement of displacement trends between the two methods was obtained. The favorable comparison increases confidence in the suitability of remote sensing techniques to monitor the long-term displacement of entire levee systems.

Uncertainty Quantification in Graph-Based Classification of High Dimensional Data	SIAM-ASA JOURNAL ON UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION			English	Article						graph classification; uncertainty quantification; Gaussian prior	DIFFUSE INTERFACE MODELS; MCMC METHODS; CONVERGENCE; REGULARIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Classification of high dimensional data finds wide-ranging applications. In many of these applications equipping the resulting classification with a measure of uncertainty may be as important as the classification itself. In this paper we introduce, develop algorithms for, and investigate the properties of a variety of Bayesian models for the task of binary classification; via the posterior distribution on the classification labels, these methods automatically give measures of uncertainty. The methods are all based on the graph formulation of semisupervised learning. We provide a unified framework which brings together a variety of methods that have been introduced in different communities within the mathematical sciences. We study probit classification [C. K. Williams and C. E. Rasmussen, "Gaussian Processes for Regression," in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 8, MIT Press, 1996, pp. 514-520] in the graph-based setting, generalize the level-set method for Bayesian inverse problems [M. A. Iglesias, Y. Lu, and A. M. Stuart, Interfaces Free Bound., 18 (2016), pp. 181-217] to the classification setting, and generalize the Ginzburg-Landau optimization-based classifier [A. L. Bertozzi and A. Flenner, Multiscale Model. Simul., 10 (2012), pp. 1090-1118], [Y. Van Gennip and A. L. Bertozzi, Adv. Differential Equations, 17 (2012), pp. 1115-1180] to a Bayesian setting. We also show that the probit and level-set approaches are natural relaxations of the harmonic function approach introduced in [X. Zhu et al., "Semi-supervised Learning Using Gaussian Fields and Harmonic Functions," in ICML, Vol. 3, 2003, pp. 912-919]. We introduce efficient numerical methods, suited to large datasets, for both MCMC-based sampling and gradient-based MAP estimation. Through numerical experiments we study classification accuracy and uncertainty quantification for our models; these experiments showcase a suite of datasets commonly used to evaluate graph-based semisupervised learning algorithms.

Hadamard variance is used to analyzed the unfiltered and the filtered clock systems. The filtered clock system is constructed using a Kalman filter and accounts for the fractional power spectral density of the pulsar timing noise. Pulsar-aided compact atomic clocks do not have frequency drift induced by the random walk frequency noise as long as the pulsar timing model remains accurate. The result of the analysis shows that pulsars have the potential of enhancing the long-term stability of standalone compact atomic clocks, and the amount of improvement in steady state is dependent not only on pulsar's frequency stability but also on that of the clock.

Parameterized Joint Reconstruction of the Initial Pressure and Sound Speed Distributions for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography	SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES			English	Article						image reconstruction; joint image reconstruction; photoacoustic tomography	WAVE-FORM INVERSION; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ALGORITHMS; MICROSCOPY; GRADIENT; VOLUMES; PLASMA	Accurate estimation of the initial pressure distribution in photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) depends on knowledge of the sound speed distribution. However, the sound speed distribution is typically unknown. Further, the initial pressure and sound speed distributions cannot both, in general, be stably recovered from PACT measurements alone. In this work, a joint reconstruction (JR) method for the initial pressure distribution and a low-dimensional parameterized model of the sound speed distribution is proposed. By employing a priori information about the structure of the sound speed distribution, both the initial pressure and sound speed can be accurately recovered. The JR problem is solved by use of a proximal optimization method that allows constraints and nonsmooth regularization functions for the initial pressure distribution. The gradients of the cost function with respect to the initial pressure and sound speed distributions are calculated by use of an adjoint state method that has the same per-iteration computational cost as calculating the gradient with respect to the initial pressure distribution alone. This approach is evaluated through two-dimensional computer-simulation studies for a small animal imaging model and by application to experimental in vivo measurements of a mouse.

J	Candogan, UO; Chandrasekaran, V				Candogan, Utkan Onur; Chandrasekaran, Venkat			FINDING PLANTED SUBGRAPHS WITH FEW EIGENVALUES USING THE SCHUR-HORN RELAXATION	SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						convex optimization; distance-regular graphs; induced subgraph isomorphism; majorization; orbitopes; semidefinite programming; strongly regular graphs	LARGE HIDDEN CLIQUE; REGULAR GRAPHS; NORM; RANK	Extracting structured subgraphs inside large graphs-often known as the planted subgraph problem-is a fundamental question that arises in a range of application domains. This problem is NP-hard in general and, as a result, significant efforts have been directed towards the development of tractable procedures that succeed on specific families of problem instances. We propose a new computationally efficient convex relaxation for solving the planted subgraph problem; our approach is based on tractable semidefinite descriptions of majorization inequalities on the spectrum of a symmetric matrix. This procedure is effective at finding planted subgraphs that consist of few distinct eigenvalues, and it generalizes previous convex relaxation techniques for finding planted cliques. Our analysis relies prominently on the notion of spectrally comonotone matrices, which are pairs of symmetric matrices that can be transformed to diagonal matrices with sorted diagonal entries upon conjugation by the same orthogonal matrix.

We used bidirectional deep recurrent neural networks to train and test speech recognition performance. We showed that data augmentation and custom language models can improve speech recognition accuracy.

We achieve this by developing an adaptive operator compression scheme and a multiresolution matrix factorization algorithm which achieve nearly optimal performance on both complexity and well-posedness. To develop our adaptive operator compression and multiresolution matrix factorization methods, we first introduce a novel notion of energy decomposition for SPD matrix A using the representation of energy elements. The interaction between these energy elements depicts the underlying topological structure of the operator. This concept of decomposition naturally reflects the hidden geometric structure of the operator which inherits the localities of the structure. By utilizing the intrinsic geometric information under this energy framework, we propose a systematic operator compression scheme for the inverse operator A. In particular, with an appropriate partition of the underlying geometric structure, we can construct localized basis by using the concept of interior and closed energy. Meanwhile, two important localized quantities are introduced, namely, the error factor and the condition factor. Our error analysis results show that these two factors will be the guidelines for finding the appropriate partition of the basis functions such that prescribed compression error and acceptable condition number can be achieved. By virtue of this insight, we propose the patch pairing algorithm to realize our energy partition framework for operator compression with controllable compression error and condition number.

The earth-orbiting Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument will combine radiance and polarization measurements to derive features of ground-level particulate matter. The optical design requires an in-depth analysis of several key polarization factors in order to meet stringent requirements on radiometric and polarimetric accuracy. A simple two-layer optical coating, a pair of achromatic quarter-wave plates, and analysis of the polarization aberrations are used to minimize the effects of polarization errors and achieve high polarimetric accuracy.

Therefore, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), known for their superlative mechanical properties, are of remarkable interest for integration with AM technology. In this study, we pioneer the utilization of commercially available BMG sheetmetal as feedstock for AM, using laser foil printing (LFP) technology. LFP and traditional casting were used to produce samples for four-point bending and Vickers hardness measurements to rigorously compare the mechanical performance of samples resulting from these two fabrication techniques. Through LFP, fully amorphous BMG samples with dimensions larger than the critical casting thickness of the same master alloy were successfully made, while exhibiting high yield strength and toughness in bending. This work exemplifies a potential method to fabricate high-value BMG commercial parts, like gears or mechanisms, where the parts are conventionally machined after printing, and greatly benefit from utilizing novel materials.

Thermoelectric performance of silicon with oxide nanoinclusions	MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Thermal transport; nanoinclusions; plasma synthesis	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; BULK ALLOYS; NANOCOMPOSITES; NANOCRYSTALS; SEGREGATION; TRANSPORT; SI	Silicon nanoparticles produced via a plasma-based technique have been sintered into bulk nanostructured samples. These samples have micron-sized crystalline domains and contain well-dispersed oxide nanoinclusions. We have compared the thermoelectric performance of such structure to that of a control sample produced by sintering ball-milled silicon powders. The control sample has lower precipitate density and is composed of nanograins. Despite the stark difference in nanostructure, both samples have comparable thermal conductivity, and the sample with nanoinclusions has higher power factor and ZT. This result confirms that grain size engineering is not the only promising route to achieving improved thermoelectric performance.

Can Airborne Ground Penetrating Radars Explore Groundwater in Hyper-Arid Regions?	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Airborne radar; ground penetrating radar; remote monitoring; water resources; hydrology; soil	FREQUENCY-RANGE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; CROSS-SECTION; WATER-CONTENT; AQUIFER; GPR; PERMITTIVITY; EVAPORATION; SUBSURFACE	Groundwater provides roughly 43% of the water used globally for irrigated agriculture. Understanding, predicting, and managing the environmental processes that define the natural capital of Earth's changing groundwater is one of the most pressing societal challenges of the 21st century. To understand the influence of the dynamics in the vadose zone on terrestrial ecosystems, and to estimate the future sustainability of groundwater resources, a regional and eventually global assessment of water table depth is required. To enable observations of the hydrologic systems' dynamics, the feasibility of an airborne ground penetrating radar (GPR) system is considered as a first step to effectively provide both large spatial coverage and short revisit times. Such a capability has the potential to enable large-scale surveys to directly observe the shallow subsurface hydrologic processes. To evaluate the capabilities of such a system, we start with a review of soil and subsurface material properties, with a focus on hyper-arid regions. Using first principles, results from literature reviews, and recent field measurements, we then investigate the effects of attenuation and surface clutter to identify the potential capabilities and challenges of an airborne GPR to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the vadose zone. In this paper, we arrive at a qualified "yes" as an answer the title's question. With low radar frequencies (on the order of 10 MHz or less), adequate ground clutter rejection, and medium or higher vadose zone soil resistivity, the detection of water table depths of 50 m and beyond are feasible.

In this work, we explore the use of 1D photonic bandgap structures integrated directly onto a Si sensor that can operate with solar blindness. These filters take advantage of the improved admittance with silicon to significantly improve throughput over conventional stand-alone bandpass filter elements. At far ultraviolet wavelengths these filters require the use of non-absorbing dielectrics such as the metal fluoride materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. The latest performance of these 1D multilayer filters on Si photodiodes and CCD imaging sensors is demonstrated. We have also extended these 1D structures to more complex multilayers guided by the design concepts of metamaterials and metatronics, and to 2D patterned plasmonic hole array filters fabricated in aluminum. The performance of sensors and test filter structures is presented with an emphasis on UV throughput.

Structurable equivalence relations	FUNDAMENTA MATHEMATICAE			English	Article						countable Borel equivalence relations; structurability; Borel reductions		For a class K of countable relational structures, a countable Borel equivalence relation E is said to be K-structurable if there is a Borel way to put a structure in K on each E-equivalence class. We study in this paper the global structure of the classes of K-structurable equivalence relations for various K. We show that K-structurability interacts well with several kinds of Borel homomorphisms and reductions commonly used in the classification of countable Borel equivalence relations. We consider the poset of classes of k-structurable equivalence relations for various K, under inclusion, and show that it is a distributive lattice; this implies that the Borel reducibility preordering among countable Borel equivalence relations contains a large sublattice. Finally, we consider the effect on K-structurability of various model-theoretic properties of K. In particular, we characterize the K such that every K-structurable equivalence relation is smooth, answering a question of Marks.

Commercial digital-output barometers are chosen to be packaged first with 100.000 cSt silicone oil and then sub-micron thick parylene within the volume of the original housing. It is newly found that parylene type and oil viscosity can decide the sign and magnitude of the intrinsic stress in parylene. Additionally, the effect of deposited thickness and temperature on film stress is studied through induced pressure offset. When properly designed, parylene-oil-encapsulated pressure sensors maintain <0.3% sensitivity drift and <1 to 2 minHg offset drift for over 50 to 106+ days in 77 degrees C saline, equivalent to 25 to 53+ months at 37 degrees C [1]. This new compact packaging method is promising for converting air-operated commercial sensors to be "implantable" with nearly original sensitivity and minimal offset and drift.

Electroretinogram responses from rabbits demonstrate bioactivity of the lens, which is further explored in 1D simulations of retinal oxygenation. Tests in human eyes validate comfort, fit, and the Troxler neural adaptation effect. With oxygen transmissibility, DK/t, of 130 Fatt, the lens meets FDA guidelines for overnight wear and offers advantages of comfort and reliability.

The method starts with drawing sacrificial poly(ethylenc carbonate) (PEC) fibers from its chloroform solution and then forms hollow capillaries by coating the fibers with Parylene and removing the sacrificial PEC at its thermolytic temperature. For the fiber drawing, the relation of fiber diameter to other parameters including drawing speed, fiber aspect ratio, solution viscosity and solvent evaporation rate are studied at 0 and 25 degrees C. It is found that 0 degrees C is near the optimal temperature in terms of fiber diameter uniformity. Finally, this work also reports a self-expelling mechanism of the molten PEC at its thermolytic temperature from inside the Parylene-coated PEC fibers, which greatly reduces the sacrificial time to only tens of minutes.

The challenging problems of reliable data delivery and effective mission control that are critical in space explorations are a typical application scenario of the DTN technology. Because space communications must integrate seamlessly with terrestrial communications to support efficient flight operations, DTN is designed as an overlay network architecture; as such, it innately supports the highly heterogeneous networks that will be built on 5G technology. In the absence of reliable underlying links, the reliable data delivery services of DTN rely heavily on the custody transfer feature of its core bundle protocol (BP). Little work has been done in theoretical analysis of the performance of BP custodial transfer in a space communication environment in presence of link disruptions. In this paper, we present a study of BP for reliable data delivery in space communications characterized by multiple link disruption events, accompanied by an extremely long propagation delay and data loss. An analytical model is built to estimate the bundle delivery time and transmission goodput performance of BP for bundle delivery over a space channel in the presence of multiple link disruptions. The model is validated by running data-flow experiments using a testbed infrastructure.

This dream is studied in terms of its image of the walnut tree, rotation about it (the alchemical circulatio), elements of Kundalini yoga (especially a blockage in Uncle Toros's throat), the idea of sacrifice (real vs. psychological), and the Jungian archetypes of the collective unconscious. The problem of identification with evil for the Armenian is raised, along with the need for an Auseinandersetzung (confrontation) through the inner experience of the unconscious with its phantom narratives and healing strength of the feminine.

We find that "protest voting" refers to a wide range of behaviors, and we create a taxonomy of these phenomena. Support for fringe or insurgent parties is often labeled as protest voting. Voting theorists have used the term in a completely different way, identifying an unusual type of tactical voting as protest voting. Protest voting also occurs when voters cast blank, null, or spoiled ballots. There are also instances when protest voting is organized and directed by political elites. Finally, several countries provide voters with the option of casting a vote for "None of the Above," which some see as a form of protest voting. In addition to developing this taxonomy, we discuss the analytical and empirical challenges confronting research on each type of protest voting.	[Alvarez, R. Michael; Kiewiet, D.

Heat Exchanger Performance Impacts on Optimum Cost Conditions in Thermoelectric Energy Recovery Designs	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	14th European Conference on Thermoelectrics (ECT)	SEP 20-23, 2016	Inst Super Tecnico, Alameda Campus, Lisbon, PORTUGAL		Inst Super Tecnico, Alameda Campus	Thermoelectric systems; energy recovery; cost analysis; cost-performannce optimization; heat exchanger effects		Cost is just as important as power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste heat recovery thermoelectric generators (TEG). Prior work [1] has shown that the system design that minimizes cost (e. g., the $/W value) can be close to the designs that maximize the system's efficiency or power density, however, it is important to understand the relationship between those designs to optimize TEG performance-cost compromises. Expanding on recent work [1, 2, 3] the impact of heat exchanger conditions on the optimum TEG fill factors and cost scaling of a waste heat recovery thermoelectric generator with a detailed treatment of the hot side exhaust heat exchanger has been investigated further. The effect of the heat lost to the environment and updated relationships between the hot-side and cold-side conductances [4] that maximize power output are considered. The optimum fill factor to minimize TEG energy recovery system costs is strongly dependent on the heat leakage fraction, s, the mass flow rate of the exhaust, the hot-side heat exchanger effectiveness, heat exchanger UAh, and heat flux. These relationships are explored and characterized for typical exhaust gas-flow conditions to show the inherent design complexities. The heat exchanger costs often dominate the TEG cost equation and it is critical to fully understand the tradeoff between heat exchanger performance, optimum TEG fill factors, and cost to establish potentially optimum design points within the cost-performance design space. This work will explore the design tradeoffs and relationships within the cost-efficiency-power density design space for a typical thermoelectric energy recovery system application. The interplay between optimum TEG fill factors and heat exchanger design can impact system footprint, volume, and mass in weight-sensitive applications. Less-effective, low-cost heat exchangers may outperform higher cost alternatives from a market adoption perspective. This shift of emphasis acknowledging the interdependence of optimum TEG fill factors and heat exchanger performance has significant implications on thermoelectric waste heat recovery systems designs and their operation. In addition, preferred TEG design regimes exist that accommodate reasonable compromises in TE performance and cost. This effort highlights how the optimum fill factor-heat exchanger performance relations couple to these optimum TEG performance-cost domains based on TEG-system-level analyses and provides a focus for future system research and development efforts.

Many of the same design techniques used at lower frequencies are still applied, but fabrication constraints impose significant limitations on the type of structure that can be used, forcing the designer to consider unique fabrication processes or completely new antenna structures. Through advances in fabrication and computational techniques, the variety of terahertz antennas is growing. This chapter presents a range of antennas applied at these frequencies from 1.9 THz horn antennas to superconducting planar arrays. The chapter will cover different antenna technologies and feeds such as corrugated horn antennas, smooth-walled profiled horn antennas, multi-flare angle horn antennas, lens antennas, microlens leaky wave antennas, metasurface antennas, antenna arrays, off-chip antennas, and others. It will detail theory, simulation, fabrication techniques, and state-of-the-art antenna results in all these different technologies at millimeter and terahertz frequencies. The chapter will also provide details for terahertz antennas in the context of terahertz systems.

While only routinely possible in animals, rare clinical procedures make it possible to perform such recordings in awake human beings. Such human single-neuron recordings have started to reveal insights into the neural mechanisms of learning, memory, cognition, attention, and decision-making in humans. Here, we describe in detail the methods we developed to perform such recordings in patients undergoing invasive monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. We describe three aspects: the neurosurgical procedure to implant depth electrodes with embedded microwires, electrophysiological methods to perform experiments in the clinical settings, and data processing steps to isolate single neurons. Together, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the methods needed to perform single-neuron recordings in humans during psychophysical tasks.

Interesterified blends crystallize more slowly than BT. Conversely, the crystallization rates of PMF-BT-based interesterification (IE) products were compared with the starting mixture and IE products prepared with non-PMF triglycerides. The SFC PMF-based IE products increased significantly at temperatures between 25 and 40 degrees C. The SFC profiles became smoother and the products had potential to serve as base oils for preparing specialty fats with a wider range of plasticity. Further exploration of triacylglycerol (TAG) compositional changes revealed that PMF interesterified products had greater saturated/saturated/saturated (S/S/S)-type TAGs compared with soybean oil interesterified products. Moreover, in subsequent evaluations of BT-PMF-based IE fats as a margarine replacement effects in a baked cake model system showed that the material was a suitable functional oil base with acceptable aeration properties and plasticity during baking.

The naturally occurring stable isotopes of volatile elements (D, C-13, N-15, O-17,O-18, S-33,S-34,S-36) provide one way of studying the origin, evolution and migration of geological organic compounds. The study of bulk stable isotope compositions (i.e. averaged across all possible molecular isotopic forms) is well established and widely practised, but frequently results in non-unique interpretations. Increasingly, researchers are reading the organic isotopic record with greater depth and specificity by characterizing stable isotope `structures' - the proportions of site-specific and multiply substituted isotopologues that contribute to the total rare-isotope inventory of each compound. Most of the technologies for measuring stable isotope structures of organic molecules have been only recently developed and to date have been applied only in an exploratory way. Nevertheless, recent advances have demonstrated that molecular isotopic structures provide distinctive records of biosynthetic origins, conditions and mechanisms of chemical transformation during burial, and forensic fingerprints of exceptional specificity. This paper provides a review of this young field, which is organized to follow the evolution of molecular isotopic structure from biosynthesis, through diagenesis, catagenesis and metamorphism.

Hydrothermal explosions in the caldera floor of unknown age until recently created a complex set of intersecting crater structures with evident structural controls. Low-temperature thermal springs and fumaroles occur along known and inferred fracture systems and their crossing points, springs preferentially along the coast and fumaroles within the caldera and its hydrothermal explosion craters. Their chemical and isotopic signatures reflect phase separation and mixing to varying degrees with magmatic, hydrothermal, meteoric, and seawater components. A deep hot hydrothermal brine with seawater and magmatic influence feeds thermal fluid and gases by vapor separation into a set of intermediate thermal aquifers, which have been explored by drilling. A shallow low-temperature aquifer results from steam condensation and the resulting surface manifestations emit hot steam-gas mixtures at up to boiling temperature. Widespread diffuse degassing of CO2 demonstrates the permeable nature of the Nisyros hydrothermal system, focusing along fault systems, releasing 68 t d(-1) of CO2 and 58 MW of thermal energy. The last magmatic activity of Nisyros, even if of unknown age, is considered relatively old, based on morphological considerations and on the absence of historical magmatic eruptions. Nevertheless, there are many geochemical indications supporting the presence of a magmatic source at depth, which feeds the hydrothermal system. This evidence is mainly constituted by the isotopic composition of H2O, S, and He discharged by the Nisyros fumaroles.

J	Zak, M				Zak, Michail			Modelling 'Life' against 'heat death'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Entropy; probability; livings; intuition		This work is inspired by the discovery of a new class of dynamical system described by ordinary differential equations coupled with their Liouville equation. These systems called self-controlled since the role of actuators is played by the probability produced by the Liouville equation. Following the Madelung equation that belongs to this class, non-Newtonian properties such as randomness, entanglement and probability interference typical for quantum systems have been described. Special attention was paid to the capability to violate the second law of thermodynamics, which makes these systems neither Newtonian, nor quantum. It has been shown that self-controlled dynamical systems can be linked to mathematical models of living systems. The discovery of isolated dynamical systems that can decrease entropy in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, and resemblances of these systems to livings suggests that 'Life' can slow down the 'heat death' of the Universe and that can be associated with the Purpose of Life.

J	Chen, CW				Chen, Curtis W.			Approach for Modeling Coherent Radar Ground Echoes in Planetary Landing Simulations	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							DESCENT; PERFORMANCE	An approach is proposed for modeling coherent radar echoes from a distributed ground surface in planetary landing simulations. Such simulations pose unique challenges for radar echo modeling given the highly dynamic position and attitude profile that a landing vehicle may follow. The current surface-modeling approach is based on a coherent facet model, with speckle realizations for each cell interpolated from a two-dimensional array of random values, the indices into which are computed from the viewing geometry following the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem. This formulation allows the use of methods for resampling the scene while preserving the continuity of the speckle in the modeled radar echoes. Simulated results are presented, demonstrating that the current approach indeed captures the desired surface correlation properties for use in high-fidelity models of landing radar performance.

This paper outlines the necessary technologies that enable these small satellites to be placed on an interplanetary trajectory. Propulsion is a key aspect of this problem but is only part of it; because a nanospacecraft does not choose its launcher and its injection orbit, launch opportunities and propulsion systems must be considered together. Specifications of present and upcoming electric thrusters and the limits of electric propulsion are described. Especially, the use of such nanothrusters on a nanospacecraft are considered with the realistic constraint of limited thrusting time, which restricts the very large Delta V that can be obtained otherwise. Then, given the present state of rideshare opportunities along scientific or commercial missions, the paper analyzes the possibility of nanospacecraft escaping Earth on their own from common orbits. The paper concludes on technological and system developments required for nanospacecraft to change the paradigm of interplanetary Solar System exploration.

CUTE will probe both atomic (Mg and Fe) and molecular (OH) lines for evidence of enhanced transit absorption, and to search for evidence of early ingress due to bow shocks ahead of the planet's orbital motion. As a dedicated mission, CUTE will observe greater than or similar to 100 spectroscopic transits of hot Jupiters over a nominal 7-month mission. This represents the equivalent of >700 orbits of the only other instrument capable of these measurements, the Hubble Space Telescope. CUTE efficiently utilizes the available CubeSat volume by means of an innovative optical design to achieve a projected effective area of similar to 28 cm(2), low instrumental background, and a spectral resolving power of R similar to 3000 over the primary science bandpass. These performance characteristics enable CUTE to discern transit depths between 0.1% and 1% in individual spectral absorption lines. We present the CUTE optical and mechanical design, a summary of the science motivation and expected results, and an overview of the projected fabrication, calibration, and launch timeline.

Vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that performs optimally on off-axis, monolithic telescopes and may also be designed for segmented telescopes with minor losses in performance. We describe the key advantages of vortex coronagraphs on off-axis telescopes such as (1) unwanted diffraction due to aberrations is passively rejected in several low-order Zernike modes relaxing the wavefront stability requirements for imaging Earth-like planets from <10 to >100 pmrms, (2) stars with angular diameters >0.1 lambda/D may be sufficiently suppressed, (3) the absolute planet throughput is >10%, even for unfavorable telescope architectures, and (4) broadband solutions (Delta lambda/lambda > 0.1) are readily available for both monolithic and segmented apertures. The latter make use of grayscale apodizers in an upstream pupil plane to provide suppression of diffracted light from amplitude discontinuities in the telescope pupil without inducing additional stroke on the deformable mirrors. We set wavefront stability requirements on the telescope, based on a stellar irradiance threshold set at an angular separation of 3 +/- 0.5 lambda/D from the star, and discuss how some requirements may be relaxed by trading robustness to aberrations for planet throughput.

Symmetry Breaking Induced Activation of Nanocrystal Optical Transitions	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article								We have analysed the effect of symmetry breaking on the optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals due to doping by charged impurities. Using doped CdSe nanocrystals as an example, we show the effects of a Coulomb center on the exciton fine-structure and optical selection rules using symmetry theory and then quantify the effect of symmetry breaking on the exciton fine structure, modelling the charged center using a multipole expansion. The model shows that the presence of a Coulomb center breaks the nanocrystal symmetry and affects its optical properties through mixing and shifting of the hole spin and parity sublevels. This symmetry breaking, particularly for positively charged centers, shortens the radiative lifetime of CdSe nanocrystals even at room temperature, in qualitative agreement with the increase in PL efficiency observed in CdSe nanocrystals doped with positive Ag charge centers [A. Sahu et. al., Nano Lett. 12, 2587, (2012)]. The effect of the charged center on the photoluminescence and the absorption spectra is shown, with and without the presence of compensating charges on the nanocrystal surface. While spectra of individual nanocrystals are expected to shift and broaden with the introduction of a charged center, configuration averaging and inhomogeneous broadening are shown to wash out these effects. The presence of compensating charges at the NC surface also serves to stabilize the band edge transition energies relative to NCs with no charge centers.

While John Bailar is often credited as the "Father of American Inorganic Chemistry," it is arguable that Fred Basolo, Bailar's student at Illinois, has had the most lasting impact on the dramatic growth of the field in American academia. Justification for that assertion includes the remarkable representation of his academic descendants among inorganic faculty members of American universities; comments and reminiscences from the students he trained; and an examination of his seminal contributions in the form of both original research and textbooks, particularly the groundbreaking 1958 work Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions, written with his Northwestern colleague Ralph Pearson, which played a central role in raising the intellectual stature of inorganic chemistry by bringing the study of mechanism to the forefront.

Simulations using detailed hydrogen chemistry are done on one-, two-, and three-dimensional flames. The analysis spans flat and stretched, steady and unsteady, and laminar and turbulent flames. Quantitative and qualitative results using the thermal diffusion model compare very well with the more complex multicomponent diffusion model. Comparisons are made using flame speeds, surface areas, species profiles, and chemical source terms. Once validated, this model is applied to three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flames. For these cases, thermal diffusion causes an increase in the propagation speed of the flames as well as increased product chemical source terms in regions of high positive curvature. The results illustrate the necessity for including thermal diffusion, and the accuracy and computational efficiency of the mixture-averaged thermal diffusion model.

Thermoelectric energy recovery is one important technology for recovering this waste thermal energy in high-temperature industrial, transportation and military energy systems. Thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems in these applications require high performance hot-side and cold-side heat exchangers to provide the critical temperature differential and transfer the required thermal energy. High performance hot-side heat exchangers in these systems are often metal-based due to requirements for high-temperature operation, strength at temperature, corrosion resistance, and chemical stability. However, the generally selected metal-based hot-side heat exchangers (i.e., Inconels, Stainless Steels) suffer from low thermal conductivity, high thermal expansion, and high density, which degrades their thermal performance, leads to high thermal-expansion-driven stresses, and creates relatively high mass/high volume (i.e., low power density) TEG systems that are then difficult to fabricate and integrate into viable energy recovery systems. This paper describes the design and testing of a new, high-temperature minichannel graphite heat exchanger designed for operation up to 500 degrees C that is a critical element of a high-power-density TEG power system for aircraft energy recovery. This high-performance graphite heat exchanger represents a new state-of-the-art standard in high-temperature heat exchangers for TEG systems, which provides higher thermal transport, less thermal expansion at operation, lower system level stresses on TE components, and a lighter weight TEG system. This new heat exchanger creates a new design paradigm in TEG system design for terrestrial energy recovery and potential NASA technology infusion into terrestrial energy system applications. This paper will present and discuss the key heat transfer, pressure drop, pumping power analyses and design tradeoffs that created this unique design. Heat transfer and pressure drop modeling was performed with both empirical models based on known heat transfer and friction factor correlations and COMSOL thermal/fluid dynamic modeling of the graphite heat exchanger structure. We will also discuss resulting thermal transport and heat fluxes predicted at the TEG interface level. Heat exchanger performance testing was performed under simulated operating conditions and correlation with test data at the anticipated operating temperature conditions will be presented and discussed.

M.; Preskill, John			BQP-completeness of Scattering in Scalar Quantum Field Theory	QUANTUM			English	Article							COMPUTATION; MATRIX	Recent work has shown that quantum computers can compute scattering probabilities in massive quantum field theories, with a run time that is polynomial in the number of particles, their energy, and the desired precision. Here we study a closely related quantum field-theoretical problem: estimating the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude, in the presence of spacetime-dependent classical sources, for a massive scalar field theory in 1) dimensions. We show that this problem is HQP-hard: in other words, its solution enables one to solve any problem that is solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer. Hence, the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude cannot be accurately estimated by mm efficient classical algorithm, even if the field theory is very weakly coupled, unless BQP=BPP. Furthermore, the corresponding decision problem can be solved by a quantum computer in a time scaling polynomially with the number of bits needed to specify the classical source fields, and this problem is therefore BQP-complete. Our construction can be regarded as an idealized architecture 14 a universal quantum computer in a laboratory system described by massive 04 theory coupled to classical spacetime-dependent sources.

Relaxation of Alignment Errors and Phase Calibration in Computational Frequency-Diverse Imaging using Phase Retrieval	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Microwaves; imaging; phase retrieval; computational imaging; coherent imaging; phase coherence; phaseless imaging; calibration; frequency-diversity	METAMATERIAL APERTURES; SIMULATION PLATFORM; MICROWAVE; SYSTEM; IMAGER; RADAR	We demonstrate a computational, frequency-diverse, phaseless imaging technique at microwave frequencies that minimizes the impacts of phase calibration and alignment errors on image reconstruction. Phase calibration error is introduced by means of misaligning the sub-antennas forming an aperture, causing unwanted phase shifts between the forward model and adjoint operation. It is shown that by leveraging phase retrieval techniques, distinguishable images can still be reconstructed in the presence of significant phase errors, while complex-based reconstructions those relying on measurement of both phase and amplitude produce heavily corrupted images. Using a frequency-diverse imaging system consisting of a cavity-backed metasurface antenna that operates at microwave frequencies in the K-band (17.5-26.5 GHz), we demonstrate the complex-based and phaseless images of various objects, from a simple subwavelength conducting element to more complex metal structures. We verify that the combination of the phase retrieval approach with the frequency-diverse imager significantly improves the robustness of the composite imaging system to phase errors. While frequency-diverse computational imaging systems have significant advantages in terms of hardware, their reliance on a near-exact forward model places heavy requirements on system calibration. The phase retrieval approach developed here has the potential to alleviate this reliance, increasing the feasibility of such systems.

J	Callies, J; Ferrari, R				Callies, Jorn; Ferrari, Raffaele			Baroclinic Instability in the Presence of Convection	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							MIXED-LAYER INSTABILITIES; 2-DIMENSIONAL EADY WAVES; OCEAN FRONTS; NONLINEAR EQUILIBRATION; GEOSTROPHIC TURBULENCE; STABILITY; DISSIPATION; BALANCE; DRIVEN; MODEL	Baroclinic mixed-layer instabilities have recently been recognized as an important source of submesoscale energy in deep winter mixed layers. While the focus has so far been on the balanced dynamics of these instabilities, they occur in and depend on an environment shaped by atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence. In this study, idealized numerical simulations are presented that allow the development of both baroclinic instability and convective small-scale turbulence, with simple control over the relative strength. If the convection is only weakly forced, baroclinic instability restratifies the layer and shuts off convection, as expected. With increased forcing, however, it is found that baroclinic instabilities are remarkably resilient to the presence of convection. Even if the instability is too weak to restratify the layer and shut off convection, the instability still grows in the convecting environment and generates baroclinic eddies and fronts. This suggests that despite the vigorous atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence in winter mixed layers, baroclinic instabilities can persistently grow, generate balanced submesoscale turbulence, and modify the bulk properties of the upper ocean.

The resulting metamorphosis model was introduced and analyzed in [M. I. Miller and L. Younes, Int. J. Comput. Vis., 41 (2001), pp. 61-84; A. Trouve and L. Younes, Found. Comput. Math., 5 (2005), pp. 173-198], and a variational time discretization for the geodesic interpolation was proposed in [B. Berkels, A. Effiand, and M. Rumpf, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 8 (2015), pp. 1457-1488]. In this paper, this time discrete model is expanded and an image extrapolation via a discretization of the geometric exponential map is consistently derived for the variational time discretization. For a given weakly differentiable initial image and an initial image variation, the exponential map allows one to compute a discrete geodesic extrapolation path in the space of images. It is shown that a time step of this shooting method can be formulated in the associated deformations only. For sufficiently small time steps, local existence and uniqueness are proved using a suitable fixed point formulation and the implicit function theorem. A spatial Galerkin discretization with cubic splines on coarse meshes for the deformations and piecewise bilinear finite elements on fine meshes for the image intensities are used to derive a fully practical algorithm. Different applications underline the efficiency and stability of the proposed approach.

Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities-Optimized Stroke Minimization. II. Optimization for Future Missions	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; methods: numerical; planets and satellites: detection; stars: imaging	CONTRAST IMAGING-SYSTEMS; EXTREME ADAPTIVE OPTICS; GEMINI PLANET IMAGER; 2 DEFORMABLE MIRRORS; 51 ERI B; TELESCOPE APERTURES; CORONAGRAPH; ABERRATIONS; PRINCIPLE; EXOPLANET	High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy provide unique constraints for exoplanet formation models as well as for planetary atmosphere models. Instrumentation techniques in this field have greatly improved over the last two decades, with the development of stellar coronagraphy, in parallel with specific methods of wavefront sensing and control. Next generation space-and ground-based telescopes will enable the characterization of cold solar-system-like planets for the first time and maybe even in situ detection of bio-markers. However, the growth of primary mirror diameters, necessary for these detections, comes with an increase of their complexity (segmentation, secondary mirror features). These discontinuities in the aperture can greatly limit the performance of coronagraphic instruments. In this context, we introduced a new technique, Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities-Optimized Stroke Minimization (ACAD-OSM), to correct for the diffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a coronagraph, using deformable mirrors. In this paper, we present several tools that can be used to optimize the performance of this technique for its application to future large missions. In particular, we analyzed the influence of the deformable setup (size and separating distance) and found that there is an optimal point for this setup, optimizing the performance of the instrument in contrast and throughput while minimizing the strokes applied to the deformable mirrors. These results will help us design future coronagraphic instruments to obtain the best performance.

In this review, we describe aspects of neural crest induction, migration and axial level differences, highlighting what is known about the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms.

The Impact of Airborne Radio Occultation Observations on the Simulation of Hurricane Karl (2010)	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM; FULL SPECTRUM INVERSION; GENESIS POTENTIAL INDEX; SATELLITE RADIANCE DATA; TROPICAL CYCLONES; RAPID INTENSIFICATION; OBSERVATION OPERATOR; REFRACTIVE-INDEX; FORECAST IMPACT; ATMOSPHERE	This study evaluates, for the first time, the impact of airborne global positioning system radio occultation (ARO) observations on a hurricane forecast. A case study was conducted of Hurricane Karl during the PreDepression Investigation of Cloud-Systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaign in 2010. The assimilation of ARO data was developed for the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) analysis system of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model version 3.2. The impact of ARO data on Karl forecasts was evaluated through data assimilation (DA) experiments of local refractivity and nonlocal excess phase (EPH), in which the latter accounts for the integrated horizontal sampling along the signal ray path. The tangent point positions (closest point of an RO ray path to Earth's surface) drift horizontally, and the drifting distance of ARO data is about 2 to 3 times that of spaceborne RO, which was taken into account in these simulations. Results indicate that in the absence of other satellite observations, the assimilation of ARO EPH resulted in a larger impact on the analysis than local refractivity did. In particular, the assimilation of ARO observations at the actual tangent point locations resulted in more accurate forecasts of the rapid intensification of the storm. Among all experiments, the best forecast was obtained by assimilating ARO data with the most accurate geometric representation, that is, the use of nonlocal EPH operators with tangent point drift, which reduced the error in the storm's predicted minimum sea level pressure (SLP) by 43% beyond that of the control experiment.

ATOMISTIC SIMULATION OF HYDROGEN DIFFUSION IN PALLADIUM NANOPARTICLES USING A DIFFUSIVE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS METHOD	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2017, VOL 9			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	NOV 03-09, 2017	Tampa, FL	ASME			PHASE-TRANSFORMATIONS; INFORMATION-THEORY; PD NANOCRYSTALS; STORAGE; ABSORPTION; GROWTH	Understanding the transport of hydrogen within metals is crucial for the advancement of energy storage and the mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement. Using nanosized palladium particles as a model, recent experimental studies have revealed several highly nonlinear phenomena that occur over a long period of time. The time scale of these phenomena is beyond the capability of established atomistic models. In this work, we present the application of a new model, referred to as diffusive molecular dynamics (DMD), to simulating long-term diffusive mass transport at atomistic length scale. Specifically, we validate the model for the long-term dynamics of a single hydrogen atom on palladium lattice. We show that the DMD result is in satisfactory agreement with the result of the classical random walk model. Then, we apply the DMD model to simulate the absorption of hydrogen by a palladium nanocube with an edge length of 16 nm. We show that the absorption process is dominated by the propagation of a sharp, coherent alpha/beta hydride phase boundary. We also characterize the local lattice deformation near the dynamic phase boundary using the mean positions of the palladium and hydrogen atoms.

The intention was to study the efficiency in separating non-volatile particles. No particles could be detected downstream of either device when challenged with neat octacosane particles at high concentration. Both laboratory and marine exhaust aerosol measurements showed that sub-23nm semi-volatile particles are formed downstream of the thermodenuder when upstream sulfuric acid approached 100 ppbv. Charge measurements revealed that these are formed by re-nucleation rather than incomplete evaporation of upstream aerosol. Sufficient dilution to control upstream sulfates concentration and moderate TD operation temperature (250 degrees C) are both required to eliminate their formation. Use of the CS following an evaporation tube seemed to eliminate the risk for particle re-nucleation, even at a ten-fold higher concentration of semi-volatiles than in case of the TD. Particles detected downstream of the CS due to incomplete evaporation of sulfuric acid and octacosane aerosol, did not exceed 0.01% of upstream concentration. Despite the superior performance of CS in separating non-volatile particles, the TD may still be useful in cases where increased sensitivity over the traditional evaporation tube method is needed and where high sulfur exhaust concentration may fast deplete the catalytic stripper adsorption capacity.Copyright (c) 2018 American Association for Aerosol Research	[Amanatidis, Stavros; Ntziachristos, Leonidas] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, POB 458, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Amanatidis, Stavros; Ntziachristos, Leonidas; Karjalainen, Panu; Saukko, Erkka; Simonen, Pauli; Kuittinen, Niina; Ronkko, Topi; Keskinen, Jorma] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Phys, Tampere, Finland; [Aakko-Saksa, Paivi] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Timonen, Hilkka] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Amanatidis, Stavros] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Saukko, Erkka] Pegasor Oy, Tampere, Finland	Ntziachristos, L (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, POB 458, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.	leon@auth.gr	Keskinen, Jorma/G-4222-2014; Keskinen, Jorma/AAV-5576-2020; Timonen, Hilkka/Y-6958-2019; Aakko-Saksa, Paivi T/F-4213-2018; Timonen, Hilkka J/M-8141-2014; Karjalainen, Panu/B-9585-2015; NTZIACHRISTOS, LEONIDAS/C-6999-2008	Keskinen, Jorma/0000-0002-2807-8593; Keskinen, Jorma/0000-0002-2807-8593; Timonen, Hilkka/0000-0002-7987-7985; Aakko-Saksa, Paivi T/0000-0003-2995-0889; Timonen, Hilkka J/0000-0002-7987-7985; Simonen, Pauli/0000-0002-4267-6098; Kuittinen, Niina/0000-0002-8423-8934; Ronkko, Topi/0000-0002-1555-3367; Karjalainen, Panu/0000-0003-2824-0033; Amanatidis, Stavros/0000-0002-4924-8424; NTZIACHRISTOS, LEONIDAS/0000-0002-5630-9686	Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation)Finnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES); Agco Power Oy; Dinex Ecocat Oy; Dekati Oy; Neste Oyj; Pegasor Oy; Wartsila Finland Oy; TekesFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES); Wartsila; Pegasor; Spectral Engines; Gasmet; VG-Shipping; HaminaKotka Satama Oy; Oiltanking Finland Oy; Kine Robotics	This work was conducted in the framework of the HERE project funded by Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation), Agco Power Oy, Dinex Ecocat Oy, Dekati Oy, Neste Oyj, Pegasor Oy, and Wartsila Finland Oy.

Computational simulation of the dynamics of secondary organic aerosol formation in an environmental chamber	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							VAPOR WALL-LOSS; ALPHA-PINENE OZONOLYSIS; LABORATORY CHAMBERS; PARTICLE; GAS; DEPOSITION; MODEL; STATE; SIZE; LOSSES	A key atmospheric process that is studied in laboratory chambers is the oxidation of volatile organic compounds to form low volatility products that condense on existing atmospheric particles (or nucleate) to form organic aerosol, so-called secondary organic aerosol. The laboratory chamber operates as a chemical reactor, in which a number of chemical and physical processes take place: gas-phase chemistry, transport of vapor oxidation products to suspended particles followed by uptake into the particles, deposition of vapors on the walls of the chamber, deposition of particles on the walls of the chamber, and coagulation of suspended particles. Understanding the complex interplay among these simultaneous physicochemical processes is necessary in order to interpret the results of chamber experiments. Here we develop and utilize a comprehensive computational model for dynamics of vapors and particles in a laboratory chamber and analyze chamber behavior over a range of physicochemical conditions.Copyright (c) 2018 American Association for Aerosol Research	[Sunol, A.

Estimation of Precipitation over the OLYMPEX Domain during Winter 2015/16	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT; RAIN-GAUGE; CLIMATOLOGICAL PRECIPITATION; OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; PASSIVE MICROWAVE; SATELLITE; RADAR; TEMPERATURE; GSMAP	To provide ground validation data for satellite precipitation products derived from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, such as IMERG, in cold seasons and where orographic factors exert strong controls on precipitation, the Olympic Mountain Experiment (OLYMPEX) was conducted during winter 2015/16. By utilizing multiple observational resources from OLYMPEX, estimates of daily and finer-scale precipitation are constructed at 1/328 spatial resolution over the OLYMPEX domain. The estimates are based on NOAA WSR-88D and gauge estimates as incorporated in NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Q3GC product, augmented with an additional 120 gauges available during OLYMPEX. Few stations are located in the interior of the Olympic Peninsula at elevations higher than about 500 m, and in this part of the domain the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model is used to invert the snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates, derived from two NASA JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow depth maps on 8-9 February 2016 and 29-30 March 2016, for precipitation through adjustment of the precipitation-weighting factor on a grid cell by grid cell basis. In comparison with this composite product, both IMERG (version 04A) and its Japanese counterpart GSMaP's (version 04B) satellite-only products tend to underestimate winter precipitation, by 41% and 28%, respectively, over the entire domain from 1 October 2015 to 30 April 2016. The underestimation is more pronounced for the orographically enhanced mountainous interior of the OLYMPEX domain, by 57% and 48%, respectively. In contrast, IMERG and GSMaP storm interarrival time statistics are quite similar to those estimated from gridded observations.

J	Vakilzadeh, MK; Beck, JL; Abrahamsson, T				Vakilzadeh, Majid K.; Beck, James L.; Abrahamsson, Thomas			USING APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION BY SUBSET SIMULATION FOR EFFICIENT POSTERIOR ASSESSMENT OF DYNAMIC STATE-SPACE MODEL CLASSES	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Approximate Bayesian Computation; Subset Simulation; Bayesian model selection; system identification; bilinear and Masing hysteretic models	CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; CLASS SELECTION; FAILURE PROBABILITIES; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; STRUCTURAL MODELS; INFERENCE; ABC	Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods have gained in popularity over the last decade because they expand the horizon of Bayesian parameter inference methods to the range of models for which an analytical formula for the likelihood function might be difficult, or even impossible, to establish. The majority of the ABC methods rely on the choice of a set of summary statistics to reduce the dimension of the data. However, as has been noted in the ABC literature, the lack of convergence guarantees induced by the absence of a vector of sufficient summary statistics that assures intermodel sufficiency over the set of competing models hinders the use of the usual ABC methods when applied to Bayesian model selection or assessment. In this paper, we present a novel ABC model selection procedure for dynamical systems based on a recently introduced multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo method, self-regulating ABC-SubSim, and a hierarchical state-space formulation of dynamic models. We show that this formulation makes it possible to independently approximate the model evidence required for assessing the posterior probability of each of the competing models. We also show that ABC-SubSim not only provides an estimate of the model evidence as a simple by-product but also gives the posterior probability of each model as a function of the tolerance level, which allows the ABC model choices made in previous studies to be understood. We illustrate the performance of the proposed framework for ABC model updating and model class selection by applying it to two problems in Bayesian system identification: a single-degree-of-freedom bilinear hysteretic oscillator and a three-story shear building with Masing hysteresis, both of which are subject to a seismic excitation.

Dynamics of many-body localization in the presence of particle loss	QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						many-body localization; time evolution; open quantum systems; matrix product operators; cold atoms in optical lattices	SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; LATTICE; ATOMS	At long times, residual couplings to the environment become relevant even in the most isolated experiments, a crucial difficulty for the study of fundamental aspects of many-body dynamics. A particular example is many-body localization in a cold-atom setting, where incoherent photon scattering introduces both dephasing and particle loss. Whereas dephasing has been studied in detail and is known to destroy localization already on the level of non-interacting particles, the effect of particle loss is less well understood. A difficulty arises due to the 'non-local' nature of the loss process, complicating standard numerical tools using matrix product decomposition. Utilizing symmetries of the Lindbladian dynamics, we investigate the particle loss on both the dynamics of observables, as well as the structure of the density matrix and the individual states. We find that particle loss in the presence of interactions leads to dissipation and a strong suppression of the (operator space) entanglement entropy. Our approach allows for the study of the interplay of dephasing and loss for pure and mixed initial states to long times, which is important for future experiments using controlled coupling of the environment.

Velocity is measured by the Doppler shift of dual X- and Ka-band radio links between the Juno spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, and the DSS-25 antenna of the Deep Space Network (DSN). During times of closest-approach, Juno experiences large dynamic ranges caused by the orbital dynamics and spin signatures caused by the spin-stabilized spacecraft that are detectable by the receivers at DSS-25. Open-loop recordings of received voltages are processed to compute Doppler observables utilized in the estimation of the gravity field. Presented is a method to process open-loop data collected by the DSN to compensate for the spin signature of the spacecraft, removal of artifacts from Doppler observables caused by the high dynamic environment, and improve performance of the digital phase-locked loop utilized in the data processing.

Invented at Caltech/JPL, recent laboratory demonstrations have resulted in near quantum-limited noise performance over more than an octave of microwave bandwidth and operating temperatures as high as 3 Kelvin. These amplifiers have the potential to be used as front-end replacements for ALMA's mm/sub-mm SIS receivers and intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers, and for multiplexing faint signals from focal-plane arrays of single-photon detectors on space telescopes such as NASA's Origins Space Telescope (OST). The enhanced observational capabilities that would be enabled by TKIP front-end amplifiers on ALMA would tremendously benefit ALMA science across all bands.

Attitudes toward text recycling in academic writing across disciplines	ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH-POLICIES AND QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Academic honesty; academic publishing; academic writing; research ethics; self-plagiarism; text reuse; writing in the disciplines	SELF-PLAGIARISM; STUDENT PLAGIARISM; LANGUAGE REUSE; MISNOMER; CULTURE	Text recycling, the reuse of material from one's own previously published writing in a new text without attribution, is a common academic writing practice that is not yet well understood. While some studies of text recycling in academic writing have been published, no previous study has focused on scholars' attitudes toward text recycling. This article presents results from a survey of over 300 journal editors and editorial board members from 86 top English-language journals in 16 different academic fields regarding text recycling in scholarly articles. Responses indicate that a large majority of academic gatekeepers believe text recycling is allowable in some circumstances; however, there is a lack of clear consensus about when text recycling is or is not appropriate. Opinions varied according to the source of the recycled material, its structural location and rhetorical purpose, and conditions of authorship conditionsas well as by the level of experience as a journal editor. Our study suggests the need for further research on text recycling utilizing focus groups and interviews.

In a 1 km pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean simulation, the small-scale sea ice deformations are evaluated with a scaling analysis in relation to satellite observations of the Envisat Geophysical Processor System (EGPS) in the Central Arctic. A new coupled scaling analysis for data on Eulerian grids is used to determine the spatial and temporal scaling and the coupling between temporal and spatial scales. The spatial scaling of the modeled sea ice deformation implies multifractality. It is also coupled to temporal scales and varies realistically by region and season. The agreement of the spatial scaling with satellite observations challenges previous results with VP models at coarser resolution, which did not reproduce the observed scaling. The temporal scaling analysis shows that the VP model, as configured in this 1 km simulation, does not fully resolve the intermittency of sea ice deformation that is observed in satellite data.

The faults are governed by a rate and state friction law. The roughness introduces local barriers that complicate the nucleation process and result in asymmetric expansion of the rupture, nonmonotonic increase in the slip rates on the fault, and the generation of multiple slip pulses. These complexities are reflected as irregular fluctuations in the moment rate. There is a large difference between first slip events in the sequences and later events. In the first events, for roughness amplitude b(r)0.002, there is a large increase in the nucleation length with increasing b(r). For larger values of b(r), slip is mostly aseismic. For the later events there is a trade-off between the effects of the finite fault length and the fault roughness. For b(r)0.002, the finite length is a more dominant factor and the nucleation length barely changes with b(r). For larger values of b(r), the roughness plays a larger role and the nucleation length increases significantly with b(r). Using an energy balance approach, where the roughness is accounted for in the fault stiffness, we derive an approximate solution for the nucleation length on rough faults. The solution agrees well with the main trends observed in the simulations for the later events and provides an estimate of the frictional and roughness properties under which faults experience a transition between seismic and aseismic slip.

Relationships between ECS and observable metrics of the current climate in model ensembles, so-called emergent constraints, have been used to constrain ECS. Here a statistical method (including a backward selection process) is employed to achieve a better statistical understanding of the connections between four recently proposed emergent constraint metrics and individual feedbacks influencing ECS. The relationship between each metric and ECS is largely attributable to a statistical connection with shortwave low cloud feedback, the leading cause of intermodel ECS spread. This result bolsters confidence in some of the metrics, which had assumed such a connection in the first place. Additional analysis is conducted with a few thousand artificial metrics that are randomly generated but are well correlated with ECS. The relationships between the contrived metrics and ECS can also be linked statistically to shortwave cloud feedback. Thus, any proposed or forthcoming ECS constraint based on the current generation of climate models should be viewed as a potential constraint on shortwave cloud feedback, and physical links with that feedback should be investigated to verify that the constraint is real. In addition, any proposed ECS constraint should not be taken at face value since other factors influencing ECS besides shortwave cloud feedback could be systematically biased in the models.

The stellar mass, star formation rate and dark matter halo properties of LAEs at z similar to 2	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: halos; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: star formation	LY-ALPHA EMITTERS; LYMAN-BREAK GALAXIES; LARGE-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; SUBARU DEEP FIELD; REST-FRAME ULTRAVIOLET; NEAR-INFRARED CATALOG; YALE-CHILE MUSYC; FORMING GALAXIES; HIGH-REDSHIFT; H-ALPHA	We present average stellar population properties and dark matter halo masses of z similar to 2 Ly alpha emitters (LAEs) from spectral energy distribution fitting and clustering analysis, respectively, using similar or equal to 1250 objects (NB387 <= 25.5) in four separate fields of similar or equal to 1 deg(2) in total. With an average stellar mass of 10.2 +/- 1.8 x 10(8) M-circle dot and star formation rate of 3.4 +/- 0.4M(circle dot) yr(-1), the LAEs lie on an extrapolation of the star-formation main sequence (MS) to low stellar mass. Their effective dark matter halo mass is estimated to be 4.0(-2.9)(+5.1) x 10(10) M-circle dot with an effective bias of 1.22(-0.18)(+0.16), which is lower than that of z similar to 2 LAEs (1.8 +/- 0.3) obtained by a previous study based on a three times smaller survey area, with a probability of 96%. However, the difference in the bias values can be explained if cosmic variance is taken into account. If such a low halo mass implies a low HI gas mass, this result appears to be consistent with the observations of a high Ly alpha escape fraction. With the low halo masses and ongoing star formation, our LAEs have a relatively high stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) and a high efficiency of converting baryons into stars. The extended Press-Schechter formalism predicts that at z = 0 our LAEs are typically embedded in halos with masses similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); they will also have similar SHMRs to the LMC, if their star formation rates are largely suppressed after z similar to 2 as some previous studies have reported for the LMC itself.

Detecting Upward Directed Charged Particle Fluxes in the Mars Science Laboratory Radiation Assessment Detector	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; GCR; MSL; RAD; particle flux directionality	PROTONS; RAD	The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, operating on the surface of Mars, is exposed to radiation fluxes from above and below. Galactic Cosmic Rays travel through the Martian atmosphere, producing a modified spectrum consisting of both primary and secondary particles at ground level. These particles produce an upward directed secondary particle spectrum as they interact with the Martian soil. Here we develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward directed particle fluxes in the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of Geant4 and Planetocosmics modeling to find discrimination criteria for the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare model-predicted values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in RAD observation data. Given the quality of available information on Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and rover composition, we find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. We additionally note that the method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies. Plain Language Summary The MSL rover Curiosity is exposed to energetic particles from above and below on the Martian surface. Particles enter the Martian atmosphere from above and travel through it until they reach the ground. Particles lose energy and can produce secondary particles while passing through the atmosphere, resulting in an energy distribution on ground level that is different from that on the top of the atmosphere. The resulting particles produce an upward directed particle distribution in the soil. We develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward particle fluxes in the RAD instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of models to find criteria for discriminating the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare simulated values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in observation data. We find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. The method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies.	[Appel, J. K.; Koeehler, J.; Guo, J.; Lohf, H.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R.

Retrieval of Compositional End-Members From Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity Observations in a Soil-Filled Fracture in Marathon Valley, Endeavour Crater Rim	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; Opportunity rover; Endeavour crater; Marathon Valley; aqueous alteration	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; X-RAY SPECTROMETER; LEAST-SQUARES; CHEMISTRY; DEPOSITS	The Opportunity rover investigated a gentle swale on the rim of Endeavour crater called Marathon Valley where a series of bright planar outcrops are cut into polygons by fractures. A wheel scuff performed on one of the soil-filled fracture zones revealed the presence of three end-members identified on the basis of Pancam multispectral imaging observations covering 0.4 to 1m: red and dark pebbles, and a bright soil clod. Multiple overlapping Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) measurements were collected on three targets within the scuff zone. The field of view of each APXS measurement contained various proportions of the Pancam-based end-members. Application of a log maximum likelihood method for retrieving the composition of the end-members using the 10 APXS measurements shows that the dark pebble end-member is compositionally similar to average Mars soil, with slightly elevated S and Fe. In contrast, the red pebble end-member exhibits enrichments in Al and Si and is depleted in Fe and Mg relative to average Mars soil. The soil clod end-member is enriched in Mg, S, and Ni. Thermodynamic modeling of the soil clod end-member composition indicates a dominance of sulfate minerals. We hypothesize that acidic fluids in fractures leached and oxidized the basaltic host rock, forming the red pebbles, and then evaporated to leave behind sulfate-cemented soil. Plain Language Summary The Opportunity rover investigated a region on the rim of Endeavour crater on Mars called Marathon Valley where a series of bright outcrops are cut by fractures. A scuff performed by one of the rover wheels on the fractures revealed the presence of three different compositional end-members. A novel technique was applied to retrieve the composition of the end-members using measurements by the rover's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer and Pancam instruments. The presence of a magnesium-sulfate-rich soil end-member and hematite-rich pebbles in the scuffed fracture imply alteration in an acid-sulfate environment. Results add to growing evidence of alteration along the rim of Endeavour crater that was concentrated along fractures, which likely provided a conduit for subsurface fluid flow. The timing of formation of these altered deposits is unclear; they could have formed during transient postimpact hydrothermal activity or perhaps significantly later utilizing groundwater from the southern highlands.

Complex Plane Specular Meteor Radar Interferometry	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						radar; phased array; interferometry; uncertainty; specular; meteor	MESOSPHERIC WINDS; CALIBRATION	This paper presents a solution to the problem of specular meteor radar interferometry cast on the complex plane. This technique is applicable to all meteor radars at the output of the receiver's pulsed Doppler signal processing chain. Specular meteor trail radar echoes are modeled as exponentially decaying sinusoids impinging on a sparse interferometric antenna array. A set of 10 underdense meteor trail radar parameters are estimated using nonlinear least squares optimization of the physical model parameters. Meteor trail spatial locations are determined by estimating all parameters through global optimization of the complex-valued interferometric angle-of-arrival equations. Statistical precision of the estimated meteor radar parameters of Doppler, diffusion coefficient, angle-of-arrival, and height are subsequently characterized by calculation of the full covariance matrix. The determination of statistical uncertainties in the measured parameters is a key innovation in the field, as it lays the groundwork for calculating the statistical precision of the subsequently derived wind field.

Moreover, in the case where K admits three nontrivial finite surgeries, K must be the pretzel knot P(-2, 3, 7). In the case where K admits two noncyclic finite surgeries or two finite surgeries at distance 2, the two surgery slopes must be one of ten or seventeen specific pairs, respectively. For D-type finite surgeries, we improve a finiteness theorem due to Doig by giving an explicit bound on the possible resulting prism manifolds, and also prove that 4m and 4m + 4 are characterizing slopes for the torus knot T(2m + 1, 2) for each m >= 1.

We report a PACT system equipped with a high frequency linear transducer array for mapping the microvascular network of a whole mouse brain with the skull intact and studying its hemodynamic activities. The linear array was scanned in the coronal plane to collect data from different angles, and full-view images were synthesized from the limited-view images in which vessels were only partially revealed. We investigated spontaneous neural activities in the deep brain by monitoring the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood vessels and observed strong interhemispherical correlations between several chosen functional regions, both in the cortical layer and in the deep regions. We also studied neural activities during an epileptic seizure and observed the epileptic wave spreading around the injection site and the wave propagating in the opposite hemisphere. [GRAPHICS] .

New Separators in Lithium/Sulfur Cells with High-Capacity Cathodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LI-S; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; SULFUR BATTERIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ENERGY DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE CATHODES; CARBON; ELECTRODE; CHEMISTRY	Lithium-sulfur cells exhibit poor cycle life, due to the 'polysulfide shuttle' enabled by the dissolution of sulfur reduction products in organic electrolyte. Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, including novel cathode designs to sequester polysulfides within the cathode, new electrolytes with reduced polysulfide solubility, and blocking layers to hinder polysulfide migration towards the anode. However, these are less successful in the case of high-energy Li/S cells with cathodes featuring substantial sulfur loadings, as proportionately greater polysulfide dissolution rapidly degrades performance. Additionally, the electrolyte/sulfur ratio is a limiting factor in high-energy cells, indicating that a minimum polysulfide solubility is required. Herein we describe the benefits of modified separators with the objective of blocking polysulfide migration. Specifically, we demonstrate improved discharge performance in laboratory Li/S cells with ceramic-coated separators, including single-sided and double-sided Al2O3-coated polyolefin material from commercial sources. We also developed a new AlF3 coating on a polyolefin separator that showed even greater improvements: higher initial specific capacity (similar to 800 mAh/gS), coulombic efficiency (>96%), and cycle life (>100 cycles). Detailed analytical study via SEM and EDS of separators harvested from cycled cells indicated an approximately uniform sulfur distribution across the ceramic-coated separator. Finally, concentrated electrolytes, which reportedly minimize polysulfide diffusion and lithium dendrite growth, were tested and shown to yield high coulombic efficiency although with low sulfur utilization.

The Role of Three-Dimensional Boundary Stresses in Limiting the Occurrence and Size of Experimental Landslides	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						slope stability; shallow landslides; landslide experiments; landslide size	RAINFALL-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; FLOW; AVALANCHES; EROSION; GENERATION; RESISTANCE; PARTICLE; FAILURE; ANGLES; MODEL	The occurrence of seepage-induced shallow landslides on hillslopes and steep channel beds is important for landscape evolution and natural hazards. Infinite-slope stability models have been applied for seven decades, but sediment beds generally require higher water saturation levels than predicted for failure, and controlled experiments are needed to test models. We initiated 90 landslides in a 5 m long laboratory flume with a range in sediment sizes (D = 0.7, 2, 5, and 15mm) and hillslope angles ( = 20 degrees to 43 degrees), resulting in subsurface flow that spanned the Darcian and turbulent regimes, and failures that occurred with subsaturated and supersaturated sediment beds. Near complete saturation was required for failure in most experiments, with water levels far greater than predicted by infinite-slope stability models. Although 3-D force balance models predict that larger landslides are less stable, observed downslope landslide lengths were typically only several decimeters, not the entire flume length. Boundary stresses associated with short landslides can explain the increased water levels required for failure, and we suggest that short failures are tied to heterogeneities in granular properties. Boundary stresses also limited landslide thicknesses, and landslides progressively thinned on lower gradient hillslopes until they were one grain diameter thick, corresponding to a change from near-saturated to supersaturated sediment beds. Thus, landslides are expected to be thick on steep hillslopes with large frictional stresses acting on the boundaries, whereas landslides should be thin on low-gradient hillslopes or in channel beds with a critical saturation level that is determined by sediment size. Plain Language Summary Shallow landslides on hillslopes and steep riverbeds commonly occur when rainwater saturates soil enough to outweigh its frictional stability. Landslides play a key role in shaping mountains and pose natural hazards to those living in steep terrain. To predict the occurrence of landslides we often rely on models that have not been verified experimentally. To test these models, we initiated 90 landslides on a laboratory hillslope under a wide range of soil conditions and inclination angles. We found that landslides on very steep hillslopes were nearly as stable as on low gradient hills but were much larger in size. At small hillslope angles, landslides could be as thin as a single sediment grain, and the amount of water required to initiate these slides was determined by sediment size. Landslide models that consider the frictional force acting only at the base of the landslides underpredict stability in all experiments. Frictional forces acting at the boundaries of landslides are often ignored, but including these forces can explain the increased stability of our experimental hillslopes. However, these models are unable to predict the size of the experimental landslides, which were, on average, 10-fold smaller than predicted.

Past, targeted investments in specific climate questions have resulted in tremendous improvements in issues important to human health, security, and infrastructure. However, the current climate observing system was not planned in a comprehensive, focused manner required to adequately address the full range of climate needs. A potential approach to planning the observing system of the future is presented in this article. First, this article proposes that priority be given to the most critical needs as identified within the World Climate Research Program as Grand Challenges. These currently include seven important topics: melting ice and global consequences; clouds, circulation and climate sensitivity; carbon feedbacks in the climate system; understanding and predicting weather and climate extremes; water for the food baskets of the world; regional sea-level change and coastal impacts; and near-term climate prediction. For each Grand Challenge, observations are needed for long-term monitoring, process studies and forecasting capabilities. Second, objective evaluations of proposed observing systems, including satellites, ground-based and in situ observations as well as potentially new, unidentified observational approaches, can quantify the ability to address these climate priorities. And third, investments in effective climate observations will be economically important as they will offer a magnified return on investment that justifies a far greater development of observations to serve society's needs.

Enabling interoperability in planetary sciences and heliophysics: The case for an information model	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union (AGU)	DEC 14-18, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union		Interoperability; Information architecture; Information model; Planetary science; Heliophysics; Semantic; Digital repository; Ontology		The Planetary Data System has developed the PDS4 Information Model to enable interoperability across diverse science disciplines. The Information Model is based on an integration of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) level standards for trusted digital archives, information model development, and metadata registries. Where controlled vocabularies provides a basic level of interoperability by providing a common set of terms for communication between both machines and humans the Information Model improves interoperability by means of an ontology that provides semantic information or additional related context for the terms. The information model was defined by team of computer scientists and science experts from each of the diverse disciplines in the Planetary Science community, including Atmospheres, Geosciences, Cartography and Imaging Sciences, Navigational and Ancillary Information, Planetary Plasma Interactions, Ring-Moon Systems, and Small Bodies. The model was designed to be extensible beyond the Planetary Science community, for example there are overlaps between certain PDS disciplines and the Heliophysics and Astrophysics disciplines. "Interoperability" can apply to many aspects of both the developer and the end-user experience, for example agency-to-agency, semantic level, and application level interoperability. We define these types of interoperability and focus on semantic level interoperability, the type of interoperability most directly enabled by an information model.	[Hughes, J.

The survey has been awarded 300 nights of observing time at the Subaru Telescope, and it started in 2014 March. This paper presents the first public data release of HSC-SSP. This release includes data taken in the first 1.7 yr of observations (61.5 nights), and each of the Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep layers covers about 108, 26, and 4 square degrees down to depths of i similar to 26.4, similar to 26.5, and similar to 27.0 mag, respectively (5 sigma for point sources). All the layers are observed in five broad bands (grizy), and the Deep and UltraDeep layers are observed in narrow bands as well. We achieve an impressive image quality of 0.'' 6 in the i band in the Wide layer. We show that we achieve 1%-2% point spread function (PSF) photometry (root mean square) both internally and externally (against Pan-STARRS1), and similar to 10 mas and 40 mas internal and external astrometric accuracy, respectively. Both the calibrated images and catalogs are made available to the community through dedicated user interfaces and database servers. In addition to the pipeline products, we also provide value-added products such as photometric redshifts and a collection of public spectro-scopic redshifts. Detailed descriptions of all the data can be found online. The data release website is https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp.

A team of scientists from Japan, Taiwan, and Princeton University is using HSC to carry out a 300-night multi-band imaging survey of the high-latitude sky. The survey includes three layers: the Wide layer will cover 1400 deg(2) in five broad bands (grizy), with a 5 sigma point-source depth of r approximate to 26. The Deep layer covers a total of 26 deg(2) in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg(2)). Here we describe the instrument, the science goals of the survey, and the survey strategy and data processing. This paper serves as an introduction to a special issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, which includes a large number of technical and scientific papers describing results from the early phases of this survey.

The system was commissioned in 2012-2014, and has been offered for general observations, including the HSC Subaru Strategic Program, since 2014 March. The system provides observers with data quality information, such as seeing, sky background level, and sky transparency, based on quick analysis as data are acquired. Quick-look images and validation of image focus are also provided through an interactive web application. The system is responsible for the automatic extraction of QA information from acquired raw data into a database, to assist with observation planning, assess progress of all observing programs, and monitor long-term efficiency variations of the instrument and telescope. Enhancements of the system are being planned to facilitate final data analysis, to improve the HSC archive, and to provide legacy products for astronomical communities.

On the 1.degrees 5 diameter focal plane (497 mm in physical size), 116 four-side buttable 2k x 4 k fully depleted CCDs are tiled with 0.3 mm gaps between adjacent chips, which are cooled down to -100.degrees C by two pulse tube coolers with a capability to exhaust 100 W heat at -100.degrees C. The design of the dewar is basically a natural extension of Suprime-Cam, incorporating some improvements such as (1) a detailed CCD positioning strategy to avoid any collision between CCDs while maximizing the filling factor of the focal plane, (2) a spherical washers mechanism adopted for the interface points to avoid any deformation caused by the tilt of the interface surface to be transferred to the focal plane, (3) the employment of a truncated-cone-shaped window, made of synthetic silica, to save the back focal space, and (4) a passive heat transfer mechanism to exhaust efficiently the heat generated from the CCD readout electronics which are accommodated inside the dewar. Extensive simulations using a finite-element analysis (FEA) method are carried out to verify that the design of the dewar is sufficient to satisfy the assigned errors. We also perform verification tests using the actually assembled CCD dewar to supplement the FEA and demonstrate that the design is adequate to ensure an excellent image quality which is key to the HSC. The details of the camera system, including the control computer system, are described as well as the assembling process of the dewar and the process of installation on the telescope.

The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg(2) split into six fields, with a mean i-band seeing of 0".58 and 5 sigma point-source depth of i similar to 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for first-year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin(-2), respectively. We define the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We find that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lensing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function rho(1) < 3 x 10(-7) (requirement: 4 x 10(-7)) at 0 degrees.5 scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on > 1 degrees scales that are sufficiently large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.

As a pilot study for a series of papers, we measure hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) masses using XMM-Newton data for four clusters in the current coverage area out of a sample of 22 MCXC clusters. We additionally analyze a non-MCXC cluster associated with one MCXC cluster. We show that HE masses for the MCXC clusters are correlated with cluster richness from the CAMIRA catalog, while that for the non-MCXC cluster deviates from the scaling relation. The mass normalization of the relationship between cluster richness and HE mass is compatible with one inferred by matching CAMIRA cluster abundance with a theoretical halo mass function. The mean gas mass fraction based on HE masses for the MCXC clusters is < f(gas)> = 0.125 +/- 0.012 at spherical overdensity Delta = 500, which is similar to 80%-90% of the cosmic mean baryon fraction, Omega(b)/Omega(m), measured by cosmic microwave background experiments. We find that the mean baryon fraction estimated from X-ray and HSC-SSP optical data is comparable to Omega(b)/Omega(m). A weak-lensing shear catalog of background galaxies, combined with photometric redshifts, is currently available only for three clusters in our sample. Hydrostatic equilibrium masses roughly agree with weak-lensingmasses, albeit with large uncertainty. This study demonstrates that further multiwavelength study for a large sample of clusters using X-ray, HSC-SSP optical, and weak-lensing data will enable us to understand cluster physics and utilize cluster-based cosmology.

HSC is a new prime focus optical imager with a 1.(omicron)5-diameter field of view on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The superb median seeing on the HSC i-band images of 0 ''.56 allows the reconstruction of high angular resolution mass maps via weak lensing, which is crucial for the weak lensing cluster search. We identify 65 mass map peaks with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio larger than 4.7, and carefully examine their properties by cross-matching the clusters with optical and X-ray cluster catalogs. We find that all the 39 peaks with S/N > 5.1 have counterparts in the optical cluster catalogs, and only 2 out of the 65 peaks are probably false positives. The upper limits of X-ray luminosities from the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) imply the existence of an X-ray underluminous cluster population. We show that the X-rays from the shear-selected clusters can be statistically detected by stacking the RASS images. The inferred average X-ray luminosity is about half that of the X-ray-selected clusters of the same mass. The radial profile of the dark matter distribution derived from the stacking analysis is well modeled by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile with a small concentration parameter value of c(500) similar to 2.5, which suggests that the selection bias on the orientation or the internal structure for our shear-selected cluster sample is not strong.

II. Faint end color-magnitude diagrams and radial profiles of red and blue galaxies at 0.1 < z < 1.1	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: dark matter	MORPHOLOGY-DENSITY RELATION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; STELLAR MASS; DATA RELEASE; HALO MASSES; SEQUENCE; EVOLUTION; ENVIRONMENT; FRACTIONS	We present a statistical study of the redshift evolution of the cluster galaxy population over a wide redshift range from 0.1 to 1.1, using similar to 1900 optically-selected CAMIRA clusters from similar to 232 deg(2) of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide S16A data. Our stacking technique with a statistical background subtraction reveals color-magnitude diagrams of red-sequence and blue cluster galaxies down to faint magnitudes of m(z) similar to 24. We find that the linear relation of red-sequence galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram extends down to the faintest magnitudes we explore with a small intrinsic scatter sigma(int)(g - r) < 0.1. The scatter does not evolve significantly with redshift. The stacked color-magnitude diagrams are used to define red and blue galaxies in clusters in order to study their radial number density profiles without resorting to photometric redshifts of individual galaxies. We find that red galaxies are significantly more concentrated toward cluster centers and blue galaxies dominate the outskirts of clusters. We explore the fraction of red galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction decreases with increasing distances from cluster centers. The red fraction exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift. The radial number density profiles of cluster member galaxies are also used to infer the location of the steepest slope in the three-dimensional galaxy density profiles. For a fixed threshold in richness, we find little redshift evolution in this location.

We compare these weak lensing based dark matter maps with maps of the distribution of the stellar mass associated with luminous red galaxies. We find a strong correlation between these two maps with a correlation coefficient of rho = 0.54 +/- 0.03 (for a smoothing size of 8'). This correlation is detected even with a smaller smoothing scale of 2' (rho = 0.34 +/- 0.01). This detection is made uniquely possible because of the high source density of the HSC-SSP weak lensing survey ((n) over bar similar to 25 arcmin(-2)). We also present a variety of tests to demonstrate that our maps are not significantly affected by systematic effects. By using the photometric redshift information associated with source galaxies, we reconstruct a three-dimensional mass map. This three-dimensional mass map is also found to correlate with the three-dimensional galaxy mass map. Cross-correlation tests presented in this paper demonstrate that the HSC-SSP weak lensing mass maps are ready for further science analyses.

The HSC images are sufficiently deep to detect cluster member galaxies down to M-* similar to 10(10.2) M-circle dot even at z similar to 1, allowing a reliable cluster detection at such high redshifts. We apply the CAMIRA algorithm to the HSC Wide S16A dataset covering similar to 232 deg(2) to construct a catalog of 1921 clusters at redshift 0.1 < z < 1.1 and richness (N) over cap (mem) > 15 that roughly corresponds to M-200m greater than or similar to 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot. We confirm good cluster photometric redshift performance, with the bias and the scatter in Delta z/(1 + z) being better than 0.005 and 0.01, respectively, over most of the redshift range. We compare our cluster catalog with large X-ray cluster catalogs from the XXL and XMM-LSS (the XMM Large Scale Structure) surveys and find good correlation between richness and X-ray properties.

Time-reversed ultrasonically encoded optical focusing through highly scattering ex vivo human cataractous lenses	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS			English	Article						focusing light through turbid media; wavefront shaping; adaptive optics; optical phase conjugation; time-reversed ultrasonically encoded optical focusing; cataract; amblyopia	PHASE-CONJUGATION; TURBIDITY SUPPRESSION; CONGENITAL CATARACT; DECORRELATION TIME; IN-VIVO; LIGHT; SURGERY; MEDIA; GLAUCOMA; PERIODS	Normal development of the visual system in infants relies on clear images being projected onto the retina, which can be disrupted by lens opacity caused by congenital cataract. This disruption, if uncorrected in early life, results in amblyopia (permanently decreased vision even after removal of the cataract). Doctors are able to prevent amblyopia by removing the cataract during the first several weeks of life, but this surgery risks a host of complications, which can be equally visually disabling. Here, we investigated the feasibility of focusing light noninvasively through highly scattering cataractous lenses to stimulate the retina, thereby preventing amblyopia. This approach would allow the cataractous lens removal surgery to be delayed and hence greatly reduce the risk of complications from early surgery. Employing a wavefront shaping technique named time-reversed ultrasonically encoded optical focusing in reflection mode, we focused 532-nm light through a highly scattering ex vivo adult human cataractous lens. This work demonstrates a potential clinical application of wavefront shaping techniques. (c) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

The mission objectives are primarily the observation of the oceanic mesoscales but also include coastal oceanography, global and regional sea level monitoring, data assimilation, and operational oceanography. The mission ended its nominal phase after 3 years in orbit and began a new phase (drifting orbit) in July 2016. The objective of this paper is to provide a state of the art of the achievements of the SARAL/AltiKa mission in terms of quality assessment and unique characteristics of AltiKa data. It shows that the AltiKa data have similar accuracy at the centimeter level in term of absolute water level whatever the method (from local to global) and the type of water surfaces (ocean and lakes). It shows also that beyond the fact that AltiKa data quality meets the expectations and initial mission requirements, the unique characteristics of the altimeter and the Ka-band offer unique contributions in fields that were previously not fully foreseen.

Downscaling GRACE Remote Sensing Datasets to High-Resolution Groundwater Storage Change Maps of California's Central Valley	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GRACE; downscaling; groundwater; neural networks; California's Central Valley; water resources management	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CIRCULATION MODEL OUTPUT; AQUIFER SYSTEM; WATER; SIMULATION; DEPLETION; PRECIPITATION; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; REGIONS	NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has already proven to be a powerful data source for regional groundwater assessments in many areas around the world. However, the applicability of GRACE data products to more localized studies and their utility to water management authorities have been constrained by their limited spatial resolution (similar to 200,000 km(2)). Researchers have begun to address these shortcomings with data assimilation approaches that integrate GRACE-derived total water storage estimates into complex regional models, producing higher-resolution estimates of hydrologic variables (similar to 2500 km(2)). Here we take those approaches one step further by developing an empirically based model capable of downscaling GRACE data to a high-resolution (similar to 16 km(2)) dataset of groundwater storage changes over a portion of California's Central Valley. The model utilizes an artificial neural network to generate a series of high-resolution maps of groundwater storage change from 2002 to 2010 using GRACE estimates of variations in total water storage and a series of widely available hydrologic variables (PRISM precipitation and temperature data, digital elevation model (DEM)-derived slope, and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil type). The neural network downscaling model is able to accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior, with acceptable Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for calibration and validation (ranging from 0.2445 to 0.9577 and 0.0391 to 0.7511, respectively). Ultimately, the model generates maps of local groundwater storage change at a 100-fold higher resolution than GRACE gridded data products without the use of computationally intensive physical models. The model's simulated maps have the potential for application to local groundwater management initiatives in the region.

Numerous processing approaches have been developed to improve InSAR results and overcome its limitations. Regardless of the processing methodology, however, temporal decorrelation is a major obstacle for all InSAR applications, especially over vegetated areas and dynamic environments, such as Interior Alaska. Temporal coherence is usually modeled as a univariate exponential function of temporal baseline. It has been, however, documented that temporal variations in surface backscattering due to the change in surface parameters, i.e., dielectric constant, roughness, and the geometry of scatterers, can result in gradual, seasonal, or sudden decorrelations and loss of InSAR coherence. The coherence models introduced so far have largely neglected the effect of the temporal change in backscattering on InSAR coherence. Here, we introduce a new temporal decorrelation model that considers changes in surface backscattering by utilizing the relative change in SAR intensity between two images as a proxy for the change in surface scattering parameters. The model also takes into account the decorrelation due to the change in snow depth between two images. Using the L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) data, the model has been assessed over forested and shrub landscapes in Delta Junction, Interior Alaska. The model decreases the RMS error of temporal coherence estimation from 0.18 to 0.09 on average. The improvements made by the model have been statistically proved to be significant at the 99% confidence level. Additionally, the model shows that the coherence of forested areas are more prone to changes in backscattering than shrub landscape. The model is based on L-band data and may not be expanded to C-band or X-band InSAR observations.

Estimating Live Fuel Moisture from MODIS Satellite Data for Wildfire Danger Assessment in Southern California USA	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						wildfire; satellite vegetation indices; live fuel moisture; empirical model function; Southern California; chaparral ecosystem	TIME-SERIES; VEGETATION; DEGRADATION; IMPACT; NDVI	The goal of the research reported here is to assess the capability of satellite vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard both Terra and Aqua satellites, in order to replicate live fuel moisture content of Southern California chaparral ecosystems. We compared seasonal and interannual characteristics of in-situ live fuel moisture with satellite vegetation indices that were averaged over different radial extents around each live fuel moisture observation site. The highest correlations are found using the Aqua Enhanced Vegetation Index for a radius of 10 km, independently verifying the validity of in-situ live fuel moisture measurements over a large extent around each in-situ site. With this optimally averaged Enhanced Vegetation Index, we developed an empirical model function of live fuel moisture. Trends in the wet-to-dry phase of vegetation are well captured by the empirical model function on interannual time-scales, indicating a promising method to monitor fire danger levels by combining satellite, in-situ, and model results during the transition before active fire seasons. An example map of Enhanced Vegetation Index-derived live fuel moisture for the Colby Fire shows a complex spatial pattern of significant live fuel moisture reduction along an extensive wildland-urban interface, and illustrates a key advantage in using satellites across the large extent of wildland areas in Southern California.

We show that their inequalities can be rewritten as an n-matrix generalization of Lieb's original triple matrix inequality. The complex matrix powers are replaced by resolvents and appropriate maximally entangled states. We expect that the technically advantageous properties of resolvents, in particular for perturbation theory, can be of use in applications of the n-matrix inequalities, e.g., for analyzing the performance of the rotated Petz recovery map in quantum information theory and for removing the unitaries altogether.

Reservoirs act as critical buffers to ensure agricultural and municipal water deliveries, mitigate flooding, and generate hydroelectric power, yet they often lose significant amounts of water through evaporation, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Despite this fact, reservoir evaporation has been an inconsistently and inaccurately estimated component of the water cycle within the water resource infrastructure of the arid and semiarid western United States. This paper highlights the increasing importance and challenges of correctly estimating and forecasting reservoir evaporation in the current and future climate, as well as the need to bring new ideas and state-of-the-art practices for the estimation of reservoir evaporation into operational use for modern water resource managers. New ideas and practices include i) improving the estimation of reservoir evaporation using up-to-date knowledge, state-of-the-art instrumentation and numerical models, and innovative experimental designs to diagnose processes and accurately forecast evaporation; ii) improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variations in evaporative water loss from existing reservoirs and transferring this knowledge when expanding reservoirs or siting new ones; and iii) implementing an adaptive management plan that incorporates new knowledge, observations, and forecasts of reservoir evaporation to improve water resource management.

We present new zircon U-Pb geochronology results to show that the Dala diabase was emplaced at similar to 132 Ma and geochemical data (whole-rock element and Sr-Nd isotope ratios, zircon Hf isotopes and Fe similar to Ti oxide mineral chemistry) to confirm that the Dala diabase intrusion is part of the Comei LIP. The Dala diabase can be divided into a high-Mg/low-Ti series and a low-Mg/high-Ti series. The high-Mg/low-Ti series represents more primitive mafic magma compositions that we demonstrate are parental to the low-Mg/high-Ti series. Fractionation of olivine and clinopyroxene, followed by plagioclase within the low-Mg series, lead to systematic changes in concentrations of mantle compatible elements (Cr, Co, Ni, and V), REEs, HFSEs, and major elements such as Ti and P. Some Dala samples from the low-Mg/high-Ti series contain large ilmenite clusters and show extreme enrichment of Ti with elevated Ti/Y ratios, likely due to settling and accumulation of ilmenite during the magma chamber evolution. However, most samples from throughout the Comei LIP follow the Ti-evolution trend of the typical liquid line of descent (LLD) of primary OIB compositions, showing strong evidence of control of Ti contents by differentiation processes. In many other localities, however, primitive magmas are absent and observed Ti contents of evolved magmas cannot be quantitatively related to source processes. Careful examination of the petrogenetic relationship between co-existing low-Ti and high-Ti mafic rocks is essential to using observed rock chemistry to infer source composition, location, and degree of melting.

J	Izard, A; Fosalba, P; Crocce, M				Izard, Albert; Fosalba, Pablo; Crocce, Martin			ICE-COLA: fast simulations for weak lensing observables	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; dark matter; large-scale structure of Universe	MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; MOCK GALAXY CATALOGS; DARK-MATTER; COVARIANCE-MATRIX; PERTURBATION-THEORY; FAST GENERATION; HALO CATALOGS; ACCURATE	Approximate methods to full N-body simulations provide a fast and accurate solution to the development of mock catalogues for the modelling of galaxy clustering observables. In this paper we extend ICE-COLA, based on an optimized implementation of the approximate COLA method, to produce weak lensing maps and halo catalogues in the light-cone using an integrated and self-consistent approach. We show that despite the approximate dynamics, the catalogues thus produced enable an accurate modelling of weak lensing observables one decade beyond the characteristic scale where the growth becomes non-linear. In particular, we compare ICE-COLA to the MICE Grand Challenge N-body simulation for some fiducial cases representative of upcoming surveys and find that, for sources at redshift z = 1, their convergence power spectra agree to within 1 per cent up to high multipoles (i.e. of order 1000). The corresponding shear two point functions, xi+ and. xi-, yield similar accuracy down to 2 and 20 arcmin respectively, while tangential shear around a z = 0.5 lens sample is accurate down to 4 arcmin. We show that such accuracy is stable against an increased angular resolution of the weak lensing maps. Hence, this opens the possibility of using approximate methods for the joint modelling of galaxy clustering and weak lensing observables and their covariance in ongoing and future galaxy surveys.

The dusty aftermath of SN Hunt 248: merger-burst remnant?

The 2014 outburst achieved peak luminosity equivalent to that of the historic eruption of luminous blue variable (LBV) eta Car, and exhibited a multipeaked optical light curve which rapidly faded after similar to 100 d. We report ultraviolet (UV) through optical observations of SN Hunt 248 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) about 1 yr after the outburst, and mid-infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope before the burst and in decline. The HST data reveal a source which is a factor of similar to 10 dimmer in apparent brightness than the faintest available measurement of the precursor star. The UV-optical spectral energy distribution (SED) requires a strong Balmer continuum, consistent with a hot B4-B5 photosphere attenuated by grey circumstellar extinction. Substantial mid-infrared excess of the source is consistent with thermal emission from hot dust with a mass of similar to 10(-6)-10(-5) M-circle dot and a geometric extent which is comparable to the expansion radius of the ejecta from the 2014 event. SED modelling indicates that the dust consists of relatively large grains (>0.3 mu m), which could be related to the grey circumstellar extinction which we infer for the UV-optical counterpart. Revised analysis of the precursor photometry is also consistent with grey extinction by circumstellar dust, and suggests that the initial mass of the star could be twice as large as previously estimated (nearly similar to 60M(circle dot)). Re-analysis of the earlier outburst data shows that the peak luminosity and outflow velocity of the eruption are consistent with a trend exhibited by stellar merger candidates, prompting speculation that SN Hunt 248 may also have stemmed from a massive stellar merger or common-envelope ejection.

J	Friedrich, O; Eifler, T				Friedrich, Oliver; Eifler, Tim			Precision matrix expansion - efficient use of numerical simulations in estimating errors on cosmological parameters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: statistical; cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; COVARIANCE-MATRIX; SHRINKAGE ESTIMATION; COSMOLIKE; IMPACT	Computing the inverse covariance matrix (or precision matrix) of large data vectors is crucial in weak lensing (and multiprobe) analyses of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Analytically computed covariances are noise-free and hence straightforward to invert; however, the model approximations might be insufficient for the statistical precision of future cosmological data. Estimating covariances from numerical simulations improves on these approximations, but the sample covariance estimator is inherently noisy, which introduces uncertainties in the error bars on cosmological parameters and also additional scatter in their best-fitting values. For future surveys, reducing both effects to an acceptable level requires an unfeasibly large number of simulations. In this paper we describe a way to expand the precision matrix around a covariance model and show how to estimate the leading order terms of this expansion from simulations. This is especially powerful if the covariance matrix is the sum of two contributions, C = A + B, where A is well understood analytically and can be turned off in simulations (e.g. shape noise for cosmic shear) to yield a direct estimate of B. We test our method in mock experiments resembling tomographic weak lensing data vectors from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). For DES we find that 400 N-body simulations are sufficient to achieve negligible statistical uncertainties on parameter constraints. For LSST this is achieved with 2400 simulations. The standard covariance estimator would require > 10(5) simulations to reach a similar precision. We extend our analysis to a DES multiprobe case finding a similar performance.

Using spatially uniform 3D gold-nanoparticle sensors, we have demonstrated surface enhanced Raman sensing of insulin in the secretions from human pancreatic islets under low and high glucose environments without the use of labels such as antibodies or aptamers. Label-free measurements of the islet secretions showed excellent correlation among the ambient glucose levels, secreted insulin concentrations, and measured Raman emission intensities. When excited at 785 nm, plasmonic hotspots of the densely arranged 3D gold-nanoparticle pillars as well as strong interaction between sulfide linkages of the insulin molecules and the gold nanoparticles produced highly sensitive and reliable insulin measurements down to 100 pM. The sensors exhibited a dynamic range of 100 pM to 50 nM with an estimated detection limit of 35 pM, which covers the reported concentration range of insulin observed in pancreatic cell secretions. The sensitivity of this approach is approximately 4 orders of magnitude greater than previously reported results using label-free optical approaches, and it is much more cost-effective than immunoassay-based insulin detection widely used in clinics and laboratories. These promising results may open up new opportunities for insulin sensing in research and clinical applications.

Here we introduce a superwettable microchip that integrates superhydrophobic superhydrophilic micropatterns and a nanodendritic electrochemical biosensor toward the detection of prostate cancer biomarkers. On the superwettable microchip, the superhydrophobic area could confine the microdroplets in superhydrophilic microwells; such behavior is extremely helpful for reducing the amount of analytical solution. In contrast, superhydrophilic microwells exhibit a high adhesive force toward microdroplets, and the nanodendritic structures can improve probe-binding capacity and response signals, thus greatly enhancing the sensitivity. Sensitive and selective detection of prostate cancer biomarkers including miRNA-375, miRNA-141, and prostate specific antigen on a single microchip is also achieved. Such a superwettable microchip with high sensitivity, low sample volume, and upside-down detection capability in a single microdroplet shows great potential to fabricate portable devices toward complex biosensing applications.

Simulation-based marginal likelihood for cluster strong lensing cosmology	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: numerical; methods: statistical; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: theory	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; GALACTIC NUCLEI FEEDBACK; DARK-MATTER HALOES; APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; X-RAY; GALAXY CLUSTERS; ARC STATISTICS; AGN FEEDBACK; SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH; MILLENNIUM SIMULATION	Comparisons between observed and predicted strong lensing properties of galaxy clusters have been routinely used to claim either tension or consistency with Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. However, standard approaches to such cosmological tests are unable to quantify the preference for one cosmology over another. We advocate approximating the relevant Bayes factor using a marginal likelihood that is based on the following summary statistic: the posterior probability distribution function for the parameters of the scaling relation between Einstein radii and cluster mass, alpha and beta. We demonstrate, for the first time, a method of estimating the marginal likelihood using the X-ray selected z > 0.5 Massive Cluster Survey clusters as a case in point and employing both N-body and hydrodynamic simulations of clusters. We investigate the uncertainty in this estimate and consequential ability to compare competing cosmologies, which arises from incomplete descriptions of baryonic processes, discrepancies in cluster selection criteria, redshift distribution and dynamical state. The relation between triaxial cluster masses at various overdensities provides a promising alternative to the strong lensing test.

NuSTAR plus XMM-Newton monitoring of the neutron star transient AX J1745.6-2901	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; methods: observational; techniques: spectroscopic; stars: neutron; absorption lines; X-rays: binaries	X-RAY BINARIES; ACCRETING BLACK-HOLES; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; BROAD IRON LINES; FE K ABSORPTION; GALACTIC-CENTER; LOW/HARD STATE; GX 339-4; V404 CYGNI; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM	AX J1745.6-2901 is a high-inclination (eclipsing) transient neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary showcasing intense ionized Fe K absorption. We present here the analysis of 11 XMM-Newton and 15 NuSTAR new data sets (obtained between 2013 and 2016), therefore tripling the number of observations of AX J1745.6-2901 in outburst. Thanks to simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra, we greatly improve on the fitting of the X-ray continuum. During the soft state, the emission can be described by a disc blackbody (kT similar to 1.1-1.2 keV and inner disc radius r(DBB) similar to 14 km), plus hot (kT similar to 2.2-3.0 keV) blackbody radiation with a small emitting radius (r(BB) similar to 0.5-0.8 km) likely associated with the boundary layer or NS surface, plus a faint Comptonization component. Imprinted on the spectra are clear absorption features created by both neutral and ionized matter. Additionally, positive residuals suggestive of an emission Fe K alpha disc line and consistent with relativistic ionized reflection are present during the soft state, while such residuals are not significant during the hard state. The hard-state spectra are characterized by a hard (Gamma similar to 1.9-2.1) power law, showing no evidence for a high energy cut-off (kT(e) > 60-140 keV) and implying a small optical depth (tau < 1.6). The new observations confirm the previously witnessed trend of exhibiting strong Fe K absorption in the soft state that significantly weakens during the hard state. Optical (GROND) and radio (GMRT) observations suggest for AX J1745.6-2901 a standard broad-band spectral energy distribution as typically obsrved in accreting NSs.

Applications of machine-learning algorithms for infrared colour selection of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: observational; methods: statistical; stars: evolution; stars: massive; stars: Wolf-Rayet; infrared: stars	MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTION; GLIMPSE; PLANE; SPEX	We have investigated and applied machine-learning algorithms for infrared colour selection of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) candidates. Objects taken from the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) catalogue of the infrared objects in the Galactic plane can be classified into different stellar populations based on the colours inferred from their broad-band photometric magnitudes [J, H and K-s from 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and the four Spitzer/IRAC bands]. The algorithms tested in this pilot study are variants of the k-nearest neighbours approach, which is ideal for exploratory studies of classification problems where interrelations between variables and classes are complicated. The aims of this study are (1) to provide an automated tool to select reliable WR candidates and potentially other classes of objects, (2) to measure the efficiency of infrared colour selection at performing these tasks and (3) to lay the groundwork for statistically inferring the total number of WR stars in our Galaxy. We report the performance results obtained over a set of known objects and selected candidates for which we have carried out follow-up spectroscopic observations, and confirm the discovery of four new WR stars.

J	Cvitanic, J; Xing, H				Cvitanic, Jaksa; Xing, Hao			Asset pricing under optimal contracts	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY			English	Article						Asset-management; Equilibrium asset pricing; Optimal contracts; Principal agent problem	ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS	We consider the problem of finding equilibrium asset prices in a financial market in which a portfolio manager (Agent) invests on behalf of an investor (Principal), who compensates the manager with an optimal contract. We extend a model from Buffa, Vayanos and Woolley (2014) by allowing general contracts, and by allowing the portfolio manager to invest privately in individual risky assets or the index. To alleviate the effect of moral hazard, Agent is optimally compensated by benchmarking to the index, which, however, may incentivize him to be too much of a "closet indexer".

J	Hann-Caruthers, W; Martynov, VV; Tamuz, O				Hann-Caruthers, Wade; Martynov, Vadim V.; Tamuz, Omer			The speed of sequential asymptotic learning	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY			English	Article						Social learning; Herd behavior		In the classical herding literature, agents receive a private signal regarding a binary state of nature, and sequentially choose an action, after observing the actions of their predecessors. When the informativeness of private signals is unbounded, it is known that agents converge to the correct action and correct belief. We study how quickly convergence occurs, and show that it happens more slowly than it does when agents observe signals. However, we also show that the speed of learning from actions can be arbitrarily close to the speed of learning from signals. In particular, the expected time until the agents stop taking the wrong action can be either finite or infinite, depending on the private signal distribution. In the canonical case of Gaussian private signals we calculate the speed of convergence precisely, and show explicitly that, in this case, learning from actions is significantly slower than learning from signals.

Subsurface iceberg melt key to Greenland fjord freshwater budget	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							ICE-SHEET; SUBMARINE MELT; SURFACE ELEVATION; GLACIAL FJORD; OCEAN; MELTWATER; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS; MODEL; VARIABILITY	Liquid freshwater fluxes from the Greenland ice sheet affect ocean water properties and circulation on local, regional and basin-wide scales, with associated biosphere effects. The exact impact, however, depends on the volume, timing and location of freshwater releases, which are poorly known. In particular, the transformation of icebergs, which make up roughly 30-50% of the loss of the ice-sheet mass to liquid freshwater, is not well understood. Here we estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of the freshwater flux for the Helheim-Sermilikg lacier-fjord system in southeast Greenland using an iceberg-melt model that resolves the subsurface iceberg melt. By estimating seasonal variations in all the freshwater sources, we confirm quantitatively that iceberg melt is the largest annual freshwater source in this system type. We also show that 68-78% of the iceberg melt is released below a depth of 20 m and, seasonally, about 40-100% of that melt is likely to remain at depth, in contrast with the usual model assumptions. Iceberg melt also peaks two months after all the other freshwater sources peak. Our methods provide a framework to assess individual freshwater sources in any tidewater system, and our results are particularly applicable to coastal regions with a high solid-ice discharge in Greenland.

Choice is path independent if it is recursive, in the sense that choosing from a menu can be broken up into choosing from smaller submenus. While an important property, path independence is known to be incompatible with continuous choice. The main result of our paper is that a natural modification of path independence, which we call partial path independence, is not only compatible with continuity, but ends up characterizing the ubiquitous Luce (or logit) rule.

Evapotranspiration sensitivity to air temperature across a snow-influenced watershed: Space-for-time substitution versus integrated watershed modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Evapotranspiration; Air temperature; Snow; Integrated watershed model; Space-for-time substitution; Soil properties	SIERRA-NEVADA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SWAT MODEL; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; RIVER-BASIN; CALIFORNIA; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; STORAGE; CALIBRATION	Changes in long-term, montane actual evapotranspiration (ET) in response to climate change could impact future water supplies and forest species composition. For scenarios of atmospheric warming, predicted changes in long-term ET tend to differ between studies using space-for-time substitution (STS) models and integrated watershed models, and the influence of spatially varying factors on these differences is unclear. To examine this, we compared warming-induced (+2 to +6 degrees C) changes in ET simulated by an STS model and an integrated watershed model across zones of elevation, substrate available water capacity, and slope in the snow-influenced upper San Joaquin River watershed, Sierra Nevada, USA. We used the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the watershed modeling and a Budyko-type relationship for the STS modeling. Spatially averaged increases in ET from the STS model increasingly surpassed those from the SWAT model in the higher elevation zones of the watershed, resulting in 2.3-2.6 times greater values from the STS model at the watershed scale. In sparse, deep colluvium or glacial soils on gentle slopes, the SWAT model produced ET increases exceeding those from the STS model. However, watershed areas associated with these conditions were too localized for SWAT to produce spatially averaged ET-gains comparable to the STS model. The SWAT model results nevertheless demonstrate that such soils on high-elevation, gentle slopes will form ET "hot spots" exhibiting disproportionately large increases in ET, and concomitant reductions in runoff yield, in response to warming. Predicted ET responses to warming from STS models and integrated watershed models may, in general, substantially differ (e.g., factor of 2-3) for snow-influenced watersheds exhibiting an elevational gradient in substrate water holding capacity and slope. Long-term water supplies in these settings may therefore be more resilient to warming than STS model predictions would suggest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Jepsen, S.

Single photon detection of 1.5 THz radiation with the quantum capacitance detector	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTORS	Far-infrared spectroscopy can reveal secrets of galaxy evolution and heavy-element enrichment throughout cosmic time, prompting astronomers worldwide to design cryogenic space telescopes for far-infrared spectroscopy. The most challenging aspect is a far-infrared detector that is both exquisitely sensitive (limited by the zodiacal-light noise in a narrow wavelength band, lambda/Delta lambda similar to 1,000) and array-able to tens of thousands of pixels. We present the quantum capacitance detector, a superconducting device adapted from quantum computing applications in which photon-produced free electrons in a superconductor tunnel into a small capacitive island embedded in a resonant circuit. The quantum capacitance detector has an optically measured noise equivalent power below 10(-20) W Hz(-1/2) at 1.5 THz, making it the most sensitive far-infrared detector ever demonstrated. We further demonstrate individual far-infrared photon counting, confirming the excellent sensitivity and suitability for cryogenic space astrophysics.	[Echternach, P. M.; Pepper, B.

We apply this new algorithm to Bayesian inference on symmetric or Hermitian positive definite (PD) matrices. To do so, we exploit the Riemannian structure induced by Cartan's canonical metric. The geodesics that correspond to this metric are available in closed-form and - within the context of Lagrangian Monte Carlo - provide a principled way to travel around the space of PD matrices. Our method improves Bayesian inference on such matrices by allowing for a broad range of priors, so we are not limited to conjugate priors only. In the context of spectral density estimation, we use the (non-conjugate) complex reference prior as an example modelling option made available by the algorithm. Results based on simulated and real-world multivariate time series are presented in this context, and future directions are outlined.

The analysis is performed on data acquired with an approximately 45-min temporal baseline using the uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar collected in August 2009 over temperate and boreal forests of the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec. This investigation presents several compensation methods based on the classical random volume over ground model, which include fixing the value of the extinction parameter, fixing the temporal decorrelation magnitude, or varying temporal decorrelation estimates with height. We also compare results with the random motion over ground model. While these methods have been presented in the literature previously, a comparison of the different methods and an assessment of their height estimation accuracy applied to the same datasets have not yet been performed. In addition, we introduce the use of ancillary reference forest height data from airborne large footprint lidar to estimate model parameters and to mitigate solution ambiguities. We finally demonstrate that this mitigation strategy is robust and suitable for use with future spaceborne lidar missions such as the Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation. The resulting PolInSAR canopy height estimates correspond well with those obtained from coincident field and airborne lidar data. Height estimation differences of 3.4 m (RMSE) were observed between the PolInSAR- and lidar-derived canopy height maps when using the fixed extinction method. These can be partially attributed to inherent differences in the sensor spatial resolutions and geolocation accuracy. The RMS error between the PolInSAR height estimates and the field collected Lorey's heights was 2.4 m.

The percentage of bit errors from electron exposure is compared to results from Co-60 total ionizing dose (TID) measurements. Electron irradiation at low energies (below 2 MeV) causes more bit upsets than Co-60 gamma exposures at the same TID level when TID refers to equilibrium dose (as opposed to local dose). Bit upsets increase when electron energy decreases if comparisons are made at the same equilibrium dose level. In particular, 60-MeV electrons are less damaging than Co-60 gamma exposures at the same equilibrium dose level while 1-MeV electrons are more damaging. However, all radiation sources produce virtually identical results when comparisons are made at the same local dose level, indicating that charged-particle equilibrium is violated during electron irradiations.

Separation of detector non-linearity issues and multiple ionization satellites in alpha-particle PIXE	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer; PIXE; XRF; Non-linearity; Multiple ionization satellites	X-RAY SPECTROMETER; SPECTRA; REFINEMENT	Multiple ionization satellites are prominent features in X-ray spectra induced by MeV energy alpha particles. It follows that the accuracy of PIXE analysis using alpha particles can be improved if these features are explicitly incorporated in the peak model description when fitting the spectra with GUPIX or other codes for least-squares fitting PIXE spectra and extracting element concentrations. A method for this incorporation is described and is tested using spectra recorded on Mars by the Curiosity rover's alpha particle X-ray spectrometer. These spectra are induced by both PIXE and X-ray fluorescence, resulting in a spectral energy range from 1 to 25 keV. This range is valuable in determining the energy -channel calibration, which departs from linearity at low X-ray energies. It makes it possible to separate the effects of the satellites from an instrumental non-linearity component. The quality of least-squares spectrum fits is significantly improved, raising the level of confidence in analytical results from alpha-induced PIXE.

Winter precipitation characteristics in western US related to atmospheric river landfalls: observations and model evaluations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; SURFACE PROCESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SNOW BUDGET; CALIFORNIA; SIMULATION; SEASON; FLOW; SENSITIVITY; PREDICTION	Winter precipitation (PR) characteristics in western United States (WUS) related to atmospheric river (AR) landfalls are examined using the observation-based PRISM data. The observed AR-related precipitation characteristics are in turn used to evaluate model precipitation data from the NASA MERRA2 reanalysis and from seven dynamical downscaling simulations driven by the MERRA2. Multiple metrics including mean bias, Taylor diagram, and two skill scores are used to measure model performance for three climatological sub-regions in WUS, Pacific Northwest (PNW), Pacific Southwest (PSW) and Great Basin (GB). All model data well represent the winter-mean PR with spatial pattern correlations of 0.8 or higher with PRISM for the three sub-regions. Higher spatial resolutions and/or the use of spectral nudging generally yield higher skill scores in simulating the geographical distribution of PR for the entire winter. The PRISM data shows that the AR-related fraction of winter PR and associated daily PR PDFs in each region vary strongly for landfall locations; AR landfalls in the northern WUS coast (NC) affect mostly PNW while those in the southern WUS coast (SC) affect both PSW and GB. NC (SC) landfalls increase the frequency of heavy PR in PNW (PSW and GB) but reduce it in PSW (PNW). All model data reasonably represent these observed variations in the AR-related winter PR fractions and the daily PR PDFs according to AR landfall locations. However, unlike for the entire winter period, no systematic effects of resolution and/or spectral nudging are identified in these AR-related PR characteristics. Dynamical downscaling in this study generally yield positive added values to the MERRA2 PR in the AR-related PR fraction for most sub-regions and landfall locations, most noticeably for PSW by NU-WRF. The downscaling also generate positive added value in p95 for PNW, but negative values for PSW and GB due to overestimation of heavy precipitation events.

Observational estimation of radiative feedback to surface air temperature over Northern High Latitudes	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Local radiative feedback; High-latitude climate feedback; Radiative kernel; Observational estimates of feedback	CLIMATE FEEDBACKS; POLAR AMPLIFICATION; SEA-ICE; KERNEL TECHNIQUE; ALBEDO FEEDBACK; ARCTIC CLIMATE; SENSITIVITY; CLOUDS; VARIABILITY; AQUAPLANET	The high-latitude climate system contains complicated, but largely veiled physical feedback processes. Climate predictions remain uncertain, especially for the Northern High Latitudes (NHL; north of 60 degrees N), and observational constraint on climate modeling is vital. This study estimates local radiative feedbacks for NHL based on the CERES/Terra satellite observations during March 2000-November 2014. The local shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative feedback parameters are calculated from linear regression of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere on surface air temperatures. These parameters are estimated by the de-seasonalization and 12-month moving average of the radiative fluxes over NHL. The estimated magnitudes of the SW and the LW radiative feedbacks in NHL are 1.88 +/- 0.73 and 2.38 +/- 0.59 W m(-2) K-1, respectively. The parameters are further decomposed into individual feedback components associated with surface albedo, water vapor, lapse rate, and clouds, as a product of the change in climate variables from ERA-Interim reanalysis estimates and their pre-calculated radiative kernels. The results reveal the significant role of clouds in reducing the surface albedo feedback (1.13 +/- 0.44 W m(-2) K-1 in the cloud-free condition, and 0.49 +/- 0.30 W m(-2) K-1 in the all-sky condition), while the lapse rate feedback is predominant in LW radiation (1.33 +/- 0.18 W m(-2) K-1). However, a large portion of the local SW and LW radiative feedbacks were not simply explained by the sum of these individual feedbacks.

Distinguishing signal from autofluorescence in cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy of mammalian cells	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cryo-CLEM; Autofluorescence; Mammalian cells; Electron cryo-tomography; Fluorescent proteins	GREEN-FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; CHROMOGRANIN-A; CRYOELECTRON MICROSCOPY; CRYO-FLUORESCENCE; INSULIN; TOMOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; SECRETION; CALCIUM; BINDING	In cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), frozen targets of interest are identified and located on EM grids by fluorescence microscopy and then imaged at higher resolution by cryo-EM. Whilst working with these methods, we discovered that a variety of mammalian cells exhibit strong punctate auto fluorescence when imaged under cryogenic conditions (80 K). Autofluorescence originated from multilamellar bodies (MLBs) and secretory granules. Here we describe a method to distinguish fluorescent protein tags from these autofluorescent sources based on the narrower emission spectrum of the former. The method is first tested on mitochondria and then applied to examine the ultrastructural variability of secretory granules within insulin secreting pancreatic beta-cell-derived INS-1E cells.

J	Taeb, A; Chandrasekaran, V				Taeb, Armeen; Chandrasekaran, Venkat			Interpreting latent variables in factor models via convex optimization	MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Canonical correlations analysis; Factor analysis; Log-determinant optimization; Minimum-trace factor analysis; Nuclear-norm relaxation; Semidefinite programming	MATRIX; SELECTION	Latent or unobserved phenomena pose a significant difficulty in data analysis as they induce complicated and confounding dependencies among a collection of observed variables. Factor analysis is a prominent multivariate statistical modeling approach that addresses this challenge by identifying the effects of (a small number of) latent variables on a set of observed variables. However, the latent variables in a factor model are purely mathematical objects that are derived from the observed phenomena, and they do not have any interpretation associated to them. A natural approach for attributing semantic information to the latent variables in a factor model is to obtain measurements of some additional plausibly useful covariates that may be related to the original set of observed variables, and to associate these auxiliary covariates to the latent variables. In this paper, we describe a systematic approach for identifying such associations. Our method is based on solving computationally tractable convex optimization problems, and it can be viewed as a generalization of the minimum-trace factor analysis procedure for fitting factor models via convex optimization. We analyze the theoretical consistency of our approach in a high-dimensional setting as well as its utility in practice via experimental demonstrations with real data.

Triphenylsulfonium topophotochemistry	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							CHEMICALLY AMPLIFIED RESISTS; TRIARYLSULFONIUM SALTS; SOLID-STATE; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; PHOTOLYSIS; GENERATION; RADIATION	The products from the 193 nm irradiation of triphenylsulfonium nonaflate (TPS) embedded in a poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film have been characterized. The analysis of the photoproduct formation was performed using chromatographic techniques including HPLC, GPC and GC-MS as well as UV-vis and NMR spectroscopic methods. Two previously unreported TPS photoproducts, triphenylene and dibenzothiophene, were detected; additionally, GPC and DOSY-NMR spectroscopic analyses after irradiation suggested that TPS fragments had been incorporated into the polymer film. The irradiation of acetonitrile solutions containing 10% w/v PMMA and 1% w/v TPS in a 1 cm-path-length cuvette showed only a trace amount of triphenylene or dibenzothiophene, indicating that topochemical factors were important for the formation of these molecules. The accumulated evidence indicates that both products were formed by in-cage, secondary photochemical reactions: 2-(phenylthio) biphenyl to triphenylene, and diphenylsulfide to dibenzothiophene.

On the predictability of lake surface temperature using air temperature in a changing climate: A case study for Lake Tahoe (USA)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; CENTRAL-EUROPEAN LAKE; WATER TEMPERATURES; CALIFORNIA-NEVADA; REGIME SHIFT; DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; IMPACTS; MODELS; STRATIFICATION	Can we predict long-term trends of lake surface temperature based on air temperature alone? We explore this question by analyzing the performance of a hybrid model (air2water) as a predictive tool for defining scenarios of lake surface temperature in the framework of climate change studies. Employing Lake Tahoe (U.S.A.) as a case study, we apply the model using different air temperature datasets (in situ measurements, gridded observations, and downscaled General Circulation Models). Through a data-driven calibration of the model parameters based on surface water temperature records, we show that air2water provides good performance (root mean square error similar to 0.5 degrees C, on a monthly scale) regardless of the input dataset. The model is able to accurately capture the historical long-term trend and interannual fluctuations over decades (from 1969 to present), using only 7 yr of monthly measurements of surface water temperature for calibration. Additionally, when used to predict future surface water temperature of the lake, air2water produces the same projections irrespective of the air temperature dataset used to drive the model. This is certainly desirable, but not immediately expected when using a relatively simple model. Overall, the results suggest the high potential and robustness of air2water as a predictive tool for climate change assessment. Lake surface temperature warming of up to 1.1 degrees C (RCP 4.5) and 2.9 degrees C (RCP 8.5) was simulated at the end of the 21st century during summer months in Lake Tahoe. Such a scenario, if realized, would lead to serious consequences on lake water chemistry, primary productivity, plankton community structure, and nutrient cycling.

Liebermannite crystallizes in space group I4/m with Z = 2, cell dimensions of a = 9.15 +/- 0.14 (1 sigma) angstrom, c = 2.74 +/- 0.13 angstrom, and a cell volume of 229 +/- 19 angstrom(3) (for the type material), as revealed by synchrotron diffraction. In Zagami, liebermannite likely formed via solid-state transformation of primary igneous K-feldspar during an impact event that achieved pressures of similar to 20 GPa or more. The mineral name is in honor of Robert C. Liebermann, a high-pressure mineral physicist at Stony Brook University, New York, USA.

Structure analysis and conditions of formation of akimotoite in the Tenham chondrite	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							INDUCED MELT VEIN; L6 CHONDRITE; SHOCK; PRESSURE; PEROVSKITE; CHEMISTRY; PYROXENE; SYSTEM; TRANSFORMATION; CONSTRAINTS	Akimotoite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 is one of the most common mineralogical indicators for high-level shock metamorphism in meteorites. First described 1997, its occurrence has been amply confirmed in a number of highly shocked chondrites. Yet, a thorough structure analysis of natural akimotoite has remained extant. Here we report accurate cell parameters, fractional atomic coordinates, and site occupancies for natural akimotoite from the holotype specimen based on synchrotron microdiffraction. The variation of unit cell shape and volume with Fe content define mixing volumes. Based on the mixing volume relation for akimotoite and hemleyite, we constrain the unit cell volume of endmember hemleyite to 273.8 +/- 1.0 angstrom(3). We show that mixing is nearly ideal for low Fe content but evolves to positive excess volume toward the Fe endmember. Based on this finding and the actual composition of akimotoite in Tenham, we show that this mineral has formed by solid-solid transformation prograde from enstatite, not by crystallization from melt.

Measurements are in the energy range 0.88-2.50 keV/u, corresponding to the energies of the "fast" and "slow" ion components of the SW. Limited agreement is found with single-exchange results calculated in the classical over-the-barrier model. These CE data are useful for understanding, in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, photon emissions in the X-ray to visible energy range arising from resulting ion-stabilization steps.

This paper considers a hybrid coordinated scheme as a means to benefit from both policies. Consider the downlink of a multi-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high capacity links and, therefore, allows for joint signal processing within the cloud transmission. Across the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as low levels of backhaul communication are feasible. The frame structure of every BS is composed of various time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs), which are maintained at a fixed power level. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and scheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled to a single cloud at most, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and can be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. This paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The considered scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a maximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, which can be solved using efficient techniques. This paper then proposes solving the problem using both optimal and heuristic algorithms that can be implemented in a distributed fashion across the network. The proposed distributed algorithms rely on the well-chosen structure of the constructed conflict graph utilized to solve the maximum-weight independent set problem. Simulation results suggest that the proposed optimal and heuristic hybrid scheduling strategies provide appreciable gain as compared with the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with a negligible degradation to signal-level coordination.

The mechanisms were designed to collect information held as intuitions about opening weekend box office revenues for movies in Australia. The principles on which the mechanisms operate and their capacity to collect information are explored. A pari-mutuel mechanism produces a predicted probability distribution over box office amounts that is, with the exception of very small films, indistinguishable from the actual revenues. The second mechanism is based on guessing the guesses of others and when applied under conditions where incentives for accuracy are unavailable still performs well against data.

These interstellar objects (ISOs) are hypothesized to have formed in extrasolar planetary systems prior to being ejected into interstellar space and subsequently arriving at the solar system. This paper discusses necessary considerations for tracing ISOs back to their parent stars via trajectory analysis and places approximate limits on doing so. Results indicate that the capability to backtrace ISOs beyond the immediate solar neighborhood is presently constrained by the quality of stellar astrometry, a factor poised for significant improvement with upcoming Gaia data releases. Nonetheless, prospects for linking 1I or any other ISO to their respective parent stars appear unfavorable on an individual basis due to gravitational scattering from random stellar encounters, which limit traceability to the past few tens of millions of years. These results, however, do not preclude the possibility of occasional success, particularly after considering the potential for observational bias favoring the discovery of younger ISOs, together with the anticipated rise in the ISO discovery rate under forthcoming surveys.

The Station Information System (SIS) is a centralized repository of seismic station equipment inventory, instrument response, and site information of stations operated by regional seismic networks (RSNs) of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS; Filson and Arabasz, 2017). It has a web-based user interface that enables the creation and manipulation of the corresponding metadata. The system can track the installation, maintenance, and removal of equipment from a site, which often results in the creation of new metadata epochs. SIS also computes the overall response, including gain, of a data channel by combining the responses of the underlying hardware components. SIS distributes this information in standard formats such as Federation of Digital Seismic Networks StationXML and dataless Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data. SIS can also be used to manage inventory of field equipment such as power, telemetry, or Global Positioning System antenna, as well as links to other site-related repositories external to SIS to give the network operator the most complete view of a site and the overall network. This article summarizes the main features in SIS. We present its basic infrastructure, holdings, workflow, and how RSNs retrieve data from it. We also explain the reasoning to pursue one centralized repository and why it supports the goals of SIS and the ANSS. We demonstrate that by providing the ANSS network operator with a comprehensive site view, SIS enables the production of high-quality metadata, a necessary prerequisite for producing high-quality seismic data.

Since 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey has been working in collaboration with several partners to develop EEW for the United States. The goal is to create and operate an EEW system, called ShakeAlert, for the highest risk areas of the United States, starting with the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington. In early 2016, the Production Prototype v.1.0 was established for California; then, in early 2017, v.1.2 was established for the West Coast, with earthquake notifications being distributed to a group of beta users in California, Oregon, and Washington. The new ShakeAlert Production Prototype was an outgrowth from an earlier demonstration EEW system that began sending test notifications to selected users in California in January 2012. ShakeAlert leverages the considerable physical, technical, and organizational earthquake monitoring infrastructure of the Advanced National Seismic System, a nationwide federation of cooperating seismic networks. When fully implemented, the ShakeAlert system may reduce damage and injury caused by large earthquakes, improve the nation's resilience, and speed recovery.

An earthquake early warning system, ShakeAlert, is providing alerts to beta end users in the western United States, specifically California, Oregon, and Washington. An essential aspect of the earthquake early warning system is the development of a framework to test modifications to code to ensure functionality and assess performance. In 2016, a Testing and Certification Platform (TCP) was included in the development of the Production Prototype version of ShakeAlert. The purpose of the TCP is to evaluate the robustness of candidate code that is proposed for deployment on ShakeAlert Production Prototype servers. TCP consists of two main components: a real-time in situ test that replicates the real-time production system and an offline playback system to replay test suites. The real-time tests of system performance assess code optimization and stability. The offline tests comprise a stress test of candidate code to assess if the code is production ready. The test suite includes over 120 events including local, regional, and teleseismic historic earthquakes, recentering and calibration events, and other anomalous and potentially problematic signals. Two assessments of alert performance are conducted. First, point-source assessments are undertaken to compare magnitude, epicentral location, and origin time with the Advanced National Seismic System Comprehensive Catalog, as well as to evaluate alert latency. Second, we describe assessment of the quality of ground-motion predictions at end-user sites by comparing predicted shaking intensities to ShakeMaps for historic events and implement a threshold-based approach that assesses how often end users initiate the appropriate action, based on their ground-shaking threshold. TCP has been developed to be a convenient streamlined procedure for objectively testing algorithms, and it has been designed with flexibility to accommodate significant changes in development of new or modified system code. It is expected that the TCP will continue to evolve along with the ShakeAlert system, and the framework we describe here provides one example of how earthquake early warning systems can be evaluated. Electronic Supplement: Tables of test suite events used to assess the ShakeAlert system and a thorough description of the non-deterministic behavior of the system during test runs.

With a timed sequence of heating and temperature probing pulses, we are able to monitor its electron temperature in nonequilibrium with effectively zero back-action from the temperature measurement in the form of additional dissipation or thermal conductance. The experiments demonstrate the possibility of using a fast proximity Josephson junction thermometer for studying thermal transport in mesoscopic systems and for calorimetry.

We confirm the planetary nature of the companion via a combination of. radial velocities, which limit the mass to less than or similar to 4.1 M-J (3 sigma), and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of lambda = -179.7(-3.7)(+3.8) degrees. Global modeling indicates that the T-eff=7500. 110 K host star has M-star = 1.62(-0.20)(+0.25) M-star and R-star = 1.83 +/- 0.10 R-circle dot. The planet has a radius of R-P = 1.91 +/- 0.11 R-J and receives a stellar insolation flux of similar to 3.2 x 10(9) erg s(-1) cm(-2), leading to an inferred equilibrium temperature of T-eq similar to 1935 K assuming zero albedo and complete heat redistribution. With a v sin I-* = 84.8 +/- 2.0 km s(-1), the host. is relatively slowly rotating compared to other stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced in metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely an Am star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transiting planet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal the existence of a companion with late-G9V/early-K1V spectral type at a projected separation of approximate to 160 au. Radial velocity measurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to have stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to have caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the transiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.

The California-Kepler Survey. V. Peas in a Pod: Planets in a Kepler Multi-planet System Are Similar in Size and Regularly Spaced	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; planetary systems; stars: fundamental parameters; surveys	TERRESTRIAL PLANETS; NEPTUNE; PERIOD	We have established precise planet radii, semimajor axes, incident stellar fluxes, and stellar masses for 909 planets in 355 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler. In this sample, we find that planets within a single multi-planet system have correlated sizes: each planet is more likely to be the size of its neighbor than a size drawn at random from the distribution of observed planet sizes. In systems with three or more planets, the planets tend to have a regular spacing: the orbital period ratios of adjacent pairs of planets are correlated. Furthermore, the orbital period ratios are smaller in systems with smaller planets, suggesting that the patterns in planet sizes and spacing are linked through formation and/or subsequent orbital dynamics. Yet, we find that essentially no planets have orbital period ratios smaller than 1.2, regardless of planet size. Using empirical mass-radius relationships, we estimate the mutual Hill separations of planet pairs. We find that 93% of the planet pairs are at least 10 mutual Hill radii apart, and that a spacing of similar to 20 mutual Hill radii is most common. We also find that when comparing planet sizes, the outer planet is larger in 65% +/- 0.4% of cases, and the typical ratio of the outer to inner planet size is positively correlated with the temperature difference between the planets. This could be the result of photo-evaporation.

Temperature field measurements of thermal boundary layer and wake of moving hot spheres using interferometry	EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE			English	Article						Thermal boundary layer; Sphere; Interferometry	PREMIXED METHANE/AIR FLAME	The methodology used to post-process a raw interferogram of a hot moving sphere falling in an inert nitrogen environment is presented. The steps taken to obtain the temperature field around the hot sphere are explained in detail. These are: (1) noise removal; (2) phase demodulation; (3) phase unwrapping; (4) bias removal; and (5) Abel transform inversion. All the typical features of the flow are revealed such as growth of the thermal boundary layer, shallower temperature gradients were the flow separates, and a hot wake in the recirculation zone. For validation of the methodology, the temperature field is compared against numerical simulations and found to be in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement all around except at the front and rear stagnation points. The difficulties encountered with resolving these regions are discussed. Overall, interferometry is found to be an excellent tool for resolving thermal flows, including thin regions, such as thermal boundary layers.

An Infrared Study of the Circumstellar Material Associated with the Carbon Star R Sculptoris	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars: AGB and post-AGB; stars: mass-loss	SHORT-WAVELENGTH SPECTROMETER; DETACHED SHELLS; MASS-LOSS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; STELLAR LIGHT; U-ANT; DUST; ENVELOPES; GRAINS; EVOLUTION	The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star R Sculptoris (R Scl) is one of the most extensively studied stars on the AGB. R Scl is a carbon star with a massive circumstellar shell (M-shell similar to 7.3 x 10(-3) M-circle dot) that is thought to have been produced during a thermal pulse event similar to 2200 years ago. To study the thermal dust emission associated with its circumstellar material, observations were taken with the Faint Object InfraRed CAMera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) at 19.7, 25.2, 31.5, 34.8, and 37.1 mu m. Maps of the infrared emission at these wavelengths were used to study the morphology and temperature structure of the spatially extended dust emission. Using the radiative-transfer code DUSTY, and fitting the spatial profile of the emission, we find that a geometrically thin dust shell cannot reproduce the observed spatially resolved emission. Instead, a second dust component in addition to the shell is needed to reproduce the observed emission. This component, which lies interior to the dust shell, traces the circumstellar envelope of R Scl. It is best fit by a density profile with n alpha r(alpha), where alpha = 0.75(-0.25)(+0.45) and a dust mass of M-d = 9.0(-4.1)(+2.3) x 10(-6) M-circle dot. The strong departure from an r(-2) law indicates that the mass-loss rate of R Scl has not been constant. This result is consistent with a slow decline in the post-pulse mass loss that has been inferred from observations of the molecular gas.	[Hankins, M. J.; Herter, T.

This property can be exploited in the design of heterogeneously patterned thin sheets that deform into a non-trivial shape when heated or cooled. In this paper, we start from a variational formulation for the entropic elastic energy of liquid crystal elastomers and we derive an effective two-dimensional metric constraint, which links the deformation and the heterogeneous director field. Our main results show that satisfying the metric constraint is both necessary and sufficient for the deformation to be an approximate minimizer of the energy. We include several examples which show that the class of deformations satisfying the metric constraint is quite rich.

Distributed Optimal Power Flow Algorithm for Radial Networks, I: Balanced Single Phase Case	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Power distribution; distributed algorithms; nonlinear systems; power system control	CONVEX RELAXATION; PART I	The optimal power flow (OPF) problem determines a network operating point that minimizes a certain objective such as generation cost or power loss. Traditionally, OPF is solved in a centralized manner. With increasing penetration of renewable energy in distribution system, we need faster and distributed solutions for real-time feedback control. This is difficult due to the nonlinearity of the power flow equations. In this paper, we propose a solution for balanced radial networks. It exploits recent results that suggest solving for a globally optimal solution of OPF over a radial network through the secondorder cone program relaxation. Our distributed algorithm is based on alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), but unlike standard ADMM-based distributed OPF algorithms that require solving optimization subproblems using iterative method, our decomposition allows us to derive closed form solutions for these subproblems, greatly speeding up each ADMM iteration. We illustrate the scalability of the proposed algorithm by simulating it on a real-world 2065-bus distribution network.

Here, we demonstrate a compact single-shot multispectral video-imaging camera by placing a micro-structured diffractive filter in close proximity to the image sensor. The diffractive filter converts spectral information to a spatial code on the sensor pixels. Following a calibration step, this code can be inverted via regularization-based linear algebra to compute the multispectral image. We experimentally demonstrated spectral resolution of 9.6 nm within the visible band (430-718 nm). We further show that the spatial resolution is enhanced by over 30% compared with the case without the diffractive filter. We also demonstrate Vis-IR imaging with the same sensor. Because no absorptive color filters are utilized, sensitivity is preserved as well. Finally, the diffractive filters can be easily manufactured using optical lithography and replication techniques.

In this paper, we present the results of our observations using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument. We observed 9 of the 14 KELT planet hosts that are visible from the northern hemisphere and 51 comparison stars, discovering two new potential companions and re-observing two previously known possible binary systems and one confirmed binary system.

We find that for any given precipitation intensity, vapor associated with deep convection is isotopically depleted relative to vapor associated with shallow convection. The intensity of precipitation also plays a role as for any given depth of convection, the relative enrichment of water vapor decreases as the intensity of precipitation increases. Shallow convection, via the uplifting of enriched boundary layer air into the free troposphere and the convective detrainment, enriches the free troposphere. In contrast, deep convection is associated with processes that deplete the water vapor in the free troposphere, such as rain re-evaporation. The results of this study allow for a better identification of the parameters controlling the isotopic composition of the free troposphere and indicate that the isotopic composition of water vapor can be used to evaluate the relative contributions of shallow and deep convection in global models.

Flexible pulse-stretching for a swept source at 2.0 mu m using free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							DISPERSIVE FOURIER TRANSFORMATION; FIBER LASER; CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY; COMPRESSION; SCATTERING; GRATINGS; NM	Dispersive pulse-stretching at 2.0 mu m has long been hindered by the high intrinsic optical loss from conventional dispersive media. Here a flexible pulse-stretching technique at 2.0 mu m is demonstrated over a broad bandwidth with large-scale dispersion and low intrinsic optical loss. The technique employs the newly proposed pulse-stretching scheme, namely, free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay. Both normal and anomalous temporal dispersion (up to +/- 500 ps/nm) with low intrinsic loss (< 6 dB) over a spectral bandwidth of similar to 84 nm at 2.0 mu m is obtained with low nonlinear effects. Based on this method, an optical wave-length-swept source at 2.0 mu m is realized and applied to spectrally encoded imaging at a line scan rate of similar to 19 MHz, proving the potential of this pulse-stretching technique for continuous single-shot measurements at the 2.0 mu m wavelength regime, particularly for optical microscopy and spectroscopy.

In this study, we perform a large-scale characterization of the morphology and internal layering of linear dunes in hyper-arid areas on Earth, through utilizing multiple complementary radar datasets (SIR-C imaging, SRTM interferometry-derived elevations and radar sounding or Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)). Linear dune fields in the Egyptian desert are of special interest, due to their significance as planetary analogs to dunes on Mars and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Satellite radar imagery and elevation data of the region show significant variance in the geomorphology of different dune fields in Egypt. In addition, GPR probing of the first few meters suggests different inner settings in the layering of dunes of different ages in eastern and western Egypt, reflecting different paleoclimatic regimes that led to their formation. Furthermore, our radiometric analysis suggests that dunes with different inner layering arrangement also exhibit different radar backscatter returns as a function of their heights. For relatively younger dunes with a homogeneous inner structure, like the ones in eastern Egypt in the Qattaniya dune field, we observe that sigma0 does not change as a function of the dune height. For relatively older dunes in western Egypt like the Great Sand Sea (Northern (Siwa) and Southern dune fields), we observed a linear correlation between sigma0 and the dune height. Thus, surface properties of dunes like morphology and backscatter variation with height are related to inner characteristics like arrangement of internal layering, relative ages and can be used to infer their depositional history. Linear dunes discovered in the equatorial regions of Titan by the Cassini-Huygens mission are morphologically very similar to these linear dune fields in the Egyptian Sahara. Hence, assessing the variability of morphology and radar backscatter properties of Titan's dunes as a function of their heights can help constrain the ambiguities associated with their internal structure and formation history and provide insights into Titan's paleowind regimes.

Expansion of major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009 using satellite scatterometer data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urbanization; QuikSCAT; Dense Sampling Method; Impervious surface; LandScan	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; METROPOLITAN-AREA; LIGHT; URBANIZATION; ABUNDANCE; GROWTH; NIGHT; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; IMPACT	A consistent dataset delineating and characterizing changes in urban environments will be valuable for socio-economic and environmental research and for sustainable urban development. Remotely sensed data have been long used to map urban extent and infrastructure at various spatial and spectral resolutions. Although many datasets and approaches have been tried, there is not yet a universal way to map urban extents across the world. Here we combined a microwave scatterometer (QuikSCAT) dataset at similar to 1 km posting with percent impervious surface area (%ISA) data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) that was generated from Landsat data, and ambient population data from the LandScan product to characterize and quantify growth in nine major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend tests on backscatter time series from urban areas show significant expanding trends in eight of nine urban areas with p-values ranging 0.032 to 0.001. The sole exception is Houston, which has a substantial non-urban backscatter at the northeastern edge of the urban core. Strong power law scaling relationships between ambient population and either urban area or backscatter power (r(2) of 0.96 in either model) with sub-linear exponents (beta of 0.911 and 0.866, respectively) indicate urban areas become more compact with more vertical built-up structure than lateral expansion to accommodate the increased population. Increases in backscatter and %ISA datasets between 2001 and 2006 show agreement in both magnitude and direction for all urban areas except Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP), likely due to the presence of many lakes and ponds throughout the MSP metropolitan area. We conclude discussing complexities in the backscatter data caused by large metal structures and rainfall.

Retinoic acid temporally orchestrates colonization of the gut by vagal neural crest cells	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Retinoic Acid; Neural crest; Meis3; Zebrafish; Enteric nervous system	ENTERIC NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MICE LACKING; PROGENITOR CELLS; NEURITE GROWTH; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; IN-VIVO; ZEBRAFISH; EXPRESSION; RET; MIGRATION	The enteric nervous system arises from neural crest cells that migrate as chains into and along the primitive gut, subsequently differentiating into enteric neurons and glia. Little is known about the mechanisms governing neural crest migration en route to and along the gut in vivo. Here, we report that Retinoic Acid (RA) temporally controls zebrafish enteric neural crest cell chain migration. In vivo imaging reveals that RA loss severely compromises the integrity and migration of the chain of neural crest cells during the window of time window when they are moving along the foregut. After loss of RA, enteric progenitors accumulate in the foregut and differentiate into enteric neurons, but subsequently undergo apoptosis resulting in a striking neuronal deficit. Moreover, ectopic expression of the transcription factor meis3 and/or the receptor ret, partially rescues enteric neuron colonization after RA attenuation. Collectively, our findings suggest that retinoic acid plays a critical temporal role in promoting enteric neural crest chain migration and neuronal survival upstream of Meis3 and RET in vivo.

The architecture of the instrument is based on a pseudo-correlation radiometer with analog sideband separation and includes 1/f mitigation by phase-switching the local oscillator (LO) signal. The improved sensitivity of the development comes from the use of high performance Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) chips instead of the typical Schottky diode mixers at the input. We forecast sensitivity per sub-band of 170 mK, at an output instrument rate of 1 Hz.

It was also included on the CDROM distributed with the Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering (M. Lyu, ed). In the years since it was first released, however, CASRE has become more difficult to use. This is mainly because there have been no updates since 2000. The last version of Windows on which CASRE would reliably execute was Windows XP, and since it was developed explicitly for Windows, it is not feasible to run it on other platforms. Software development and acquisition organizations continued to be interested in using tools of the same type as CASRE. In 2013, the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) contacted the authors at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts to determine whether a) CASRE could be modified to run in contemporary environments, or b) whether a new tool with the same functionality as CASRE could be developed with modern programming languages and techniques. After weighing the alternatives, a decision was made to develop a new tool rather than updating CASRE. There were several reasons for which this decision was made. First of all, CASRE had been developed with the programming languages available at the time, in this case C and Fortran. Developing a new tool would allow use of modern, expressive languages and development environments that were particularly well suited to the statistical modeling domain (e.g., R, RStudio). Developing a new tool would also allow us to implement it so that it would run in modern operating environments, specifically Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and Linux. This last design decision would make it possible for users who would not have been able to run CASRE to use the new tool. We wanted to address the difficulty of adding new models to CASRE, since it was not architected for ease of modification. We wanted to develop a tool for which it would be easy to add new models and model evaluation techniques (e.g., prequential likelihood ratio, Akaike Information Criterion). This would enable organizations already using software reliability modeling to manage their testing to place the models they were using into a common framework, making it easier to evaluate multiple sets of results to gain additional insight into their testing process. Researchers would also gain an advantage by having a common framework in which to work with multiple models, analyze their results, and identify relationships among them. Finally, this would make it practical to distribute as open-source software, to which contributors could add new models and evaluation techniques as they were developed by the research community and validated by practitioners. We have used these ideas to develop the Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool (SFRAT). It is implemented in R, uses the Shiny user interface package, and will run in any environment in which R and RStudio can run. We intend for it to be an open-source tool with a mechanism for contributors to add new capabilities. Our hope is that distributing SFRAT as open-source software will allow it to retain currency in the software reliability practice and research communities.

We have designed GaN MMIC power amplifier chips for 94 GHz, and illustrate the concept of the W-Band Spatial Power Combining Amplifier (WSPCA). Using 1 Watt, 94 GHz MMIC chips in a two-way cavity mode combiner, we were able to achieve 2 Watts of output power with 9 dB gain and 15 % PAE. This technique could be extended to high power MMICs and larger numbers of chips to achieve higher output power in a compact size. Current applications include earth science radar, and may be extended to other applications requiring wider bandwidth.

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a control barrier function based methodology which can be used to enforce set invariance on systems in the presence of non-linear disturbances and uncertainty. The first part of this work is a review of the current methods available for finding viable sets and how they are linked to practical choices regarding safety. Their limitations and directions towards improvements when it comes to handling model uncertainty are also highlighted. The second part of this work is the formulation of a condition which can guarantee set invariance in the presence of generic uncertain in the dynamics. An associated optimization problem to enforce that condition is proposed and a method to convexify the problem and make it solvable in real-time is formally presented.

Additionally, power restrictions prevent the use of survival heating during the night. The harsh mechanical vibration environment of launch and landing provides an additional challenge to reliability. A multi-physics simulation was created that took into account temperature property variations, as well as solving the transient analysis that also included rapid variation in power-pulsing during the operation of the laser. The steady state analysis employed a more traditional finite element based analysis, but with provisions for Mars gas convection and thermal radiation.

The purpose of these back-to-back projects is to address the Command & Data Handling (CDH), Power and Motor Control needs for missions to ocean worlds such as the potential Europa Lander project. We addressed the mass reduction challenge by developing the key technologies necessary to design a next generation compact motor control avionics.

Adapted from land-based measurements, this test methodology involves hoisting the antenna under test using a helium-filled aerostat above the earth to minimize ground interactions while flying a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) with onboard RF measurement equipment package to map the far field radiation pattern. Prior to testing the technique using both airborne platforms - the aerostat and the sUAS - measurements are performed on the ground using the sUAS and a fixed VHF dipole over a ground plane to verify the methodology prior to incorporating the flying aerostat for airborne measurements of the HF dipole. These initial measurements have produced promising far-field pattern results with work remaining to fully adapt the fixed VHF antenna measurements to the dynamic HF antenna test setup that uses two airborne platforms (sUAS and aerostat) for measurements.

Recently, similarity-based clustering has attracted much attention due to its ability to partition modern datasets with high dimensional, heterogeneous features. Furthermore, a variety of methods have been proposed to obtain the similarity metric between objects. In this paper, we focus on the following problem: given the (noisy) similarity information on a data set that may contain outliers, find the underlying clustering structure without prior knowledge on the number of clusters K. We propose a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach to solve the problem and give conditions that guarantee exact recovery on a Gaussiansimilarity matrix model with vanishing probability of error. We show that under certain necessary conditions, the SDP algorithm is consistentwith high probability. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Classical percolation, i.e., the existence of infinite connected components in a stochastic network, has been analyzed in previous studies. However, a single connection is not enough for localization, which requires at least two connections to anchors. In this paper, we generalize classical percolation to localization problems. We find that for distributed localization, phase transition appears around a critical network density, i.e., an infinite localizable subnetwork exists with probability zero in the sub-critical case and with probability one in the super-critical case. Further, simulation methods are developed to estimate upper and lower bounds of critical densities, and precise estimates of densities in angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-of-arrival (TOA) localization are performed using proposed methods.

For many applications, such as the design of missions involving multiple spacecraft, the resulting set of Pareto-optimal solution models can be too large to be consumed directly, requiring additional analyses in order to gain meaningful insights. In this paper, we investigate the use of automated clustering techniques for grouping similar solution models, and introduce and study a number of both generic and domain-specific methods for measuring the similarity of the solution models. We report results from applying our approach to the exploration of the design space of a spacecraft-based interferometry array in a lunar orbit. For purposes of evaluation and validation, results from the application to the case study are correlated with the results from a study in which solution models were clustered manually by groups of domain experts. The results show tradeoffs in the granularity and extensibility of applying clustering approaches to spacecraft mission architecture models. Also, what humans consider to be relevant in assessing architectural similarity varies and is often biased by their background and expertise. We conclude that providing the subjects with a range of clustering tools has the potential to strongly enhance the ability to explore the complex design space of multi-spacecraft missions, and gain deep insights into the trade space.

When used in combination with a dispersive section, the whole longitudinal phase space density can be imaged. At the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the installation of such a device downstream of the undulators enables the reconstruction of the X-ray temporal intensity profile by comparing longitudinal phase space distributions with lasing on and lasing off [1]. However, the resolution of this TDS is limited to around 1 fs rms (root mean square), and therefore, in most cases, it is not possible to resolve single self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) spikes within one photon pulse. By combining the intensity spectrum from a high resolution photon spectrometer [2] and the temporal structure from the TDS, the overall resolution is enhanced, thus allowing the observation of temporal, single SASE spikes. The combined data from the spectrometer and the TDS is analyzed using an iterative algorithm to obtain the actual intensity profile. In this paper, we present the reconstruction algorithm as well as analyzed data obtained from simulations which shows the reliability of this method. Real data will be published at a later stage.

We aim to link the target-elicited N2 in a dot-probe task and the drug-related attention bias in heroin dependence and further estimate the brain regions involved in the generation of the target-elicited N2. We recorded 64-channel electroencephalograms (EEG) from 17 abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs) and 17 healthy controls (HCs) during the dot-probe visual task. Individual N2 sources were localized using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Compared to HCs, AHAs generated larger N2 amplitude in both congruent and incongruent conditions, suggesting that target detection processing in AHAs might require more attention resources. Moreover, N2 component was mainly generated in the Brodmann areas (BAs) 7, 23, 24, 31, 30, 32, and 40, implying that the frontoparietal cortex played a critical role in target detection processes.

Our approach is the following. We first find the contract that is optimal among those for which the agent's value process allows a dynamic programming representation, in which case the agent's optimal effort is straightforward to find. We then show that the optimization over this restricted family of contracts represents no loss of generality. As a consequence, we have reduced a non-zero-sum stochastic differential game to a stochastic control problem which may be addressed by standard tools of control theory. Our proofs rely on the backward stochastic differential equations approach to non-Markovian stochastic control, and more specifically on the recent extensions to the second order case.

Based on a combination of the flyback and flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) boost converter topologies, the FCMFC achieves faster slew rates and peak power than previous pulsed power converters. FCMFC distributes the high voltage gain across the switch-diode-capacitor (SDC) stages, lowering device stresses and reducing the required magnetic component size compared to existing architectures. Two applications are addressed in this work: one for DC-DC boosting and one for pulsed power conversion. The FCMFC achieved a 100V to 1000V step-up while only utilizing half of the electrical hardware compared to existing topologies. Another FCMFC was developed to produce 36kV pulses at 8kV/u.s, with a 50% decrease in the magnetic component size compared to an existing architecture from the literature.

In the offline case, we demonstrate that a classical randomization algorithm works well and we derive a new bound on the performance sub-optimality gap. In the online case, we prove a fundamental lower bound in resource violation and propose a new algorithm that combines techniques from multiplicative weight update and primal-dual update paradigms. This online algorithm asymptotically achieves the best possible performance in terms of resource allocation among all online algorithms.

Larger buffer size and more delay-sensitive applications on the Internet have made this phenomenon a pressing issue. Active queue management (AQM) algorithms, which play an important role in combating bufferbloat, have not been widely deployed due to complicated manual parameter tuning. Moreover, AQM algorithms are often designed and analyzed based on models with a single bottleneck link, rendering their performance and stability unclear in multi-bottleneck networks. In this paper, we propose a general framework to combat bufferbloat in multi-bottleneck networks. We first conduct an equilibrium analysis for a general multi-bottleneck TCP/AQM system and develop an algorithm to compute the equilibrium point. We then decompose the system into single-bottleneck subsystems and derive sufficient conditions for the local asymptotic stability of the subsystems. Using the proposed framework, we present a case study to analyze the stability of the recently proposed Controlled Delay (CoDel) in multi-bottleneck networks and devise Self-tuning CoDel to improve the system stability and performance. Extensive simulation results show that Self-tuning CoDel effectively stabilizes queueing delay in multi-bottleneck scenarios, and thus contributes to combating bufferbloat.

In this paper, we propose an efficient method for tackling the ever increasing size of real-world problems. To this end, we propose a general relaxation and several algorithms for enforcing constraints in a challenging application: the phase-mapping problem in materials science. Using experimental data we show that the proposed method significantly out-performs previous methods in terms of l(2)-norm error and speed.

To facilitate understanding of the target hypothesis, it is crucial for the teaching algorithm to use examples which are interpretable to the human learner. In this paper, we propose NOTES, a principled framework for constructing interpretable teaching sets, utilizing explanations to accelerate the teaching process. Our algorithm is built upon a natural stochastic model of learners and a novel submodular surrogate objective function which greedily selects interpretable teaching examples. We prove that NOTES is competitive with the optimal explanation-based teaching strategy. We further instantiate NOTES with a specific hypothesis class, which can be viewed as an interpretable approximation of any hypothesis class, allowing us to handle complex hypothesis in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NOTES on several image classification tasks, for both simulated and real human learners. Our experimental results suggest that by leveraging explanations, one can significantly speed up teaching.

At the same time, Gaussian processes (GP) are well-studied machine learning models for structure learning. In this paper, we demonstrate interesting connections between the two, especially for multi-way data analysis. We show that low-rank tensor regression is essentially learning a multi-linear kernel in Gaussian processes, and the low-rank assumption translates to the constrained Bayesian inference problem. We prove the oracle inequality and derive the average case learning curve for the equivalent GP model. Our finding implies that low-rank tensor regression, though empirically successful, is highly dependent on the eigenvalues of covariance functions as well as variable correlations.

Space- and ground-based non-accelerated long lifetime data for ruggedized commercial Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO) lasers	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE OPTICS-ICSO 2018	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO)	OCT 09-12, 2018	Chania, GREECE			laser; lifetime; space		Lifetime data is presented for ruggedized commercial NPRO lasers used in the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) Instrument on NASA's Aura Earth-orbiting spacecraft, including 20 years of data from two life test units on the ground, 12 years of on-orbit data from TES Laser A, and 2 years of on-orbit data from TES Laser B. The TES lasers are diode-pumped Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO) lasers using Nd:YAG crystals. Since accelerated life testing was not possible on the complete laser, early prototype lasers that had gone through thermal cycling and vibration testing were placed on non-accelerated life tests with the hope of gathering at least a couple of years of data before launch. Long-term lifetime data for hybrid laser systems in space applications is not abundant, and out of necessity, accelerated reliability testing is usually done over a relatively short time with a large number of devices. The data presented in this paper is unique as it tracks the optical power output over time of a total of four lasers on the order of decades rather than months or years. Two of the lasers have each been on life test for over 20 years on the ground and are still operating, and the other two lasers have been on-orbit for 14 years. TES Laser A was still operating when the TES Instrument was decommissioned in January 2018. Therefore, the data presented covers over 450,000 non-accelerated device-hours, with 23% of those hours being in space.	[Asbury, C. G.; Dorsky, L. I.; Nerheim, N. M.; Forouhar, S.; Rider, D.

The 2-mu m laser wavelength is of particular interest due to the presence of many CO2 and H2O absorption lines in its vicinity(1). Transmitter architectures are typically composed of an optically pumped, frequency-stable, solid-state seed laser and a high-power optical amplifier.(2, 3) Taking advantage of the reliability and relative simplicity of semiconductor lasers, this architecture can substantially improve by replacing the solid-state light source with semiconductor lasers of comparable performance. This approach will greatly improve the system reliability, and will simplify instrument integration and space qualification. There are currently very limited semiconductor lasers operating in the 2-mu m range with performance satisfactory enough for use as an injection seed in a laser absorption spectrometer. Optimally, seed lasers producing greater than 50 mW of continuous-wave (CW), with frequency jitter of less than 1 MHz are desired to reliably resolve the CO2 absorption lines near 2-mu m. In this paper, we report the demonstration of high-power, single-longitudinal-mode laterally coupled distributed feedback (LC-DFB) lasers at 2.05 mu m wavelength. We measured more than 80 mW of CW power at -10 degrees C for devices with a 4-mu m-wide ridge and 2-mm-long cavity.

In this work we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size polynomial in dimension and the number of mixture components, while being independent of the data set size. Hence, one can harness computationally intensive algorithms to compute a good approximation on a significantly smaller data set. More importantly, such coresets can be efficiently constructed both in distributed and streaming settings and do not impose restrictions on the data generating process. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry and new combinatorial complexity results for mixtures of Gaussians. Empirical evaluation on several real-world data sets suggests that our coreset-based approach enables significant reduction in training-time with negligible approximation error.

Yet it is still challenging to hide the very presence of encrypted, secret data from a powerful adversary. This paper presents a new technique to hide data in flash by manipulating the voltage level of pseudo-randomlyselected flash cells to encode two bits (rather than one) in the cell. In this model, we have one "public" bit interpreted using an SLC-style encoding, and extract a private bit using an MLC-style encoding. The locations of cells that encode hidden data is based on a secret key known only to the hiding user. Intuitively, this technique requires that the voltage level in a cell encoding data must be (1) not statistically distinguishable from a cell only storing public data, and (2) the user must be able to reliably read the hidden data from this cell. Our key insight is that there is a wide enough variation in the range of voltage levels in a typical flash device to obscure the presence of fine-grained changes to a small fraction of the cells, and that the variation is wide enough to support reliably re-reading hidden data. We demonstrate that our hidden data and underlying voltage manipulations go undetected by support vector machine based supervised learning which performs similarly to a random guess.

The use of intelligent systems to detect trafficking can thus have a direct impact on investigative resource allocation and decision-making, and, more broadly, help curb a widespread social problem. Trafficking detection involves assigning a normalized score to a set of escort advertisements crawled from the Web - a higher score indicates a greater risk of trafficking-related (involuntary) activities. In this paper, we define and study the problem of trafficking detection and present a trafficking detection pipeline architecture developed over three years of research within the DARPA Memex program. Drawing on multi-institutional data, systems, and experiences collected during this time, we also conduct post hoc bias analyses and present a bias mitigation plan. Our findings show that, while automatic trafficking detection is an important application of AI for social good, it also provides cautionary lessons for deploying predictive machine learning algorithms without appropriate de-biasing. This ultimately led to integration of an interpretable solution into a search system that contains over 100 million advertisements and is used by over 200 law enforcement agencies to investigate leads.

To support these decision-making tasks, which may require elastic prioritization of goals dependent on changing conditions, custom analytics tools are often developed. We were asked to develop such a tool by a team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where rover telecom operators make decisions based on models predicting how much data rovers can transfer from the surface of Mars. Through research, design, implementation, and informal evaluation of our new tool, we developed principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. We offer these principles as a step towards understanding the complex task of designing these systems. The principles we present are applicable to designers and developers tasked with building analytics systems in domains that face complex operations challenges such as scheduling, routing, and logistics.

The surface morphology of the III-V nanowires, the thickness of the quantum wells and the photoluminescence spectra of the InGaAs/InP quantum well nanowires were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and micro photoluminescence, respectively. It was found that the thickness inhomogeneity of the quantum well, the composition inhomogeneity of the quantum well and the pump power density irradiated onto the surface of nanowire are the three major factors affecting the micro-photoluminescence spectra.

DICKINSON	Geological Society of America Special Papers		English	Article; Book Chapter							U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY; HF ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY; ROBERTS-MOUNTAINS ALLOCHTHON; RITTER RANGE PENDANT; SNOW LAKE PENDANT; CONTINENTAL-MARGIN; MOJAVE DESERT; DEATH-VALLEY; MAGMATIC ARC; PALEOGEOGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE	The Sierra Nevada batholith of California represents the intrusive footprint of composite Mesozoic Cordilleran arcs built through pre-Mesozoic strata exposed in isolated pendants. Neoproterozoic to Permian strata, which formed the prebatholithic framework of the Sierran arc, were emplaced against the tectonically reorganized SW Laurentian continental margin in the late Paleozoic, culminating with final collapse of the fringing McCloud arc against SW Laurentia. Synthesis of 22 new and 135 existing detrital zircon U/Pb geochronology sample analyses clarifies the provenance, affinity, and history of Sierra Nevada framework rocks. Framework strata comprise terranes with distinct postdepositional histories and detrital zircon provenance that form three broad groups: allochthonous Neoproterozoic to lower Paleozoic strata with interpreted sediment sources from Idaho to northern British Columbia; Neoproterozoic to Permian strata parautochthonous to SW Laurentia; and middle to upper Paleozoic deposits related to the fringing McCloud arc. Only three sedimentary packages potentially contain detritus from rocks exotic to western Laurentia: the Sierra City melange, chert-argillite unit, and Twin Lakes assemblage. We reject previous correlations of eastern Sierra Nevada strata with the Roberts Mountains and Golconda allochthons and find no evidence that these allochthons ever extended westward across Owens Valley. Snow Lake terrane detrital ages are consistent with interpreted provenance over a wide range from the Mojave Desert to central Idaho. The composite detrital zircon population of all analyses from pre-Mesozoic Sierran framework rocks is indistinguishable from that of the Neoproterozoic to Permian SW Laurentian margin, providing a strong link, in aggregate, between these strata and western Laurentia. These findings support interpretations that the Sierran arc was built into thick sediments underpinned by transitional to continental western Laurentian lithosphere. Thus, the Mesozoic Sierra Nevada arc is native to the SW Cordilleran margin, with the Sierran framework emplaced along SW Laurentia prior to Permian-Triassic initiation of Cordilleran arc activity.

Elucidating flow-mediated endothelial metabolites enables us to discover metabolic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We posited that flow-responsive vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-protein kinase C isoform epsilon (PKC)-6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) signaling modulates glycolytic metabolites for vascular repair. Results: Bidirectional oscillatory flow (oscillatory shear stress [OSS]: 0.13 dynecm(-2) at 1Hz) upregulated VEGFR-dependent PKC expression to a greater degree than did unidirectional pulsatile flow (pulsatile shear stress [PSS]: 23 +/- 8 dynecm(-2) at 1Hz) in human aortic endothelial cells (p<0.05, n=3). PSS and OSS further upregulated PKC-dependent PFKFB3 expression for glycolysis (p<0.05, n=4). Constitutively active PKC increased, whereas dominant-negative PKC reduced both basal and maximal extracellular acidification rates for glycolytic flux (p<0.01, n=4). Metabolomic analysis demonstrated an increase in PKC-dependent glycolytic metabolite, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), but a decrease in gluconeogenic metabolite, aspartic acid (p<0.05 vs. control, n=6). In a New Zealand White rabbit model, both PKC and PFKFB3 immunostaining was prominent in the PSS- and OSS-exposed aortic arch and descending aorta. In a transgenic Tg(flk-1:EGFP) zebrafish model, GATA-1a morpholino oligonucleotide injection (to reduce viscosity-dependent shear stress) impaired vascular regeneration after tail amputation (p<0.01, n=20), which was restored with PKC messenger RNA (mRNA) rescue (p<0.05, n=5). As a corollary, siPKC inhibited tube formation and vascular repair, which were restored by DHA treatment in our Matrigel and zebrafish models. Innovation and Conclusion: Flow-sensitive VEGFR-PKC-PFKFB3 signaling increases the glycolytic metabolite, dihydroxyacetone, to promote vascular repair. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 31-43.

In addition, we identify 16 targets as likely eclipsing binaries, based on their light curve morphology. We obtained follow-up optical spectra of 105/141 candidate host stars and 8/16 eclipsing binaries to improve stellar properties and to identify spectroscopic binaries. Importantly, spectroscopy enables measurements of host star radii with approximate to 10% precision, compared to approximate to 40% precision when only broadband photometry is available. The improved stellar radii enable improved planet radii. Our curated catalog of planet candidates provides a starting point for future efforts to confirm and characterize K2 discoveries.

Identification of 481 Fast Rotators in the Solar Neighborhood	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars: activity; stars: low-mass; stars: Population II; stars: rotation; surveys	M-DWARFS; ROTATIONAL BRAKING; SKY SURVEY; AGE; EMISSION; FIELDS	The K2 mission is targeting large numbers of nearby (d < 100 pc) GKM dwarfs selected from the SUPERBLINK proper motion survey (mu > 40 mas yr(-1), V < 20). Additionally, the mission is targeting low-mass, high proper motion stars associated with the local (d < 500 pc) Galactic halo population also selected from SUPERBLINK. K2 campaigns 0 through 8 monitored a total of 26,518 of these cool main-sequence stars. We used the auto-correlation function to search for fast rotators by identifying short-period photometric modulations in the K2 light curves. We identified 481 candidate fast rotators with rotation periods < 4 days that show light-curve modulations consistent with starspots. Their kinematics show low average transverse velocities, suggesting that they are part of the young disk population. A subset (13) of the fast rotators is found among those targets with colors and kinematics consistent with the local Galactic halo population and may represent stars spun up by tidal interactions in close binary systems. We further demonstrate that the M dwarf fast rotators selected from the K2 light curves are significantly more likely to have UV excess and discuss the potential of the K2 mission to identify new nearby young GKM dwarfs on the basis of their fast rotation rates. Finally, we discuss the possible use of local halo stars as fiducial, non-variable sources in the Kepler fields.

Convergence analysis of ensemble Kalman inversion: the linear, noisy case	APPLICABLE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian inverse problems; ensemble Kalman filter; parameter identification; 65N21; 62F15; 65N75	FILTER	We present an analysis of ensemble Kalman inversion, based on the continuous time limit of the algorithm. The analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the ensemble allows us to establish well-posedness and convergence results for a fixed ensemble size. We will build on recent results on the convergence in the noise-free case and generalise them to the case of noisy observational data, in particular the influence of the noise on the convergence will be investigated, both theoretically and numerically. We focus on linear inverse problems where a very complete theoretical analysis is possible.	[Schillings, C.] Univ Mannheim, Inst Math, Mannheim, Germany; [Stuart, A.

The host star is in a binary system, comprising a K5V star and M7/8V star with a projected separation of 40 au. The planet orbits the primary star with an orbital period of 17.3 days and a transit duration of 3 hrs. The host star is bright (V = 11.2, J = 9.1) and so may be a good target for precise radial velocity measurements. K2-136A. c is the first Neptune-sized planet to be found orbiting in a binary system within an open cluster. The Hyades is the nearest star cluster to the Sun, has an age of 625-750 Myr, and forms one of the fundamental rungs in the distance ladder; understanding the planet population in such a well-studied cluster can help us understand and set constraints on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.

Centauri is known as the closest star to the Sun. Recently, radial velocity (RV) observations revealed the existence of an Earth-mass planet around it. With an orbital period of similar to 11 days, Proxima Centauri b is probably in the habitable zone of its host star. We undertook a photometric monitoring campaign to search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8 has been tentatively identified. Its midtime, T-C = 2,457,640.1990 +/- 0.0017 HJD, is consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on the RV orbit in a 1 sigma confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of Proxima. Centauri, affecting the detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of a potential transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here has a confidence level of 2.5 sigma. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to confirm the planetary transit of Proxima. Centauri. b. We plan to monitor Proxima. Centauri in the next polar night at Dome. A in Antarctica, taking advantage of continuous darkness. Kipping et al. reported two tentative transit-like signals of Proxima. Centauri. b observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars space telescope in 2014 and 2015. The midtransit time of our detection is 138. minutes later than that predicted by their transit ephemeris. If all of the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs plausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima. Centauri. b induced by an outer planet in this system.

Cloud Atlas: Discovery of Rotational Spectral Modulations in a Low-mass, L-type Brown Dwarf Companion to a Star	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; stars: atmospheres	LOMB-SCARGLE PERIODOGRAM; ALL-SKY SURVEY; PHOTOMETRIC VARIABILITY; TIME-SERIES; SPACED DATA; EVOLUTION; WEATHER; SEARCH; YOUNG; ATMOSPHERES	Observations of rotational modulations of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets allow the characterization of condensate cloud properties. As of now, rotational spectral modulations have only been seen in three L-type brown dwarfs. We report here the discovery of rotational spectral modulations in LP261-75B, an L6-type intermediate surface gravity companion to an M4.5 star. As a part of the Cloud Atlas Treasury program, we acquired time-resolved Wide Field Camera 3 grism spectroscopy (1.1-1.69 mu m) of LP261-75B. We find gray spectral variations with the relative amplitude displaying only a weak wavelength dependence and no evidence for lower-amplitude modulations in the 1.4. mu m water band than in the adjacent continuum. The likely rotational modulation period is 4.78 +/- 0.95. hr, although the rotational phase is not well sampled. The minimum relative amplitude in the white light curve measured over the whole wavelength range is 2.41% +/- 0.14%. We report an unusual light curve, which seems to have three peaks approximately evenly distributed in rotational phase. The spectral modulations suggests that the upper atmosphere cloud properties in LP261-75B are similar to two other mid-L dwarfs of typical infrared colors, but differ from that of the extremely red L-dwarf WISE0047.

Generalized radiative transfer theory for scattering by particles in an absorbing gas: Addressing both spatial and spectral integration in multi-angle remote sensing of optically thin aerosol layers	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							CORRELATED RANDOM MEDIUM; AVERAGED SOLAR FLUXES; OXYGEN A-BAND; PATH-LENGTH; BOLTZMANN-EQUATION; PHOTON PROPAGATION; JOINT STATISTICS; BROKEN CLOUDS; K METHOD; TRANSPORT	We demonstrate the computational advantage gained by introducing non-exponential transmission laws into radiative transfer theory for two specific situations. One is the problem of spatial integration over a large domain where the scattering particles cluster randomly in a medium uniformly filled with an absorbing gas, and only a probabilistic description of the variability is available. The increasingly important application here is passive atmospheric profiling using oxygen absorption in the visible/near-IR spectrum. The other scenario is spectral integration over a region where the absorption cross-section of a spatially uniform gas varies rapidly and widely and, moreover, there are scattering particles embedded in the gas that are distributed uniformly, or not. This comes up in many applications, O-2 A-band profiling being just one instance. We bring a common framework to solve these problems both efficiently and accurately that is grounded in the recently developed theory of Generalized Radiative Transfer (GRT). In GRT, the classic exponential law of transmission is replaced by one with a slower power-law decay that accounts for the unresolved spectral or spatial variability. Analytical results are derived in the single-scattering limit that applies to optically thin aerosol layers. In spectral integration, a modest gain in accuracy is obtained. As for spatial integration of near-monochromatic radiance, we find that, although both continuum and in band radiances are affected by moderate levels of sub-pixel variability, only extreme variability will affect in-band/continuum ratios.

Shaler: insitu analysis of a fluvial sedimentary deposit on Mars	SEDIMENTOLOGY			English	Article						Fluvial; Gale crater; Mars; sedimentology; stratigraphy	TROUGH CROSS STRATIFICATION; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; GALE CRATER; FLOW; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; SYSTEM; UNIT; SCOTLAND	This paper characterizes the detailed sedimentology of a fluvial sandbody on Mars for the first time and interprets its depositional processes and palaeoenvironmental setting. Despite numerous orbital observations of fluvial landforms on the surface of Mars, ground-based characterization of the sedimentology of such fluvial deposits has not previously been possible. Results from the NASA Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover provide an opportunity to reconstruct at fine scale the sedimentary architecture and palaeomorphology of a fluvial environment on Mars. This work describes the grain size, texture and sedimentary facies of the Shaler outcrop, reconstructs the bedding architecture, and analyses cross-stratification to determine palaeocurrents. On the basis of bedset geometry and inclination, grain-size distribution and bedform migration direction, this study concludes that the Shaler outcrop probably records the accretion of a fluvial barform. The majority of the outcrop consists of large-scale trough cross-bedding of coarse sand and granules. Palaeocurrent analyses and bedform reconstruction indicate that the beds were deposited by bedforms that migrated towards the north-east, across the surface of a bar that migrated south-east. Stacked cosets of dune cross-bedding suggest aggradation of multiple bedforms, which provides evidence for short periods of sustained flow during Shaler deposition. However, local evidence for aeolian reworking and the presence of potential desiccation cracks within the outcrop suggest that fluvial deposition may have been intermittent. The uppermost strata at Shaler are distinct in terms of texture and chemistry and are inferred to record deposition from a different sediment dispersal system with a contrasting provenance. The outcrop as a whole is a testament to the availability of liquid water on the surface of Mars in its early history.

However, the sky is bright in the thermal infrared (3-5 mu m), and the correspondingly small fields of view of available detectors make it highly unusual to have a calibration star in the same field as a science target. Here, we present a new method of obtaining differential photometry by simultaneously imaging a science target and a calibrator star, separated by less than or similar to 2 amin, onto a 10 x 10 asec(2) field-of-view detector. We do this by taking advantage of the Large Binocular Telescope's (LBT) unique binocular design to point the two co-mounted telescopes apart and simultaneously obtain both targets in three sets of observations. Results indicate that the achievable scatter in L-S-band (lambda(c) = 3.3 mu m) is at the percent level for bright targets and possibly better with heavier sampling and characterization of the systematics.

FinDer v.2: Improved real-time ground-motion predictions for M2-M9 with seismic finite-source characterization	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Image processing; Spatial analysis; Earthquake early warning; Earthquake ground motions; Earthquake hazards; Earthquake source observations	RUPTURE DETECTOR FINDER; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; EARTHQUAKE RUPTURE; BROAD-BAND; GPS; NETWORK; MODELS; SYSTEM; PROPAGATION; DIRECTIVITY	Recent studies suggest that small and large earthquakes nucleate similarly, and that they often have indistinguishable seismic waveform onsets. The characterization of earthquakes in real time, such as for earthquake early warning, therefore requires a flexible modeling approach that allows a small earthquake to become large as fault rupture evolves over time. Here, we present a modeling approach that generates a set of output parameters and uncertainty estimates that are consistent with both small/moderate (<= M6.5) and large earthquakes (>M6.5) as is required for a robust parameter interpretation and shaking forecast. Our approach treats earthquakes over the entire range of magnitudes (>M2) as finite line-source ruptures, with the dimensions of small earthquakes being very small (<100 m) and those of large earthquakes exceeding several tens to hundreds of kilometres in length. The extent of the assumed line source is estimated from the level and distribution of high-frequency peak acceleration amplitudes observed in a local seismic network. High-frequency motions are well suited for this approach, because they are mainly controlled by the distance to the rupturing fault. Observed ground-motion patterns are compared with theoretical templates modeled from empirical ground-motion prediction equations to determine the best line source and uncertainties. Our algorithm extends earlier work by Bose et al. for large finite-fault ruptures. This paper gives a detailed summary of the new algorithm and its offline performance for the 2016 M7.0 Kumamoto, Japan and 2014 M6.0 South Napa, California earthquakes, as well as its performance for about 100 real-time detected local earthquakes (2.2 <= M <= 5.1) in California. For most events, both the rupture length and the strike are well constrained within a few seconds (<10 s) of the event origin. In large earthquakes, this could allow for providing warnings of up to several tens of seconds. The algorithm could also be useful for resolving fault plane ambiguities of focal mechanisms and identification of rupturing faults for earthquakes as small as M2.5.	[Bose, M.; Clinton, J.

Role of the mass attenuation coefficient database in standardization of a silicon drift X-ray detector for PIXE analysis	X-RAY SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							L-SHELL; FLUORESCENCE YIELDS; K-SHELL; IONIZATION; PROTONS; SYSTEM; WIDTHS	A simple, inexpensive procedure is described for calibrating a silicon drift detector-based PIXE system for the analysis of geological and other thick-target materials. It rests on the use of single element, chemical compound, and National Institute for Standards and Technology multielement standards. Much less effort has been focussed on the impact of mass attenuation coefficients on PIXE's analytical accuracy than on ionization cross sections and fluorescence yields. The calibrated system enables us to investigate the effects of inserting different mass attenuation coefficient datasets into the GUPIX database. For the K X-rays of light elements, accuracy is significantly improved by replacing the formerly used XCOM self-attenuation coefficients by the corresponding FFAST values; this effect decreases rapidly with increasing atomic number. Similar improvement was found for L X-rays of medium-Z, but not for high-Z atoms.

Position-specific C-13 distributions within propane from experiments and natural gas samples	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Isotope geochemistry; Site-specific isotopes	CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; HYDROUS PYROLYSIS; NITROUS-OXIDE; DEPOSITIONAL-ENVIRONMENTS; ORGANIC-MATTER; AMINO-ACIDS; FATTY-ACIDS; N-ALKANES; METHANE; ISOTOPOLOGUES	Site-specific carbon isotope measurements of organic compounds potentially recover information that is lost in a conventional, 'bulk' isotopic analysis. Such measurements are useful because isotopically fractionating processes may have distinct effects at different molecular sites, and thermodynamically equilibrated populations of molecules tend to concentrate heavy isotopes in one molecular site versus another. Most recent studies of site-specific C-13 in organics use specialized Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques or complex chemical degradations prior to mass spectrometric measurements. Herein we present the first application of a new mass spectrometric technique that reconstructs the site-specific carbon isotope composition of propane based on measurements of the C-13/C-12 ratios of two or more fragment ions that sample different proportions of the terminal and central carbon sites. We apply this method to propane from laboratory experiments and natural gas samples to explore the relationships between site-specific carbon isotope composition, full-molecular delta C-13, thermal maturity, and variation in organic matter precursors. Our goal is to advance the understanding of the sources and histories of short-chain alkanes within geologic systems. Our findings suggest that propane varies in its site-specific carbon isotope structure, which is correlated with increasing thermal maturity, first increasing in terminal position delta C-13 and then increasing in both center and terminal position delta C-13. This pattern is observed in both experimental and natural samples, and is plausibly explained by a combination of site-specific, temperature-dependent isotope effects associated with conversion of different precursor molecules (kerogen, bitumen, and/or oil) to propane, differences in site-specific isotopic contents of those precursors, and possibly distillation of reactive components of those precursors with increasing maturity. We hypothesize that the largest changes in sitespecific isotopic content of propane occur when bitumen and/or oil replace kerogen as the dominant precursors. If correct, this phenomenon could have significant utility for understanding gas generation in thermogenic petroleum systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The body couples stemming from a misalignment between the electric field and the electric-dipole density vector are studied and the conservation laws for polymer networks are derived. Using variational principles, expressions for the polarization and the stress are determined. Interestingly, it is found that the stress tensor resulting from coupled loadings in which the electric field is misaligned with the principal stretch directions is not symmetric and the asymmetry arises from the body couples. Next, the electromechanical response of a chain is analyzed. The deformations of the individual polymer chains are related to the macroscopic deformation via two highly non-linear constraints the first pertaining to the compatibility of the local deformations with the imposed macroscopic one and the second stems from the symmetric part of the stress at equilibrium. In accord with the proposed framework, an amended three-chains model is introduced. The predictions of this model are found to be in excellent agreement with experimental findings. Lastly, the behavior of a polymer subjected to a simple shear and an electric field is studied. The offset between the electric field and the principal directions gives rise to body couples, a polarization that is not aligned with the electric field, and an asymmetric stress tensor.

X-ray emission from SN 2012ca: A Type Ia-CSM supernova explosion in a dense surrounding medium	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						shock waves; circumstellar matter; stars: mass-loss; supernovae: general; supernovae: individual: SN 2012ca; X-rays: individual: SN 2012ca	CIRCUMSTELLAR MEDIUM; FACTORY OBSERVATIONS; STRIPPED-ENVELOPE; LIGHT CURVES; WHITE-DWARF; CLUMPY WIND; PTF 11KX; PROGENITORS; SPECTRA; COLLAPSE	X-ray emission is one of the signposts of circumstellar interaction in supernovae (SNe), but until now, it has been observed only in core-collapse SNe. The level of thermal X-ray emission is a direct measure of the density of the circumstellar medium (CSM), and the absence of X-ray emission from Type Ia SNe has been interpreted as a sign of a very low density CSM. In this paper, we report late-time (500-800 d after discovery) X-ray detections of SN 2012ca in Chandra data. The presence of hydrogen in the initial spectrum led to a classification of Type Ia-CSM, ostensibly making it the first SN Ia detected with X-rays. Our analysis of the X-ray data favours an asymmetric medium, with a high-density component which supplies the X-ray emission. The data suggest a number density > 10(8) cm(-3) in the higher density medium, which is consistent with the large observed Balmer decrement if it arises from collisional excitation. This is high compared to most core-collapse SNe, but it may be consistent with densities suggested for some Type IIn or superluminous SNe. If SN 2012ca is a thermonuclear SN, the large CSM density could imply clumps in the wind, or a dense torus or disc, consistent with the single-degenerate channel. A remote possibility for a core-degenerate channel involves a white dwarf merging with the degenerate core of an asymptotic giant branch star shortly before the explosion, leading to a common envelope around the SN.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: understanding observations of large-scale outflows at low redshift with EAGLE simulations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics	SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; STAR-FORMATION; GALACTIC WINDS; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; STELLAR FEEDBACK; DRIVEN; EVOLUTION; PROJECT; KINEMATICS	This work presents a study of galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback. We extract main-sequence disc galaxies with stellar mass 10(9) <= M-*/M-circle dot <= 5.7 x 10(10) at redshift z = 0 from the highest resolution cosmological simulation of the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) set. Synthetic gas rotation velocity and velocity dispersion (s) maps are created and compared to observations of disc galaxies obtained with the Sydney-AAO (Australian Astronomical Observatory) Multi-object Integral field spectrograph (SAMI), where sigma-values greater than 150 km s(-1) are most naturally explained by bipolar outflows powered by starburst activity. We find that the extension of the simulated edge-on (pixelated) velocity dispersion probability distribution depends on stellar mass and star formation rate surface density (Sigma(SFR)), with low-M*/low-Sigma(SFR) galaxies showing a narrow peak at low sigma (similar to 30 km s(-1)) and more active, high-M-*/high-Sigma(SFR) galaxies reaching sigma > 150 km s(-1). Although supernova-driven galactic winds in the EAGLE simulations may not entrain enough gas with T < 10(5) K compared to observed galaxies, we find that gas temperature is a good proxy for the presence of outflows. There is a direct correlation between the thermal state of the gas and its state of motion as described by the sigma-distribution. The following equivalence relations hold in EAGLE: (i) low-sigma peak double left right arrow disc of the galaxy double left right arrow gas with T < 10(5) K; (ii) high-sigma tail double left right arrow galactic winds double left right arrow gas with T >= 10(5) K.

The Upper Scorpius association	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; CENTAURUS OB ASSOCIATION; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; T-TAURI STARS; SPACED DATA; UPPER SCO; KEPLER; TELESCOPE; ACCRETION; EVOLUTION	High-precision photometry from space-based missions such as K2 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite enables detailed studies of young star variability. However, because space-based observing campaigns are often short (e.g. 80 d for K2), complementary long-baseline photometric surveys are critical for obtaining a complete understanding of young star variability, which can change on time-scales of minutes to years. We therefore present and analyse light curves of members of the Upper Scorpius association made over 5.5 yr by the ground-based Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT), which complement the high-precision observations of this region taken by K2 during its Campaigns 2 and 15. We show that KELT data accurately identify the periodic signals found with high-precision K2 photometry, demonstrating the power of ground-based surveys in deriving stellar rotation periods of young stars. We also use KELT data to identify sources exhibiting variability that is likely related to circumstellar material and/or stellar activity cycles; these signatures are often unseen in the short-term K2 data, illustrating the importance of long-term monitoring surveys for studying the full range of young star variability. We provide the KELT light curves as electronic tables in an ongoing effort to establish legacy time series data sets for young stellar clusters.

The twisted radio structure of PSO J334.2028+01.4075, still a supermassive binary black hole candidate	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; quasars: individual: PSO J334.2028+01.4075; radio continuum: galaxies	LOBE-DOMINATED QUASARS; SYSTEMATIC SEARCH; GALACTIC NUCLEI; COMPLETE SAMPLE; PG 1302-102; JETS; MODEL	Supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) on sub-parsec scales are prime targets for gravitational wave experiments. They also provide insights on close binary evolution and hierarchical structure formation. Sub-parsec BBHs cannot be spatially resolved but indirect methods can identify candidates. In 2015 Liu et al. reported an optical-continuum periodicity in the quasar PSO J334.2028+01.4075, with the estimated mass and rest-frame period suggesting an orbital separation of about 0.006 pc (0.7 mu arcsec). The persistence of the quasar's optical periodicity has recently been disfavoured over an extended baseline. However, if a radio jet is launched from a sub-parsec BBH, the binary's properties can influence the radio structure on larger scales. Here, we use the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to study the parsec- and kiloparsec-scale emission energized by the quasar's putative BBH. We find two VLBA components separated by 3.6 mas (30 pc), tentatively identifying one as the VLBA 'core' from which the other was ejected. The VLBA components contribute to a point-like, time-variable VLA source that is straddled by lobes spanning 8 arcsec (66 kpc). We classify PSO J334.2028+01.4075 as a lobe-dominated quasar, albeit with an atypically large twist of 39 degrees between its elongation position angles on parsec-and kiloparsec-scales. By analogy with 3C207, a well-studied lobe-dominated quasar with a similarly-rare twist, we speculate that PSO J334.2028+01.4075 could be ejecting jet components over an inner cone that traces a precessing jet in a BBH system.

Model for how an accretion disk drives astrophysical jets and sheds angular momentum	PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION			English	Article						accretion disk; astrophysical jet; angular momentum; Hall MHD; dynamo; weakly ionized plasma; canonical angular momentum	WEAKLY MAGNETIZED DISKS; MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY; NONLINEAR EVOLUTION; HALL TERM; SIMULATIONS; ACCELERATION	Clumps of ions and neutrals in the weakly ionized plasma in an accretion disk are shown to follow trajectories analogous to those of fictitious 'metaparticles' having a charge to mass ratio reduced from that of an ion by the ionization fraction. A certain class of meta-particles have zero-canonical angular momentum and so spiral in towards the star. Accumulation of these meta-particles establishes a radial electric field that drives the electric current that flows in bidirectional astrophysical jets lying along the disk axis and provides forces that drive the jets. The entire process converts gravitational potential energy into jet energy while absorbing angular momentum from accreting material and shedding this angular momentum at near infinite radius.

J	Najafi, E; Liao, BL; Scarborough, T; Zewail, A				Najafi, Ebrahim; Liao, Bolin; Scarborough, Timothy; Zewail, Ahmed			Imaging surface acoustic wave dynamics in semiconducting polymers by scanning ultrafast electron microscopy	ULTRAMICROSCOPY			English	Article						Ultrafast electron microscopy; Surface acoustic waves; Rayleigh waves; Mechanical properties; Organic thin films	CARRIER DYNAMICS; FIELD; TRANSPORT; VISUALIZATION; BIOSENSORS; SPACE; GAAS	Understanding the mechanical properties of organic semiconductors is essential to their electronic and photovoltaic applications. Despite a large volume of research directed toward elucidating the chemical, physical and electronic properties of these materials, little attention has been directed toward understanding their thermo-mechanical behavior. Here, we report the ultrafast imaging of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on the surface of the Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) thin film at the picosecond and nanosecond timescales. We then use these images to measure the propagation velocity of SAWs, which we then employ to determine the Young's modulus of P3HT. We further validate our experimental observation by performing a semi-empirical transient thermoelastic finite element analysis. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ultrafast electron microscopy to not only probe charge carrier dynamics in materials as previously reported, but also to measure their mechanical properties with great accuracy. This is particularly important when in situ characterization of stiffness for thin devices and nanomaterials is required. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
