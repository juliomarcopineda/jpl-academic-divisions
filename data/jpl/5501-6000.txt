Cloud heights measured by MISR from 2000 to 2015	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						MISR stereo heights; effective cloud height; global time series; ENSO; equatorial clouds; teleconnections		Davies and Molloy (2012) reported a decrease in the global effective cloud height over the first 10years of Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) measurements on the Terra satellite. We have reexamined their time series for possible artefacts that might especially affect the initial portion of the record when the heights appeared anomalously high. While variations in sampling were shown to be inconsequential, an artefact due to the change in equator crossing time that affected the first 2years was discovered, and this has now been corrected. That correction, together with the extension of the time series by five more years, yields no significant overall trend in global heights during the first 15years of Terra operation. The time series is dominated by large interannual fluctuations associated with La Nina events that mask any overall trend on a global scale. On a regional basis, the cloud heights showed significant interannual variations of much larger amplitude, sometimes with fairly direct cancellation between regions. There were unexplained differences between the two hemispheres in the timing of height anomalies. These differences persisted over a large range of extratropical latitudes, suggestive of teleconnections. Within the tropics, there were very strong changes associated with the Central Pacific and Indonesian Maritime Continent regions that oscillated out of phase with each other, with interannual amplitudes that exceeded 1km. Plain Language Summary Effective cloud height is an important climate variable, strongly influencing the overall greenhouse effect, with a change of approximate to 15m/decade being comparable to the rate of CO2 increase. The Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra satellite uses a stereo technique to systematically measure cloud heights with a sampling accuracy of approximate to 11m on the global, annual average. Over the last 15years we find interannual departures are greatest during La Nina events, reaching over 40m on a global average. The apparent decreasing trend during the first 10years noted by Davies and Molloy has now vanished, in part due to correction for sun glint, and in part due to higher clouds in the last 5years. Regional cloud height changes continue to show a high degree of correlation, especially for about five distinct regions of equatorial clouds. Southern Hemisphere cloud heights have increased, whereas Northern Hemisphere heights have decreased.

The Great Cold Spot in Jupiter's upper atmosphere	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; thermosphere; aurora; ionosphere; infrared; vortex	JOVIAN IONOSPHERE; AURORAL EMISSION; SOLAR-WIND; THERMAL STRUCTURE; H-3(+) EMISSION; ENERGY INPUTS; DYNAMICS; THERMOSPHERE; TEMPERATURE; MODEL	Past observations and modeling of Jupiter's thermosphere have, due to their limited resolution, suggested that heat generated by the aurora near the poles results in a smooth thermal gradient away from these aurorae, indicating a quiescent and diffuse flow of energy within the subauroral thermosphere. Here we discuss Very Large Telescope-Cryogenic High-Resolution IR Echelle Spectrometer observations that reveal a small-scale localized cooling of similar to 200K within the nonauroral thermosphere. Using Infrared Telescope Facility NSFCam images, this feature is revealed to be quasi-stable over at least a 15year period, fixed in magnetic latitude and longitude. The size and shape of this Great Cold Spot vary significantly with time, strongly suggesting that it is produced by an aurorally generated weather system: the first direct evidence of a long-term thermospheric vortex in the solar system. We discuss the implications of this spot, comparing it with short-term temperature and density variations at Earth. Plain Language Summary In this paper, we reveal the detection of a region of cooling in Jupiter's upper atmosphere that we describe as Jupiter's Great Cold Spot. In the past, Jupiter's upper atmosphere was observed to have a gentle gradient of heat flowing away from the auroral region, and so the detection of such a localized cooling suggests that Jupiter's upper atmosphere is far more complex than previously thought. This region, similar in size to the Great Red Spot, appears to be a large vortex located at very high altitudes, but unlike weather systems lower in the atmosphere, it appears to be directly related to the planet's aurora. This vortex has been observed over 15 years and so appears to be somewhat stable, though it changes in shape and size over shorter timescales. Although never considered for Jupiter, this vortex might be related to similar structures observed and modeled at Earth.

Monika			Retrieving forest canopy extinction coefficient from terrestrial and airborne lidar	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Lidar data; Extinction coefficient; Foliage inclination angle; Foliage azimuthal angle	LEAF-AREA INDEX; INCLINATION ANGLE DISTRIBUTION; LASER-SCANNING TLS; PLANT CANOPIES; SEASONAL-VARIATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; LIGHT; TREES; ORIENTATION; VEGETATION	Accurately retrieving the extinction coefficient (k) of foliage elements is a key step to spatially mapping the radiation regime within and under a forest canopy. The azimuthal angle of foliage elements (characterized by their normal vectors) is an important factor for improving the retrieval accuracy of k using 3-D voxels derived from lidar data. In this work, we first developed and validated an approach to retrieve k for a forest canopy by considering both inclination and azimuthal angles from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. Then, we explored the feasibility of applying the proposed method to aerial laser scanning (ALS) data through four point thinning experiments for both broadleaf and coniferous trees. Our results showed that: (1) TLS-based foliage orientation could capture 86% (N=209, p < 0.001) and 64% (N = 78, p < 0.001) of the variance in manually measured azimuthal and inclination angles, respectively for an artificial broadleaf tree; (2) the proposed lidar-based k retrieval method can be applied to both ALS- and TLS- based forest lidar data; and (3) the azimuthal angle of foliage elements is an important factor for retrieving k of a forest canopy, and both TLS and ALS platforms have differing effects on the estimates of forest k. Using this new framework, we were able to use lidar data to model the expected spatio-temporal distribution of photosynthetically active radiation within forest canopies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Field observations, in conjunction with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, Global Positioning System, and seismology data, reveal this to be one of the most complex earthquakes ever recorded. The rupture propagated northward for more than 170 kilometers along both mapped and unmapped faults before continuing offshore at the island's northeastern extent. Geodetic and field observations reveal surface ruptures along at least 12 major faults, including possible slip along the southern Hikurangi subduction interface; extensive uplift along much of the coastline; and widespread anelastic deformation, including the similar to 8-meter uplift of a fault-bounded block. This complex earthquake defies many conventional assumptions about the degree to which earthquake ruptures are controlled by fault segmentation and should motivate reevaluation of these issues in seismic hazard models.

Gas-Surface Scattering Dynamics Applied to Concentration of Gases for Mass Spectrometry in Tenuous Atmospheres	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SATELLITE DRAG COEFFICIENTS; DIRECT INELASTIC-SCATTERING; ATOMIC-BEAM SCATTERING; EXCITATION-FUNCTION; VITREOUS CARBON; AU(110) SURFACE; OXYGEN; GRAPHITE; GOLD; CHEMISTRY	A concept for a passive neutral gas concentrator that facilitates the analysis of rarefied atmospheres using mass spectrometry on spacecraft has been developed. The efficiency of the concentrator depends strongly on gas surface scattering dynamics between the incoming gas molecules and the concentrator surface. We conducted beam surface scattering experiments using hyperthermal beams containing atomic and molecular oxygen with speeds of approximately 5500 m s(-1), with angular and velocity resolution of the inelastically scattered O and O-2, on gold thin film, SiO2, and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces, which were chosen as candidate concentrator surfaces. The results show clearly that atoms and molecules scattering from HOPG have the narrowest and most superspecular angular distributions with the least energy transferred to the surface. A test particle model, referred to as the Statistical Program for Aerodynamic and Radiation Pressure Coefficient Simulation, utilized the experimental results to model gas concentration in three-dimensional cone and annular-ring geometries constructed of the representative materials chosen for study. The modeling results indicate that a cone concentrator with a 10 half angle opening yields the highest concentration factors. In addition, a cone constructed of HOPG yields a concentration factor that is an order of magnitude higher than what can be achieved using gold or SiO2 surfaces.

Apart from NO2, which is highest over urban locations, average tropospheric column levels of these trace gases are highest over oil ports and refineries. The highest average pollution levels over urban settlements are typically in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. We detect 278 statistically significant and real linear NO2 trends in total. Over urban areas NO2 increased by up to 12% yr(-1), with only two locations showing a decreasing trend. Over oil refineries, oil ports, and power plants, NO2 increased by about 2-9% yr(-1). For HCHO, 70 significant and real trends were detected, with HCHO increasing by 2-7% yr(-1) over urban settlements and power plants and by about 2-4% yr(-1) over refineries and oil ports. Very few SO2 trends were detected, which varied in direction and magnitude (23 increasing and 9 decreasing). Apart from two locations where CHOCHO is decreasing, we find that glyoxal tropospheric column levels are not changing over the Middle East. Hence, for many locations in the Middle East, OMI observes a degradation in air quality over 2005-2014. This study therefore demonstrates the capability of OMI to generate long-term air-quality monitoring at local scales over this region.

Measurement of the absolute brightness of this background is complicated by local foregrounds like the Earth's atmosphere and sunlight reflected from local interplanetary dust, and large discrepancies in the inferred brightness of the optical background have resulted. Observations from probes far from the Earth are not affected by these bright foregrounds. Here we analyse the data from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) instrument on NASA's New Horizons mission acquired during cruise phase outside the orbit of Jupiter, and find a statistical upper limit on the optical background's brightness similar to the integrated light from galaxies. We conclude that a carefully performed survey with LORRI could yield uncertainties comparable to those from galaxy counting measurements.

The observations cover the longitude range of (32 degrees, 64 degrees) and (189 degrees, 207 degrees) in the northern Galactic plane. All of the diffuse OH emissions conform to the so-called "Sum Rule" of the four brightness temperatures, indicating optically thin emission conditions for OH from diffuse clouds in the Galactic plane. The column densities of the H I "halos" N(H-I) surrounding molecular clouds increase monotonically with OH column density, N(OH), until saturating when N(H-I)= 1.0 x 10(21) cm(-2) and N(OH) >= 4.5 x 10(15) cm(-2), indicating the presence of molecular gas that cannot be traced by H I. Such a linear correlation, albeit weak, is suggestive of H (I) halos' contribution to the UV shielding required for molecular formation. About 18% of OH clouds have no associated CO emission (CO-dark) at a sensitivity of 0.07 K, but are associated with C+ emission. A weak correlation exists between C+ intensity and OH column density for CO-dark molecular clouds. These results imply that OH seems to be a better tracer of molecular gas than CO in diffuse molecular regions.

The amplitude of the near-infrared EBL from space absolute photometry observations has been controversial and depends strongly on the modeling and subtraction of the zodiacal light (ZL) foreground. We report the first measurement of the diffuse background spectrum at 0.8-1.7 mu m from the CIBER experiment. The observations were obtained with an absolute spectrometer over two flights in multiple sky fields to enable the subtraction of ZL, stars, terrestrial emission, and diffuse Galactic light. After subtracting foregrounds and accounting for systematic errors, we find the nominal EBL brightness, assuming the Kelsall ZL model, is 42.7(-10.6) (+11.9) nW m(-2) sr(-1) at 1.4 mu m. We also analyzed the data using the Wright ZL model, which results in a worse statistical fit to the data and an unphysical EBL, falling below the known background light from galaxies at. lambda<. 1.3 mu m. Using a model-independent analysis based on the minimum EBL brightness, we find an EBL brightness of 28.7(-3.3)(+5.1) nWm(-2) s(r-1) at 1.4 mu m. While the derived EBL amplitude strongly depends on the ZL model, we find that we cannot fit the spectral data to ZL, Galactic emission, and EBL from solely integrated galactic light from galaxy counts. The results require a new diffuse component, such as an additional foreground or an excess EBL with a redder spectrum than that of ZL.

UZ224 ("DeeDee"), a dynamically detached trans-Neptunian object discovered at 92 au. This object is currently the second-most distant known trans-Neptunian object with reported orbital elements, surpassed in distance only by the dwarf planet Eris. The object was discovered with an r-band magnitude of 23.0 in data collected by the Dark Energy Survey between 2014 and 2016. Its 1140 year orbit has (a, e, i)=(109 au, 0.65, 26 degrees.8). It will reach its perihelion distance of 38 au in the year 2142. Integrations of its orbit show it to be dynamically stable on Gyr timescales, with only weak interactions with Neptune. We have performed follow-up observations with ALMA, using 3 hr of on-source integration time to measure the object's thermal emission in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail. The signal is detected at 7 sigma significance, from which we determine a V-band albedo of 13.1(-2.4)(+3.3)(stat)sys percent and a diameter of 635(-61)(+57)(stat)(-39)(+32)(sys) km assuming a spherical body with uniform surface properties.

Observation system simulation experiments (OSSE) were conducted using a combination of a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), a radiative transfer model (VLIDORT), and a HCHO retrieval algorithm developed for the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), which will be launched in 2019. Application of the retrieval algorithm to simulated hourly radiances yields the retrieved HCHO VCDs, which are then compared with the GEOS-Chem HCHO VCDs as true values for the evaluation of the retrieval algorithm. In order to examine the retrieval sensitivity to the temporal variation of AMF, we examine three AMF specifications, AMF(m), AMF(h), and AMF(mh), using monthly, hourly, and monthly mean hourly input data for their calculation, respectively. We compare the retrieved HCHO VCDs using those three AMFs and find that the HCHO VCDs with AMF(h) are in better agreement with the true values than the results using AMF(mh) and AMF(m). AMF(mh) reflects diurnal variation of planetary boundary layer and other meteorological parameters, so that the results with AMF(mh) show a better performance than those with AMF(m). The differences between AMF(h) and AMF(m) range from -0.76 to 0.74 in absolute value and are mainly caused by temporal changes in aerosol chemical compositions and aerosol vertical distributions, which result in 27 to 58 and -34 to 43% changes in HCHO VCDs over China, respectively, compared to HCHO VCDs using AMF(m). We apply our calculated AMF table together with OMI aerosol optical properties to OMI HCHO products in March 2006, when Asian dust storms occurred, and find -32 to 47% changes in the retrieved HCHO columns due to temporal changes in aerosol optical properties in East Asia. The impact of aerosol temporal variability cannot be neglected for future geostationary observations.

A 15-year record of CO emissions constrained by MOPITT CO observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC CARBON-MONOXIDE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; ATMOSPHERIC HYDROXYL; FIRE EMISSIONS; SATELLITE DATA; GEOS-CHEM; AURA TES; EL-NINO; OZONE	Long-term measurements from satellites and surface stations have demonstrated a decreasing trend of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) in the Northern Hemisphere over the past decade. Likely explanations for this decrease include changes in anthropogenic, fires, and/or biogenic emissions or changes in the primary chemical sink hydroxyl radical (OH). Using remotely sensed CO measurements from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument, in situ methyl chloroform (MCF) measurements from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem model, we estimate the change in global CO emissions from 2001 to 2015. We show that the loss rate of MCF varied by 0.2% in the past 15 years, indicating that changes in global OH distributions do not explain the recent decrease in CO. Our two-step inversion approach for estimating CO emissions is intended to mitigate the effect of bias errors in the MOPITT data as well as model errors in transport and chemistry, which are the primary factors contributing to the uncertainties when quantifying CO emissions using these remotely sensed data. Our results confirm that the decreasing trend of tropospheric CO in the Northern Hemisphere is due to decreasing CO emissions from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources. In particular, we find decreasing CO emissions from the United States and China in the past 15 years, and unchanged anthropogenic CO emissions from Europe since 2008. We find decreasing trends of biomass burning CO emissions from boreal North America, boreal Asia and South America, but little change over Africa. In contrast to prior results, we find that a positive trend in CO emissions is likely for India and southeast Asia.

J	Popp, M; Eggl, S				Popp, Max; Eggl, Siegfried			Climate variations on Earth-like circumbinary planets	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE; HABITABLE ZONES; TERRESTRIAL PLANETS; MOIST GREENHOUSE; MODEL; CO2; PARAMETERIZATION; AMPLIFICATION; ATMOSPHERES; SENSITIVITY	The discovery of planets orbiting double stars at close distances has sparked increasing scientific interest in determining whether Earth-analogues can remain habitable in such environments and how their atmospheric dynamics is influenced by the rapidly changing insolation. In this work we present results of the first three-dimensional numerical experiments of a water-rich planet orbiting a double star. We find that the periodic forcing of the atmosphere has a noticeable impact on the planet's climate. Signatures of the forcing frequencies related to the planet's as well as to the binary's orbital periods are present in a variety of climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation, making the interpretation of potential observables challenging. However, for Earth-like greenhouse gas concentrations, the variable forcing does not change the range of insolation values allowing for habitable climates substantially.

Sulfur diagenesis under rapid accumulation of organic-rich sediments in a marine mangrove from Guadeloupe (French West Indies)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Microbial sulfate reduction; Organic carbon-rich sediments; Sulfur and oxygen isotopes; Sulfur oxidizing microbial mats; Early diagenesis; Marine mangrove	BACTERIAL SULFATE REDUCTION; ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; ANAEROBIC OXIDATION; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; METHANE PRODUCTION; PYRITE FORMATION; MICROBIOLOGICAL FRACTIONATION; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; AARHUS BAY	The biogeochemistry of sulfur and carbon during early-diagenetic processes within organic-rich marine mangrove sediments was studied in the "Manche a Eau" lagoon, Guadeloupe, West Indies. These sediments are characterized by a total organic carbon content (TOC) mostly above 11wt%, delta C-13(TOC) below-25 parts per thousand VPDB and C/N-molar ratios exceeding 15. Rates of mangrove-derived organic carbon accumulation vary between similar to 200 and 400 gOC.m(-2).yr(-1), with highest rates at the shore of the lagoon. On the lagoon border, where colorless filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria colonize the sediments, active sulfate reductionwithin the upper 20 cm, with a net removal rate of similar to 0.5 mu mol.cm(-3).d(-1), is assumed to be essentially driven by organic carbon oxidation. This is expressed by relatively low apparent sulfur isotope fractionation (34enet = -33%) and a gentle delta O-18/delta(34)Ssulfate apparent slope of 0.36 +/- 0.03 (2s). Further inside the lagoon, in the absence of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, higher apparent sulfur isotope fractionation and a steeper delta O-18/delta(34)Ssulfate slope (0.67 +/- 0.20) suggest an overall lower sulfate removal rate that may be coupled to minor sulfur disproportionation. Spatial and vertical variation in sulfur cycling, reflected by oxygen and sulfur isotopic characteristics, seem to be mainly controlled by unsteady to relatively steady organicmatter deposition and its reactivity. In all sediments, delta S-34 values of pyrite are positively correlated with the TOC/TS ratio and negatively correlated with delta(CTOC)-C-13; suggesting a primary control of the quantity and quality of organic matter on the pyrite isotope records, despite potential iron-limiting conditions for the most active sites. Our results provide insights into the role of organic carbon input on sulfur cycling; stimulating sulfate reduction and in turn the presence of sulfur-oxidizing microbial mats, resulting in an intense cycling of both carbon and sulfur in these marine mangrove sediments.

We present laboratory measurements of the NL function of a H2RG detector and discuss the accuracy to which it would need to be calibrated in future space missions to performcosmological measurements through the weak gravitational lensing technique. In addition, we present an analysis of archival data from the infrared H1RG detector of the Wide Field Camera 3 in the Hubble Space Telescope that provides evidence consistent with the existence of a sensor effect analogous to the "brighter-fatter" effect found in Charge-Coupled Devices. We propose a model in which this effect could be understood as shifts in the effective pixel boundaries, and discuss prospects of laboratory measurements to fully characterize this effect.

The source of this structure may be the complex dynamics of the Keplerian shear and the self-gravity of the ring particles. The outcome of these dynamic effects depends sensitively on the collisional and physical properties of the particles. Two mechanisms can emerge that dominate the macroscopic physical structure of the ring: self-gravity wakes and viscous overstability. Here we study the interplay between these two mechanisms by using our recently developed particle collision method that allows us to better model the inter-particle contact physics. We find that for a constant ring surface density and particle internal density, particles with rough surfaces tend to produce axisymmetric ring features associated with the viscous overstability, while particles with smoother surfaces produce self-gravity wakes.

Validation of SMAP soil moisture for the SMAPVEX15 field campaign using a hyper-resolution model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							LAND-SURFACE MODEL; OCEAN SALINITY; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEM; SENSOR	Accurate global mapping of soil moisture is the goal of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, which is expected to improve the estimation of water, energy, and carbon exchanges between the land and the atmosphere. Like other satellite products, the SMAP soil moisture retrievals need to be validated, with the validation relying heavily on in situ measurements. However, a one-to-one comparison is ill advised due to the spatial mismatch of the large SMAP footprint (similar to 40 km) and the point scale in situ measurements. This study uses a recently developed hyper-resolution land surface model-HydroBlocks-as a tool to upscale in situ soil moisture measurements for the SMAPVEX15 (SMAP Validation Experiment 2015) field campaign during 2-18 August 2015. Calibrated against in situ observation, HydroBlocks shows a satisfactory Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.817 and RMSE of 0.019 m(3)/m(3) for the calibration period. These results indicate that HydroBlocks can be used to upscale in situ measurements for this site. Different from previous studies, here in situ measurements are upscaled using a land surface model without bias correction. The upscaled soil moisture is then used to evaluate SMAP (passive) soil moisture products. The comparison of the upscaled network to SMAP shows that the retrievals are generally able to capture the areal-averaged soil moisture temporal variations. However, SMAP appears to be oversensitive to summer precipitation. We expect these findings can be used to improve the SMAP soil moisture product and thus facilitate its usage in studying the water, energy, and carbon cycles.

J	Takahashi, H; Suzuki, K; Stephens, G				Takahashi, Hanii; Suzuki, Kentaroh; Stephens, Graeme			Land-ocean differences in the warm-rain formation process in satellite and ground-based observations and model simulations	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						the warm-rain process; drizzle; vertical velocity; the A-Train observations; Atmospheric Radiation Measurement; a one-dimensional model	DROPLET SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; CLOUD MICROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; VERTICAL VELOCITY STATISTICS; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; EFFECTIVE RADIUS; PART II; GROWTH; CONDENSATION; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION	A previous study explored land-ocean differences in the warm-rain formation process. In that study, aerosol effects were removed, or at least partially removed, but some land-ocean differences remained. Therefore, the study hypothesized that the land-ocean difference in the microphysical structure of warm clouds and in the formation of warm rain can be explained by differences in the nature of updraughts. To test this hypothesis, this study provides a detailed analysis of the land-ocean differences in warm clouds using a combination of CloudSat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, ground-based measurements obtained from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM), as well as a simple model framework. Our results show that a stronger updraught increases the height at which significant coalescence begins, and also prolongs the lifetime of falling drops promoting larger droplet growth. A consequence of this difference is that drizzle is less frequently observed at cloud base over land. Our results point to the critical role of the strength of the convective updraught in the warm-rain formation process.

Scattered GPS L2 signals (1227.6 MHz) were collected by the SMAP's dual-polarization (Horizontal H and Vertical V) radar receiver and then processed on-ground using a known replica of the GPS L2C code. The scattering properties over land are evaluated using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the Polarimetric Ratio (PR), and the width of the waveforms' trailing and leading edges. These parameters show sensitivity to the effects of the Earth's topography and Above Ground Biomass (ABG) even over Amazonian and Boreal forests. These effects are shown to be an important factor in precise soil moisture and biomass determination. Additionally, it is found that PR shows sensitivity to soil moisture content over different land cover types. In particular, the following values of the PR are found over: (a) tropical forests similar to-1.2 dB; (b) boreal forests similar to 0.8 dB; (c) Greenland similar to 2.8 dB; and (d) the Sahara Desert similar to 3.2 dB.

These datasets are too large in size to be processed and calibrated manually as done in the past. Here, we describe a methodology to process the SAR and optical data in a synergistic fashion and automatically calibrate, mosaic, and integrate these data sets together into seamless, ice-sheet-wide, products. We employ this approach to produce annual mosaics of ice motion in Antarctica and Greenland with all available data acquired on a particular year. We find that the precision of a Landsat-8 pair is lower than that of its SAR counterpart, but due to the large number of Landsat-8 acquisitions, combined with the high persistency of optical surface features in the Landsat-8 data, we obtain accurate velocity products from Landsat that integrate well with the SAR-derived velocity products. The resulting pool of remote sensing products is a significant advance for observing changes in ice dynamics over the entire ice sheets and their contribution to sea level. In preparation for the next generation sensors, we discuss the implications of the results for the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR mission (NISAR).

Significant improvements in our understanding of non-Gaussanity beyond Planck require information from large-scale structure. The most promising approach to utilize this information comes from the scale-dependent bias of halos. For local non-Gaussanity, the improvements available are well studied but the potential for non-Gaussianity beyond the local type, including equilateral and quasi-single field inflation, is much less well understood. In this paper, we forecast the capabilities of large- scale structure surveys to detect general non-Gaussianity through galaxy/halo power spectra. We study how non-Gaussanity can be distinguished from a general biasing model and where the information is encoded. For quasi-single field inflation, significant improvements over Planck are possible in some regions of parameter space. We also show that the multi-tracer technique can significantly improve the sensitivity for all non-Gaussianity types, providing up to an order of magnitude improvement for equilateral non-Gaussianity over the single-tracer measurement.

J	Bingham, FM; Lee, T				Bingham, Frederick M.; Lee, Tong			Space and time scales of sea surface salinity and freshwater forcing variability in the global ocean (60 degrees S-60 degrees N)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						salinity	WAVE-NUMBER SPECTRUM; LAYER SALINITY; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MESOSCALE VARIABILITY; OPTIMAL INTERPOLATION; CONVERGENCE ZONE; AQUARIUS; TEMPERATURE; MAXIMUM; CYCLE	Using Aquarius Version-4.0 data, we have investigated the time and space scales of sea surface salinity (SSS) over the global ocean between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. Decorrelation time scales of SSS were found to be divided among less than 80 days (covering 1/2 of ocean area), 80-100 days (1/3), and greater than 100 days (remainder). Once the seasonal cycle is removed, shorter time scales (less than 80 days) dominate. Spatial scales are largest in the tropics along the intertropical convergence zones of all oceans and the South Pacific convergence zone in the South Pacific. Time scales were also calculated for time-integrated (cumulative) surface freshwater forcing (CFWF) using precipitation from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission and evaporation from OAFlux data. These showed little spatial pattern, but a dominance of the seasonal and longer time scales over the globe. The lack of correspondence between dominant temporal and spatial scales of SSS and CFWF highlights the importance of ocean processes in regulating SSS variability. Plain Language Summary Salinity at the surface of the ocean (SSS) is thought to be mostly controlled by evaporation and rainfall. While this may be true at large space and time scales, at shorter scales, SSS variability is in fact strongly related to internal ocean processes such as mixing and wind inputs. In this study, we compare the scales of variability of evaporation and rainfall with those of SSS. In both, the seasonal time scale is dominant, but the patterns of variation are quite different. This lack of correspondence between variation in the two quantities highlights the need for understanding internal ocean dynamics and their impact on SSS.

Outflows, infall and evolution of a sample of embedded low-mass protostars The William Herschel Line Legacy (WILL) survey	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: formation; stars: protostars; ISM: jets and outflows; surveys	STAR-FORMING REGIONS; SPITZER C2D SURVEY; YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; PERSEUS MOLECULAR CLOUD; IN-ORBIT PERFORMANCE; FAR-INFRARED LINES; NEARBY DENSE CORES; GOULD BELT; INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS; UNBIASED SUBMILLIMETER	Context. Herschel observations of water and highly excited CO (J > 9) have allowed the physical and chemical conditions in the more active parts of protostellar outflows to be quantified in detail for the first time. However, to date, the studied samples of Class 0/I protostars in nearby star-forming regions have been selected from bright, well-known sources and have not been large enough for statistically significant trends to be firmly established. Aims. We aim to explore the relationships between the outflow, envelope and physical properties of a flux-limited sample of embedded low-mass Class 0/I protostars. Methods. We present spectroscopic observations in H2O, CO and related species with Herschel HIFI and PACS, as well as ground-based follow-up with the JCMT and APEX in CO, HCO+ and isotopologues, of a sample of 49 nearby (d < 500 pc) candidate protostars selected from Spitzer and Herschel photometric surveys of the Gould Belt. This more than doubles the sample of sources observed by the WISH and DIGIT surveys. These data are used to study the outflow and envelope properties of these sources. We also compile their continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the near-IR to mm wavelengths in order to constrain their physical properties (e.g. L-bol, T-bol and M-env). Results. Water emission is dominated by shocks associated with the outflow, rather than the cooler, slower entrained outflowing gas probed by ground-based CO observations. These shocks become less energetic as sources evolve from Class 0 to Class I. Outflow force, measured from low-J CO, also decreases with source evolutionary stage, while the fraction of mass in the outflow relative to the total envelope (i.e. M-out/M-env) remains broadly constant between Class 0 and I. The median value of similar to 1% is consistent with a core to star formation efficiency on the order of 50% and an outflow duty cycle on the order of 5%. Entrainment efficiency, as probed by F-CO/M-acc, is alsO Invariant with source properties and evolutionary stage. The median value implies a velocity at the wind launching radius of 6.3 km s(-1), which in turn suggests an entrainment efficiency of between 30 and 60% if the wind is launched at similar to 1 AU, or close to 100% if launched further out. L[O I] is strongly correlated with L-bol but not with M-env, in contrast to low-J CO, which is more closely correlated with the latter than the former. This suggests that [O I] traces the present-day accretion activity of the source while CO traces time-averaged accretion over the dynamical timescale of the outflow. H2O Is more strongly correlated with M-env than L-bol, but the difference is smaller than low-J CO, consistent with water emission primarily tracing actively shocked material between the wind, traced by [O I], and the entrained molecular outflow, traced by low-J CO. L[O I] does not vary from Class 0 to Class I, unlike CO and H2O. This is likely due to the ratio of atomic to molecular gas in the wind increasing as the source evolves, balancing out the decrease in mass accretion rate. Infall signatures are detected in HCO+ and H2O In a few sources, but still remain surprisingly illusive in single-dish observations.	[Mottram, J. C.; van Dishoeck, E. F.; Jose-Garcia, I.

Multivariate statistical analysis of OSIRIS/Rosetta spectrophotometric data of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; methods: data analysis; techniques: photometric	OSIRIS; NUCLEUS; VIRTIS; SHAPE	Context. The ESA Rosetta mission explored comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014 2016, following its target before and after the perihelion passage on 13 August 2015. The NAC camera of the OSIRIS imaging system allowed to map the nucleus surface acquiring images with different filters in the visible wavelength range. Aims. Here we study the spectrophotometric behaviour of the nucleus by a multivariate statistical analysis, aiming to distinguish homogeneous groups and to constrain the bulk composition. Methods. We applied the G-mode clustering algorithm to 16 OSIRIS data cubes acquired on 5 6 August 2014 (mostly covering the northern hemisphere) and 2 May 2015 (mostly covering the southern hemisphere), selected to have complete coverage of the comet's surface with similar observing conditions. Results. We found four similar homogeneous groups for each of the analysed cubes. The first group corresponds to the average spectrophotometric behaviour of the nucleus. The second (spectrally redder) and the third (spectrally bluer) groups are found in regions that were already found to deviate from the average terrain of the comet by previous studies. A fourth group (characterised by enhancements of the flux at 700 750 nm and 989 nm, possibly due to H2O+ and /or NH2 emissions) seems connected with the cometary activity rather than with the bulk composition. Conclusions. While our aim in this work was to study the spectrophotometric behaviour of the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as a whole, we found that a follow-up application of the G-mode to smaller regions of the surface could be useful in particular to identify and study the temporal evolution of ice patches, as well as to constrain the composition and physical processes behind the emission of dust jets.

The distribution of oscillation frequency of magnetic field and plasma parameters in BBFs: THEMIS statistics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							BURSTY BULK FLOWS; HIGH-SPEED FLOWS; SUBSTORM ONSET; PI2 PULSATIONS; BRAKING; RECONNECTION; MAGNETOTAIL; MECHANISM; CLUSTER; WAVES	Bursty bulk flows (BBFs) have been correlated with Pi2 pulsations and damping oscillations of plasma velocity in many investigations. But the oscillation time scales in BBFs are still an open question. The purpose of this study is to statistically study the oscillated frequency distribution of magnetic field and plasma parameters inside BBFs. The data are obtained by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) probes during the period of 2008 to 2011. For 424 selected BBF events, we use the wavelet spectrum analysis to select the main, second, and third period components of the magnetic field and plasma parameters according to their largest, second, and third largest values of the wavelet power spectral density, respectively. The power spectra show repeated information in the form of multiple peaks or oscillations. The quasi-Gaussian distribution is a good model for the occurrences of the main and secondary periods. The most probable main periods of the magnetic field and plasma parameters are between 143 s and 160 s, which are located in the frequency band of Pi2 and Pi3 pulsations. The second and third period ranges from 63 s to 70 s and from 34 s to 37 s, respectively. Main periods of these parameters change little with the radial distance. We conclude that periods of these parameters are formed at the beginning of BBF history. Although the distribution model cannot give the dynamic processes, it identifies the intrinsic frequencies in oscillations of magnetic field and ion velocity inside of BBFs.	[Wu, Qi; Du, A.

Development of a near-infrared balloon-borne camera for dayside and sunlit auroral observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS; EMISSION; PRECIPITATION; IONOSPHERE; SCATTER; PROTON; SHOCK	Imaging aurora in daylight is a difficult and challenging task. The brightness of the sunlit atmosphere overwhelms the auroral emissions at visible wavelengths. Modeling of atmospheric brightness suggests that the contrast between auroral brightness and sky brightness makes it possible to image the aurora at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths from sufficient altitudes. Preliminary experiments confirmed that the auroral N-2(+) Meinel emissions at about 1100nm are bright enough to be extracted from atmospheric background brightness during daylight at about 40km of a balloon altitude, which lead to the development of a high-performance NIR InGaAs camera that can be flown on a high-altitude and long-duration balloon. Auroral observations from such a platform are highly accommodated to current space missions (such as Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms/Acceleration Reconnection Turbulence and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun, Magnetospheric Multiscale, Cluster, Geotail, and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) and many ground-based measurements and will enhance the science return significantly.

This newly invented hybrid structure demonstrates better tradeoffs between insertion loss and isolation compared to conventional distributed structures. The performance benefits are analyzed in detail and validated by both simulation and measurement results. Additionally, the chip area is conserved by using lump elements, the coupled inductor. Moreover, a specific bias scheme is used to further decrease insertion loss by about 0.5 dB. This SPST switch achieves higher than 35-dB isolation over an ultrawide frequency range, from 54 to 84 GHz, a minimum 1.7-dB insertion loss, and < -10-dB reflection coefficient with 0.012-mm(2) chip area in 65-nm CMOS. The design achieves more than 10-dB enhancement of isolation in comparison with the state-of-the-arts while maintaining similar insertion loss.

The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) was applied to the MRB with more than 1.2 million river reaches for a 10-year study (2005-2014). Runoff data from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was used as input to RAPID. This article investigates the effect of topography on RAPID performance, the differences between the VIC-RAPID streamflow simulations in the HUC-2 regions of the MRB, and the impact of major dams on the streamflow simulations. The model performance improved when initial parameter values, especially the Muskingum K parameter, were estimated by taking topography into account. The statistical summary indicates the RAPID model performs better in the Ohio and Tennessee Regions and the Upper and Lower Mississippi River Regions in comparison to the western part of the MRB, due to the better performance of the VIC model. The model accuracy also increases when lakes and reservoirs are considered in the modeling framework. In general, results show the VIC-RAPID streamflow simulation is satisfactory at the continental scale of the MRB.

A gradient of nutrient enrichment reveals nonlinear impacts of fertilization on Arctic plant diversity and ecosystem function	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Arctic; climate change; ecosystem function; ecosystem respiration; gross primary productivity; net ecosystem CO2 exchange; plant diversity	LONG-TERM NUTRIENT; WET SEDGE; CO2 FLUX; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; CARBON-CYCLE; TUNDRA; RESPONSES	Rapid environmental change at high latitudes is predicted to greatly alter the diversity, structure, and function of plant communities, resulting in changes in the pools and fluxes of nutrients. In Arctic tundra, increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability accompanying warming is known to impact plant diversity and ecosystem function; however, to date, most studies examining Arctic nutrient enrichment focus on the impact of relatively large (> 25x estimated naturally occurring N enrichment) doses of nutrients on plant community composition and net primary productivity. To understand the impacts of Arctic nutrient enrichment, we examined plant community composition and the capacity for ecosystem function (net ecosystem exchange, ecosystem respiration, and gross primary production) across a gradient of experimental N and P addition expected to more closely approximate warming-induced fertilization. In addition, we compared our measured ecosystem CO2 flux data to a widely used Arctic ecosystem exchange model to investigate the ability to predict the capacity for CO2 exchange with nutrient addition. We observed declines in abundance-weighted plant diversity at low levels of nutrient enrichment, but species richness and the capacity for ecosystem carbon uptake did not change until the highest level of fertilization. When we compared our measured data to the model, we found that the model explained roughly 30%-50% of the variance in the observed data, depending on the flux variable, and the relationship weakened at high levels of enrichment. Our results suggest that while a relatively small amount of nutrient enrichment impacts plant diversity, only relatively large levels of fertilization-over an order of magnitude or more than warming-induced rates-significantly alter the capacity for tundra CO2 exchange. Overall, our findings highlight the value of measuring and modeling the impacts of a nutrient enrichment gradient, as warming-related nutrient availability may impact ecosystems differently than single-level fertilization experiments.

J	Sala, F; Schoeny, C; Kabir, S; Divsalar, D; Dolecek, L				Sala, Frederic; Schoeny, Clayton; Kabir, Shahroze; Divsalar, Dariush; Dolecek, Lara			On Nonuniform Noisy Decoding for LDPC Codes With Application to Radiation-Induced Errors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						LDPC codes; radiation effects; noisy decoding; density evolution	DEPENDENT GATE FAILURES; PARITY-CHECK CODES; GALLAGER B DECODER; DENSITY EVOLUTION; FLASH MEMORIES; SOFT ERRORS; HARDWARE; DESIGN	Recent studies on noisy decoding for LDPC codes rely on the assumption that the noise in each component is independent and perpetual. This paper examines a noisy decoding model that generalizes this approach: the noise is due to multi-state channels, where the channel states are governed by queue-like processes. This model is inspired by errors in decoders that are due to the high levels of radiation. This is an important problem, as modern non-volatile memories (NVMs) must perform well in high-radiation environments if they are to be used for deep space applications. High levels of radiation have a significant impact on floating gate-based NVMs, such as flash, and therefore, require well-tuned, powerful error-correcting codes for reliable data storage along with the decoders capable of handling radiation-induced noisy components. We introduce a noisy LDPC decoding model subsuming certain previously studied models. This model is better suited to represent transient errors-in both variable nodes and check nodes-and allows for a more refined analysis compared with older, coarser models. We perform a density evolution-like theoretical evaluation, applicable to both regular and irregular codes, optimize the voting threshold for a Gallager B/E-decoder, and analyze the resulting evaluation. We also examine the finite block length case.

MERRA-2 assimilates partial column ozone retrievals from a series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV) instruments on NASA and NOAA spacecraft between January 1980 and September 2004: starting in October 2004, retrieved ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's EOS Aura satellite are assimilated. The MERRA-2 ozone is compared with independent satellite and ozonesonde data, focusing on the representation of the spatial and temporal variability of stratospheric and upper-tropospheric ozone and on implications of the change in the observing system from SBUV to EOS Aura. The comparisons show agreement within 10% (standard deviation of the difference) between MERRA-2 profiles and independent satellite data in most of the stratosphere. The agreement improves after 2004, when EOS Aura data are assimilated. The standard deviation of the differences between the lower-stratospheric and upper-tropospheric MERRA-2 ozone and ozonesondes is 11.2% and 24.5%, respectively, with correlations of 0.8 and above, indicative of a realistic representation of the near-tropopause ozone variability in MERRA-2. The agreement improves significantly in the EOS Aura period; however, MERRA-2 is biased low in the upper troposphere with respect to the ozonesondes. Caution is recommended when using MERRA-2 ozone for decadal changes and trend studies.

Thermal Pressure in Diffuse H-2 Gas Measured by Herschel [C II] Emission and FUSE UV H-2 Absorption	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: structure; local interstellar matter	GALACTIC PLANE SURVEY; WARM IONIZED MEDIUM; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; COLLISIONAL EXCITATION; CARBON ABUNDANCES; LINE OBSERVATIONS; SIGHT LINES; RING SURVEY; H-I	UV absorption studies with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite have made important observations of H2 molecular gas in Galactic interstellar translucent and diffuse clouds. Observations of the 158 mu m[C II] fine-structure line with Herschel trace the same H-2 molecular gas in emission. We present [C II] observations along 27 lines of sight (LOSs) toward target stars of which 25 have FUSE H-2 UV absorption. Two stars have only HST STIS C II lambda 2325 absorption data. We detect [C II] 158 mu m emission features in all but one target LOS. For three target LOSs that are close to the Galactic plane, vertical bar b vertical bar < 1 degrees, we also present position-velocity maps of [C II] emission observed by Herschel Heterodyne Instrument in the Far Infrared (HIFI) in on-the-fly spectral-line mapping. We use the velocity-resolved [C II] spectra observed by the HIFI instrument toward the target LOSs observed by FUSE to identify [C II] velocity components associated with the H-2 clouds. We analyze the observed velocity integrated [C II] spectral-line intensities in terms of the densities and thermal pressures in the H-2 gas using the H-2 column densities and temperatures measured by the UV absorption data. We present the H-2 gas densities and thermal pressures for 26 target LOSs and from the [C II] intensities derive a mean thermal pressure in the range of similar to 6100-7700K cm(-3) in diffuse H-2 clouds. We discuss the thermal pressures and densities toward 14 targets, comparing them to results obtained using the UV absorption data for two other tracers C I and CO. Our results demonstrate the richness of the far-IR [C II] spectral data which is a valuable complement to the UV H-2 absorption data for studying diffuse H-2 molecular clouds. While the UV absorption is restricted to the directions of the target star, far-IR [C II] line emission offers an opportunity to employ velocity-resolved spectral-line mapping capability to study in detail the clouds' spatial and velocity structures.

Two features of the turn maneuvers are extracted after analysis of the observed differences: (1) The noon-turns reverse yaw direction when the beta angle falls between [-0.7A degrees, 0A degrees]; (2) midnight-turns always take the direction that completes < 180A degrees of total yaw. We present the approach implemented to account for the discrepancies between the observed and modeled yaw attitudes. In particular, an empirical beta angle bias is applied in the noon-turn model to correct the yaw direction error, and a short-route constraint is applied in the midnight-turn model for more robust performance.

A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations allows us to determine corrective factors for the secular frequency and forced eccentricity in the coplanar restricted three-body problem. The correction is given in the form of a polynomial function of the system's parameters that can be applied to first-order forced eccentricity and secular frequency estimates. The resulting secular equations are simple, straight forward to use,. and improve the fidelity of Heppenheimers solution well beyond higher-order models. The quality and convergence of the corrected secular equations are tested for a wide range of parameters and limits of its applicability are given.

The Orbits of Jupiter's Irregular Satellites	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ephemerides; planets and satellites: general; planets and satellites: individual (Jupiter)	OUTER JOVIAN SATELLITES; CAPTURE; PLANETS; PERTURBATIONS; INCLINATION; DISCOVERY; EVOLUTION; ASTEROIDS	We report on the improved ephemerides for the irregular Jovian satellites. We used a combination of numerically integrated equations of motion and a weighted least-squares algorithm to fit the astrometric measurements. The orbital fits for 59 satellites are summarized in terms of state vectors, post-fit residuals, and mean orbital elements. The current data set appears to be sensitive to the mass of Himalia, which is constrained to the range of GM = 0.13-0.28 km(3) s(-2). Here, GM is the product of the Newtonian constant of gravitation, G and the body's mass, M. Our analysis of the orbital uncertainties indicates that 11 out of 59 satellites are lost owing to short data arcs. The lost satellites hold provisional International Astronomical Union (IAU) designations and will likely need to be rediscovered.

The Greater Taurus-Auriga Ecosystem. I. There is a Distributed Older Population	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						open clusters and associations: individual (Taurus Auriga); stars: formation; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: protostars	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; LOW-MASS STARS; X-RAY SOURCES; BROWN DWARFS; UPPER SCORPIUS; YOUNG STARS; SUBSTELLAR COMPANIONS; OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION	The census of Taurus-Auriga has been assembled over seven decades and inherited the biases and incompleteness of the input studies. The unusual shape of its inferred initial mass function (IMF) and the existence of isolated disk-bearing stars suggest that additional (likely disk-free) members remain to be discovered. We therefore have begun a global reassessment of the census of Taurus-Auriga that exploits new data and better definitions of youth and kinematic membership. As a first step, we reconsider the membership of all disk-free candidate members from the literature with spectral type >= F0, 3(h)50(m)< alpha < 5(h)40(m), and 14 degrees < delta < 34 degrees.We combine data from the literature with Keck/HIRES and UH88/SNIFS spectra to test the membership of these candidates using the positions in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, proper motions, radial velocities, Ha, lithium, and surface gravity. We find 218 confirmed or likely Taurus members, 160 confirmed or likely interlopers, and only 18 that lack sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. A significant fraction of these stars (81/218 = 37%) are not included in the most recent canonical member lists. There are few additional members to the immediate vicinity of the molecular clouds, preserving the IMFs that have been deemed anomalous in past work. Many of the likely Taurus members are instead distributed broadly across the search area. When combined with the known disk hosts, our updated census reveals two regimes: a high-density population with a high disk fraction (indicative of youth) that broadly traces the molecular clouds, and a low-density population with low disk fraction (hence likely older) that most likely represents previous generations of star formation.

First Detection of Mid-infrared Variability from an Ultraluminous X-Ray Source Holmberg II X-1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						black hole physics; circumstellar matter; infrared: ISM; ISM: individual objects (Holmberg II X-1)	NEAR-INFRARED COUNTERPARTS; SPITZER-SPACE-TELESCOPE; IGR J16318-4848; XMM-NEWTON; GX 301-2; STAR; EMISSION; DUST; GALAXIES; CHANDRA	We present mid-infrared (IR) light curves of the Ultraluminous X-ray Source (ULX) Holmberg II X-1 from observations taken between 2014 January 13 and 2017 January 5 with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 3.6 and 4.5 mu m in the Spitzer Infrared Intensive Transients Survey. The mid-IR light curves, which reveal the first detection of mid-IR variability from a ULX, is determined to arise primarily from dust emission rather than from a jet or an accretion disk outflow. We derived the evolution of the dust temperature (T-d similar to 600-800 K), IR luminosity (L-IR similar to 3 x 10(4) L-circle dot), mass (M-d similar to 1-3 x 10(-6) M-circle dot), and equilibrium temperature radius (R-eq similar to 10-20 au). A comparison of X-1 with a sample of spectroscopically identified massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud on a mid-IR color-magnitude diagram suggests that the mass donor in X-1 is a supergiant (sg) B[e]-star. The sgB[e]interpretation is consistent with the derived dust properties and the presence of the [Fe II] (lambda = 1.644 mm) emission line revealed from previous near-IR studies of X-1. We attribute the mid-IR variability of X-1 to the increased heating of dust located in a circumbinary torus. It is unclear what physical processes are responsible for the increased dust heating; however, it does not appear to be associated with the X-ray flux from the ULX, given the constant X-ray luminosities provided by serendipitous, near-contemporaneous X-ray observations around the first mid-IR variability event in 2014. Our results highlight the importance of mid-IR observations of luminous X-ray sources traditionally studied at X-ray and radio wavelengths.	[Lau, R.

The NuSTAR Hard X-Ray Survey of the Norma Arm Region	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						binaries: general; Galaxy: disk; novae, cataclysmic variables; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: stars	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SOFT GAMMA REPEATER; CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES; V404 CYGNI; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS; INTERMEDIATE POLARS; TIMING EVOLUTION; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; IGR J16393-4643	We present a catalog of hard X-ray sources in a square-degree region surveyed by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) in the direction of the Norma spiral arm. This survey has a total exposure time of 1.7 Ms, and the typical and maximum exposure depths are 50 ks and 1 Ms, respectively. In the area of deepest coverage, sensitivity limits of 5 x 10(-14) and 4 x 10(-14) erg s(-1) cm(-2) in the 3-10 and 10-20. keV bands, respectively, are reached. Tweny-eight sources are firmly detected, and 10 are detected with low significance; 8 of the 38 sources are expected to be active galactic nuclei. The three brightest sources were previously identified as a low-mass X-ray binary, high-mass X-ray binary, and pulsar wind nebula. Based on their X-ray properties and multiwavelength counterparts, we identify the likely nature of the other sources as two colliding wind binaries, three pulsar wind nebulae, a black hole binary, and a plurality of cataclysmic variables (CVs). The CV candidates in the Norma region have plasma temperatures of similar to 10-20. keV, consistent with the Galactic ridge X-ray emission spectrum but lower than the temperatures of CVs near the Galactic center. This temperature difference may indicate that the Norma region has a lower fraction of intermediate polars relative to other types of CVs compared to the Galactic center. The NuSTAR logN-logS distribution in the 10-20. keV band is consistent with the distribution measured by Chandra at 2-10. keV if the average source spectrum is assumed to be a thermal model with kT. (C) 15 keV, as observed for the CV candidates.

Despite the development of lightweight and high-speed laser scanners, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still heavy burdens for widespread use of laser scanning. To solve these problems, a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots has been proposed. This system, named CPS-SLAM, consists of a parent robot with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers. A large-scale 3D model is acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on the parent robot from several positions determined precisely by a localization technique, named the Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), that uses multiple robots. Therefore, this system can build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP. In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a very precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops. This paper proposes an automatic planning technique for a laser measurement by using CPS-SLAM. Planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure makes it possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment. The proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling. We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

All previous mission encounters with a comet have provided a snapshot of the cometary activity at a given heliocentric distance. In contrast, Rosetta has escorted the comet nucleus for an extended period (> 2 years) at a large range of cometo-centric and heliocentric distances, which has provided exceptional and unprecedented observing conditions to study, analyse and monitor 67 P during its passage to, through and away from perihelion. One of the biggest challenges of this mission is the development of an observation plan that adequately addresses the mission's science objectives while coping with a largely unknown and continuously evolving environment that constantly modifies the planning constraints. The Rosetta Science Ground Segment (RSGS), in support of the Project Scientist and the Science Working Team, is in charge of translating the high level mission science objectives into a low level pointing and operations plan. We present here the high-level science planning process adopted during the comet escort phase. We describe the main science objectives addressed along the mission lifetime, the different groups involved in the science planning, and the approach followed to translate those requirements into a viable and scientifically valid operations plan. Finally, we describe how the science planning scheme has evolved since arrival at the comet to react to the unexpected environment, largely reducing the planning lead times.

Relationships between sucretolerance and salinotolerance in bacteria from hypersaline environments and their implications for the exploration of Mars and the icy worlds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						extreme environments; salinity tolerance; sucrose; sugar tolerance	GREAT SALT PLAINS; WATER ACTIVITY; MICROBIAL STABILITY; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; GROWTH; SURFACE; LIFE; MINERALS; DYNAMICS; OKLAHOMA	The most extremely osmotolerant microbial isolates are fungi from high-sugar environments that tolerate the lowest water activity (0.61) for growth yet reported. Studies of osmotolerant bacteria have focused on halotolerance rather than sucretolerance (ability to grow in high sugar concentrations). A collection of salinotolerant (>= 10% NaCl or >= 50% MgSO4) bacterial isolates from the Great Salt Plains of Oklahoma and Hot Lake in Washington were screened for sucretolerance in medium supplemented with >= 50% fructose, glucose or sucrose. Tolerances significantly differed between solutes, even though water activities for saline media (0.92 and 0.85 for 10 and 20% NaCl Salt Plains media, respectively) were comparable or lower than water activities for high-sugar media (0.93 and 0.90 for 50 and 70% sucrose artificial nectar media, respectively). These specific solute effects were differentially expressed among individual isolates. Extrapolating the results of earlier food science studies with yeasts at high sugar concentrations to bacteria in salty environments with low water activity should be done with caution. Furthermore, the discussion of habitable Special Regions on Mars and the icy worlds should reflect an understanding of specific solute effects.

Electrification of sand on Titan and its influence on sediment transport	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							IDENTICAL INSULATORS; DUNE ORIENTATION; CASSINI RADAR; LINEAR DUNES; LANDING SITE; TRIBOELECTRIFICATION; VIMS; AGGREGATION; ATMOSPHERE; PARTICLES	Triboelectric, or frictional, charging is a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomenon in granular flows. Recognized in terrestrial volcanic plumes and sand storms, such electrification mechanisms are possibly present on Titan. There, dunes and plains of low-density organic particles blanket extensive regions of the surface. Unlike Earth, Titan hosts granular reservoirs whose physical and chemical properties possibly enhance the effets of charging on particle motion. Here we demonstrate in laboratory tumbler experiments under atmospheric conditions and using organic materials analogous to Titan that Titan sands can readily charge triboelectrically. We suggest that the resulting electrostatic forces are strong enough to promote aggregation of granular materials and affect sediment transport on Titan. Indeed, our experiments show that electrostatic forces may increase the saltation threshold for grains by up to an order of magnitude. Efficient electrification may explain puzzling observations on Titan such as the mismatch between dune orientations and inferred wind fields. We conclude that, unlike other Solar System bodies, nanometre-scale electrostatic processes may shape the geomorphological features of Titan across the moon's surface.	[Harper, J. S.

How the martian residual south polar cap develops quasi-circular and heart-shaped pits, troughs, and moats	ICARUS			English	Article							SUBLIMATION-DRIVEN ACTIVITY; CO2 ICE; HIRISE OBSERVATIONS; MARS; STRATIGRAPHY; CONSTRAINTS; DEPOSITION; EVOLUTION; EROSION; MODELS	The martian Residual South Polar Cap (RSPC) is a 1-10 m thick deposit of permanent CO2 ice perched on the much larger H2O ice cap. The CO2 ice is dissected into mesas by erosional landforms that can be broadly classified as (i) quasi-circular pits, (ii) heart-shaped pits, (iii) linear troughs, and (iv) moats. We use HiRISE (25-50 cm/px) images taken at a cadence of days to months to track meter-scale changes in the RSPC in order to investigate the mechanisms that lead to the development of these four distinct morphologies. For the first time, we report the development of dark fans on the sides of the CO2 mesas and the fracturing and deterioration of the initially smooth upper surface of CO2 mesas. We interpret these features as indicating the sublimation and subsequent escape of CO2 from the interiors of mesas, which undermines structural support of mesa tops, causing them to collapse. The collapse of mesa tops, along with uneven deposition of CO2 ice, creates steep scarps that erode during the summer due to preferential sunlight absorption. During the winter, CO2 deposition acts to smooth topography, creating gently sloping ramps. We propose that the interplay between the steep scarps and gentle slopes leads to either quasi-circular pits, heart-shaped pits, linear troughs, or moats, depending on local conditions.

We observed 2007 PA8 on sixteen days with Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) and on five days with the 0.6 m telescope at Table Mountain Observatory. Closest approach was on November 5 at a distance of 0.043 au. Images obtained with Goldstone's new chirp system achieved range resolutions as fine as 3.75 m, placing thousands of pixels on the asteroid's surface, and revealing that 2007 PA8 is an elongated, asymmetric object. Surface features include angularities, facets, and a concavity approximately 400 m in diameter. We used the Shape software to estimate the asteroid's 3D shape and spin state. 2007 PA8 has a broad, rounded end and a tapered, angular end with sharp-crested ridges. The asteroid's effective diameter is 1.35 +/- 0.07 km, which in combination with the absolute magnitude of 16.30 +/- 0.52 gives an optical albedo of pv = 0.29 +/- 0.14. The shape modeling of the radar data revealed that 2007 PA8 is a non-principal axis (NPA) rotator in the short-axis mode with an average period of precession by the long axis around the angular momentum vector of 4.26 +/- 0.02 days and an oscillatory period around the long axis of 20.55 +/- 3.75 days. The amplitude of rolling around the long axis is 42 +/- 7 degrees. The angular momentum vector points toward ecliptic longitude and latitude of 273.6 +/- 10 degrees, +16.9 +/- 5 degrees. 2007 PA8 is only the second confirmed short-axis mode NPA rotator known in the near-Earth asteroid population after (99942) Apophis (Pravec et al., 2014). 2007 PA8 has a geopotential high at the equator, where the equator is defined as the plane that contains the long and intermediate axis. This geopotential extreme could be interpreted as a large, hidden surface depression, or as evidence that 2007 PA8 is a multi-component body. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Additive manufacturing of a functionally graded material from Ti-6Al-4V to Invar: Experimental characterization and thermodynamic calculations	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Functionally graded material; Thermodynamic modeling; Laser deposition; Microstructure	304L STAINLESS-STEEL; THERMAL-EXPANSION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FABRICATION; COMPOSITES; TITANIUM; BEHAVIOR; METALS	In functionally graded materials (FGMs), the elemental composition, or structure, within a component varies gradually as a function of position, allowing for the gradual transition from one alloy to another, and the local tailoring of properties. One method for fabricating FGMs with varying elemental composition is through layer-by-layer directed energy deposition additive manufacturing. This work combines experimental characterization and computational analysis to investigate a material graded from Ti-6Al-4V to Invar 36 (64 wt% Fe, 36 wt% Ni). The microstructure, composition, phases, and microhardness were determined as a function of position within the FGM. During the fabrication process, detrimental phases associated with the compositional blending of the Ti-6Al-4V and Invar formed, leading to cracking in the final deposited part. Intermetallic phases (FeTi, Fe2Ti, Ni3Ti, and NiTi2) were experimentally identified to occur throughout the gradient region, and were considered as the reason that the FGM cracked during fabrication. CALPHAD (CALculation of PHase Diagrams) thermodynamic calculations were used concurrently to predict phases that would form during the manufacturing process and were compared to the experimental results. The experimental-computational approach described herein for characterizing FGMs can be used to improve the understanding and design of other FGMs. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Pictoris. We compare the spectrum obtained with currently published model grids and with known substellar objects and present the best matching models as well as the best matching observed objects. Comparing the empirical measurement of the bolometric luminosity to evolutionary models, we find a mass of 12.9. +/- 0.2. M-Jup, an effective temperature of 1724. +/- 15 K, a radius of 1.46. +/- 0.01. R-Jup, and a surface gravity of log g = 4.18. 0.01 [dex] (cgs). The stated uncertainties are statistical errors only, and do not incorporate any uncertainty on the evolutionary models. Using atmospheric models, we find an effective temperature of 1700-1800 K and a surface gravity of log g = 3.5-4.0 [dex] depending upon the model. These values agree well with other publications and with "hot-start" predictions from planetary evolution models. Further, we find that the spectrum of beta Pic. b best matches a low surface gravity L2. +/- 1 brown dwarf. Finally, comparing the spectrum to field brown dwarfs, we find the the spectrum best matches 2MASS J04062677- 381210 and 2MASS J03552337 + 1133437.

Integral Field Spectroscopy of the Low-mass Companion HD 984 B with the Gemini Planet Imager	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; stars: individual (HD 984)	VERY-LOW MASS; SUBSTELLAR CANDIDATE MEMBERS; FINDING CAMPAIGN DISCOVERY; EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; 1ST LIGHT; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; SPEX SPECTROSCOPY; SPECKLE NOISE; T-DWARFS	We present new observations of the low-mass companion to HD 984 taken with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) as a part of the GPI Exoplanet Survey campaign. Images of HD 984 B were obtained in the J (1.12-1.3 mu m) and H (1.50-1.80 mu m) bands. Combined with archival epochs from 2012 and 2014, we fit the first orbit to the companion to find an 18 au (70-year) orbit with a 68% confidence interval between 14 and 28 au, an eccentricity of 0.18 with a 68% confidence interval between 0.05 and 0.47, and an inclination of 119 degrees with a 68% confidence interval between 114 degrees and 125 degrees. To address the considerable spectral covariance in both spectra, we present a method of splitting the spectra into low and high frequencies to analyze the spectral structure at different spatial frequencies with the proper spectral noise correlation. Using the split spectra, we compare them to known spectral types using field brown dwarf and low-mass star spectra and find a best-fit match of a field gravity M6.5 +/- 1.5 spectral type with a corresponding temperature of 2730(-180)(+120)K. Photometry of the companion yields a luminosity of log(L-bol/L-circle dot) = -2.88 +/- 0.07 dex with DUSTY models. Mass estimates, again from DUSTY models, find an age-dependent mass of 34 +/- 1 to 95 +/- 4 M-Jup. These results are consistent with previous measurements of the object.

Utilizing the back catalog with new photometric surveys to maximum efficiency requires modeling the color selection bias imposed on the. selection of target galaxies by flux limits at multiple wavelengths. The likelihood derived herein can address, in principle, all possible color selection biases through the use of a generalization of the LF, Phi(L), over the space of all spectra: the spectro-luminosity functional, psi[L-nu]. It is, therefore, the first estimator capable of simultaneously analyzing multiple redshift surveys in a consistent way. We also propose a new way of parametrizing the evolution of the classic Schechter function parameters, L-* and phi(*), that improves both the physical realism and statistical performance of the model. The techniques derived in this paper are used in a companion paper by. Lake et al. to measure the LF of galaxies at the rest-frame wavelength of 2.4 mu m using the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).	[Lake, S. E.; Wright, E.

The Scientific Potential of Current and Next-generation Large Ground and Space Telescopes	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; instrumentation: spectrographs; planetary systems; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: spectroscopic	CARBON-MONOXIDE; ORBITAL MOTION; 1ST LIGHT; WATER-ABSORPTION; SPECTROSCOPY; CONSTRAINTS; ATMOSPHERES; PLANETS; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; MASS	Direct imaging of exoplanets presents a formidable technical challenge owing to the small angular separation and high contrast between exoplanets and their host stars. High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a pathway to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. Here, we present a framework to simulate HDC observations and data analyses. The goal of these simulations is to perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between raw star light suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the performance of an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing directly imaged gas-giant planets in near-infrared bands. We also simulate HDC observations of an Earth-like planet using next-generation ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We conclude that ground-based ELTs are more suitable for HDC observations of an Earth-like planet than future space-based missions owing to the considerable difference in collecting area. For ground-based telescopes, HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone around an M-dwarf star at 10(-4) star light suppression level. Compared to the 10(-7) planet/star contrast, HDC relaxes the star light suppression requirement by a factor of 10(3). For space-based telescopes, detector noise will be a major limitation at spectral resolutions higher than 10(4). Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise, R = 400 (1600) is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx (LUVOIR). The corresponding star light suppression requirement to detect a planet with planet/star contrast = 6.1 x 10(-11) is relaxed by a factor of 10 (100) for HabEx (LUVOIR).

On-sky performance of the QACITS pointing control technique with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; techniques: high angular resolution; methods: observational	PHASE-MASK CORONAGRAPHS; WAVE-FRONT SENSOR; 1ST LIGHT; EXOPLANETS; PRINCIPLE	Context. A vortex coronagraph is now available for high contrast observations with the Keck/NIRC2 instrument at L band. The vortex coronagraph uses a vortex phase mask in a focal plane and a Lyot stop in a downstream pupil plane to provide high contrast at small angular separations from the observed host star. Aims. Reaching the optimal performance of the coronagraph requires fine control of the wavefront incident on the phase mask. In particular, centering errors can lead to significant stellar light leakage that degrades the contrast performance and prevents the observation of faint planetary companions around the observed stars. It is thus critical to correct for the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center, generally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity field variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil tracking mode. Methods. A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex coronagraph has been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument. This algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center, and stabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. Results. On-sky data show that the QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4 mas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator is probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot stop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5 mas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed. Conclusions. The QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust method to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition, QACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the observing efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used for vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and angular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.

KMTNet Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration; Spitzer Team	OGLE-2015-BLG-1482L: The First Isolated Low-mass Microlens in the Galactic Bulge	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; gravitational lensing: micro; stars: fundamental parameters	SURFACE BRIGHTNESS RELATIONS; BROWN-DWARF COMPANIONS; PARALLAX MEASUREMENT; SPITZER OBSERVATIONS; PLANET PHOTOMETRY; TELESCOPE NETWORK; ANGULAR SIZES; OGLE-III; EVENTS; BINARY	We analyze the single microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 simultaneously observed from two ground-based surveys and from Spitzer. The Spitzer data exhibit finite-source effects that are. due to the passage of the lens close to or directly over. the surface of the source star as seen from Spitzer. Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of the angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax derived from a comparison between the ground-based and the Spitzer light curves. yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax. From this analysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star with a. mass 0.10 +/- 0.02 M-circle dot or a brown dwarf with a. mass 55 +/- 9MJ, which are. located at D-LS = 0.80 +/- 0.19 kpc and D-LS = 0.54 +/- 0.08 kpc, respectively,. where DLS is the distance between the lens and the source, and thus it is the first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the Galactic bulge. The degeneracy between the two solutions is severe ( Delta chi(2) = 0.3). The fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the finite-source effect is seen only in a single data point from Spitzer, and this single data point gives rise to two solutions for rho, the angular size of the source in units of the angular Einstein ring radius. Because the rho degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high-cadence observations around the peak, while the Spitzer cadence is typically similar to 1 day(-1), we expect that events for which the finite-source effect is seen only in the Spitzer data may frequently exhibit this rho degeneracy. For OGLE-2015-BLG-1482, the relative proper motion of the lens and source for the low-mass star is mu(rel) = 9.0 +/- 1.9 mas yr(-1), while for the brown dwarf it is 5.5 +/- 0.5 mas yr(-1). Hence, the degeneracy can be resolved within similar to 10 years from direct-lens imaging by using next-generation instruments with high spatial resolution.

Demonstration of an Active Single-mode Fiber Injection Unit	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: spectrographs; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: spectroscopic	WAVE-FRONT CONTROL; TAU BOOTIS B; CARBON-MONOXIDE; TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY; COUPLING EFFICIENCY; VORTEX CORONAGRAPH; WATER-ABSORPTION; ORBITAL MOTION; 1ST LIGHT; ATMOSPHERE	High-dispersion coronagraphy (HDC) optimally combines high-contrast imaging techniques such as adaptive optics/wavefront control plus coronagraphy to high spectral resolution spectroscopy. HDC is a critical pathway toward fully characterizing exoplanet atmospheres across a broad range of masses from giant gaseous planets down to Earth-like planets. In addition to determining the molecular composition of exoplanet atmospheres, HDC also enables Doppler mapping of atmosphere inhomogeneities (temperature, clouds, wind), as well as precise measurements of exoplanet rotational velocities. Here, we demonstrate an innovative concept for injecting the directly imaged planet light into a single-mode fiber, linking a high-contrast adaptively corrected coronagraph to a high-resolution spectrograph (diffraction-limited or not). Our laboratory demonstration includes three key milestones: close-to-theoretical injection efficiency, accurate pointing and tracking, and on-fiber coherent modulation and speckle nulling of spurious starlight signal coupling into the fiber. Using the extreme modal selectivity of single-mode fibers, we also demonstrated speckle suppression gains that outperform conventional image-based speckle nulling by at least two orders of magnitude.

DES Collaboration	Discovery of the Lensed Quasar System DES J0408-5354	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; quasars: general; surveys	ALL-SKY SURVEY; CANDIDATE SELECTION; CALIBRATION	We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of the quad-like lensed quasar system DES J0408-5354 found in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 (Y1) data. This system was discovered during a search for DES Y1 strong lensing systems using a method that identified candidates as red galaxies with multiple blue neighbors. DES J0408-5354 consists of a central red galaxy surrounded by three bright (i < 20) blue objects and a fourth red object. Subsequent spectroscopic observations using the Gemini South telescope confirmed that the three blue objects are indeed the lensed images of a quasar with redshift z = 2.375, and that the central red object is an early-type lensing galaxy with redshift z = 0.597. DES J0408-5354 is the first quad lensed quasar system to be found in DES and begins to demonstrate the potential of DES to discover and dramatically increase the sample size of these very rare objects.

Enhanced ozone loss by active inorganic bromine chemistry in the tropical troposphere	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						BrO; CIMS; Ozone; Troposphere	IN-SITU; BRO; IMPACT; MODEL; ACID; N2O5; OH	Bromine chemistry, particularly in the tropics, has been suggested to play an important role in tropospheric ozone loss although a lack of measurements of active bromine species impedes a quantitative understanding of its impacts. Recent modelling and measurements of bromine monoxide (BrO) by Wang et al. (2015) have shown current models under predict BrO concentrations over the Pacific Ocean and allude to a missing source of BrO. Here, we present the first simultaneous aircraft measurements of atmospheric bromine monoxide, BrO (a radical that along with atomic Br catalytically destroys ozone) and the inorganic Br precursor compounds HOBr, BrCI and Br-2 over the Western Pacific Ocean from 0.5 to 7 km. The presence of 0.17-1.64 pptv BrO and 3.6-8 pptv total inorganic Br from these four species throughout the troposphere causes 10-20% of total ozone loss, and confirms the importance of bromine chemistry in the tropical troposphere; contributing to a 6 ppb decrease in ozone levels due to halogen chemistry. Observations are compared with a global chemical transport model and find that the observed high levels of BrO, BrCI and HOBr can be reconciled by active multiphase oxidation of halide (Br and Cl-) by HOBr and ozone in cloud droplets and aerosols. Measurements indicate that 99% of the instantaneous free Br in the troposphere up to 8 km originates from inorganic halogen photolysis rather than from photolysis of organobromine species.

Southern Ocean cloud biases are a major determinant of inter-hemispheric albedo biases in many models, including HadGEM2-ES, a fully coupled model with a dynamical ocean. In this study, targeted albedo corrections are applied in the Southern Ocean to explore the dynamical response to artificially reducing these biases. The Southern Hemisphere jet increases in strength in response to the increased tropical-extratropical temperature gradient, with increased energy transport into the mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, but no improvement is observed in the double-ITCZ bias or atmospheric cross-equatorial energy transport, a finding which supports other recent work. The majority of the adjustment in energy transport in the tropics is achieved in the ocean, with the response further limited to the Pacific Ocean. As a result, the frequently argued teleconnection between the Southern Ocean and tropical precipitation biases is muted. Further experiments in which tropical longwave biases are also reduced do not yield improvement in the representation of the tropical atmosphere. These results suggest that the dramatic improvements in tropical precipitation that have been shown in previous studies may be a function of the lack of dynamical ocean and/or the simplified hemispheric albedo bias corrections applied in that work. It further suggests that efforts to correct the double ITCZ problem in coupled models that focus on large-scale energetic controls will prove fruitless without improvements in the representation of atmospheric processes.

A GCM investigation of impact of aerosols on the precipitation in Amazon during the dry to wet transition	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION; CLIMATE RESPONSE; LAND-SURFACE; NORTH-AFRICA; MODEL; SEASON; CONVECTION; DROUGHT; PARAMETERIZATION; APPROXIMATION	The climatic effects of aerosols on the precipitation over the Amazon during the dry to wet transition period have been investigated using an atmospheric general circulation model, NCEP/AGCM, and the aerosol climatology data. We found increased instability during the dry season and delayed wet season onset with aerosols included in the model simulation, leading to the delay of the maximum precipitation over the Amazon by about half a month. In particular, our GCM simulations show that surface solar flux is reduced in the Amazon due to the absorption and scattering of the solar radiation by aerosols, leading to decreased surface temperature. Reduced surface solar flux is balanced by decreases in both surface sensible heat and latent heat fluxes. During the wet season, the subtropical system over the Amazon has a shallower convection. With the inclusion of aerosols in the simulation, precipitation in the rainy season over the Amazon decreases in the major rainfall band, which partially corrects the overestimate of the simulated precipitation in that region. The reduced surface temperature by aerosols is also coupled with a warming in the middle troposphere, leading to increased atmosphere stability and moisture divergence over the Amazon. However, during the dry season when the convective system is stronger over the Amazon, rainfall increases in that region due to the warming of the air over the upper troposphere produced by biomass burning aerosols, which produces an anomalous upward motion and a convergence of moisture flux over the Amazon and draws the moisture and precipitation further inland. Therefore, aerosol effects on precipitation depend on the large-scale atmospheric stability, resulting in their different roles over the Amazon during the dry and wet seasons.	[Gu, Yu; Liou, K.

From 1992 to 2013, to first order, the observed SWV exhibited three distinct piece-wise trends: a steady increase from 1992 to 2000, an abrupt drop from 2000 to 2004, and a gradual recovery after 2004, while the global-mean surface temperature experienced a strong increase until 2000 and a warming hiatus after 2000. The atmosphere-only CESM shows that the seasonal variation of tropical-mean (30A degrees S-30A degrees N) SWV is anticorrelated with that of the tropical-mean sea surface temperature (SST), while the correlation between the tropical SWV and SST anomalies on the interannual time scale is rather weak. By nudging the modeled SWV to prescribed profiles in coupled atmosphere-slab ocean experiments, we investigate the impact of SWV variations on surface temperature change. We find that a uniform 1 ppmv (0.5 ppmv) SWV increase (decrease) leads to an equilibrium global mean surface warming (cooling) of 0.12 +/- 0.05 A degrees C (-0.07 +/- 0.05 A degrees C). Sensitivity experiments show that the equilibrium response of global mean surface temperature to SWV perturbations over the extratropics is larger than that over the tropics. The observed sudden drop of SWV from 2000 to 2004 produces a global mean surface cooling of about -0.048 +/- 0.041 A degrees C, which suggests that a persistent change in SWV would make an imprint on long-term variations of global-mean surface temperature. A constant linear increase in SWV based on the satellite-observed rate of SWV change yields a global mean surface warming of 0.03 +/- 0.01 A degrees C/decade over a 50-year period, which accounts for about 19 % of the observed surface temperature increase prior to the warming hiatus. In the same experiment, trend analyses during different periods reveal a multi-year adjustment of surface temperature before the response to SWV forcing becomes strong relative to the internal variability in the model.

The near-surface electron radiation environment of Saturn's moon Mimas	ICARUS			English	Article							E-RING; ICY SATELLITES; INTERPLANETARY DUST; MAGNETOSPHERE; ENCELADUS; PLASMA; BOMBARDMENT; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS; VICINITY	Saturn's inner mid-size moons are exposed to a number of external weathering processes, including charged particle bombardment and UV photolysis, as well as deposition of E-ring grains and interplanetary dust. While optical remote sensing observations by several instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft have revealed a number of weathering patterns across the surfaces of these moons, it is not entirely clear which external process is responsible for which observed weathering pattern. Here we focus on Saturn's moon Mimas and model the effect of energetic electron bombardment across its surface. By using a combination of a guiding center, bounce-averaged charged particle tracing approach and a particle physics code, we investigate how the radiation dose due to energetic electrons is deposited with depth at different locations. We predict a lens-shaped electron energy deposition pattern that extends down to cm depths at low latitudes centered around the apex of the leading hemisphere (90 degrees W). These results are consistent with previous remote sensing observations of a lens-shaped color anomaly observed by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) instrument as well as a thermal inertia anomaly observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). Our results confirm that these features are produced by MeV electrons that have a penetration depth into the surface comparable to the effective sampling depths of these instruments. On the trailing hemisphere we predict a similar lens-shaped electron energy deposition pattern, whose effects have to date not been observed by the Cassini remote sensing instruments. We suggest that no corresponding lens-shaped weathering pattern has been observed on the trailing hemisphere because of the comparatively short range of lower energy (<1 MeV) electrons into surface ice, as well as competing effects from cold plasma, neutral, and dust bombardment.

Moist convection and the 2010-2011 revival of Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter; Atmospheres composition; Atmospheres dynamics	INFRARED TELESCOPE FACILITY; SATURNS THERMAL EMISSION; GALILEO PROBE DATA; GREAT WHITE SPOT; DYNAMICAL IMPLICATIONS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; CLOUD VARIABILITY; 2.2-CM WAVELENGTH; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; 2009-2010 FADE	The transformation of Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt (SEB) from its faded, whitened state in 2009-2010 (Fletcher et al., 2011b) to its normal brown appearance is documented via comparisons of thermal infrared (5-20 mu m) and visible-light imaging between November 2010 and November 2011. The SEB revival consisted of convective eruptions triggered over similar to 100 days, potentially powered by the latent heat released by the condensation of water. The plumes rise from the water cloud base and ultimately diverge and cool in the stably-stratified upper troposphere. Thermal-IR images from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) were acquired 2 days after the SEB disturbance was first detected as a small white spot by amateur observers on November 9th 2010. Subsequent images over several months revealed the cold, putatively anticyclonic and cloudy plume tops (area 2.5 x 10(6) km(2)) surrounded by warm, cloud-free conditions at their peripheries due to subsidence. The latent heating was not directly detectable in the 5-20 mu m range. The majority of the plumes erupted from a single source near 140 - 160 degrees W, coincident with the remnant cyclonic circulation of a brown barge that had formed during the fade. The warm remnant of the cyclone could still be observed in IRTF imaging 5 days before the November 9th eruption. Additional plumes erupted from the leading edge of the central disturbance immediately east of the source, which propagated slowly eastwards to encounter the Great Red Spot. The tropospheric plumes were sufficiently vigorous to excite stratospheric thermal waves over the SEB with a 20 - 30 degrees longitudinal wavelength and 5-6 K temperature contrasts at 5 mbar, showing a direct connection between moist convection and stratospheric wave activity. The subsidence and compressional heating of dry, unsaturated air warmed the troposphere (particularly to the northwest of the central branch of the revival) and removed the aerosols that had been responsible for the fade. Dark, cloud-free lanes west of the plumes were the first to show the colour change, and elongated due to the zonal windshear to form the characteristic 'S-shape' of the revival complex. The aerosol-free air was redistributed and mixed throughout the SEB by the zonal flow, following a westward-moving southern branch and an eastward-moving northern branch that revived the brown colouration over-200 days. The transition from the cool conditions of the SEBZ during the fade to the revived SEB caused a 2-4 K rise in 500-mbar temperatures (leaving a particularly warm southern SEB) and a reduction of aerosol opacity by factors of 2-3. Newly-cleared gaps in the upper tropospheric aerosol layer appeared different in filters sensing the similar to 700-mbar cloud deck and the 2-3 bar cloud deck, suggesting complex vertical structure in the downdrafts. The last stage of the revival was the re-establishment of normal convective activity northwest of the GRS in September 2011, similar to 840 days after the last occurrence in June 2009. Moist convection may therefore play an important role in controlling the timescale and atmospheric variability during the SEB life cycle. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Jupiter's para-H-2 distribution from SOFIA/FORCAST and Voyager/IRIS 17-37 mu m spectroscopy	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter; Atmospheres; Composition; Atmospheres; Dynamics	GREAT-RED-SPOT; COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; PARA-HYDROGEN FRACTION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; JOVIAN ATMOSPHERE; TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES; INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; OUTER PLANETS; CASSINI-CIRS; SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION	Spatially resolved maps of Jupiter's far-infrared 17-37 pm hydrogen-helium collision-induced spectrum were acquired by the FORCAST instrument on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) in May 2014. Spectral scans in two grisms covered the broad S(0) and S(1) absorption lines, in addition to contextual imaging in eight broad-band filters (5-37 mu m) with spatial resolutions of 2-4". The spectra were inverted to map the zonal-mean temperature and para-H-2 distribution (f(p), the fraction of the para spin isomer with respect to the ortho spin isomer) in Jupiter's upper troposphere (the 100700 mbar range). We compared these to a reanalysis of Voyager-1 and -2 IRIS spectra covering the same spectral range. Tropospheric temperature contrasts match those identified by Voyager in 1979, within the limits of temporal variability consistent with previous investigations. Para-H-2 increases from equator to pole, with low fp air at the equator representing sub-equilibrium conditions (i.e., less para-H-2 than expected from thermal equilibration), and high fp air and possible super-equilibrium at higher latitudes. In particular, we confirm the continued presence of a region of high f(p) air at high northern latitudes discovered by Voyager/IRIS, and an asymmetry with generally higher f(p) in the north than in the south. Far-IR aerosol opacity is not required to fit the data, but cannot be completely ruled out. We note that existing collision-induced absorption databases lack opacity from (H-2)(2) dimers, leading to under-prediction of the absorption near the S(0) and S(1) peaks. There appears to be no spatial correlation between para-H-2 and tropospheric ammonia, phosphine and cloud opacity derived from Voyager/IRIS at mid-infrared wavelengths (7-15 mu m). We note, however, that para-H-2 tracks the similar latitudinal distribution of aerosols within Jupiter's upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes observed in reflected sunlight, suggesting that catalysis of hydrogen equilibration within the hazes (and not the main clouds) may govern the equator to-pole gradient, with conditions closer to equilibrium at higher latitudes. This gradient is superimposed onto smaller-scale variations associated with regional advection of para-H-2 at the equator and poles. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To do so, these CubeSats will need high-gain antennas (HGAs) that fit in a highly confined volume. In this article, we present an innovative, deployable Ka-band antenna that folds in a 1.5-U (10 x 10 x 15 cm(3)) stowage volume suitable for 6U (10 x 20 x 30 cm(3))-class CubeSats. This antenna is designed for telecommunication and is compatible with NASA's deep-space network (DSN) at Ka-band frequencies (i.e., uplink: 34.2-34.7 GHz; downlink: 31.8-32.3 GHz). Calculations and measurements show that 42.0-dBi gain and 57% aperture efficiency are obtained at 32 GHz. We thoroughly describe the mechanical deployment mechanism because it is a critical component of the deployable CubeSat antenna.

A Deployable High-Gain Antenna Bound for Mars Developing a new folded-panel reflectarray for the first CubeSat mission to Mars	IEEE ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION MAGAZINE			English	Article							REFLECTARRAYS; ARRAY	This article describes the development of a deployable high-gain antenna (HGA) for the proposed Mars Cube One (MarCO) CubeSat mission to Mars. The antenna is a new folded-panel reflectarray (FPR) designed to fit on a 6U (10 x 20 x 34 cm(3)) CubeSat bus and support 8.425-GHz Mars-to-Earth telecommunications. The FPR provides a gain of 29.2 dBic with right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). Small stowage volume is a key advantage of the FPR design, as it only consumes similar to 4% of the usable spacecraft payload volume with a mass of less than 1 kg.

In our algorithm, each robot continually computes its buffered Voronoi cell (BVC) and plans its path within the BVC in a receding horizon fashion. We prove that our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance for robots with single integrator dynamics. We show that our algorithm has computational complexity of O(k), which is the same as that of the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) algorithm, and is considerably faster than model predictive control (MPC) and sequential convex programming (SCP) based approaches. Moreover, ORCA andMPC-SCP require relative position, velocity, and even other information, to be exchanged over a communication network among the robots. Our algorithm only requires the sensed relative position, and therefore is well suited for on-line implementation as it does not require a communication network, and it works well with noisy relative position sensors. Furthermore, we provide an extension of our algorithm to robots with higher-order dynamics like quadrotors. We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm by comparing it to ORCA in multiple benchmark simulation scenarios, and we present results of over 70 experimental trials using five quadrotors in a motion capture environment.

NOV.; IDENTIFICATION; BACILLUS; MEMBER	A Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming, aerobic bacterial strain, designated ISSFR-015(T), was isolated from a high-efficiency particulate arrestance filter in the International Space Station and was characterized by polyphasic taxonomy. A comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence (1494 bp) of strain ISSFR-015(T) showed highest similarity to Solibacillus isronensis B3W22(T) (98.9 %), followed by Solibacillus silvestris HR3-23(T) (98.6 %) and Bacillus cecembensis PN5(T) (96.7 %). DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that the DNA relatedness values of strain ISSFR-015(T) with other closely related species were in the range of 41-47% [S. silvestrisMTCC 10789(T)(47 %), S. isronensis MTCC 7902(T)(41 %) and B. cecembensis MTCC 9127(T) (43 %)]. The DNA G+C content of strain ISSFR-015(T) was 45.4 mol%. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:(0) (45.2 %) and C-17:1 omega 10(c) (12.1 %). The polar lipid profile contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and one unknown phospholipid. The isoprenoid quinones present in strain ISSFR-015(T) were MK-7 (86.8 %), MK-6 (11.6 %) and MK-8 (1.0 %). The peptidoglycan type of the cell wall was A4 alpha L-Lys-DGlu. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, strain ISSFR-015(T) belongs to the genus Solibacillus. The polyphasic taxonomic data, including low DNA-DNA hybridization values, and the chemotaxonomic analysis confirmed that strain ISSFR-015(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Solibacillus kalamii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain for this proposed species is ISSFR-015(T) (= NRRL B-65388(T)=DSM 101595(T)).

Characterization of LIBS emission lines for the identification of chlorides, carbonates, and sulfates in salt/basalt mixtures for the application to MSL ChemCam data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						LIBS spectroscopy; carbon; chlorine; sulfur; salts; Mars Science Laboratory	INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; GALE CRATER; INSTRUMENT SUITE; MARS; MINERALOGY; CHEMISTRY; FEATURES; VEINS; ROCK; UNIT	Ancient environmental conditions on Mars can be probed through the identification of minerals on its surface, including water-deposited salts and cements dispersed in the pore space of sedimentary rocks. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analyses by the Martian rover Curiosity's ChemCam instrument can indicate salts, and ChemCam surveys aid in identifying and selecting sites for further, detailed in situ analyses. We performed laboratory LIBS experiments under simulated Mars conditions with a ChemCam-like instrument on a series of mixtures containing increasing concentrations of salt in a basaltic background to investigate the potential for identifying and quantifying chloride, carbonate, and sulfate salts found only in small amounts, dispersed in bulk rock with ChemCam, rather than concentrated in veins. Data indicate that the presence of emission lines from the basalt matrix limited the number of Cl, C, and S emission lines found to be useful for quantitative analysis; nevertheless, several lines with intensities sensitive to salt concentration were identified. Detection limits for the elements based on individual emission lines ranged from similar to 20wt % carbonate (2wt % C), similar to 5-30wt % sulfate (1-8wt % S), and similar to 5-10wt % chloride (3-6wt % Cl) depending on the basaltic matrix and/or salt cation. Absolute quantification of Cl, C, and S in the samples via univariate analysis depends on the cation-anion pairing in the salt but appears relatively independent of matrices tested, following normalization. These results are promising for tracking relative changes in the salt content of bulk rock on the Martian surface with ChemCam.	[Anderson, D. E.; Ehlmann, B. L.; Thomas, N.

Environmental dependence of the galaxy stellar mass function in the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification Data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: photometry; galaxies: statistics	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; VLT DEEP SURVEY; SPECTROSCOPIC TARGET SELECTION; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; REDSHIFT SURVEY; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; METALLICITY RELATION; ASSEMBLY HISTORY; COLOR-MAGNITUDE; STAR-FORMATION	Measurements of the galaxy stellar mass function are crucial to understand the formation of galaxies in the Universe. In a hierarchical clustering paradigm, it is plausible that there is a connection between the properties of galaxies and their environments. Evidence for environmental trends has been established in the local Universe. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) provides large photometric data sets that enable further investigation of the assembly of mass. In this study, we use similar to 3.2 million galaxies from the (South Pole Telescope) SPTEast field in the DES science verification (SV) data set. From grizY photometry, we derive galaxy stellar masses and absolute magnitudes, and determine the errors on these properties using Monte Carlo simulations using the full photometric redshift probability distributions. We compute galaxy environments using a fixed conical aperture for a range of scales. We construct galaxy environment probability distribution functions and investigate the dependence of the environment errors on the aperture parameters. We compute the environment components of the galaxy stellar mass function for the redshift range 0.15 < z < 1.05. For z < 0.75, we find that the fraction of massive galaxies is larger in high-density environment than in lowdensity environments. We show that the low-density and high-density components converge with increasing redshift up to z similar to 1.0 where the shapes of the mass function components are indistinguishable. Our study shows how high-density structures build up around massive galaxies through cosmic time.

Testing the lognormality of the galaxy and weak lensing convergence distributions from Dark Energy Survey maps	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	COSMOLOGICAL DENSITY-FLUCTUATIONS; PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; POINT CORRELATION-FUNCTIONS; SCIENCE VERIFICATION DATA; LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; N-BODY SIMULATIONS; PERTURBATION-THEORY; SHEAR MEASUREMENT; STATISTICS	It is well known that the probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy density contrast is approximately lognormal; whether the PDF of mass fluctuations derived from weak lensing convergence (kappa(WL)) is lognormal is less well established. We derive PDFs of the galaxy and projected matter density distributions via the counts-in-cells (CiC) method. We use maps of galaxies and weak lensing convergence produced from the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data over 139 deg(2). We test whether the underlying density contrast is well described by a lognormal distribution for the galaxies, the convergence and their joint PDF. We confirm that the galaxy density contrast distribution is well modelled by a lognormal PDF convolved with Poisson noise at angular scales from 10 to 40 arcmin (corresponding to physical scales of 3-10 Mpc). We note that as kappa(WL) is a weighted sum of the mass fluctuations along the line of sight, its PDF is expected to be only approximately lognormal. We find that the kappa(WL) distribution is well modelled by a lognormal PDF convolved with Gaussian shape noise at scales between 10 and 20 arcmin, with a best-fitting chi(2)/dof of 1.11 compared to 1.84 for a Gaussian model, corresponding to p-values 0.35 and 0.07, respectively, at a scale of 10 arcmin. Above 20 arcmin a simple Gaussian model is sufficient. The joint PDF is also reasonably fitted by a bivariate lognormal. As a consistency check, we compare the variances derived from the lognormal modelling with those directly measured via CiC. Our methods are validated against maps from the MICE Grand Challenge N-body simulation.

Faint-source-star planetary microlensing: the discovery of the cold gas-giant planet OGLE-2014-BLG-0676Lb	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; planets and satellites: detection	DIFFERENCE IMAGE-ANALYSIS; GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; GALACTIC BULGE; OPTICAL DEPTH; OGLE-III; SPITZER OBSERVATIONS; EXTRASOLAR PLANETS; MASS; SYSTEMS; EVENTS	We report the discovery of a planet-OGLE-2014-BLG-0676Lb-via gravitational microlensing. Observations for the lensing event were made by the following groups: Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics; Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment; Wise Observatory; RoboNET/Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope; Microlensing Network for the Detection of Small Terrestrial Exoplanets; and mu-FUN. All analyses of the light-curve data favour a lens system comprising a planetary mass orbiting a host star. The most-favoured binary lens model has a mass ratio between the two lens masses of (4.78 +/- 0.13) x 10(-3). Subject to some important assumptions, a Bayesian probability density analysis suggests the lens system comprises a 3.09(+1.02)-(1.12) MJ planet orbiting a 0.62(+ 0.20)-(0.22) M-circle dot host star at a deprojected orbital separation of 4.40(+2.16)-(1.46) au. The distance to the lens system is 2.22(+ 0.96)-(0.83) kpc. Planet OGLE2014-BLG-0676Lb provides additional data to the growing number of cool planets discovered using gravitational microlensing against which planetary formation theories may be tested. Most of the light in the baseline of this event is expected to come from the lens and thus high-resolution imaging observations could confirm our planetary model interpretation.	[Rattenbury, N.

Thermally anomalous features in the subsurface of Enceladus's south polar terrain	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							COHERENT BACKSCATTER; MICROWAVE RADIOMETRY; TIGER STRIPES; HEAT-FLUX; RADAR; SURFACE; SATELLITES; TITAN; GRAVITY; REGIONS	Saturn's moon Enceladus is an active world. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft witnessed for the first time water-rich jets venting from four anomalously warm fractures (called sulci) near its south pole(1,2). Since then, several observations have provided evidence that the source of the material ejected from Enceladus is a large underground ocean, the depth of which is still debated(3-6). Here, we report on the first and only opportunity that Cassini's RADAR instrument(7,8) had to observe Enceladus's south polar terrain closely, targeting an area a few tens of kilometres north of the active sulci. Detailed analysis of the microwave radiometry observations highlights the ongoing activity of the moon. The instrument recorded the microwave thermal emission, revealing a warm subsurface region with prominent thermal anomalies that had not been identified before. These anomalies coincide with large fractures, similar or structurally related to the sulci. The observations imply the presence of a broadly distributed heat production and transport system below the south polar terrain with 'plate-like' features and suggest that a liquid reservoir could exist at a depth of only a few kilometres under the ice shell at the south pole. The detection of a possible dormant sulcus further suggests episodic geological activity.	[Le Gall, A.; Kirk, R.; Hayes, A.

Airborne LiDAR technology has demonstrated its ability to accurately map canopy fuels. However, its geographical and temporal coverage is limited, thus making it difficult to characterize fuel properties over large regions before catastrophic events occur. This study presents a two-step methodology for integrating post-fire airborne LiDAR and pre-fire Landsat OLI (Operational Land Imager) data to estimate important pre-fire canopy fuel properties for crown fire spread, namely canopy fuel load (CFL), canopy cover (CC), and canopy bulk density (CBD). This study focused on a fire prone area affected by the large 2013 Rim fire in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA. First, LiDAR data was used to estimate CFL, CC, and CBD across an unburned 2 km buffer with similar structural characteristics to the burned area. Second, the LiDAR-based canopy fuel properties were extrapolated over the whole area using Landsat OLI data, which yielded an R-2 of 0.8, 0.79, and 0.64 and RMSE of 3.76 Mg.ha(-1), 0.09, and 0.02 kg.m(-3) for CFL, CC, and CBD, respectively. The uncertainty of the estimates was estimated for each pixel using a bootstrapping approach, and the 95% confidence intervals are reported. The proposed methodology provides a detailed spatial estimation of forest canopy fuel properties along with their uncertainty that can be readily integrated into fire behavior and fire effects models. The methodology could be also integrated into the LANDFIRE program to improve the information on canopy fuels.

Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Using the L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Onboard the Soil Moisture Active-Passive Satellite and Evaluation at Core Validation Sites	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); vegetation	SAR DATA; BACKSCATTERING; MODEL; SCATTERING; ROUGHNESS; AIRBORNE; SERIES	This paper evaluates the retrieval of soil moisture in the top 5-cm layer at 3-km spatial resolution using L-band dual-copolarized Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data that mapped the globe every three days from mid-April to early July, 2015. Surface soil moisture retrievals using radar observations have been challenging in the past due to complicating factors of surface roughness and vegetation scattering. Here, physically based forward models of radar scattering for individual vegetation types are inverted using a time-series approach to retrieve soil moisture while correcting for the effects of static roughness and dynamic vegetation. Compared with the past studies in homogeneous field scales, this paper performs a stringent test with the satellite data in the presence of terrain slope, subpixel heterogeneity, and vegetation growth. The retrieval process also addresses any deficiencies in the forward model by removing any time-averaged bias between model and observations and by adjusting the strength of vegetation contributions. The retrievals are assessed at 14 core validation sites representing a wide range of global soil and vegetation conditions over grass, pasture, shrub, woody savanna, corn, wheat, and soybean fields. The predictions of the forward models used agree with SMAP measurements to within 0.5 dB unbiased-root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and -0.05 dB (bias) for both copolarizations. Soil moisture retrievals have an accuracy of 0.052 m(3)/m(3) ubRMSE, -0.015 m(3)/m(3) bias, and a correlation of 0.50, compared to in situ measurements, thus meeting the accuracy target of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) ubRMSE. The successful retrieval demonstrates the feasibility of a physically based time series retrieval with L-band SAR data for characterizing soil moisture over diverse conditions of soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation.

SMAP L-Band Microwave Radiometer: Instrument Design and First Year on Orbit	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Calibration; microwave radiometry; polarimetry	SOIL-MOISTURE; RADIOFREQUENCY INTERFERENCE; CALIBRATION; MISSION; PERFORMANCE; POLARIMETRY; MITIGATION	The Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) L-band microwave radiometer is a conical scanning instrument designed to measure soil moisture with 4% volumetric accuracy at 40-km spatial resolution. SMAP is NASA's first Earth Systematic Mission developed in response to its first Earth science decadal survey. Here, the design is reviewed and the results of its first year on orbit are presented. Unique features of the radiometer include a large 6-m rotating reflector, fully polarimetric radiometer receiver with internal calibration, and radio-frequency interference detection and filtering hardware. The radiometer electronics are thermally controlled to achieve good radiometric stability. Analyses of on-orbit results indicate that the electrical and thermal characteristics of the electronics and internal calibration sources are very stable and promote excellent gain stability. Radiometer NEDT < 1 K for 17-ms samples. The gain spectrum exhibits low noise at frequencies >1 MHz and 1/f noise rising at longer time scales fully captured by the internal calibration scheme. Results from sky observations and global swath imagery of all four Stokes antenna temperatures indicate that the instrument is operating as expected.

The gain and dark responses were characterized for each focal plane array detector element. An integrating sphere source with an integrated monitoring spectroradiometer illuminated the OCO-2 spectrometers at many light levels. Instrument output was compared with the calibrated output of the source to derive gain coefficients. This source was calibrated in situ with respect to the National Institute of Standards and Technology reference standards, and the instrument met its absolute performance requirement of 5%. Matching fields of view for the internal monitor detectors and the external instrument under test was found to be particularly important, as observed in the results and supported by modeling. Temperature-dependent dark offsets were corrected in a separate process. Solar spectra with varying neutral density filters were used to validate the linearity of the spectrometers.

An Optimal Nonnegative Eigenvalue Decomposition for the Freeman and Durden Three-Component Scattering Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Model-based decomposition; optimal nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition (NNED); radar polarimetry	SAR IMAGE DECOMPOSITION; COHERENCY MATRIX; RADAR POLARIMETRY	Model-based decomposition allows the physical interpretation of polarimetric radar scattering in terms of various scattering mechanisms. A three-component decomposition proposed by Freeman and Durden has been popular, though significant shortcomings have been identified. In particular, it can result in negative eigenvalues for the component terms and the remainder matrix, hence violating fundamental requirements for physically meaningful decompositions. In addition, since the algorithm solves for the canopy term first, the contribution of the canopy is often over-estimated. In this paper, we show how to determine the parameters for the Freeman-Durden model in a way that minimizes the total power in the remainder matrix without favoring any individual component in the model, while simultaneously satisfying the constraints of non-negative eigenvalues. We illustrate our analytical solution by comparison with the Freeman-Durden algorithm, as well as the nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition (NNED) proposed by van Zyl et al. The results show that this optimum algorithm generally assigns less power to the volume scattering than either the original Freeman-Durden or the NNED algorithms.

We examine the sensitivity of Ku-, X-, and C-band sigma(0)(VV) and sigma(0)(HH) to variability in snow geophysical properties such as salinity, density, temperature, and snow grain radius, sampled from a highly saline snow cover on first-year sea ice. A first-order multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate sigma(0)(VV) and sigma(0)(HH) by taking into account the surface and volume scattering contributions within each snow layer of the snow pack. Penetration depth models are used to calculate the potential penetration of all three frequencies, at initial and perturbed snow property conditions. Sensitivity analyses suggest that variability in salinity and snow grain radius have the greatest effect, followed by density and temperature. This phenomenon is observed for all three frequencies, influencing microwave penetration and backscatter. Dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers and substantial changes in scattering contributions from snow grain radius perturbations were found to be the dominant factors affecting microwave penetration and backscatter. Results from this paper demonstrate the potential of using a multifrequency theoretical approach to correlate with active microwave observations to determine the geophysical and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. The paper also represents an evolution in a theoretical understanding on how an active microwave approach using multiple frequencies can be further utilized toward the development of snow thickness and/or snow water equivalent algorithm on smooth FYI.

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past	SCIENCE			English	Article							IMHOTEP REGION; NUCLEUS; ROTATION; OSIRIS; SHAPE	The Rosetta spacecraft spent similar to 2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet's landscape. This suggests that most of the major landforms were created early in the comet's current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO2 ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.

Applicability of Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans multitemporal interferometry for monitoring slow ground motions in the San Francisco Bay Area	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Sentinel-1; multitemporal interferometry; slow deformation	TIME-DEPENDENT MODEL; M(W)8.3 ILLAPEL; ANDREAS FAULT; INSAR; CREEP; CALIFORNIA; SYSTEM; CHILE; SLIP	Data from the Sentinel-1 satellite have already proven useful for investigating seismic and volcanic events since its launch in April 2014. The requirement of ultrahigh coregistration accuracy and the current relatively short time of Sentinel-1 acquisitions make its application challenging for studying slow deformation processes, such as fault creep and land subsidence. Here we analyze a set of 14 SAR images over the San Francisco Bay Area spanning 1year from early 2015 to 2016. We show that implementing an existing Enhanced Spectral Diversity algorithm or using precise orbits together with a reference digital elevation model both yield the required coregistration accuracy for making use of the phase measurements in time series analysis of ground deformation. Following a thorough validation test, we update our estimates of Hayward Fault creep rate and confirm uplift due to recharge of the Santa Clara Valley aquifer system during the final summer of 4year drought.

Ceres's obliquity history and its implications for the permanently shadowed regions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						obliquity; volatiles; dynamics	ELLIPSOID DIMENSIONS; LUNAR; MERCURY; ICE; EVOLUTION; VOLATILES; TOPOGRAPHY; CLIMATE; IMAGES; MOONS	Due to the small current obliquity of Ceres (epsilon approximate to 4 degrees), permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) exist on the dwarf planet's surface. Since the existence and persistence of the PSRs depend on the obliquity, we compute the obliquity history over the last 3Myr and find that it undergoes large oscillations with a period of 24.5kyr and a maximum of epsilon(max)approximate to 19.6 degrees. During periods of large obliquity, most of the present-day PSRs receive direct sunlight. Some craters in Ceres's polar regions possess bright crater floor deposits (BCFDs). We find an apparent correlation between BCFDs and the most persistent PSRs. In the north, only two PSRs remain at epsilon(max) and they both contain BCFDs. In the south, one of the two only craters that remain in shadow at epsilon(max) contains a BCFD. The location of BCFDs within persistent PSRs strongly suggests that BCFDs consist of volatiles accumulated in PSR cold traps: either water molecules trapped from the exosphere or exposed ground ice.

Biological regulation of atmospheric chemistry en route to planetary oxygenation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						sulfur mass-independent fractionation; organic haze; planetary oxidation; hydrogen loss; Neoarchean	MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION; SULFUR ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; MULTIPLE-SULFUR; TRANSVAAL SUPERGROUP; KAAPVAAL CRATON; ORGANIC HAZE; BIOGENIC METHANE; PYRITE FORMATION; SULFATE; OXIDATION	Emerging evidence suggests that atmospheric oxygen may have varied before rising irreversibly similar to 2.4 billion years ago, during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Significantly, however, pre-GOE atmospheric aberrations toward more reducing conditions-featuring a methane-derived organic-haze-have recently been suggested, yet their occurrence, causes, and significance remain underexplored. To examine the role of haze formation in Earth's history, we targeted an episode of inferred haze development. Our redox-controlled (Fe-speciation) carbon-and sulfur-isotope record reveals sustained systematic stratigraphic covariance, precluding nonatmospheric explanations. Photochemical models corroborate this inference, showing Delta S-36/Delta S-33 ratios are sensitive to the presence of haze. Exploiting existing age constraints, we estimate that organic haze developed rapidly, stabilizing within similar to 0.3 +/- 0.1 million years (Myr), and persisted for upward of similar to 1.4 +/- 0.4 Myr. Given these temporal constraints, and the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the Archean, the sustained methane fluxes necessary for haze formation can only be reconciled with a biological source. Correlative delta C-13(Org) and total organic carbon measurements support the interpretation that atmospheric haze was a transient response of the biosphere to increased nutrient availability, with methane fluxes controlled by the relative availability of organic carbon and sulfate. Elevated atmospheric methane concentrations during haze episodes would have expedited planetary hydrogen loss, with a single episode of haze development providing up to 2.6-18 x 10(18) moles of O-2 equivalents to the Earth system. Our findings suggest the Neoarchean likely represented a unique state of the Earth system where haze development played a pivotal role in planetary oxidation, hastening the contingent biological innovations that followed.

We present an analysis of satellite observations of PAN from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) over the eastern Pacific Ocean for April and July 2006-2010 and the spring-to-summer seasonal transition for 2006. TES can provide quantitative estimates of free tropospheric PAN in clear-sky or thin cloud conditions where elevated PAN (>0.2ppbv) is present. The percentage of successful PAN detections increases from April to July and then decreases in August and September. However, there are no significant differences in the tropospheric average PAN either interannually or between these months. Plumes containing elevated PAN are present almost every day in July. Elevated PAN observed in July has multiple sources, including fires in Siberia, anthropogenic sources in eastern China, and recirculated pollution from the continental U.S. We combined the observed variability in the TES PAN retrievals over the eastern Pacific Ocean with a range of possible trends in PAN to determine the observational requirements to detect such trends. Based on the variability observed in the PAN retrievals over this region, we predict that it would be faster to detect a trend of a given magnitude in PAN using satellite observations over the eastern Pacific Ocean region rather than in situ surface observations and that a trend of a given magnitude would be more quickly detected in summer than spring.

The work includes an initial examination of statistical uncertainties in prior models for CO2 exchange, in radiocarbon-based fossil fuel CO2 measurements, in OCO-2 measurements, and in a regional atmospheric transport modeling system. Using these nominal assumptions for measurement and model uncertainties, we find that flask measurements of radiocarbon and total CO2 at 10 towers can be used to distinguish between different fossil fuel emission data products for major urban regions of California. We then show that the combination of flask and OCO-2 observations yields posterior uncertainties in monthly-mean fossil fuel emissions of similar to 5-10%, levels likely useful for policy relevant evaluation of bottom-up fossil fuel emission estimates. Similarly, we find that inversions yield uncertainties in monthly biosphere CO2 exchange of similar to 6%-12%, depending on season, providing useful information on net carbon uptake in California's forests and agricultural lands. Finally, initial sensitivity analysis suggests that obtaining the above results requires control of systematic biases below approximately 0.5ppm, placing requirements on accuracy of the atmospheric measurements, background subtraction, and atmospheric transport modeling.

The Perihelion Emission of Comet C/2010 L5 (WISE)	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual (C/2010 L5 (WISE))	INFRARED-SURVEY-EXPLORER; HALE-BOPP; NUCLEUS; EVOLUTION; NEOWISE; AU	The only Halley-type comet discovered by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), C/2010 L5 (WISE), was imaged three times by WISE, and it showed a significant dust tail during the second and third visits (2010 June and July, respectively). We present here an analysis of the data collected by WISE, putting estimates on the comet's size, dust production rate, gas production (CO+CO2) rate, and active fraction. We also present a detailed description of a novel tail-fitting technique that allows the commonly used syndyne-synchrone models to be used analytically, thereby giving more robust results. We find that C/2010 L5's dust tail was likely formed by strong emission, likely in the form of an outburst, occurring when the comet was within a few days of perihelion. Analyses of the June and July data independently agree on this result. The two separate epochs of dust tail analysis independently suggest a strong emission event close to perihelion. The average size of the dust particles in the dust tail increased between the epochs, suggesting that the dust was primarily released in a short period of time, and the smaller dust particles were quickly swept away by solar radiation pressure, leaving the larger particles behind. The difference in CO2 and dust production rates measured in 2010 June and July is not consistent with "normal" steady-state gas production from a comet at these heliocentric distances, suggesting that much of the detected CO2 and dust was produced in an episodic event. Together, these conclusions suggest that C/2010 L5 experienced a significant outburst event when the comet was close to perihelion.	[Kramer, E. A.; Bauer, J. M.; Stevenson, R.; Mainzer, A.

Project 1640 Observations of Brown Dwarf GJ 758 B: Near-infrared Spectrum and Atmospheric Modeling	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: spectrographs; planets and satellites: detection; stars: individual (GJ 758); techniques: high angular resolution	FIELD L-DWARFS; GIANT PLANETS; COOL STARS; CANDIDATE COMPANION; 1ST LIGHT; T-DWARFS; HD 19467; HR 8799; YOUNG; MASS	The nearby Sun-like star GJ 758 hosts a cold substellar companion, GJ 758 B, at a projected separation of l less than or similar to 30 au, previously detected in high-contrast multi-band photometric observations. In order to better constrain the companion's physical characteristics, we acquired the first low-resolution (R similar to 50) near-infrared spectrum of it using the high-contrast hyperspectral imaging instrument Project 1640 on Palomar Observatory's 5 m Hale telescope. We obtained simultaneous images in 32 wavelength channels covering the Y, J, and H bands (similar to 9521770 nm), and used data processing techniques based on principal component analysis to efficiently subtract chromatic background speckle-noise. GJ 758 B was detected in four epochs during 2013 and 2014. Basic astrometric measurements confirm its apparent northwest trajectory relative to the primary star, with no clear signs of orbital curvature. Spectra of SpeX/IRTF observed T dwarfs were compared to the combined spectrum of GJ 758 B, with chi(2) minimization suggesting a best fit for spectral type T7.0 +/- 1.0, but with a shallow minimum over T5T8. Fitting of synthetic spectra from the BT-Settl13 model atmospheres gives an effective temperature T-eff = 741 +/- 25 K and surface gravity log g=4.3 +/- 0.5 dex (cgs). Our derived best-fit spectral type and effective temperature from modeling of the low-resolution spectrum suggest a slightly earlier and hotter companion than previous findings from photometric data, but do not rule out current results, and confirm GJ 758 B as one of the coolest sub-stellar companions to a Sun-like star to date.

DES Collaboration	An r-process Enhanced Star in the Dwarf Galaxy Tucana III	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: abundances; galaxies: dwarf; stars: abundances; stars: chemically peculiar	METAL-POOR STARS; RED GIANT BRANCH; CHEMICAL EVOLUTION; SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; DETAILED ABUNDANCES; SPHEROIDAL GALAXIES; HEAVY-ELEMENTS; 1ST STARS; S-PROCESS; NUCLEOSYNTHESIS	Chemically peculiar stars in dwarf galaxies provide a window for exploring the birth environment of stars with varying chemical enrichment. We present a chemical abundance analysis of the brightest star in the newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidate Tucana III. Because it is particularly bright for a star in an ultra-faint Milky Way (MW) satellite, we are able to measure the abundance of 28 elements, including 13 neutron-capture species. This star, DES. J235532.66-593114.9 (DES J235532), shows a mild enhancement in neutron-capture elements associated with the r-process and can be classified as an r-I star. DES. J235532 is the first r-I star to be discovered in an ultra-faint satellite, and Tuc. III is the second extremely low-luminosity system found to contain r-process enriched material, after Reticulum. II. Comparison of the abundance pattern of DES. J235532 with r-I and r-II stars found in other dwarf galaxies and in the MW halo suggests a common astrophysical origin for the neutron-capture elements seen in all r-process enhanced stars. We explore both internal and external scenarios for the r-process enrichment of Tuc. III and show that with abundance patterns for additional stars, it should be possible to distinguish between them.

We find that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) heavier than 10(10) M-circle dot often display double-peaked H alpha emission, extremely broad Fe II complex emission around Mg II, and highly blueshifted and broadened C IV emission. The weight of this evidence, combined with previous studies, cautions against the use of M-BH values based on any emission line with a width over 8000 km s(-1). Also, the M-BH estimations are not positively biased by the presence of ionized narrow line outflows, anisotropic radiation, or the use of line FWHM instead of sigma for our sample, and unbiased with variability, scatter in broad line equivalent width, or obscuration for general type-1 quasars. Removing the systematically uncertain M-BH values, similar to 10(10) M-circle dot black holes (BHs) in 1 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 2 Ns can still be explained by anisotropic motion of the broad line region from similar to 10(9.5) M-circle dot BHs, although current observations support that they are intrinsically most massive, and overmassive to the host's bulge mass.

DES Collaboration	Farthest Neighbor: The Distant Milky Way Satellite Eridanus II	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark matter; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: individual (Eridanus II); galaxies: stellar content; Local Group; stars: abundances	DWARF SPHEROIDAL GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; DARK-MATTER PROFILES; LEO-T; VELOCITY DISPERSIONS; DENSITY PROFILES; NEUTRAL HYDROGEN; H-I; FAINT; STELLAR	We present Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of the recently discovered Milky Way satellite Eridanus II (Eri II). We identify 28 member stars in Eri II, from which we measure a systemic radial velocity of nu(hel)= 75.6 +/- 1.3(stat.) +/- 2.0 (sys.) km s(-1) and a velocity dispersion of 6.9(-0.9)(+1.2) km s(-1). Assuming that Eri. II is a dispersion-supported system in dynamical equilibrium, we derive a mass within the half-light radius of 1.2(-0.3)(+0.4) x 10(7) M-circle dot, indicating a mass-tolight ratio of 420(-140)(+210) M-circle dot/L-circle dot and confirming that it is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. From the equivalent width measurements of the Ca triplet lines of 16 red giant member stars, we derive a mean metallicity of [ Fe/H] = -2.38 +/- 0.13 and a metallicity dispersion of sigma[Fe/H]= 0.47(-0.09)(+0.12). The velocity of Eri. II in the Galactic standard of rest frame is nu(GSR) = -66.6 km s(-1), indicating that either Eri. II is falling into the Milky Way potential for the first time or that it has passed the apocenter of its orbit on a subsequent passage. At a Galactocentric distance of similar to 370 kpc, Eri II is one of the Milky Way's most distant satellites known. Additionally, we show that the bright blue stars previously suggested to be a young stellar population are not associated with Eri. II. The lack of gas and recent star formation in Eri II is surprising given its mass and distance from the Milky Way, and may place constraints on models of quenching in dwarf galaxies and on the distribution of hot gas in the Milky Way halo. Furthermore, the large velocity dispersion of Eri II can be combined with the existence of a central star cluster to constrain massive compact halo object dark matter with mass greater than or similar to 10 M-circle dot.

Spectral energy distribution fitting further suggests that the radial gap extends to 1 au. The narrow, wedge-like shape of the dark features appears similar to predictions of shadows cast by an inner disk that is misaligned with respect to the outer disk. Using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code HOCHUNCK3D, we construct a model of the disk that allows us to determine its physical properties in more detail. From the angular separation of the features, we measure the difference in inclination between the disks (45 degrees) and their major axes, PA = 140 degrees east of north for the outer disk, and 100 degrees for the inner disk. We find an outer-disk inclination of 25 degrees +/- 10 degrees from face-on, in broad agreement with the Wagner et al. measurement of 34 degrees. SPHERE data in J and H bands indicate a reddish disk, which indicates that HD 100453 is evolving into a young debris disk.

III (Tuc III). We identify 26 member stars in Tuc. III from which we measure a mean radial velocity of v(hel) = - 102.3 +/- 0.4 (stat.) +/- 2.0. (sys.) km s(-1), a velocity dispersion of 0.1(0.7)(+0.7) km s(-1), and a mean metallicity of = -[Fe/H] = -2.42(-0.08)(+0.07). The upper limit on the velocity dispersion is sigma < 1.5 km s(-1) at 95.5% confidence, and the corresponding upper limit on the mass within the half-light radius of Tuc. III is 9.0. x. 10(4) M-circle dot. We cannot rule out mass-to-light ratios as large as 240. Me/Le for Tuc. III, but much lower mass-to-light ratios that would leave the system baryon-dominated are also allowed. We measure an upper limit on the metallicity spread of the stars in Tuc. III of 0.19. dex at 95.5% confidence. Tuc. III has a smaller metallicity dispersion and likely a smaller velocity dispersion than any known dwarf galaxy, but a larger size and lower surface brightness than any known globular cluster. Its metallicity is also much lower than those of the clusters with similar luminosity. We therefore tentatively suggest that Tuc. III is the tidally stripped remnant of a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy, but additional precise velocity and metallicity measurements will be necessary for a definitive classification. If Tuc. III is indeed a dwarf galaxy, it is one of the closest external galaxies to the Sun. Because of its proximity, the most luminous stars in Tuc. III are quite bright, including one star at V = 15.7 that is the brightest known member star of an ultra-faint satellite.	[Simon, J.

The Dependence of the Cerean Exosphere on Solar Energetic Particle Events	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual (Ceres); planets and satellites: atmospheres; Sun: particle emission	WATER ICE; ELECTRONS	Observations from Earth-based ground and orbiting telescopes indicate that the Ceres's exosphere has a time-varying water component. Evidence of a transient atmosphere was also detected by Dawn upon its arrival, inferred from the response on the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector. That atmosphere appeared shortly after the passage of a large enhancement in the local flux of high-energy solar protons. Solar proton events have highly variable fluxes over a range of proton energies from 10 s of keV to over 100 MeV and are capable of sputtering water ice at or near the surface. Herein, we examine the fluxes of solar energetic protons measured during Earth-based attempts to detect water vapor and OH in the Ceres' atmosphere. We find that the presence of the cerean exosphere is correlated with the inferred presence of solar energetic protons at Ceres, consistent with the event detected by Dawn.	[Villarreal, M.

Active microwave observations of diurnal and seasonal variations of canopy water content across the humid African tropical forests	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							AMAZON RAIN-FOREST; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; LAND-SURFACE; SAP FLOW; DRY SEASON; STEM WATER; BACKSCATTER OBSERVATIONS; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; DIAMETER VARIATIONS; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA	A higher frequency of severe droughts under warmer temperatures is expected to lead to large impacts on global water and carbon fluxes and on vegetation cover-including possible widespread mortality. Monitoring the hydraulic state of vegetation as represented by the canopy water content will allow rapid assessment of vegetation water stress. Here we show the potential of active microwave backscatter observations at Ku band for monitoring the diurnal and seasonal variations of top-of-canopy water content. We focus on the humid tropical forests of Central Africa and examine spatiotemporal variations of radar backscatter from QuikSCAT (2001-2009) and RapidScat (2014-2016). Diurnal variations in RapidScat backscatter demonstrate the occurrence of widespread midday stomatal closure in this region. Increases in backscatter during the dry seasons in humid forests could be explained by both dry season leaf flushing (as supported by canopy structure) and vapor pressure deficit-driven increases in evapotranspiration rates.

Level of neutral buoyancy, deep convective outflow, and convective core: New perspectives based on 5 years of CloudSat data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							VERTICAL VELOCITY; TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE; CUMULONIMBUS; STRATOSPHERE; REFLECTIVITY; TEMPERATURE; EVOLUTION	This paper is the follow on to a previous publication by the authors, which investigated the relationship between the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) determined from the ambient sounding and the actual outflow levels using mainly CloudSat observations. The goal of the current study is to provide a more complete characterization of LNB, deep convective outflow, and convective core, and the relationship among them, as well as the dependence on environmental parameters and convective system size. A proxy is introduced to estimate convective entrainment, namely, the difference between the LNB (based on the ambient sounding) and the actual outflow height. The principal findings are as follows: (1) Deep convection over the Warm Pool has larger entrainment rates and smaller convective cores than the counterpart over the two tropical land regions (Africa and Amazonia), lending observational support to a long-standing assumption in convection models concerning the negative relationship between the two parameters. (2) The differences in internal vertical structure of convection between the two tropical land regions and the Warm Pool suggest that deep convection over the two tropical land regions contains more intense cores. (3) Deep convective outflow occurs at a higher level when the midtroposphere is more humid and the convective system size is smaller. The convective system size dependence is postulated to be related to convective lifecycle, highlighting the importance of cloud life stage information in interpretation of snapshot measurements by satellite. Finally, implications of the study to global modeling are discussed.

These comparisons aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the typical uncertainties in the observational database which can be considered in subsequent observational and modelling studies. For the amplitudes, a good agreement of their latitude and altitude distribution was found. Quantitatively there were differences in particular at high latitudes, close to the tropopause and in the lower mesosphere. In these regions, the standard deviation over all data sets typically exceeded 0.2 ppmv for the annual variation and 0.1 ppmv for the semi-annual and quasi-biennial variation. For the phase, larger differences between the data sets were found in the lower mesosphere. Generally the smallest phase uncertainties can be observed in regions where the amplitude of the variability is large. The standard deviations of the phases for all data sets were typically smaller than a month for the annual and semi-annual variation and smaller than 5 months for the quasi-biennial variation. The amplitude and phase differences among the data sets are caused by a combination of factors. In general, differences in the temporal variation of systematic errors and in the observational sampling play a dominant role. In addition, differences in the vertical resolution of the data, the considered time periods and influences of clouds, aerosols as well as non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects cause differences between the individual data sets.

J	Gonzalez, AO; Jiang, XA				Gonzalez, Alex O.; Jiang, Xianan			Winter mean lower tropospheric moisture over the Maritime Continent as a climate model diagnostic metric for the propagation of the Madden-Julian oscillation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							STATIC ENERGY BUDGET; TROPICAL INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION; EASTWARD PROPAGATION; VERTICAL STRUCTURE; MJO; PRECIPITATION; DISTURBANCES; CONVECTION; PACIFIC	Despite its widespread influences on the atmosphere, the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) remains poorly represented in state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs). Motivated by recent findings that the horizontal advection of the mean low-tropospheric moist static energy or moisture by the MJO winds plays a crucial role in the eastward propagation of the MJO, we investigate the relationship between lower tropospheric moisture patterns over the Indo-Pacific and MJO eastward propagation in a suite of 23 GCM simulations. Model capability of reproducing the observed November-April mean lower tropospheric moisture pattern over the Indo-Pacific, especially near the Maritime Continent (MC), is highly correlated with model skill in simulating MJO eastward propagation. In GCMs with difficulty capturing realistic MJO propagation, the amplitude of the mean low-level moisture over the MC is greatly underestimated, leading to weak horizontal moisture gradients and thus discrepancies in moisture advection, significantly affecting MJO propagation. This study suggests that the mean lower tropospheric moisture pattern over the MC can serve as an important diagnostic metric for MJO propagation in climate models.

Ground-based High Spectral Resolution Lidar observation of aerosol vertical distribution in the summertime Southeast United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							OPTICAL DEPTH; CLOUD; LAYER; SURFACE; EXTINCTION; EMISSIONS; PROFILES; TRENDS; IMPACT; TROPOPAUSE	As part of the Southeast United States-based Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS), and collinear with part of the Southeast Atmosphere Study, the University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar system was deployed to the University of Alabama from 19 June to 4 November 2013. With a collocated Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer, a nearby Chemical Speciation Network (PM2.5) measurement station, and near daily ozonesonde releases for the August-September SEAC(4)RS campaign, the site allowed the region's first comprehensive diurnal monitoring of aerosol particle vertical structure. A 532nm lidar ratio of 55 sr provided good closure between aerosol backscatter and AERONET (aerosol optical thickness, AOT). A principle component analysis was performed to identify key modes of variability in aerosol backscatter. "Fair weather" days exhibited classic planetary boundary layer structure of a mixed layer accounting for similar to 50% of AOT and an entrainment zone providing another 25%. An additional 5-15% of variance is gained from the lower free troposphere from either convective detrainment or frequent intrusions of western United States biomass burning smoke. Generally, aerosol particles were contained below the 0 degrees C level, a common level of stability in convective regimes. However, occasional strong injections of smoke to the upper troposphere were also observed, accounting for the remaining 10-15% variability in AOT. Examples of these common modes of variability in frontal and convective regimes are presented, demonstrating why AOT often has only a weak relationship to surface PM2.5 concentration.

Can significant trends be detected in surface air temperature and precipitation over South America in recent decades?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						temperature trends; precipitation trends; South America; CMIP5 models	EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; COUPLED MODEL; BASIC EVALUATION; CLIMATE; RAINFALL; PACIFIC; CMIP5; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; STREAMFLOW	Trends in near-surface air temperature and precipitation over South America are examined for the periods 1975-2004 and 1955-2004, respectively, using multiple observational and climate model data sets. The results for observed near-surface air temperature show an overall warming trend over much of the continent, with the largest magnitudes over central Brazil. These observed trends are found to be statistically significant using pre-industrial control simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as the baseline to estimate natural climate variability. The observed trends are compared with those obtained in natural-only CMIP5 simulations, in which only natural forcings (i.e. volcanoes and solar variability) are included, and in historical CMIP5 simulations, in which anthropogenic forcings (i.e. changes in the atmospheric composition) are further incorporated. The historical CMIP5 simulations are more successful in capturing the observed temperature trends than the simulations with natural forcings only. It is suggested that anthropogenic warming is already evident over much of South America. Unlike the warming trends, observed precipitation trends over South America are less spatially coherent with both negative and positive values across the continent. Significant positive trends are found over South America in only one of the data sets used, and over a region that roughly encompasses the southern part of La Plata Basin (southern Brazil, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina) in all data sets used. The historical CMIP5 simulations do not capture this feature. No firm conclusions are reached, therefore, for anthropogenic influences on precipitation changes in the period selected for study.

Here we use Landsat-8 imagery and ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 radar interferometry data combined with data from the European seismology network to describe the source of the December 7, 2015, Mw7.2 Murghab (Tajikistan) earthquake. The earthquake reactivated a similar to 79 km-long section of the Sarez-Karakul Fault, a NE oriented sinistral, trans-tensional fault in northern Pamir. Pixel offset data delineate the geometry of the surface break and line of sight ground shifts from two descending and three ascending interferograms constrain the fault dip and slip solution. Two right stepping, NE-striking segments connected by a more easterly oriented segment, sub-vertical or steeply dipping to the west were involved. The solution shows two main patches of slip with up to 3.5 m of left lateral slip on the southern and central fault segments. The northern segment has a left-lateral and normal oblique slip of up to a meter. Back-projection of high-frequency seismic waves recorded by the European network, processed using the Multitaper-MUSIC approach, focuses sharply along the surface break. The time progression of the high-frequency radiators shows that, after a 10 second initiation phase at slow speed, the rupture progresses in 2 phases at super-shear velocity (similar to 4.3-5 km/s) separated by a 3 second interval of slower propagation corresponding to the passage through the restraining bend. The intensity of the high-frequency radiation reaches maxima during the initial and middle phases of slow propagation and is reduced by 50% during the super-shear phases of the propagation. These findings are consistent with studies of other strike-slip earthquakes in continental domain, showing the importance of fault geometric complexities in controlling the speed of fault propagation and related spatiotemporal pattern of the high-frequency radiation.

Isolating blocks as computational tools in the circular restricted three-body problem	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						Circular restricted three-body problem; Isolating blocks; Invariant manifolds; Invariant 3-sphere	ORBITS	Isolating blocks may be used as computational tools to search for the invariant manifolds of orbits and hyperbolic invariant sets associated with libration points while also giving additional insight into the dynamics of the flow in these regions. We use isolating blocks to investigate the dynamics of objects entering the Earth-Moon system in the circular restricted three-body problem with energies close to the energy of the L-2 libration point. Specifically, the stable and unstable manifolds of Lyapunov orbits and the hyperbolic invariant set around the libration points are obtained by numerically computing the way orbits exit from an isolating block in combination with a bisection method. Invariant spheres of solutions in the spatial problem may then be located using the resulting manifolds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photogrammetry-based surface measurements are performed for laminates cured at elevated temperatures. Significant out-of-plane shape errors are observed, with amplitudes 75 times the laminate thickness. The magnitude of each imperfection is also characterized experimentally on coupon-level samples. A non-linear finite element model is developed and demonstrates that these imperfections result in cylindrical and twisting modes of deformation. Results are compared to Classical Lamination Theory predictions which are shown to be inadequate in predicting shape errors that require changes in Gaussian curvature. Through these studies, it is determined that thickness variations between the top and bottom plies have the most pronounced effect on shape errors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Climatic influence on corn sowing date in the Midwestern United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						corn (maize); sowing date; climatic influence; the Midwestern United Sates	RAIN-FED CONDITIONS; PLANTING DATE; POTENTIAL IMPACT; NORTH-AMERICA; MAIZE YIELDS; CROP MODEL; PHENOLOGY; AGRICULTURE; TRENDS; SEASON	This study investigated the climatic influence on the corn sowing date in the Midwestern United States by comparing the survey data of corn cultivation with meteorological records in nine states for the last 36years (1979-2014). The results show that the year-to-year changes in the sowing date were significantly affected by springtime air temperature and precipitation in the nine states, although large state-to-state differences were found in the degree of sowing date-meteorology relationship. We determined that the 36-year climatological warm period (CWP) with daily mean temperatures 10 degrees C plays an important role in the state-to-state differences. For the states with longer CWPs, the influence of air temperature (precipitation) was generally weaker (stronger). This observed counteractive relationship should be considered for crop modelling for more effective assessment of the impact of climate change on agriculture.

Validation of SMAP surface soil moisture products with core validation sites	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAP; Soil moisture; Validation	TEMPORAL STABILITY; WATER CONTENT; SATELLITE; NETWORK; CALIBRATION; RETRIEVALS; SCALES; MAQU	The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has utilized a set of core validation sites as the primary methodology in assessing the soil moisture retrieval algorithm performance. Those sites provide well calibrated in situ soil moisture measurements within SMAP product grid pixels for diverse conditions and locations. The estimation of the average soil moisture within the SMAP product grid pixels based on in situ measurements is more reliable when location specific calibration of the sensors has been performed and there is adequate replication over the spatial domain, with an up-scaling function based on analysis using independent estimates of the soil moisture distribution. SMAP fulfilled these requirements through a collaborative Cal/Val Partner program. This paper presents the results from 34 candidate core validation sites for the first eleven months of the SMAP mission. As a result of the screening of the sites prior to the availability of SMAP data, out of the 34 candidate sites 18 sites fulfilled all the requirements at one of the resolution scales (at least). The rest of the sites are used as secondary information in algorithm evaluation. The results indicate that the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture data product meets its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) volumetric soil moisture (unbiased root mean square error); the combined radar-radiometer product is close to its expected performance of 0.04 m(3)/m(3), and the radar-based product meets its target accuracy of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) (the lengths of the combined and radar-based products are truncated to about 10 weeks because of the SMAP radar failure). Upon completing the intensive Cal/Val phase of the mission the SMAP project will continue to enhance the products in the primary and extended geographic domains, in co-operation with the Cal/Val Partners, by continuing the comparisons over the existing core validation sites and inclusion of candidate sites that can address shortcomings.

Surface composition of pull-apart bands in Argadnel Regio, Europa: Evidence of localized cryovolcanic resurfacing during basin formation	ICARUS			English	Article						Europa; Galileo; NIMS; SSI; Bands	SULFURIC-ACID; GALILEAN SATELLITES; CHAOS TERRAIN; GRAIN-SIZE; WATER ICE; RADIOLYSIS; ORIGIN; SEPARATION; EVOLUTION; MINERALS	We combine Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) data to investigate the composition of pull-apart bands in Europa's Argadnel Regio. Using spectral linear mixture modeling employing cryogenic laboratory reference spectra, we find that bands of intermediate age ("grey" bands) are compositionally distinct from bands that are stratigraphically younger ("dark" bands). The grey bands have higher abundances of larger ice grains and lower abundances of hydrated salts than the dark bands; both of these tendencies are statistically significant at the 1% level. The grey and dark bands have similar abundances of hexahydrite, a material which is relatively stable under irradiation; however, the derived abundances of frozen magnesium sulfate brine and of mirabilite, which are more susceptible to fragmentation by radiation, are significantly higher in the dark bands than in the grey bands. These results are consistent with a physical model in which the differences in composition and in ice grain sizes are linked to space weathering and radiolytic processing levels; the grey bands have presumably undergone higher levels of processing, due to being exposed on Europa's surface for a longer period of time. One prominent wedge-shaped band exhibits an anomalous albedo variation across its northern portion, appearing dark in its top third, and grey in its southernmost two-thirds. We find that the dark part of the band has a modeled composition that is in-family with other dark bands, while the grey portion has a modeled composition that is indistinguishable from other grey bands in the study area. Because these variations cannot easily be attributed to the band's formation mechanism (bands open sequentially along a central axis), we surmise that the northern part has been resurfaced, probably in response to the formation of a large topographic basin that cuts through the band. Faulting accompanying basin formation may provide conduits allowing transport to the surface of materials from Europa's interior. We hypothesize that the formation of the basin resulted in fresh cryovolcanic material being deposited across the northern portion of the band, effectively "resetting" its surface age. If, as has been suggested, the giant arcuate basins resulted from an episode of true polar wander, our study may help to more tightly constrain the age of that event within Europa's geologic column.

High energy electron sintering of icy regoliths: Formation of the PacMan thermal anomalies on the icy Saturnian moons	ICARUS			English	Article							E-RING; SURFACE; INTERSTELLAR; ENCELADUS; ORIGIN; ION; CONDUCTIVITY; EVOLUTION; DIFFUSION; CONTACT	The so-called 'PacMan' features on the leading hemispheres of the icy Saturnian moons of Mimas, Tethys and Dione were initially identified as anomalous optical discolorations and subsequently shown to have greater thermal inertia than the surrounding regions. The shape of these regions matches calculated deposition contours of high energy plasma electrons moving opposite to the moon's orbital direction, thus suggesting that electron interactions with the grains produce the observed anomalies. Here, descriptions of radiation-induced diffusion processes are given, and various sintering models are considered to calculate the rate of increase in the contact volume between grains in an icy regolith. Estimates of the characteristic sintering timescale, i.e. the time necessary for the thermal inertia to increase from that measured outside the anomalous regions to that within, are given for each of the moons. Since interplanetary dust particle (IDP) impact gardening and E-ring grain infall would be expected to mix the regolith and obscure the effects of high energy electrons, sintering rates are compared to rough estimates of the impact-induced resurfacing rates. Estimates of the sintering timescale determined by extrapolating laboratory measurements are below similar to 0.03 Myr, while the regolith renewal timescales are larger than similar to 0.1 Myr, thus indicating that irradiation by the high energy electrons should be sufficient to form stable thermal anomalies. More detailed models developed for sintering of spherical grains are able to account for the radiation-induced anomalies on Mimas and Tethys only if the regoliths on those bodies are relatively compact and composed of small (less than or similar to 5 mu m) grains or grain aggregates, and/or the grains are highly non-spherical with surface defect densities in the inter-grain contact regions that are much higher than expected for crystalline water ice grains at thermal equilibrium. These results are consistent with regolith thermal conductivity models which can only be reconciled with spacecraft observations if the contacts between grains are assumed to have much lower thermal conductance than predicted for idealized grains. The strength of the anomalies on Tethys and Dione appear to be limited by E-ring grain infall, while on Mimas IDP gardening limits the strength of the anomaly. The smaller flux of more deeply penetrating high energy (>1 MeV) electrons on Dione can account for the small thermal inertia differences measured there. Determining regolith sintering rates and the corresponding effect on thermal conductivity can, in principle, provide an independent constraint on the regolith grain geometries and exposure timescales for icy bodies.

Radar probing of Jovian icy moons: Understanding subsurface water and structure detectability in the JUICE and Europa missions	ICARUS			English	Article						Radar; Dielectric; Ganymede; Europa; Callisto; JUICE	GALILEAN SATELLITES; CRATERING RATES; GROOVED TERRAIN; SURFACE; OCEANS; CONSTRAINTS; TOPOGRAPHY; DEPOSITS; MODELS; BRINE	Radar probing of Jovian icy satellites is fundamental for understanding the moons' origin and their thermal evolution as potential habitable environments in our Solar System. Using the current state of knowledge of the geological and geophysical properties of Ganymede, Europa and Callisto, we perform a comprehensive radar detectability study to quantify the exploration depth and the lower limit for subsurface identification of water and key tectonic structural elements. To achieve these objectives, we establish parametric dielectric models that reflect different hypotheses on the formation and thermal evolution of each moon. The models are then used for FDTD radar propagation simulations at the 9-MHz sounding frequency proposed for both ESA JUICE and NASA Europa missions. We investigate the detectability above the galactic noise level of four predominant subsurface features: brittle-ductile interfaces, shallow faults, brine aquifers, and the hypothesized global oceans. For Ganymede, our results suggest that the brittle-ductile interface could be within radar detectability range in the bright terrains, but is more challenging for the dark terrains. Moreover, understanding the slope variation of the brittle-ductile interface is possible after clutter reduction and focusing. For Europa, the detection of shallow subsurface structural elements few kilometers deep (such as fractures, faults and brine lenses) is achievable and not compromised by surface clutter. The objective of detecting the potential deep global ocean on Europa is also doable under both the convective and conductive hypotheses. Finally, for Callisto, radar waves can achieve an average penetration depth of 15 km, although the current understanding of Callisto's subsurface dielectric properties does not suggest sufficiently strong contrasts to produce unambiguous radar returns.

Heat transport in the high-pressure ice mantle of large icy moons	ICARUS			English	Article						Ganymede; Titan; Callisto; Ices; Interiors	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; THERMAL EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; CONVECTION; PHASE; OCEAN; DEFORMATION; MECHANISM; GANYMEDE; CALLISTO	While the existence of a buried ocean sandwiched between surface ice and high-pressure (HP) poly morphs of ice emerges as the most plausible structure for the hundreds-of-kilometers thick hydrospheres within large icy moons of the Solar System (Ganymede, Callisto, Titan), little is known about the thermal structure of the deep HP ice mantle and its dynamics, possibly involving melt production and extraction. This has major implications for the thermal history of these objects as well as on the habitability of their ocean as the HP ice mantle is presumed to limit chemical transport from the rock component to the ocean. Here, we describe 3D spherical simulations of subsolidus thermal convection tailored to the specific structure of the HP ice mantle of large icy moons. Melt production is monitored and melt transport is simplified by assuming instantaneous extraction to the ocean above. The two controlling parameters for these models are the rheology of ice VI and the heat flux from the rock core. Reasonable end-members are considered for both parameters as disagreement remains on the former (especially the pressure effect on viscosity) and as the latter is expected to vary significantly during the moon's history. We show that the heat power produced by radioactive decay within the rock core is mainly transported through the HP ice mantle by melt extraction to the ocean, with most of the melt produced directly above the rock/water interface. While the average temperature in the bulk of the HP ice mantle is always relatively cool when compared to the value at the interface with the rock core (similar to 5 K above the value at the surface of the HP ice mantle), maximum temperatures at all depths are close to the melting point, often leading to the interconnection of a melt path via hot convective plume conduits throughout the HP ice mantle. Overall, we predict long periods of time during these moons' history where water generated in contact with the rock core is transported to the above ocean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The models included in the comparison are the 3-D chemistry transport model 3dCTM, the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, FinROSE, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMO-NIA), the Karlsruhe Simulation Model of the Middle Atmosphere (KASIMA), the modelling tools for SOlar Climate Ozone Links studies (SOCOL and CAO-SOCOL), and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM4). The comparison focuses on the energetic particle precipitation (EPP) indirect effect, that is, the polar winter descent of NOx largely produced by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A particular emphasis is given to the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in January 2009 and the subsequent elevated stratopause (ES) event associated with enhanced descent of mesospheric air. The chemistry climate model simulations have been nudged toward reanalysis data in the troposphere and stratosphere while being unconstrained above. An odd nitrogen upper boundary condition obtained from MIPAS observations has further been applied to medium-top models. Most models provide a good representation of the mesospheric tracer descent in general, and the EPP indirect effect in particular, during the unperturbed (pre-SSW) period of the NH winter 2008/2009. The observed NOx descent into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere is generally reproduced within 20 %. Larger discrepancies of a few model simulations could be traced back either to the impact of the models' gravity wave drag scheme on the polar wintertime meridional circulation or to a combination of prescribed NOx mixing ratio at the uppermost model layer and low vertical resolution. In March-April, after the ES event, however, modelled mesospheric and stratospheric NOx distributions deviate significantly from the observations. The too-fast and early downward propagation of the NO x tongue, encountered in most simulations, coincides with a temperature high bias in the lower mesosphere (0.2-0.05 hPa), likely caused by an overestimation of descent velocities. In contrast, upper-mesospheric temperatures (at 0.05-0.001 hPa) are generally underestimated by the high-top models after the onset of the ES event, being indicative for too-slow descent and hence too-low NOx fluxes. As a consequence, the magnitude of the simulated NOx tongue is generally underestimated by these models. Descending NOx amounts simulated with mediumtop models are on average closer to the observations but show a large spread of up to several hundred percent. This is primarily attributed to the different vertical model domains in which the NOx upper boundary condition is applied. In general, the intercomparison demonstrates the ability of state-of- the-art atmospheric models to reproduce the EPP indirect effect in dynamically and geomagnetically quiescent NH winter conditions. The encountered differences between observed and simulated NOx, CO, and temperature distributions during the perturbed phase of the 2009 NH winter, however, emphasize the need for model improvements in the dynamical representation of elevated stratopause events in order to allow for a better description of the EPP indirect effect under these particular conditions.

Hydrological controls on the tropospheric ozone greenhouse gas effect	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; RADIATION; EMISSIONS; IMPACT	The influence of the hydrological cycle in the greenhouse gas (GHG) effect of tropospheric ozone (O-3) is quantified in terms of the O-3 longwave radiative effect (LWRE), which is defined as the net reduction of top-of-atmosphere flux due to total tropospheric O-3 absorption. The O-3 LWRE derived from the infrared spectral measurements by Aura's Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) show that the spatiotemporal variation of LWRE is relevant to relative humidity, surface temperature, and tropospheric O-3 column. The zonally averaged subtropical LWRE is similar to 0.2 W m(-2) higher than the zonally averaged tropical LWRE, generally due to lower water vapor concentrations and less cloud coverage at the downward branch of the Hadley cell in the subtropics. The largest values of O-3 LWRE over the Middle East (> 1 W/m(2)) are further due to large thermal contrasts and tropospheric ozone enhancements from atmospheric circulation and pollution. Conversely, the low O-3 LWRE over the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (on average 0.4 W m(-2)) is due to strong water vapor absorption and cloudiness, both of which reduce the tropospheric O-3 absorption in the longwave radiation. These results show that changes in the hydrological cycle due to climate change could affect the magnitude and distribution of ozone radiative forcing.

We evaluated the instrument's capability to distinguish the subsurface elemental composition of primary rock forming elements such as 0, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K and Fe. Our study uses heritage from previous ground and field tests and applies to the analysis of gamma lines from activation reaction products generated by a pulsed neutron generator. We have estimated that the expected accuracies achieved in this approach could be as high as 1-10% for the particular chemical element being studied.	[Litvak, M. L.; Sanin, A. B.; Golovin, D.

They were formed in about the first 3 Myr of the solar system's history. This timescale is longer than that of Mars formation, and it is conceivable that protoplanets, planetesimals, and chondrules might have existed simultaneously in the solar nebula. Due to protoplanets' perturbation on the planetesimal dynamics and chondrule accretion on them, all the formed chondrules are unlikely to be accreted by the planetesimals. We investigate the amount of chondrules accreted by planetesimals in such a condition. We assume that a protoplanet is in oligarchic growth, and we perform analytical calculations of chondrule accretion by both a protoplanet and planetesimals. Through the oligarchic growth stage, planetesimals accrete about half of the formed chondrules. The smallest planetesimals get the largest amount of chondrules, compared with the amount accreted by more massive planetesimals. We perform a parameter study and find that this fraction is not greatly changed for a wide range of parameter sets.

Onorbit ILS functions for all three bands of the OCO-2 instrument have been derived using its frequent solar measurements and high-resolution solar reference spectra. The solar reference spectrum generated from the 2016 version of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) solar line list shows significant improvements in the fitting residual compared to the solar reference spectrum currently used in the version 7 Level 2 algorithm in the O-2 A band. The analytical functions used to represent the ILS of previous grating spectrometers are found to be inadequate for the OCO-2 ILS. Particularly, the hybrid Gaussian and super-Gaussian functions may introduce spurious variations, up to 5% of the ILS width, depending on the spectral sampling position, when there is a spectral undersampling. Fitting a homogeneous stretch of the preflight ILS together with the relative widening of the wings of the ILS is insensitive to the sampling grid position and accurately captures the variation of ILS in the O2 A band between decontamination events. These temporal changes of ILS may explain the spurious signals observed in the solar-induced fluorescence retrieval in barren areas.

Submarine Basaltic Glass Colonization by the Heterotrophic Fe(II)-Oxidizing and Siderophore-Producing Deep-Sea Bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri VS-10: The Potential Role of Basalt in Enhancing Growth	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						biofilm; basalt; Fe(II) oxidation; microbial fuel cell; siderophores; diffusion chamber	SHEWANELLA-ONEIDENSIS MR-1; MICROBIAL FUEL-CELLS; EXTRACELLULAR ELECTRON-TRANSFER; IRON-OXIDIZING BACTERIA; HYDROTHERMAL PLUMES; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; MARINE BASALTS; LOIHI SEAMOUNT; FLOOR BASALT; OCEAN CRUST	Phylogenetically and metabolically diverse bacterial communities have been found in association with submarine basaltic glass surfaces. The driving forces behind basalt colonization are for the most part unknown. It remains ambiguous if basalt provides ecological advantages beyond representing a substrate for surface colonization, such as supplying nutrients and/or energy. Pseudomonas stutzeri VS-10, a metabolically versatile bacterium isolated from Vailulu'u Seamount, was used as a model organism to investigate the physiological responses observed when biofilms are established on basaltic glasses. In Fe-limited heterotrophic media, P. stutzeri VS-10 exhibited elevated growth in the presence of basaltic glass. Diffusion chamber experiments demonstrated that physical attachment or contact of soluble metabolites such as siderophores with the basaltic glass plays a pivotal role in this process. Electrochemical data indicated that P. stutzeri VS-10 is able to use solid substrates (electrodes) as terminal electron donors and acceptors. Siderophore production and heterotrophic Fe(II) oxidation are discussed as potential mechanisms enhancing growth of P. stutzeri VS-10 on glass surfaces. In correlation with that we discuss the possibility that metabolic versatility could represent a common and beneficial physiological trait in marine microbial communities being subject to oligotrophic and rapidly changing deep-sea conditions.

To understand the origin of the difference in the observed L-X-L-MIR relations, we study a sample of 3247 spectroscopically confirmed type 1 AGNs collected from Bootes, XMM-COSMOS, XMM-XXL-North, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars in the Swift/XRT footprint spanning over four orders of magnitude in luminosity. We carefully examine how different observational constraints impact the observed L-X-L-MIR relations, including the inclusion of X-ray-nondetected objects, possible X-ray absorption in type 1 AGNs, X-ray flux limits, and star formation contamination. We find that the primary factor driving the different L-X-L-MIR relations reported in the literature is the X-ray flux limits for different studies. When taking these effects into account, we find that the X-ray luminosity and mid-IR luminosity (measured at rest-frame 6 mu m, or L-6 mu m) of our sample of type 1 AGNs follow a bilinear relation in the log-log plane: log L-X = (0.84 +/- 0.03) logL(6) (mu m) /10(45)erg s(-1) + (44.60. +/- 0.01) for L-6 (mu m) < 10(44.79) erg s(-1), and log L-X (0.40 +/- 0.03) log L-6 (mu m)/10(45) erg s(-1) + (44.51 +/- 0.01) for L-6 mu m. 1044.79 erg s(-1). This suggests that the luminous type 1 quasars have a shallower LX-L6mmcorrelation than the approximately linear relations found in local Seyfert galaxies. This result is consistent with previous studies reporting a luminosity-dependent LX-LMIRrelation and implies that assuming a linear LX-L-6 mu m relation to infer the neutral gas column density for X-ray absorption might overestimate the column densities in luminous quasars.

Optical Spectroscopic Campaign and Emission-line Analysis for NGC 5548	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (NGC 5548); galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; AGN MONITORING PROJECT; BLACK-HOLE MASSES; RADIUS-LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIP; VELOCITY-DELAY MAPS; HOST-GALAXY STARLIGHT; H-BETA; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; ACCRETION DISK; REGION SIZES	We present the results of an optical spectroscopic monitoring program targeting NGC 5548 as part of a larger multiwavelength reverberation mapping campaign. The campaign spanned 6 months and achieved an almost daily cadence with observations from five ground-based telescopes. The H beta and He II lambda 4686 broad emission-line light curves lag that of the 5100 angstrom optical continuum by 4.17(-0.36)(+0.36) days and 0.79(-0.34)(+0.35) days, respectively. The H beta lag relative to the 1158 angstrom ultraviolet continuum light curve measured by the Hubble Space Telescope is similar to 50% longer than that measured against the optical continuum, and the lag difference is consistent with the observed lag between the optical and ultraviolet continua. This suggests that the characteristic radius of the broad-line region is similar to 50% larger than the value inferred from optical data alone. We also measured velocity-resolved emission-line lags for H beta and found a complex velocity-lag structure with shorter lags in the line wings, indicative of a broadline region dominated by Keplerian motion. The responses of both the H beta and He II emission lines to the driving continuum changed significantly halfway through the campaign, a phenomenon also observed for C IV, Lya, He II (+ O III]), and Si IV(+ O IV]) during the same monitoring period. Finally, given the optical luminosity of NGC 5548 during our campaign, the measured H beta lag is a factor of five shorter than the expected value implied by the R-BLR-L-AGN relation based on the past behavior of NGC 5548.

J	de Putter, R; Dore, O; Green, D; Meyers, J				de Putter, Roland; Dore, Olivier; Green, Daniel; Meyers, Joel			Single-field inflation and the local ansatz: Distinguishability and consistency	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							NON-GAUSSIANITY; MODEL	The single-field consistency conditions and the local ansatz have played separate but important roles in characterizing the non-Gaussian signatures of single-and multifield inflation respectively. We explore the precise relationship between these two approaches and their predictions. We demonstrate that the predictions of the single-field consistency conditions can never be satisfied by a general local ansatz with deviations necessarily arising at order (n(s) - 1)(2). This implies that there is, in principle, a minimum difference between single-and (fully local) multifield inflation in observables sensitive to the squeezed limit such as scale-dependent halo bias. We also explore some potential observational implications of the consistency conditions and its relationship to the local ansatz. In particular, we propose a new scheme to test the consistency relations. In analogy with delensing of the cosmic microwave background, one can deproject the coupling of the long wavelength modes with the short wavelength modes and test for residual anomalous coupling.

Size, Shape, Orbit, and Yarkovsky Drift from Radar Observations	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; minor planets, asteroids: individual (1566 Icarus); planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability; planets and satellites: surfaces; techniques: radar astronomy	NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS; OBJECTS; REGOLITH; ARECIBO; MODEL; SPIN	Near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 1566 Icarus (a = 1.08 au, e. = 0.83, i = 22 degrees.8) made a close approach to Earth in 2015 June at 22 lunar distances (LD). Its detection during the 1968 approach (16 LD) was the first in the history of asteroid radar astronomy. A subsequent approach in 1996 (40 LD) did not yield radar images. We describe analyses of our 2015 radar observations of Icarus obtained at the Arecibo Observatory and the DSS-14 antenna at Goldstone. These data show that the asteroid is a moderately flattened spheroid with an equivalent diameter of 1.44 km with 18% uncertainties, resolving long-standing questions about the asteroid size. We also solve for Icarus's spin-axis orientation (lambda = 270 degrees +/- 10 degrees, beta= -81 degrees +/- 10 degrees), which is not consistent with the estimates based on the 1968 light-curve observations. Icarus has a strongly specular scattering behavior, among the highest ever measured in asteroid radar observations, and a radar albedo of similar to 2%, among the lowest ever measured in asteroid radar observations. The low cross section suggests a high-porosity surface, presumably related to Icarus's cratering, spin, and thermal histories. Finally, we present the first use of our orbit-determination software for the generation of observational ephemerides, and we demonstrate its ability to determine subtle perturbations on NEA orbits by measuring Icarus's orbit-averaged drift in semimajor axis ((-4.62 +/- 0.48) x 10(-4) au My(-1), or similar to 60 m per revolution). Our Yarkovsky rate measurement resolves a discrepancy between two published rates that did not include the 2015 radar astrometry.

Kinematics and properties of the central molecular zone as probed with [C II]	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: ISM; Galaxy: center; ISM: clouds; ISM: atoms	GALACTIC-CENTER REGION; XMM-NEWTON; RADIO ARC; GAS; CLOUDS; LINE; FILAMENTS; COMPLEX; MASERS	Context. The Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ) is a region containing massive and dense molecular clouds, with dynamics driven by a variety of energy sources including a massive black hole. It is thus the nearest template for understanding physical processes in extragalactic nuclei. The CMZ's neutral interstellar gas has been mapped spectrally in many neutral atomic and molecular gas tracers, but the ionized and CO-dark H-2 regions are less well traced spectroscopically. Aims. We identify features of the UV irradiated neutral gas, photon dominated regions (PDRs) and CO-dark H2, and highly ionized gas in the CMZ as traced by the fine structure line of C+ at 158 mu m, [C II], and characterize their properties. Methods. We observed the [C II] 158 mu m fine structure line with high spectral resolution using Herschel HIFI with two perpendicular on-the-fly strip scans, along l = -0 degrees.8 to +0 degrees.8 and b = -0 degrees.8 to +0 degrees.8, both centered on (l, b) = (0 degrees, 0 degrees). We analyze the spatial-velocity distribution of the [C II] data, compare them to those of [C II] and CO, and to dust continuum maps, in order to determine the properties and distribution of the ionized and neutral gas and its dynamics within the CMZ. Results. The longitude-and latitude-velocity maps of [C II] trace portions of the orbiting open gas streams of dense molecular clouds, the cloud G0.253 + 0.016, also known as the Brick, the arched filaments, the ionized gas within several pc of Sgr A and Sgr B2, and the warm dust bubble. We use the [C II] data to determine the physical and dynamical properties of these CMZ features. Conclusions. The bright far-IR 158 mu m C+ line, [C II], when observed with high spatial and spectral resolution, traces a wide range of emission features in the CMZ. The [C II] emission arises primarily from dense PDRs and highly ionized gas, and is an important tracer of the kinematics and physical conditions of this gas.	[Langer, W.

J	Holzmann, GJ				Holzmann, Gerard J.			Cobra: a light-weight tool for static and dynamic program analysis	INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Static analysis; Source code analysis; Lightweight tools; Token expression matching; Dynamic analysis; Runtime verification		Static source code analysis tools have become indispensable for the development of reliable software applications. The best analyzers can reveal subtle flaws in a code base, but they can also be slow. In part this is due to the collection of detailed information about the possible data and control flow of an application to support the broadest possible range of analyses. For larger code bases it is not unusual that even the best of breed static analyzers can take an hour or more to complete an analysis. In this paper we describe a framework for a much faster, but more light-weight type of static analysis that can support interactive use for standard types of queries. The Cobra tool we designed for this purpose can scale to explore millions of lines of code interactively. The tool is mostly language agnostic, and can therefore easily be configured to resolve even dynamic program analysis queries.

J	Liu, WT; Xie, XS				Liu, W. Timothy; Xie, Xiaosu			Premonsoon Drought in India Observed from Space	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							SOIL-MOISTURE; MONSOON; KERALA; ONSET; DEFINITION; VALIDATION; INDEX	Satellite observations between 2007 and 2015 are used to characterize the annual occurrence of the pre-monsoon drought (PMD), which causes human death and economic hardship in India, and to postulate its scientific causes. The PMD is identified as the driest and hottest weeks in central India just before the summer monsoon onset. The onset is marked by a sharp increase in precipitation and soil moisture and a decrease in air temperature. The difference between integrated moisture transported in from the Arabian Sea and out to the Bay of Bengal is largely deposited as rain over land during the summer monsoon. The PMD occurs during the short period when moisture is drawn out to the Bay of Bengal before it can be replenished from the Arabian Sea. The time gap is caused by the earlier start of summer monsoon (southwest) winds in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea. Sea surface temperature rise precedes the start of summer monsoon wind in both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and it has the potential to give advance warning of the PMD and thus allow mitigation of the adverse effects.

To help elucidate our understanding of Europa's surface composition, we have conducted a study of frozen chloride salt brines prepared under simulated Europa surface conditions (vacuum and temperature) using both near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopies. The latter was used to determine the hydration states of various chloride salts as a function of the temperature, while NIR spectroscopy of identically prepared samples was used to provide reference reflectance spectra of the identified hydrated salts. We further investigated the stability of the formed hydrated salts under vacuum and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Our results indicate that, at temperatures ranging from 80 to 233 K, (i) NaCl center dot 2H(2)O is formed from the freezing of NaCl brines, (ii) freezing of KCl solutions does not form KCl hydrates, (iii) freezing of MgCl2 solutions forms a stable hexahydrate, and (iv) freezing of CaCl2 solutions forms a hexahydrate. Dehydration of the salts was observed as temperatures were increased, leading to a succession of hydration states in the case of CaCl2 (hexahydrate -> tetrahydrate -> dihydrate). Similarly, UV irradiation is also found to induce progressive loss of water from the hydration shell of NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 hydrates.

Observed amplitude and phase scintillations of L1CA, L2C, and L5 signals during auroral electrojet activities driven by space weather disturbances show the following three types: continuous, intermittent, and spike (sudden intensity drop). The relations of scintillation strength between different signals are derived for carrier phase, signal intensity, and code-carrier divergence fluctuations, showing precise linear relation, de-correlation, and different linear fitting slope, respectively. These relations can help predict phase scintillation behavior of one signal from measurements of another, except for amplitude scintillation. Experiments of precise point positioning show that phase data degradation due to scintillation can cause significant positioning error increase if the scintillation effects are not considered carefully in GNSS data processing and design of positioning approaches.

An Infrared Study of the Dust Properties and Geometry of the Arched Filaments HII Region with SOFIA/FORCAST	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxy: center; H II regions	COMPACT YOUNG CLUSTERS; GALACTIC-CENTER ARC; RADIO ARC; MIDINFRARED CAMERA; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; MASSIVE STARS; MILKY-WAY; MU-M; EMISSION; EXTINCTION	Massive stellar clusters provide radiation (similar to 10(7)-10(8) L-circle dot) and winds (similar to 1000 km s(-1)) that act to heat dust and shape their surrounding environment. In this paper, the Arched Filaments in the Galactic center were studied to better understand the influence of the Arches cluster on its nearby interstellar medium (ISM). The Arched Filaments were observed with the Faint Object InfraRed CAMera for the SOFIA Telescope at 19.7, 25.2, 31.5, and 37.1 mu m. Color temperature maps of the region created with the 25.2 and 37.1 mu m data reveal relatively uniform dust temperatures (70-100 K) over the extent of the filaments (similar to 25 pc). Distances between the cluster and the filaments were calculated assuming equilibrium heating of standard-size ISM dust grains (similar to 0.1 mu m). The distances inferred by this method are in conflict with the projected distance between the filaments and the cluster, although this inconsistency can be explained if the characteristic grain size in the filaments is smaller (similar to 0.01 mu m) than typical values. DustEM models of selected locations within the filaments show evidence of depleted abundances of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by factors of similar to 1.6-10 by mass compared to the diffuse ISM. The evidence for both PAH depletion and a smaller characteristic grain size points to processing of the ISM within the filaments. We argue that the eroding of dust grains within the filaments is not likely attributable to the radiation or winds from the Arches cluster, but may be related to the physical conditions in the Galactic center.

Since chemical reactions on dust grain surfaces are important in determining molecular abundances, the dust size growth may affect chemical compositions in YSOs significantly. In this work, we aim to determine how grain growth affects chemical abundances. We use a time-dependent gas-grain chemical model for a star-forming core to calculate the gas-phase and grain-surface chemical abundances with variation of surface areas of grains to imitate grain growth. We also perform parameter studies in which the initial molecular abundances vary. Our results show that a smaller extent of the surface areas caused by grain growth changes the dominant form of sulfur-bearing molecules by decreasing H2S abundances and increasing SO and/ or SO2 abundances. We also find that complex organic molecules such as CH3CN decrease in abundances with larger grain sizes, while the abundance of other species such as CH3OCH3 is dependent on other parameters such as the initial conditions. Comparisons with observations of a class 0 protostar, IRAS 16293-2422, indicate that the observed abundance ratios between sulfur-bearing molecules H2S, SO, and SO2 can be reproduced very well when dust grains grow to a maximum grain size of a(max) = 10-100 mu m.

The observations were acquired at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) from mid-March to late July of 2016. A statistical analysis of backward-in-time integrations of the orbits of a large sample of clone objects of P/2016 J1-A and J1-B shows that the minimum separation between them occurred most likely similar to 2300 days prior to the current perihelion passage, i.e., during the previous orbit near perihelion. This closest approach was probably linked to a fragmentation event of their parent body. Monte Carlo dust-tail models show that those two components became active simultaneously similar to 250 days before the current perihelion, with comparable maximum loss rates of similar to 0.7 and similar to 0.5 kg s(-1), and total ejected masses of 8. x. 10(6) and 6. x. 10(6) kg for fragments J1-A and J1-B, respectively. Consequently, the fragmentation event and the present dust activity are unrelated. The simultaneous activation times of the two components and the fact that the activity lasted 6-9 months or longer, strongly indicate ice sublimation as the most likely mechanism involved in the dust emission process.

Ultrafast outflows in ultraluminous X-ray sources	ASTRONOMISCHE NACHRICHTEN			English	Article						X-ray binaries: accretion; accretion disks; winds-black hole physics	MASS BLACK-HOLES; HOLMBERG IX X-1; NGC 1313 X-1; XMM-NEWTON; ACCRETION FLOW; SOLAR MASSES; BROAD-BAND; NUSTAR	Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are bright extragalactic sources with X-ray luminosities above 10(39) erg s(-1) powered by accretion onto compact objects. According to the first studies performed with XMM-Newton, ULXs seemed to be excellent candidates to host intermediate-mass black holes (10(2 - 4)M). However, in the last years, the interpretation of super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes or neutron stars for most ULXs has gained a strong consensus. One critical missing piece to confirm the super-Eddington scenario was the direct detection of the massive, radiatively driven winds expected as atomic emission/absorption lines in the ULX spectra. The first evidence for winds was found as residuals in the soft X-ray spectra of ULXs. Very recently, we have been able to resolve these residuals into rest-frame emission and blueshifted (similar to 0.2c) absorption lines arising from highly ionized gas in the deep, high-resolution XMM-Newton spectra of two ULXs. The compact object is therefore surrounded by powerful ultrafast winds as predicted by models of hyper-Eddington accretion. Here we discuss the relevance of these discoveries and the importance of further deep XMM-Newton observations of powerful winds in many other ULXs to estimate the energetics of the wind, the geometry of the system, and the masses of the central accretors.

This study seeks to map regions where inelastic (not recoverable) deformation occurred during the study period, resulting in permanent compaction and loss of groundwater storage. We estimated the amount of permanent compaction by incorporating multiple data sets: the total deformation derived from InSAR, estimated skeletal-specific storage and hydraulic parameters, geologic information, and measured water levels during our study period. We used two approaches, one that we consider to provide an estimate of the lowest possible amount of inelastic deformation, and one that provides a more reasonable estimate. These two approaches resulted in a spatial distribution of values for the percentage of the total deformation that was inelastic, with the former estimating a spatially averaged value of 54%, and the latter a spatially averaged value of 98%. The former corresponds to the permanent loss of 4.14x108 m(3) of groundwater storage, or roughly 5% of the volume of groundwater used over the study time period; the latter corresponds to the loss of 7.48x108 m(3) of groundwater storage, or roughly 9% of the volume of groundwater used. This study demonstrates that a data-driven approach can be used effectively to estimate the permanent loss of groundwater storage. Plain Language Summary Subsidence due to groundwater pumping from 2007 to 2010 in the San Joaquin Valley, California was mapped using satellite data known as InSAR. These data were incorporated with additional datasets, including geological information, to estimate how much subsidence was permanent. This subsidence represents a permanent loss in groundwater storage. Using these methods, we estimated that a permanent loss of 7.48 x 10(8) m(3) of groundwater storage occurred during our study period. This accounted for roughly 9% of groundwater pumping in our study area. While this is just a small fraction of the total water stored underground in this area, this 'water of compaction' is an important safeguard for times of drought that, once removed, cannot be replenished.

Assessing accuracy and precision for space-based measurements of carbon dioxide: An associated statistical methodology revisited	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						statistical methodology; space-based measurement	TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; TES NADIR RETRIEVALS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; REFLECTED SUNLIGHT; ERROR ANALYSIS; SATELLITE; GOSAT; SCIAMACHY; ALGORITHM; MODELS	Analyzing retrieval accuracy and precision is an important element of space-based CO2 retrievals. However, this error analysis is sometimes challenging to perform rigorously because of the subtlety of Multivariate Statistics. To help address this issue, we revisit some fundamentals of Multivariate Statistics that help reveal the statistical essence of the associated error analysis. We show that the related statistical methodology is useful for revealing the intrinsic discrepancy and relation between the retrieval error for a nonzero-variate CO2 state and that for a zero-variate one. Our study suggests that the two scenarios essentially yield the same-magnitude accuracy, while the latter scenario yields a better precision than the former. We also use this methodology to obtain a rigorous framework systematically and explore a broadly used approximate framework for analyzing CO2 retrieval errors. The approximate framework introduces errors due to an essential, but often forgotten, fact that a priori climatology in reality is never equal to the true state. Due to the nature of the problem considered, realistic numerical simulations that produce synthetic spectra may be more appropriate than remote sensing data for our specific exploration. As highlighted in our retrieval simulations, utilizing the approximate framework may not be universally satisfactory in assessing the accuracy and precision of Xco(2) retrievals (with errors up to 0.17-0.28ppm and 1.4-1.7ppm, respectively, at SNR=400). In situ measurements of CO2 are needed to further our understanding of this issue and related implications.

Cloud response to climate change	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						large-eddy simulation; boundary-layer clouds; cloud radiative effects; stratocumulus to cumulus transition	HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; WIDE-RANGE; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; STRATOCUMULUS; MOISTURE; ENERGY; LES; PARAMETERIZATION; PRECIPITATION	How subtropical marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds respond to warming is investigated using large-eddy simulations (LES) of a wide range of warmer climates, with CO2 concentrations elevated by factors 2-16. In LES coupled to a slab ocean with interactive sea surface temperatures (SST), the surface latent heat flux (LHF) is constrained by the surface energy balance and only strengthens modestly under warming. Consequently, the MBL in warmer climates is shallower than in corresponding fixed-SST LES, in which LHF strengthens excessively and the MBL typically deepens. The inferred shortwave (SW) cloud feedback with a closed energy balance is weakly positive for cumulus clouds. It is more strongly positive for stratocumulus clouds, with a magnitude that increases with warming. Stratocumulus clouds generally break up above 6K to 9K warming, or above a four to eightfold increase in CO2 concentrations. This occurs because the MBL mixing driven by cloud-top longwave (LW) cooling weakens as the LW opacity of the free troposphere increases. The stratocumulus breakup triggers an abrupt and large SST increase and MBL deepening, which cannot occur in fixed-SST experiments. SW cloud radiative effects generally weaken while the lower-tropospheric stability increases under warmingthe reverse of their empirical relation in the present climate. The MBL is deeper and stratocumulus persists into warmer climates if large-scale subsidence decreases as the climate warms. The contrasts between experiments with interactive SST and fixed SST highlight the importance of a closed surface energy balance for obtaining realizable responses of MBL clouds to warming.

Radar attenuation in Europa's ice shell: Obstacles and opportunities for constraining the shell thickness and its thermal structure	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Europa; ice shell; radar	SUBSURFACE OCEAN; THWAITES GLACIER; GALILEAN SATELLITES; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; WEST ANTARCTICA; SHEAR-MARGIN; WATER-VAPOR; SURFACE; CONVECTION; ABSORPTION	Young surface and possible recent endogenic activity make Europa one of the most exciting solar system bodies and a primary target for spacecraft exploration. Future Europa missions are expected to carry ice-penetrating radar instruments designed to investigate its subsurface thermophysical structure. Several authors have addressed the radar sounders' performance at icy moons, often ignoring the complex structure of a realistic ice shell. Here we explore the variation in two-way radar attenuation for a variety of potential thermal structures of Europa's shell (determined by reference viscosity, activation energy, tidal heating, surface temperature, and shell thickness) as well as for low and high loss temperature-dependent attenuation model. We found that (i) for all investigated ice shell thicknesses (5-30km), the radar sounder will penetrate between 15% and 100% of the total thickness, (ii) the maximum penetration depth varies laterally, with deepest penetration possible through cold downwellings, (iii) direct ocean detection might be possible for shells of up to 15km thick if the signal travels through cold downwelling ice or the shell is conductive, (iv) even if the ice/ocean interface is not directly detected, penetration through most of the shell could constrain the deep shell structure through returns from deep non-ocean interfaces or the loss of signal itself, and (v) for all plausible ice shells, the two-way attenuation to the eutectic point is less than or similar to 30dB which shows a robust potential for longitudinal investigation of the ice shell's shallow thermophysical structure.

We will show that most of the slip during this event is updip of the hypocenter (10.7km depth) with substantial slip (>0.5m) between 5km depth and the surface. The peak slip is similar to 1.6m, and the inverted rake angles show predominantly strike-slip motion. Slip concentrates mostly to the south of the hypocenter, and the source time function indicates a total duration of similar to 17s with peak moment rate at similar to 6s. We will show that a 65 degrees dipping geometry is the most plausible due to a lack of polarity reversals in the InSAR data and good agreement with Coulomb stress modeling, aftershock locations, and regional moment tensors. We also note that there was an similar to 20cm peak-to-peak tsunami observed at one tide gauge station 300km away from the earthquake. We will discuss tsunami modeling results and study the possible source of the amplitude discrepancy between the modeled and the observed data at far-field tide gauges.

Mars thermosphere as seen in MAVEN accelerometer data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							IONOSPHERE	The Mars thermosphere (above approximately 120km) has been probed in situ for one Mars year using accelerometers on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. This region is affected by radiation and energy deposition from the Sun and by energy and momentum from the lower atmosphere. Densities derived from measurements made during the nominal science orbits (periapsis > 140 km) show consistent trends with solar zenith angle and Sun-Mars distance, reflecting direct and indirect heating of the thermosphere, although orbit-to-orbit variability is still significant. The six Deep Dip campaigns that MAVEN has conducted (with periapsis dropping below similar to 135 km) significantly extend the vertical profiles of the densities derived from accelerometer data. These show complex structure and high variability, both dependent on season, local time, location, and lower atmosphere activity, including dust storms and wave propagation from a dynamic lower atmosphere. In particular, the terminators are a region of convoluted structure and high variability, which may be greatest in the postmidnight, predawn hours of the sol. This space-time regime was not sampled by previous orbiters at Mars. While initial comparisons with thermospheric general circulation modes show broad areas of agreement, these terminator transition regions are not simulated well by current models. Judicious choice of the timing of these Deep Dip campaigns during the remaining MAVEN mission, as periapsis continues to precess through local time, latitude, and longitude in both hemispheres and in different seasons, should help clarify the processes at work in this complicated region.

J	Lee, AY; Stupik, J				Lee, Allan Y.; Stupik, Joan			In-Flight Characterization of the Cassini Spacecraft Propellant Slosh Modes	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							COMPARTMENTED CYLINDRICAL TANKS	Telemetry data from three 445N engine burns of the Cassini spacecraft are used to characterize the high-g slosh characteristics of bipropellants in cylindrical tanks with spherical end domes. Comparisons between flight data and theoretical results indicate that high-g clean tank slosh frequency and high-g sector mode frequency could be predicted with errors of 3-5%. However, at lower tanks' fill fractions of <35%, when most of the propellants reside in the spherical end domes of the tanks, the prediction errors deteriorated to >5%. Also, high-g full-tank slosh mode in a tank with an eight-panel propellant management device could be modeled using an annular cylindrical tank. Again, prediction error of full-tank slosh frequency degraded with decreasing fill fractions. Based on these results, the high-g sector and full-tank propellant slosh frequencies could be well predicted using simple analytical techniques before these predictions are refined by liquid slosh computer modeling tools. A set of small-amplitude oscillatory motions of the spacecraft attitude was detected during 13 science observations conducted in 2007-2008. Their frequencies matched well the low-g slosh frequency predicted analytically for uncompartmented tank. The root cause and analytical prediction of the observed spacecraft oscillatory motion in low-g condition is an interesting topic for future research.

A global analysis of the system shows KELT16 to be an F7V star with T-eff= 6236 +/- 54 K, log g (*) =4.253(-0.036) (+0.031), [Fe/H] = -0.002(-0.085) (+0.086,) M-* = 1.211 M--0.046(circle dot) (+0.043), and R-* = 1.360 R-0.053(circle dot) (+0.064). The planet is a relatively highmass inflated gas giant with M-P =2.75 (0.15) (+0.16) M-J = R-P =1.415 (0.067) (+ 0.084) R-J, density rho(P)= 1.20 +/- 0.18 g cm(3), surface gravity = log g(P) = 3.530 (-0.049) (+0.042), and = T-eq 2453(- 47) (55) K. The bestfitting linear ephemeris is T-C= 2457247.24791 +/- 0.00019 BJDTDB and P= 0.9689951 +/- 0.0000024 day. KELT-16b joins WASP-18b, -19b, -43b, -103b, and HATS-18b as the only giant transiting planets with P < 1 day. Its ultrashort period and high irradiation make it a benchmark target for atmospheric studies by the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and eventually the James Webb Space Telescope. For example, as a hotter, highermass analog of WASP-43b, KELT16b may feature an atmospheric temperaturepressure inversion and daytonight temperature swing extreme enough for TiO to rain out at the terminator. KELT-16b could also join WASP-43b in extending tests of the observed mass-metallicity relation of the solar system gas giants to higher masses. KELT-16b currently orbits at a mere similar to 1.7 Roche radii from its host star, and could be tidally disrupted in as little as a few x10(5) years ( for a stellar tidal quality factor of Q(*) = 10(5)). Finally, the likely existence of a widely separated bound stellar companion in the KELT-16 system makes it possible that Kozai-Lidov ( KL) oscillations played a role in driving KELT-16b inward to its current precarious orbit.

Continued Kinematic and Photometric Investigations of Hierarchical Solar-type Multiple Star Systems	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: visual; instrumentation: adaptive optics; stars: solar-type	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEM; RADIAL-VELOCITIES; BINARY ORBITS; HIPPARCOS; COMPANIONS; AO	We observed 15 of the solar-type binaries within 67 pc of the Sun previously observed by the Robo-AO system in the visible, with the PHARO near-infrared camera and the PALM-3000 adaptive optics system on the 5 m Hale telescope. The physical status of the binaries is confirmed through common proper motion and detection of orbital motion. In the process, we detected a new candidate companion to HIP 95309. We also resolved the primary of HIP 110626 into a close binary, making that system a triple. These detections increase the completeness of the multiplicity survey of the solar-type stars within 67 pc of the Sun. Combining our observations of HIP 103455 with archival astrometric measurements and RV measurements, we are able to compute the first orbit of HIP. 103455, showing that the binary has a 68 year period. We place the components on a color-magnitude diagram and discuss each multiple system individually.

Model performance metrics are developed to assess the simulated BSISO characteristics, with a special focus on its northward propagation over the Asian monsoon domain. Several process-oriented diagnostics developed by the MJO community are also tested for the BSISO. Simulating the phase speed and meridional extent of BSISO northward propagation, the northwest-southeast tilted rain-band structure and the quasi-biweekly mode are identified as some of the persisting problems for many GCMs. Interestingly, many of the GCMs, which capture BSISO eastward propagation, also show good fidelity in simulating BSISO northward propagation. Meridional vertical profiles of anomalous wind, temperature and diabatic heating of BSISO are better simulated in the GCMs that simulate the northward propagation. Process-oriented diagnostics based on seasonal mean vertical shear of zonal and meridional wind, large-scale rain fraction and relative humidity are also examined, but it still remains challenge to find a process diagnostic which is strongly linked to BSISO northward propagation. The complex spatial structure and presence of multi-scale disturbances, demand the development of more focused GCM evaluation metrics and process diagnostics specifically for the BSISO.	[Neena, J.

MISR imagery from multiple view angles is exploited to jointly retrieve stereoscopic cloud heights and motions, showing advantages over the AMV heights assigned by radiometric means, particularly at low heights (< 3 km) that account for over 95% of MISR CMV sampling. MISR-GOES wind differences exhibit a standard deviation ranging with increasing height from 3.3 to 4.5 ms(-1) for a high-quality [quality indicator (QI) >= 80] subset where height differences are < 1.5 km. Much of the observed difference can be attributed to the less accurately retrieved component of CMV motion along the direction of satellite motion. MISR CMV retrieval is subject to correlation between error in retrieval of this along-track component and of height. This manifests as along-track bias varying with height to magnitudes as large as 2.5 ms (1) . The cross-track component of MISR CMVs shows small (< 0.5ms(-1)) bias and standard deviation of differences (1.7ms(-1)) relative to GOES AMVs. Larger differences relative to MODIS are attributed to the tracking of cloud features at heights lower than MODIS in multilayer cloud scenes.

Team RoboSimian achieved a 5th place finish by achieving 7 points in 47:59 min. We present an architecture that was structured to be adaptable at the lowest level and repeatable at the highest level. The low-level adaptability was achieved by leveraging tactile measurements from force torque sensors in the wrist coupled with whole-body motion primitives. We use the term "behaviors" to conceptualize this low-level adaptability. Each behavior is a contact-triggered state machine that enables execution of short-order manipulation and mobility tasks autonomously. At a high level, we focused on a teach-and-repeat style of development by storing executed behaviors and navigation poses in an object/task frame for recall later. This enabled us to perform tasks with high repeatability on competition day while being robust to task differences from practice to execution. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using high-resolution laboratory and ground-based solar spectra to assess CH4 absorption coefficient calculations	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							METHANE; CALIBRATION; RETRIEVAL; CM(-1); SHAPE; BAND; CO2	A quadratic-speed-dependent Voigt line shape (qSDV) with line mixing (qSDV+LM), together with spectroscopic line parameters from Devi et al. [1,2] for the 2v(3) band of CH4, was used to retrieve total columns of CH4 front atmospheric solar absorption spectra. The qSDV line shape (Tran et al., 2013) [3] with line mixing (Levy et al., 1992) [4] was implemented into the forward model of GFIT (the retrieval algorithm that is at the heart of the GGG software (Wunch et al., 2015) [5]) to calculate CH4 absorption coefficients. High-resolution laboratory spectra of CH4 were used to assess absorption coefficients calculated using a Voigt line shape and spectroscopic parameters from the atm line list (Toon, 2014) [6]. The same laboratory spectra were used to test absorption coefficients calculated using the qSDV+LM line shape with spectroscopic line parameters from Devi et al. [1,2] for the 2v(3) band of CH4 and a Voigt line shape for lines that don't belong to the 2v3 band. The spectral line list for lines that don't belong to the 2v(3) band is an amalgamation of multiple spectral line lists. We found that for the P, Q, and R branches of the 2v(3) band, the qSDV+LM simulated the laboratory spectra better than the Voigt line shape. The qSDV+LM was also used in the spectral fitting of high-resolution solar absorption spectra from four ground-based remote sensing sites and compared to spectra fitted with a Voigt line shape. The average root mean square (RMS) residual for 131,124 solar absorption spectra fitted with absorption coefficients calculated using the qSDV+LM for the 2v(3) band of CH4 and the new Spectral line list for lines for lines that don't belong to the 2v(3) band, was reduced in the P, Q and R branches by 5%, 13%, and 3%, respectively when compared with spectra fitted using a Voigt line shape and the atm line list. We found that the average total column of CH4 retrieved from these 131,124 spectra, With the qSDV+LM was 1.1 +/- 0.3% higher than the retrievals performed using a Voigt and the atm line list. The airmass dependence of the retrieved total columns was found to change depending on the choice of spectral line shape.

The development used four NASA Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) data collections between summer 2009 and 2012 and a fall 2012 collection of wetlands dominantly fronted by vegetated shorelines along the Mississippi River Delta that are beset by severe storms, toxic releases, and relative sea-levelrise. In comparison to shorelines interpreted from 0.3 m and 1 m orthophotography, the automated GIS 10 m alongshore sampling found SAR shoreline mapping accuracy to be +/-2 m, well within the lower range of reported shoreline mapping accuracies. The high comparability was obtained even though water levels differed between the SAR and photography image pairs and included all shorelines regardless of complexity. The SAR mapping technology is highly repeatable and extendable to other SAR instruments with similar operational functionality.

Although studies are constantly expanding our knowledge about life in extreme environments, it is still unclear what the probability is for terrestrial organisms to survive and grow on Mars. Having this knowledge is paramount to addressing whether microorganisms transported from Earth could negatively impact future space exploration. The objectives of this study were to identify cultivable microorganisms collected from the surface of the Mars Science Laboratory, to distinguish which of the cultivable microorganisms can utilize energy sources potentially available on Mars, and to determine the survival of the cultivable microorganisms upon exposure to physiological stresses present on the martian surface. Approximately 66% (237) of the 358 microorganisms identified are related to members of the Bacillus genus, although surprisingly, 22% of all isolates belong to non-spore-forming genera. A small number could grow by reduction of potential growth substrates found on Mars, such as perchlorate and sulfate, and many were resistant to desiccation and ultraviolet radiation (UVC). While most isolates either grew in media containing >= 10% NaCl or at 4 degrees C, many grew when multiple physiological stresses were applied. The study yields details about the microorganisms that inhabit the surfaces of spacecraft after microbial reduction measures, information that will help gauge whether microorganisms from Earth pose a forward contamination risk that could impact future planetary protection policy.

This paper investigates the mid-infrared (MIR) characteristics of Saturn's rings. Methods. We collected and analyzed MIR high spatial resolution images of Saturn's rings obtained in January 2008 and April 2005 with the COoled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) mounted on the Subaru Telescope, and investigated the spatial variation in the surface brightness of the rings in multiple bands in the MIR. We also composed the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the C, B, and A rings and the Cassini Division, and estimated the temperatures of the rings from the SEDs assuming the optical depths. Results. We found that the C ring and the Cassini Division were warmer than the B and A rings in 2008, which could be accounted for by their lower albedos, lower optical depths, and smaller self-shadowing effect. We also fonud that the C ring and the Cassini Division were considerably brighter than the B and A rings in the MIR in 2008 and the radial contrast of the ring brightness is the inverse of that in 2005, which is interpreted as a result of a seasonal effect with changing elevations of the Sun and observer above the ring plane.

SPHERE Consortium	Near-infrared scattered light properties of the HR4796A dust ring A measured scattering phase function from 13.6 degrees to 166.6 degrees	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						instrumentation: high angular resolution; planet-disk interactions; planets and satellites: detection; scattering; planetary systems	HR 4796; CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK; DEBRIS DISK; GAS CONTENT; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MASSIVE COLLISION; SELF-CONSISTENT; GIANT PLANETS; 1ST LIGHT; YOUNG	Context. HR4796A is surrounded by a debris disc, observed in scattered light as an inclined ring with a high surface brightness. Past observations have raised several questions. First, a strong brightness asymmetry detected in polarised reflected light has recently challenged our understanding of scattering by the dust particles in this system. Secondly, the morphology of the ring strongly suggests the presence of planets, although no planets have been detected to date. Aims. We aim here at measuring with high accuracy the morphology and photometry of the ring in scattered light, in order to derive the phase function of the dust and constrain its near-infrared spectral properties. We also want to constrain the presence of planets and set improved constraints on the origin of the observed ring morphology. Methods. We obtained high-angular resolution coronagraphic images of the circumstellar environment around HR4796A with VLT/SPHERE during the commissioning of the instrument in May 2014 and during guaranteed-time observations in February 2015. The observations reveal for the first time the entire ring of dust, including the semi-minor axis that was previously hidden either behind the coronagraphic spot or in the speckle noise. Results. We determine empirically the scattering phase function of the dust in the H band from 13.6 degrees to 166.6 degrees. It shows a prominent peak of forward scattering, never detected before, for scattering angles below 30 degrees. We analyse the reflectance spectra of the disc from the 0.95 mu m to 1.6 mu m, confirming the red colour of the dust, and derive detection limits on the presence of planetary mass objects. Conclusions. We confirm which side of the disc is inclined towards the Earth. The analysis of the phase function, especially below 45 degrees, suggests that the dust population is dominated by particles much larger than the observation wavelength, of about 20 mu m. Compact Mie grains of this size are incompatible with the spectral energy distribution of the disc, however the observed rise in scattering efficiency beyond 50 degrees points towards aggregates which could reconcile both observables. We do not detect companions orbiting the star, but our high-contrast observations provide the most stringent constraints yet on the presence of planets responsible for the morphology of the dust.

J	Dunphy, M; Ponte, AL; Klein, P; Le Gentil, S				Dunphy, Michael; Ponte, Aurelien L.; Klein, Patrice; Le Gentil, Sylvie			Low-Mode Internal Tide Propagation in a Turbulent Eddy Field	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							NEAR-INERTIAL WAVES; GLOBAL OCEAN; GEOSTROPHIC FLOW; CIRCULATION; MESOSCALE; GENERATION; SCATTERING; ALTIMETRY	Understanding and predicting how internal tides distort and lose coherence as they propagate through the ocean has been identified as a key issue for interpreting data fromthe upcoming wide-swath altimeter mission Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT). This study addresses the issue through the analysis of numerical experiments where a low-mode internal tide propagates through a quasigeostrophic turbulent jet. Equations of motion linearized around the slower turbulent field are projected onto vertical modes and assumed to describe the dynamics of the low-mode internal tide propagation. Diagnostics of the terms responsible for the interaction between the wave and the slow circulation are computed from the numerical outputs. The large-scale change of stratification, on top of eddies and jet meanders, contributes significantly to these interaction terms, which is shown to be consistent with an independent scaling analysis. The sensitivity of interaction terms to a degradation of the slow field spatial and temporal resolution indicates that present-day observing systems (Argo network, altimetry) may lack the spatial resolution necessary to correctly predict internal tide evolution. The upcoming SWOT satellite mission may improve upon this situation. The number of vertical modes required to properly estimate interaction terms is discussed. These results advocate development of a simplifiedmodel based on solving a modest number of the linearized equations subject to a prescribed mesoscale field and internal tide sources.

Hard X-Ray-selected AGNs in Low-mass Galaxies from the NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: dwarf; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; RESOLUTION SPECTRAL TEMPLATES; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; DWARF GALAXIES; MIDINFRARED SELECTION; MID-IR; CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS; ENERGY-DISTRIBUTION; STARBURST GALAXIES	We present a sample of 10 low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from the 40-month Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) serendipitous survey. The sample is selected to have robust NuSTAR detections at 3-24 keV, to be at z < 0.3, and to have optical r-band magnitudes at least 0.5. mag fainter than an L-* galaxy at its redshift. The median values of absolute magnitude, stellar mass, and 2-10 X-ray luminosity of our sample are < Mr > = -20.03, < M-*> = 4.6 x 10(9) M-circle dot, and < L2- 10keV > = 3.1 x 10(42) erg s (1), respectively. Five objects have detectable broad Ha emission in their optical spectra, indicating black hole masses of (1.1-10.4) x 10(6) M-circle dot. We find that 30(-10)(+17)% of the galaxies in our sample do not show AGN-like optical narrow emission lines, and one of the 10 galaxies in our sample, J115851 + 4243.2, shows evidence for heavy X-ray absorption. This result implies that a non-negligible fraction of low-mass galaxies might harbor accreting massive black holes that are missed by optical spectroscopic surveys and < 10 keV X-ray surveys. The mid-IR colors of our sample also indicate that these optically normal low-mass AGNs cannot be efficiently identified with typical AGN selection criteria based on Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer colors. While the hard (> 10 keV) X-ray-selected low-mass AGN sample size is still limited, our results show that sensitive NuSTAR observations are capable of probing faint hard X-ray emission originating from the nuclei of low-mass galaxies out to moderate redshift ( z < 0.3), thus providing a critical step in understanding AGN demographics in low-mass galaxies.

Stellar and Planetary Parameters for K2's Late-type Dwarf Systems from C1 to C5	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; planetary systems; stars: fundamental parameters; stars: late-type; techniques: spectroscopic	NEARBY M DWARFS; INFRARED TELESCOPE FACILITY; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; LOW-MASS STARS; ASTROPHYSICAL PARAMETERS; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD; SPECTRAL TYPES; SIZED PLANETS; BAND SPECTRA	The NASA K2 mission uses photometry to find planets transiting stars of various types. M dwarfs are of high interest since they host more short-period planets than any other type of main-sequence star and transiting planets around M dwarfs have deeper transits compared to other main-sequence stars. In this paper, we present stellar parameters from K and M dwarfs hosting transiting planet candidates discovered by our team. Using the SOFI spectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope, we obtained R approximate to 1000 J-, H-, and K-band (0.95-2.52 mu m) spectra of 34 late-type K2 planet and candidate planet host systems and 12 bright K4-M5 dwarfs with interferometrically measured radii and effective temperatures. Out of our 34 late-type K2 targets, we identify 27 of these stars as M dwarfs. We measure equivalent widths of spectral features, derive calibration relations using stars with interferometric measurements, and estimate stellar radii, effective temperatures, masses, and luminosities for the K2 planet hosts. Our calibrations provide radii and temperatures with median uncertainties of 0.059 R-circle dot (16.09%) and 160 K (4.33%), respectively. We then reassess the radii and equilibrium temperatures of known and candidate planets based on our spectroscopically derived stellar parameters. Since a planet's radius and equilibrium temperature depend on the parameters of its host star, our study provides more precise planetary parameters for planets and candidates orbiting late-type stars observed with K2. We find a median planet radius and an equilibrium temperature of approximately 3 R-circle plus and 500 K, respectively, with several systems (K2-18b and K2-72e) receiving near-Earth-like levels of incident irradiation.

Precession of Mercury's Perihelion from Ranging to the MESSENGER Spacecraft	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrometry; celestial mechanics; ephemerides; planets and satellites: individual (Mercury); relativistic processes; Sun: interior	GENERAL-RELATIVITY; GRAVITY-FIELD; TRACKING DATA; MISSION; MOTION; SYSTEM; ORBIT	The perihelion of Mercury's orbit precesses due to perturbations from other solar system bodies, solar quadrupole moment (J(2)), and relativistic gravitational effects that are proportional to linear combinations of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma. The orbits and masses of the solar system bodies are quite well known, and thus the uncertainty in recovering the precession rate of Mercury's perihelion is dominated by the uncertainties in the parameters J(2), beta, and gamma. Separating the effects due to these parameters is challenging since the secular precession rate has a linear dependence on each parameter. Here we use an analysis of radiometric range measurements to the MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) spacecraft in orbit about Mercury to estimate the precession of Mercury's perihelion. We show that the MESSENGER ranging data allow us to measure not only the secular precession rate of Mercury's perihelion with substantially improved accuracy, but also the periodic perturbation in the argument of perihelion sensitive to beta and gamma. When combined with the gamma estimate from a Shapiro delay experiment from the Cassini mission, we can decouple the effects due to beta and J(2) and estimate both parameters, yielding (beta - 1)=(-2.7 +/- 3.9) x 10(-5) and J(2) =. (2.25 +/- 0.09) x 10(-7). We also estimate the total precession rate of Mercury's perihelion as 575.3100 +/- 0.0015 ''/century and provide estimated contributions and uncertainties due to various perturbing effects.

J	Mylapilli, H; Jain, A				Mylapilli, Harshavardhan; Jain, Abhinandan			Complementarity Techniques for Minimal Coordinate Contact Dynamics	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article								In this paper, nonsmooth contact dynamics of articulated rigid multibody systems is formulated as a complementarity problem. Minimal coordinate (MC) formulation is used to derive the dynamic equations of motion as it provides significant computational cost benefits and leads to a smaller-sized complementarity problem when compared with the frequently used redundant coordinate (RC) formulation. Additionally, an operational space (OS) formulation is employed to take advantage of the low-order structure-based recursive algorithms that do not require mass matrix inversion, leading to a further reduction in these computational costs. Based on the accuracy with which Coulomb's friction cone is modeled, the complementarity problem can be posed either as a linear complementarity problem (LCP), where the friction cone is approximated using a polygon, or as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP), where the friction cone is modeled exactly. Both formulations are studied in this paper. These complementarity problems are further recast as nonsmooth unconstrained optimization problems, which are solved by employing a class of Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithms. The necessary theory detailing these techniques is discussed and five solvers are implemented to solve contact dynamics problems. A simple test case of a sphere moving on a plane surface is used to validate these solvers for a single contact, whereas a 12-link complex pendulum example is chosen to compare the accuracy of the solvers for the case of multiple simultaneous contacts. The simulation results validate the MC-based NCP formulations developed in this paper. Moreover, we observe that the LCP solvers deliver accuracy comparable to that of the NCP solvers when the friction cone direction vectors in the contact tangent plane are aligned with the sliding contact velocity at each time step. The theory and simulation results show that the NCP approach can be seamlessly recast into an MC OS formulation, thus allowing for accurate modeling of frictional contacts, while at the same time reducing overall computational costs associated with contact and collision dynamics problems in articulated rigid body systems.

Dual Satellite-Aided Planetary Capture with Interplanetary Trajectory Constraints	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							BROAD-SEARCH ALGORITHMS; TRIPLE FLYBY SEQUENCES; LAPLACE RESONANCE; GANYMEDE; DESIGN; JUPITER	The system entry problem entails the capture of a spacecraft about a planet by way of propulsive maneuver(s) or flyby(s) of a planetary satellite(s), or both. In the case of the Jovian system, a balance is sought between the interplanetary time-of-flight, orbit insertion maneuver magnitude, mass delivered to the system, capture orbit period, radiation dose, and mission complexity. Based on a nominal asymptote, this paper introduces the analytical equations necessary to solve the phase-free, singly aided and doubly aided capture problems, with a focus on the doubly aided capture problem in the Jovian system. An analytical approximation for the required phasing is derived and the implications of the Laplace resonance are discussed. Analytical approximations are used to seamlessly seed a multiple-shooting algorithm in order to arrive at the converged high-fidelity solution space for the Europa Mission.

Electrodynamic tethers can provide propellantless drag for planetary capture and operation down the gravitational well, and they can generate power to use along with or be stored for inverting tether current. The design for an alternative to NASA's proposed Europa mission is presented here. The operation requires the spacecraft to pass repeatedly near Jupiter, for greater plasma density and magnetic field, raising a radiation-dose issue that past analyses did take into account; tape tethers tens of kilometers long and tens of micrometers thick, for greater operation efficiency, are considered. This might result, however, in attracted electrons reaching the tape with a penetration range that exceeds tape thickness, thereby escaping collection. The mission design requires keeping the range below thickness throughout, resulting in an orbit perijove only hundreds of kilometers above Jupiter and tapes a few kilometers long. A somewhat similar mission design might apply to other giant outer planets.

CH3D photomixing spectroscopy up to 2.5 THz: New set of rotational and dipole parameters, first THz self-broadening measurements	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						THz photomixing; Frequency-comb; Deuterated methane; Line positions; Dipole moment; Self-broadening coefficients	HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; MULTISPECTRUM ANALYSIS; FITTING TECHNIQUE; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; COEFFICIENTS; SPECTRA; MOMENT; BAND; (CH3D)-C-12; STATE	Several previously unmeasured transitions of (CH3D)-C-12 have been recorded by a terahertz photomixing continuous-wave spectrometer up to R-Q(10) branch at 2.5 THz. An improved set of rotational constants has been obtained utilizing a THz frequency metrology based on a frequency comb that achieved an averaged frequency position better than 150 kHz on more than fifty ground-state transitions. A detailed analysis of the measured line intensities was undertaken using the multispectrum fitting program and has resulted in a determination of new dipole moment parameters. Measurements at different pressures of the R-Q(7) transitions provide the first determination of self-broadening coefficients from pure rotational CH3D lines. The THz rotational measurements are consistent with IR rovibrational data but no significant vibrational dependence of self-broadening coefficient may be observed by comparison.

In these cases, the round-trip travel time of the target's radar signature is small relative to the transmit chirp duration, simplifying the processing required for range and velocity extraction. This is not the case for more distant targets, where much of the radar signature is received after the start of the subsequent transmit waveform. In this letter, we examine various signal-processing options for coping with this long-range condition. We analytically demonstrate how to retain both range and Doppler shift information for an arbitrary number of targets spaced anywhere from very near the target up to the radar's unambiguous range. The motivation for this work is to develop a 95-GHz Doppler radar for measuring ice and dust particle dynamics in cometary jets. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate our methods.

As highly non-linear clustering to date has only been described by numerical N-body simulations in a reliable and sufficiently precise way, the necessary computational costs for estimating those covariances at different points in parameter space are tremendous. In this work, we describe the change of the matter covariance and the weak lensing covariance matrix as a function of cosmological parameters by constructing a suitable basis, where we model the contribution to the covariance from non-linear structure formation using Eulerian perturbation theory at third order. We show that our formalism is capable of dealing with large matrices and reproduces expected degeneracies and scaling with cosmological parameters in a reliable way. Comparing our analytical results to numerical simulations, we find that the method describes the variation of the covariance matrix found in the SUNGLASS weak lensing simulation pipeline within the errors at one-loop and tree-level for the spectrum and the trispectrum, respectively, for multipoles up to l <= 1300. We show that it is possible to optimize the sampling of parameter space where numerical simulations should be carried out by minimizing interpolation errors and propose a corresponding method to distribute points in parameter space in an economical way.

High-resolution spectroscopy with E/Delta E approximate to 3200 (approximate to 170 meV, full width at half-maximum) was achieved with photon energy from 550 to 670 eV. Rich resonance structure observed in the experimental spectra is analysed using the R-matrix with pseudo-states (RMPS) method. Results are also compared with the screening constant by unit nuclear charge (SCUNC) calculations. We characterize and identify the strong 1s -> 2p resonances for both ions and the weaker 1s -> np resonances (n >= 3) observed in the K-shell spectra of O4 +.	[McLaughlin, B.

The quantity EG probes both parts of metric potential and is insensitive to galaxy bias and sigma(8). These properties make it an attractive statistic to test lambda cold dark matter, general relativity and its alternate theories. We have combined CMASS Data Release 11 with CFHTLenS and recent measurements of beta from RSD analysis, and find E-G(z = 0.57) = 0.42 +/- 0.056, a 13 per cent measurement in agreement with the prediction of general relativity EG(z = 0.57) = 0.396 +/- 0.011 using the Planck 2015 cosmological parameters. We have corrected our measurement for various observational and theoretical systematics. Our measurement is consistent with the first measurement of EG using cosmic microwave background lensing in place of galaxy lensing at small scales, but shows 2.8 sigma tension when compared with their final results including large scales. This analysis with future surveys will provide improved statistical error and better control over systematics to test general relativity and its alternate theories.

Numerical investigation of the dynamical environment of 65803 Didymos	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Didymos; AIDA mission; Restricted three-body problem	BINARY ASTEROIDS; RADAR; SPACECRAFT; ORBITS	The Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission is planning to visit the Didymos binary system in 2022 in order to perform the first demonstration ever of the kinetic impact technique. Binary asteroids are an ideal target for this since the deflection of the secondary body can be accurately measured by a satellite orbiting in the system. However, these binaries offer an extremely rich dynamical environment whose accurate investigation through analytical approaches is challenging at best and requires a significant number of restrictive assumptions. For this reason, a numerical investigation of the dynamical environment in the vicinity of the Didymos system is offered in this paper. After computing various families of periodic orbits, their robustness is assessed in a high-fidelity environment consisting of the perturbed restricted full three-body problem. The results of this study suggest that several nominally stable trajectories, including the triangular libration points, should not be considered as safe as a state vector perturbation may cause the spacecraft to drift from the nominal orbit and possibly impact one of the primary bodies within a few days. Nonetheless, there exist two safe solutions, namely terminator and interior retrograde orbits. The first one is adequate for observation purposes of the entire system and for communications. The second one is more suitable to perform close investigations of the primary body. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Roa, J; Pelaez, J				Roa, Javier; Pelaez, Jesus			The theory of asynchronous relative motion I: time transformations and nonlinear corrections	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Relative motion; Nonlinear effects; Time transformations; Regularization; Stability; Clohessy-Wiltshire solution	STATE TRANSITION MATRIX; ORBITAL MOTION; KEPLER MOTION	Using alternative independent variables in lieu of time has important advantages when propagating the partial derivatives of the trajectory. This paper focuses on spacecraft relative motion, but the concepts presented here can be extended to any problem involving the variational equations of orbital motion. A usual approach for modeling the relative dynamics is to evaluate how the reference orbit changes when modifying the initial conditions slightly. But when the time is a mere dependent variable, changes in the initial conditions will result in changes in time as well: a time delay between the reference and the neighbor solution will appear. The theory of asynchronous relative motion shows how the time delay can be corrected to recover the physical sense of the solution and, more importantly, how this correction can be used to improve significantly the accuracy of the linear solutions to relative motion found in the literature. As an example, an improved version of the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) solution is presented explicitly. The correcting terms are extremely compact, and the solution proves more accurate than the second and even third order CW equations for long propagations. The application to the elliptic case is also discussed. The theory is not restricted to Keplerian orbits, as it holds under any perturbation. To prove this statement, two examples of realistic trajectories are presented: a pair of spacecraft orbiting the Earth and perturbed by a realistic force model; and two probes describing a quasi-periodic orbit in the Jupiter-Europa system subject to third-body perturbations. The numerical examples show that the new theory yields reductions in the propagation error of several orders of magnitude, both in position and velocity, when compared to the linear approach.

There are no singularities in the resulting solutions, and their form is not affected by the type of reference orbit (circular, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic). In addition, the solutions to the problem are given in compact tensorial expressions and directly referred to the initial state vector of the leader spacecraft. The SB and KS formulations introduce a fictitious time by means of the Sundman transformation. Because of using an alternative independent variable, the solutions are built based on the theory of asynchronous relative motion. This technique simplifies the required derivations. Closed-form expressions of the partial derivatives of orbital motion with respect to the initial state are provided explicitly. Numerical experiments show that the performance of a given representation of the dynamics depends strongly on the time transformation, whereas it is virtually independent from the choice of variables to parameterize orbital motion. In the circular and elliptic cases, the linear solutions coincide exactly with the results obtained with the Clohessy-Wiltshire and Yamanaka-Ankersen state-transition matrices.

Drifts and Environmental Disturbances in Atomic Clock Subsystems: Quantifying Local Oscillator, Control Loop, and Ion Resonance Interactions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL			English	Article						Atomic clocks; atomic frequency standards; local oscillators (LOs)		Linear ion trap frequency standards are among the most stable continuously operating frequency references and clocks. Depending on the application, they have been operated with a variety of local oscillators (LOs), including quartz ultrastable oscillators, hydrogen-masers, and cryogenic sapphire oscillators. The short-, intermediate-, and long-term stability of the frequency output is a complicated function of the fundamental performances, the time dependence of environmental disturbances, the atomic interrogation algorithm, the implemented control loop, and the environmental sensitivity of the LO and the atomic system components. For applications that require moving these references out of controlled lab spaces and into less stable environments, such as fieldwork or spaceflight, a deeper understanding is needed of how disturbances at different timescales impact the various subsystems of the clock and ultimately the output stability. In this paper, we analyze which perturbations have an impact and to what degree. We also report on a computational model of a control loop, which keeps the microwave source locked to the ion resonance. This model is shown to agree with laboratory measurements of how well the feedback removes various disturbances and also with a useful analytic approach we developed for predicting these impacts.

J	Suhir, E; Yi, S; Ghaffarian, R				Suhir, E.; Yi, S.; Ghaffarian, R.			How Many Peripheral Solder Joints in a Surface Mounted Design Experience Inelastic Strains?	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						solder material; yield strain; low-cycle fatigue; stress analysis	CERAMIC CHIP CARRIERS; BIMETAL THERMOSTATS; STRESSES; BOARDS	It has been established that it is the peripheral solder joints that are the most vulnerable in the ball-grid-array (BGA) and column-grid-array (CGA) designs and most often fail. As far as the long-term reliability of a soldered microelectronics assembly as a whole is concerned, it makes a difference, if just one or more peripheral joints experience inelastic strains. It is clear that the low cycle fatigue lifetime of the solder system is inversely proportional to the number of joints that simultaneously experience inelastic strains. A simple and physically meaningful analytical expression (formula) is obtained for the prediction, at the design stage, of the number of such joints, if any, for the given effective thermal expansion (contraction) mismatch of the package and PCB; materials and geometrical characteristics of the package/PCB assembly; package size; and, of course, the level of the yield stress in the solder material. The suggested formula can be used to determine if the inelastic strains in the solder material could be avoided by the proper selection of the above characteristics and, if not, how many peripheral joints are expected to simultaneously experience inelastic strains. The general concept is illustrated by a numerical example carried out for a typical BGA package. The suggested analytical model (formula) is applicable to any soldered microelectronics assembly. The roles of other important factors, such as, e.g., solder material anisotropy, grain size, and their random orientation within a joint, are viewed in this analysis as less important factors than the level of the interfacial stress. The roles of these factors will be accounted for in future work and considered, in addition to the location of the joint, in a more complicated, more sophisticated, and more comprehensive reliability/fatigue model.

Photon and carrier management design for nonplanar thin-film copper indium gallium selenide photovoltaics	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS			English	Article						Solar cells; Thin film; Light trapping; CIGS; Nanotextured	NANOSTRUCTURED SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; OPTIMIZATION; ABSORPTION; DEVICES; ARRAYS	Nonplanar structured photovoltaic absorber design has potential to achieve high solar cell efficiency with significantly reduced material use. We report optoelectronic simulations that highlight photon and generated carrier management opportunities for improvement of thin film Cu(InxGa1-x)Se-2 (CIGS) device performance. Structures realized via either self-assembly or patterning via nanoimprint lithography, and also a combination of both are predicted to exhibit significant increases in short circuit current density and open circuit voltage simultaneously. The structures investigated include: 1) self-assembled nonplanar structures that strongly scatter incident light and enhance carrier generation near regions of high electric potential, 2) lithographically patterned embedded periodic dielectric structures, 3) planar dielectric layers that separate the CIGS absorber from the molybdenum back-contact via reduced-area contacts that minimize optical and electronic losses, 4) a combination of these for combined effects. We find that the self-assembled nonplanar CIGS cells with 700 nm planar equivalent Thickness, combined with dielectric separation layers yield increases in short circuit current density and open circuit voltage up to 3.4 mA cm(-2) and 29 mV, respectively. The absolute efficiency increases from 15.4% to 18.1%, compared to the predicted efficiency for planar CIGS thin film cells of equivalent thickness. The addition of a single layer MgF2 anti-reflection coating brings the maximum predicted efficiency up to 19.7% for randomly textured devices.

To account for gravitational focusing, we first generated a quasi-realistic ISO population to similar to 750 au from the Sun and propagated it forward in time to generate a steady state population of ISOs with heliocentric distance <50 au. We then simulated the detection of the synthetic ISOs using pointing data for each image and average detection efficiencies for each of three contemporary solar system surveys-Pan-STARRS1, the Mt. Lemmon Survey, and the Catalina Sky Survey. These simulations allowed us to determine the surveys' combined ISO detection efficiency under several different but realistic modes of identifying ISOs in the survey data. Some of the synthetic detected ISOs had eccentricities as small as 1.01, which is in the range of the largest eccentricities of several known comets. Our best CL of rho(CL)(SI) = 1.4 x 10(-4) au(-3) implies that the expectation that extra-solar systems form like our solar system, eject planetesimals in the same way, and then distribute them throughout the Galaxy, is too simplistic, or that the SFD or behavior of ISOs as they pass through our solar system is far from expectation.

These radii are determined using only direct observables-the bolometric flux at Earth, the effective temperature, and the parallax provided by the Gaia first data release-and thus are virtually model independent, with extinction being the only free parameter. We also determine each star's mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, a virtually model independent quantity itself from previously published transit analyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the transiting-planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The median uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are 8% and 30%, respectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses are 9% and 22%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than previously published model-dependent precisions of 5% and 6% on the planet radii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely empirical. We additionally report radii for 242 stars hosting radialvelocity (non-transiting) planets, with a median achieved accuracy of approximate to 2%. Using our empirical stellar masses we verify that the majority of putative "retired A stars" in the sample are indeed more massive than similar to 1.2. M-circle dot. Most importantly, the bolometric fluxes and angular radii reported here for a total of 498 planet host stars-with median accuracies of 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively-serve as a fundamental data set to permit the re-determination of transiting-planet radii and masses with the Gaia second data release to approximate to 3% and approximate to 5% accuracy, better than currently published precisions, and determined in an entirely empirical fashion.

We used a quasar catalog from an overlapping portion of the SDSS Stripe 82 region to quantify the completeness and efficiency of selection methods involving color, probabilistic modeling, variability, and combinations of color/probabilistic modeling with variability. In all cases, we considered only objects that appear as point sources in the DES images. We examine color selection methods based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-IR W1 - W2 color, a mixture of WISE and DES colors (g - i and i - W1), and a mixture of Vista Hemisphere Survey and DES colors (g - i and i - K). For probabilistic quasar selection, we used XDQSO, an algorithm that employs an empirical multi-wavelength flux model of quasars to assign quasar probabilities. Our variability selection uses the multi-band chi(2)-probability that sources are constant in the DES Year 1 griz-band light curves. The completeness and efficiency are calculated relative to an underlying sample of point sources that are detected in the required selection bands and pass our data quality and photometric error cuts. We conduct our analyses at two magnitude limits, i < 19.8 mag and i < 22 mag. For the subset of sources with W1 and W2 detections, the W1 - W2 color or XDQSOz method combined with variability gives the highest completenesses of > 85% for both i-band magnitude limits and efficiencies of >80% to the bright limit and > 60% to the faint limit; however, the giW1 and giW1+ variability methods give the highest quasar surface densities. The XDQSOz method and combinations of W1W2/giW1/XDQSOz with variability are among the better selection methods when both high completeness and high efficiency are desired. We also present the OzDES Quasar Catalog of 1263 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from three years of OzDES observation in the 30 deg(2) of the DES supernova fields. The catalog includes quasars with redshifts up to z similar to 4 and brighter than i = 22 mag, although the catalog is not complete up to this magnitude limit.	[Tie, S.

Our targets are very young (<10Myr) stars, which often harbor protoplanetary disks where planets may be forming. We achieve a typical contrast of similar to 10(-4)-10(-5.5) at an angular distance of 1" from the central star, corresponding to typical mass sensitivities (assuming hot-start evolutionary models) of similar to 10 M-J at 70 au and similar to 6 M-J at 140 au. We detected a new stellar companion to HIP 79462 and confirmed the substellar objects GQ Lup b and ROXs 42B b. An additional six companion candidates await follow-up observations to check for common proper motion. Our SEEDS YSO observations probe the population of planets and brown dwarfs at the very youngest ages; these may be compared to the results of surveys targeting somewhat older stars. Our sample and the associated observational results will help enable detailed statistical analyses of giant planet formation.

Planck Collaboration	Planck intermediate results L. Evidence of spatial variation of the polarized thermal dust spectral energy distribution and implications for CMB B-mode analysis	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology; observations; submillimeter; ISM - dust; extinction	COMPONENT SEPARATION; POWER SPECTRUM; EMISSION	The characterization of the Galactic foregrounds has been shown to be the main obstacle in the challenging quest to detect primordial B-modes in the polarized microwave sky. We make use of the Planck-HFI 2015 data release at high frequencies to place new constraints on the properties of the polarized thermal dust emission at high Galactic latitudes. Here, we specifically study the spatial variability of the dust polarized spectral energy distribution (SED), and its potential impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. We use the correlation ratio of the CBB `angular power spectra between the 217 and 353 GHz channels as a tracer of these potential variations, computed on different high Galactic latitude regions, ranging from 80% to 20% of the sky. The new insight from Planck data is a departure of the correlation ratio from unity that cannot be attributed to a spurious decorrelation due to the cosmic microwave background, instrumental noise, or instrumental systematics. The effect is marginally detected on each region, but the statistical combination of all the regions gives more than 99% confidence for this variation in polarized dust properties. In addition, we show that the decorrelation increases when there is a decrease in the mean column density of the region of the sky being considered, and we propose a simple power-law empirical model for this dependence, which matches what is seen in the Planck data. We explore the effect that this measured decorrelation has on simulations of the BICEP2-Keck Array/Planck analysis and show that the 2015 constraints from these data still allow a decorrelation between the dust at 150 and 353 GHz that is compatible with our measured value. Finally, using simplified models, we show that either spatial variation of the dust SED or of the dust polarization angle are able to produce decorrelations between 217 and 353 GHz data similar to the values we observe in the data.

Structure of Herbig AeBe disks at the milliarcsecond scale A statistical survey in the H band using PIONIER-VLTI	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: variables: T Tauri; Herbig Ae/Be; stars: pre-main sequence; techniques: interferometric; techniques: photometric	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; NEAR-INFRARED EMISSION; YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; T-TAURI STARS; AE/BE STARS; INNER DISK; BOLOMETRIC CORRECTIONS; CIRCUMSTELLAR ACTIVITY; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY	Context. It is now generally accepted that the near-infrared excess of Herbig AeBe stars originates in the dust of a circumstellar disk. Aims. The aims of this article are to infer the radial and vertical structure of these disks at scales of order 1 au, and the properties of the dust grains. Methods. The program objects (51 in total) were observed with the H-band (1.6 mu m) PIONIER/VLTI interferometer. The largest baselines allowed us to resolve (at least partially) structures of a few tenths of an au at typical distances of a few hundred parsecs. Dedicated UBVRIJHK photometric measurements were also obtained. Spectral and 2D geometrical parameters are extracted via fits of a few simple models: ellipsoids and broadened rings with azimuthal modulation. Model bias is mitigated by parallel fits of physical disk models. Sample statistics were evaluated against similar statistics for the physical disk models to infer properties of the sample objects as a group. Results. We find that dust at the inner rim of the disk has a sublimation temperature Tsub approximate to 1800 K. A ring morphology is confirmed for approximately half the resolved objects; these rings are wide delta r/r >= 0.5. A wide ring favors a rim that, on the star-facing side, looks more like a knife edge than a doughnut. The data are also compatible with the combination of a narrow ring and an inner disk of unspecified nature inside the dust sublimation radius. The disk inner part has a thickness z/r approximate to 0.2, flaring to z/r approximate to 0.5 in the outer part. We confirm the known luminosity- radius relation; a simple physical model is consistent with both the mean luminosity- radius relation and the ring relative width; however, a significant spread around the mean relation is present. In some of the objects we find a halo component, fully resolved at the shortest interferometer spacing, that is related to the HAeBe class.

DES Collaboration	A Search for Kilonovae in the Dark Energy Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; stars: neutron; supernovae: general	IA SUPERNOVAE; ADVANCED LIGO; OPTICAL COUNTERPART; CAMERA SEARCH; EVENT; TRANSIENTS; IDENTIFICATION; SIMULATIONS; MODELS; IMPACT	The coalescence of a binary neutron star pair is expected to produce gravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic radiation, both of which may be detectable with currently available instruments. We describe a search for a predicted r-process optical transient from these mergers, dubbed the "kilonova" (KN), using griz broadband data from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN). Some models predict KNe to be redder, shorter-lived, and dimmer than supernovae (SNe), but the event rate of KNe is poorly constrained. We simulate KN and SN light curves with the Monte-Carlo simulation code SNANA to optimize selection requirements, determine search efficiency, and predict SN backgrounds. Our analysis of the first two seasons of DES-SN data results in 0 events, and is consistent with our prediction of 1.1 +/- 0.2 background events based on simulations of SNe. From our prediction, there is a 33% chance of finding 0 events in the data. Assuming no underlying galaxy flux, our search sets 90% upper limits on the KN volumetric rate of 1.0 x 10(7) Gpc(-3) yr(-1) for the dimmest KN model we consider (peak i-band absolute magnitude M-i = -11.4 mag) and 2.4 x 10(4) Gpc-3 yr-1 for the brightest (Mi = -16.2 mag). Accounting for anomalous subtraction artifacts on bright galaxies, these limits are similar to 3 times higher. This analysis is the first untriggered optical KN search and informs selection requirements and strategies for future KN searches. Our upper limits on the KN rate are consistent with those measured by GW and gamma-ray burst searches.	[Doctor, Z.; Kessler, R.; Chen, H. Y.; Farr, B.; Holz, D.

Evidence for Relativistic Disk Reflection in the Seyfert 1h Galaxy/ULIRG IRAS 05189-2524 Observed by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; black hole physics; galaxies: active; galaxies: individual ( IRAS 05189-2524); galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies	ULTRALUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; X-RAY-SPECTRA; BLACK-HOLE SPIN; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; SUZAKU OBSERVATIONS; ACCRETION DISK; NGC 1365; LOCAL ULIRGS; ABSORPTION	We present a spectral analysis of the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1h galaxy/ULIRG IRAS 05189-2524 taken in 2013. We find evidence for relativistic disk reflection in the broadband X-ray spectrum: a highly asymmetric broad Fe K alpha emission line extending down to 3 keV and a Compton scattering component above 10 keV. Physical modeling with a self-consistent disk reflection model suggests that the accretion disk is viewed at an intermediate angle with a supersolar iron abundance, and a mild constraint can be put on the high-energy cutoff of the power-law continuum. We test the disk reflection modeling under different absorption scenarios. A rapid black hole spin is favored; however, we cannot place a model-independent tight constraint on the value. The high reflection fraction (R-ref similar or equal to 2.0-3.2) suggests that the coronal illuminating source is compact and close to the black hole (lying within 8.7 R-g above the central black hole), where light-bending effects are important.

The fundamental observation is the change in the phase of the reflected waveforms as related to the change in SWE. Through theoretical modeling it was found that the change in SWE was approximately linearly dependent on the change in phase. This was verified by retrieving SWE data collected and processed from a tower-based experiment at Fraser, CO, USA. A linear regression was performed on measured phase and in situ SWE. The correlation was found to be 0.94 and root mean square deviation was found to be 7.5 mm.

Assimilation of repeated woody biomass observations constrains decadal ecosystem carbon cycle uncertainty in aggrading forests	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							LOBLOLLY-PINE PLANTATIONS; EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; USE EFFICIENCY; MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; GLOBAL DATABASE; RESIDENCE TIME; STOCK CHANGES; GROWTH	Forest carbon sink strengths are governed by plant growth, mineralization of dead organic matter, and disturbance. Across landscapes, remote sensing can provide information about aboveground states of forests and this information can be linked to models to estimate carbon cycling in forests close to steady state. For aggrading forests this approach is more challenging and has not been demonstrated. Here we apply a Bayesian approach, linking a simple model to a range of data, to evaluate their information content, for two aggrading forests. We compare high information content analyses using local observations with retrievals using progressively sparser remotely sensed information (repeated, single, and no woody biomass observations). The net biome productivity of both forests is constrained to be a net sink with <2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) variation across the range of inputs. However, the sequestration of particular carbon pool(s) varies with assimilated biomass information. Assimilation of repeated biomass observations reduces uncertainty and/or bias in all ecosystem C pools not just wood, compared to analyses using single or no stock information. As verification, our repeated biomass analysis explains 78-86% of variation in litter dynamics at one forest, while at the second forest total dead organic matter estimates are within observational uncertainty. The uncertainty of retrieved ecosystem traits in the repeated biomass analysis is reduced by up to 50% compared to analyses with less biomass information. This study quantifies the importance of repeated woody observations in constraining the dynamics of both wood and dead organic matter, highlighting the benefit of proposed remote sensing missions.

Although these studies have demonstrated the potential of SIF, there have been concerns about the ecophysiological basis of the relationship between SIF and GPP in different environmental conditions. Launched in 2014, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has enabled fine- scale (1.3 by 2.5 km) retrievals of SIF that are comparable with measurements recorded at eddy covariance towers. In this study, we examine the effect of environmental conditions on the relationship of OCO-2 SIF with tower GPP over the course of a growing season at a well- characterized natural grassland site. Combining OCO-2 SIF and eddy covariance tower data with a canopy radiative transfer and an ecosystem model, we also assess the potential of OCO-2 SIF to constrain the estimates of V-cmax, one of the most important parameters in ecosystem models. Based on the results, we suggest that although environmental conditions play a role in determining the nature of relationship between SIF and GPP, overall, the linear relationship is more robust at ecosystem scale than the theory based on leaf- level processes might suggest. Our study also shows that the ability of SIF to constrain Vcmax is weak at the selected site.

Coherency and ellipticity of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves: Satellite observations and simulations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON-PRECIPITATION; 1-2 MAGNETIC PULSATIONS; EMIC WAVES; EQUATORIAL MAGNETOSPHERE; PARTICLE INTERACTIONS; PROTON PRECIPITATION; TRIGGERED EMISSIONS; GEOMAGNETIC STORMS; RING CURRENT; PLASMA	Coherency (C) and ellipticity (c) of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are studied using Cassini data in the Earth's dayside low-latitude magnetosphere from L = 7 to 10. The results are compared with linear kinetic theory, 1-D and 2-D simulations. The EMIC waves are observed to occur in packets with multiple wave cycles. The wave cycles within a wave packet are observed to have the same general propagation angle theta(kB0) and polarization. In observations and 2-D simulations, EMIC waves have a mixture of circular and elliptical polarization for theta(kB0) < 30 degrees. This scattered ellipticity values are due to the superposition of multiple wave modes. For wave propagation angles 30 degrees < theta(kB0) < 60 degrees, the waves are highly ;elliptical (0.2 < |epsilon| < 0.7), where epsilon is the ratio of minor to major axis of the polarization ellipse. For theta(kB0) > 60 degrees, the waves are nearly linearly polarized (|epsilon| <= 0.1). This general trend is in good agreement with linear kinetic theory and 1-D simulations. Observations indicate right-hand (RH) wave packets to be interspersed with the left-hand (LH) wave packets. We show for the first time from linear theory that ion temperature anisotropies can generate RH waves at large propagation angles and for plasma beta.. beta(i) > 0.05. The observed mixture of RH and LH waves in the magnetosphere could be due to this direct generation of RH waves. Observations and simulations show that EMIC waves are coherent with 0.5 < C < 1.0 for theta(kB0) <= 50 degrees. Here C is measured as the maximum value of cross-correlation coefficient between the transverse magnetic field components of the wave.	[Remya, B.; Lee, K. H.; Lee, L.

We construct a model-based TTD using the data-constrained circulation fields from the ECCO-JPL Ocean Data Assimilation, and test it against the observed and directly simulated distribution of pCFC-11 from the Pacific and Atlantic basins. The ECCO-JPL circulation provides overall reliable estimates of the upper ocean ventilation rates suitable for biogeochemical studies. Observed distributions of pCFC-11 in the upper ocean thermocline are well reproduced by the convolution integral of the model-based TTD (mean bias <6%, spatial correlation > 0.87) but there are significant regional biases in particular near the base of the thermocline and in the deep water formation regions. The model underestimates the deep pCFC-11 (>2000 m) in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. The ratio between the mean and the spread of the age spectrum (Gamma/Delta) is close to unity (mean = 1.04, median = 0.99) in the ventilated thermodine of the Pacific basin but there are significant regional variations of the ratio.

Utilizing decameter scale crater populations to study Martian history	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							MARS; LUNAR; MORPHOLOGY; VOLCANISM; AGE	New information has been obtained in recent years regarding formation rates and the production size-frequency distribution (PSFD) of decameter-scale primary Martian craters formed during recent orbiter missions. Here we compare the PSFD of the currently forming small primaries (P) with new data on the PSFD of the total small crater population that includes primaries and field secondaries (P + fS), which represents an average over longer time periods. The two data sets, if used in a combined manner, have extraordinary potential for clarifying not only the evolutionary history and resurfacing episodes of small Martian geological formations (as small as one or few km 2) but also possible episodes of recent climatic change. In response to recent discussions of statistical methodologies, we point out that crater counts do not produce idealized statistics, and that inherent uncertainties limit improvements that can be made by more sophisticated statistical analyses. We propose three mutually supportive procedures for interpreting crater counts of small craters in this context. Applications of these procedures support suggestions that topographic features in upper meters of mid-latitude ice-rich areas date only from the last few periods of extreme Martian obliquity, and associated predicted climate excursions.

DES Collaboration	The evolution of active galactic nuclei in clusters of galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: galaxies: clusters.	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; STAR-FORMATION ACTIVITY; AGN HOST GALAXIES; SIMILAR-TO 2; X-RAY; VELOCITY DISPERSION; MULTIWAVELENGTH SURVEY; REDSHIFT CLUSTERS; FUNDAMENTAL PLANE; INACTIVE GALAXIES	The correlation between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and environment provides important clues to AGN fuelling and the relationship of black hole growth to galaxy evolution. In this paper, we analyse the fraction of galaxies in clusters hosting AGN as a function of redshift and cluster richness for X-ray-detected AGN associated with clusters of galaxies in Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification data. The present sample includes 33 AGNs with LX > 1043 erg s(-1) in non-central, host galaxies with luminosity greater than 0.5L(*) from a total sample of 432 clusters in the redshift range of 0.1< z <0.95. Analysis of the present sample reveals that the AGN fraction in red-sequence cluster members has a strong positive correlation with redshift such that the AGN fraction increases by a factor of similar to 8 from low to high redshift, and the fraction of cluster galaxies hosting AGN at high redshifts is greater than the low-redshift fraction at 3.6 sigma. In particular, the AGN fraction increases steeply at the highest redshifts in our sample at z > 0.7. This result is in good agreement with previous work and parallels the increase in star formation in cluster galaxies over the same redshift range. However, the AGN fraction in clusters is observed to have no significant correlation with cluster mass. Future analyses with DES Year 1 through Year 3 data will be able to clarify whether AGN activity is correlated to cluster mass and will tightly constrain the relationship between cluster AGN populations and redshift.

DES Collaboration	Inference from the small scales of cosmic shear with current and future Dark Energy Survey data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; large-scale structure of Universe.	MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; GALAXY FORMATION; HALO MODEL; WEAK; BARYONS; SIMULATIONS; COSMOLOGY; PRECISION; PHYSICS	Cosmic shear is sensitive to fluctuations in the cosmological matter density field, including on small physical scales, where matter clustering is affected by baryonic physics in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as star formation, supernovae feedback, and active galactic nuclei feedback. While muddying any cosmological information that is contained in small-scale cosmic shear measurements, this does mean that cosmic shear has the potential to constrain baryonic physics and galaxy formation. We perform an analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) cosmic shear measurements, now extended to smaller scales, and using the Mead et al. (2015) halo model to account for baryonic feedback. While the SV data has limited statistical power, we demonstrate using a simulated likelihood analysis that the final DES data will have the statistical power to differentiate among baryonic feedback scenarios. We also explore some of the difficulties in interpreting the small scales in cosmic shear measurements, presenting estimates of the size of several other systematic effects that make inference from small scales difficult, including uncertainty in the modelling of intrinsic alignment on non-linear scales, ' lensing bias ', and shape measurement selection effects. For the latter two, we make use of novel image simulations. While future cosmic shear data sets have the statistical power to constrain baryonic feedback scenarios, there are several systematic effects that require improved treatments, in order to make robust conclusions about baryonic feedback.

DES Collaboration	Imprint of DES superstructures on the cosmic microwave background	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						surveys; cosmic background radiation; large-scale structure of Universe	INTEGRATED SACHS-WOLFE; DARK ENERGY; COLD SPOT; CROSS-CORRELATION; VOIDS; PLANCK; WMAP; ISW; FLUCTUATIONS; SIGNATURE	Small temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be sourced by density perturbations via the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. Large voids and superclusters are excellent environments to make a localized measurement of this tiny imprint. In some cases excess signals have been reported. We probed these claims with an independent data set, using the first year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in a different footprint, and using a different superstructure finding strategy. We identified 52 large voids and 102 superclusters at redshifts 0.2 < z < 0.65. We used the Jubilee simulation to a priori evaluate the optimal ISW measurement configuration for our compensated top-hat filtering technique, and then performed a stacking measurement of the CMB temperature field based on the DES data. For optimal configurations, we detected a cumulative cold imprint of voids with Delta T-f approximate to -5.0 +/- 3.7 mu K and a hot imprint of superclusters Delta T-f approximate to 5.1 +/- 3.2 mu K; this is similar to 1.2 sigma higher than the expected vertical bar Delta T-f vertical bar approximate to 0.6 mu K imprint of such superstructures in Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM). If we instead use an a posteriori selected filter size (R/R-v = 0.6), we can find a temperature decrement as large as Delta T-f approximate to -9.8 +/- 4.7 mu K for voids, which is similar to 2 sigma above Lambda CDM expectations and is comparable to previous measurements made using Sloan Digital Sky Survey superstructure data.

Galaxy-galaxy lensing in the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: haloes	HALO OCCUPATION DISTRIBUTION; SHEAR POWER SPECTRA; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; 100 SQUARE DEGREES; SDSS-III; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MATTER HALOES; DATA RELEASE	We present galaxy-galaxy lensing results from 139 deg(2) of Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data. Our lens sample consists of red galaxies, known as redMaGiC, which are specifically selected to have a low photometric redshift error and outlier rate. The lensing measurement has a total signal-to-noise ratio of 29 over scales 0.09 < R < 15 Mpc h(-1), including all lenses over a wide redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.8. Dividing the lenses into three redshift bins for this constant moving number density sample, we find no evidence for evolution in the halo mass with redshift. We obtain consistent results for the lensing measurement with two independent shear pipelines, NGMIX and IM3SHAPE. We perform a number of null tests on the shear and photometric redshift catalogues and quantify resulting systematic uncertainties. Covariances from jackknife subsamples of the data are validated with a suite of 50 mock surveys. The result and systematic checks in this work provide a critical input for future cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with the DES data and redMaGiC galaxy samples. We fit a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, and demonstrate that our data constrain the mean halo mass of the lens galaxies, despite strong degeneracies between individual HOD parameters.

VDES J2325-5229 a z=2.7 gravitationally lensed quasar discovered using morphology-independent supervised machine learning	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: observational; methods: statistical; quasars: general	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DARK ENERGY; MIDINFRARED SELECTION; CANDIDATE SELECTION; DATA RELEASE; MID-IR; SDSS; SAMPLE; SUBSTRUCTURE	We present the discovery and preliminary characterization of a gravitationally lensed quasar with a source redshift z(s) = 2.74 and image separation of 2.9 arcsec lensed by a foreground z(l) = 0.40 elliptical galaxy. Since optical observations of gravitationally lensed quasars showthe lens system as a superposition of multiple point sources and a foreground lensing galaxy, we have developed a morphology-independent multi-wavelength approach to the photometric selection of lensed quasar candidates based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) supervised machine learning. Using this technique and gi multicolour photometric observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), near-IR JK photometry from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and WISE mid-IR photometry, we have identified a candidate system with two catalogue components with i(AB) = 18.61 and i(AB) = 20.44 comprising an elliptical galaxy and two blue point sources. Spectroscopic follow-up with NTT and the use of an archival AAT spectrum show that the point sources can be identified as a lensed quasar with an emission line redshift of z = 2.739 +/- 0.003 and a foreground early-type galaxy with z = 0.400 +/- 0.002. We model the system as a single isothermal ellipsoid and find the Einstein radius theta(E) similar to 1.47 arcsec, enclosed mass M-enc similar to 4 x 10(11) M-circle dot and a time delay of similar to 52 d. The relatively wide separation, month scale time delay duration and high redshift make this an ideal system for constraining the expansion rate beyond a redshift of 1.

Many of these nebulae consist of outer structures that are nearly spherical (spiral/shell/arc/halo) and inner structures that are highly asymmetric (bipolar/multipolar)(1,2). The coexistence of such geometrically distinct structures is enigmatic because it hints at the simultaneous presence of both wide and close binary interactions, a phenomenon that has been attributed to stellar binary systems with eccentric orbits(3). Here, we report high-resolution molecular line observations of the circumstellar spiral-shell pattern of AFGL 3068, an asymptotic giant branch star transitioning to the preplanetary nebula phase. The observations clearly reveal that the dynamics of the mass loss is influenced by the presence of an eccentric-orbit binary. This quintessential object opens a window on the nature of deeply embedded binary stars through the circumstellar spiral-shell patterns that reside at distances of several thousand au from the stars.

J	Waliser, D; Guan, B				Waliser, Duane; Guan, Bin			Extreme winds and precipitation during landfall of atmospheric rivers	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							US WEST-COAST; HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS; INLAND PENETRATION; FUTURE CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EUROPE; CALIFORNIA; FREQUENCY; IMPACTS; EVENTS	Atmospheric rivers-long, narrow filaments of large integrated water vapour transport-are associated with weather and water extremes, such as precipitation extremes and flooding in western North America and northern Europe. Here we apply a global detection algorithm for atmospheric rivers to reanalysis data during 1997-2014 to investigate the impact of atmospheric rivers on wind extremes as well as precipitation extremes. We find that atmospheric rivers are associated with up to half of the extreme events in the top 2% of the precipitation and wind distribution, across most mid-latitude regions globally. Landfalling atmospheric rivers are associated with about 40-75% of extreme wind and precipitation events over 40% of the world's coastlines. Atmospheric rivers are associated with a doubling or more of the typical wind speed compared to all storm conditions, and a 50-100% increase in the wind and precipitation values for extreme events. We also find that the majority of extreme wind events catalogued between 1997 and 2013 over Europe with billion US dollar losses were associated with atmospheric rivers. We conclude that landfalling atmospheric rivers can represent a significant hazard around the globe, because of their association with not only extreme precipitation, but also extreme winds.

The STABLE system uses an attitude rate sensor and the motion of the guide star on a detector to control a Fast Steering Mirror to stabilize the image. The characteristics of the thermal-optical-mechanical elements in the system directly affect the quality of the point-spread function of the guide star on the detector, so a series of thermal, structural, and optical models were built to simulate system performance and ultimately inform the final pointing stability predictions. This paper describes the modeling techniques employed in each of these subsystems. The results from those models are discussed in detail, highlighting the development of the worst-case cold and hot cases, the optical metrics generated from the finite element model, and the expected STABLE residual wavefront error and decenter. Finally, the paper concludes with the predicted sensitivities in the STABLE system, which show that thermal deadbanding, structural pre-loading, and self-deflection under different loading conditions, and the speed of individual optical elements were particularly important to the resulting STABLE optical performance.

Impacts from 10-100 meter size NEAs are not statistically life-threatening, but may cause significant regional damage, while 1-10 meter size NEAs with low velocities relative to Earth are compelling targets for space missions. We describe the implementation and initial results of a real-time NEA-discovery system specialized for the detection of small, high angular rate (visually streaked) NEAs in Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) images. PTF is a 1.2-m aperture, 7.3 deg(2) field of view (FOV) optical survey designed primarily for the discovery of extragalactic transients (e.g., supernovae) in 60-second exposures reaching similar to 20.5 visual magnitude. Our real-time NEA discovery pipeline uses a machine-learned classifier to filter a large number of false-positive streak detections, permitting a human scanner to efficiently and remotely identify real asteroid streaks during the night. Upon recognition of a streaked NEA detection (typically within an hour of the discovery exposure), the scanner triggers follow-up with the same telescope and posts the observations to the Minor Planet Center for worldwide confirmation. We describe our 11 initial confirmed discoveries, all small NEAs that passed 0.3-15 lunar distances from Earth. Lastly, we derive useful scaling laws for comparing streaked-NEA-detection capabilities of different surveys as a function of their hardware and survey-pattern characteristics. This work most directly informs estimates of the streak-detection capabilities of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, planned to succeed PTF in 2017), which will apply PTF's current resolution and sensitivity over a 47-deg(2) FOV.

Based on GPP phenology estimation in GPP, the growing season determined by SIF time-series is shorter in length than the growing season length determined solely using NDVI. This is mainly due to the extended period of high NDVI values, as compared to SIF, by about 46 days (+/- 11 days), indicating a large-scale seasonal decoupling of physiological activity and changes in greenness in the fall. In addition to phenological timing, mean seasonal NDVI and SIF have different responses to temperature changes throughout the growing season. We observed that both NDVI and SIF linearly increased with temperature increases throughout the spring. However, in the fall, although NDVI linearly responded to temperature increases, SIF and GPP did not linearly increase with temperature increases, implying a seasonal hysteresis of SIF and GPP in response to temperature changes across boreal ecosystems throughout their growing season. Seasonal hysteresis of vegetation at large-scales is consistent with the known phenomena that light limits boreal forest ecosystem productivity in the fall. Our results suggest that continuing measurements from satellite remote sensing of both SIF and NDVI can help to understand the differences between, and information carried by, seasonal variations vegetation structure and greenness and physiology at large-scales across the critical boreal regions.

These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 105 of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced similar to 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at similar to 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along -track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross -track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along -track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15+ year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.

The compositions of the major elements, reported as oxides (SiO2, TiO2, A1(2)O(3), FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), have been re-calibrated using a laboratory LIBS instrument, Mars-like atmospheric conditions, and a much larger set of standards (408) that span a wider compositional range than previously employed. The new calibration uses a combination of partial least squares (PLS1) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms, together with a calibration transfer matrix to minimize differences between the conditions under which the standards were analyzed in the laboratory and the conditions on Mars. While the previous model provided good results in the compositional range near the average Mars surface composition, the new model fits the extreme compositions far better. Examples are given for plagioclase feldspars, where silicon was significantly over-estimated by the previous model, and for calcium-sulfate veins, where silicon compositions near zero were inaccurate. The uncertainties of major element abundances are described as a function of the abundances, and are overall significantly lower than the previous model, enabling important new geochemical interpretations of the data.

Secular obliquity variations of Ceres and Pallas	ICARUS			English	Article						Ceres; Pallas; Asteroid; Rotation	PRECESSION; EVOLUTION; ASTEROIDS; NUTATION	We examine variations in the orientations of the orbit poles and spin poles of Ceres and Pallas, on time scales of a few million years. We consider these two bodies together because they have similar orbits, but very different present states of knowledge concerning internal mass distribution and spin pole orientation. For Ceres, the Dawn mission has recently provided accurate estimates of the current spin pole orientation, and the degree 2 spherical harmonics of the gravitational potential. The polar moment of inertia is not as well constrained, but plausible bounds are known. For Pallas, we have estimates of the shape of the body, and spin pole orientation and angular rate, all derived from optical light curves. Using those input parameters, and the readily computed secular variations in the orbit pole, we can compute long term variations in the spin pole orientation. This provides information concerning long term variations in insolation, which controls stability of surface volatiles. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON): Final observations from the Deep Impact spacecraft	ICARUS			English	Article						Comets, coma; Comets, dynamics; Comets, dust	HELIOCENTRIC DISTANCE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; MORPHOLOGY; OUTBURSTS; NUCLEUS	The Deep Impact spacecraft observed comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) between 17 January and 10 March 2013 when the comet was similar to 5 AU from the Sun. Continuous, high-cadence, images spanning as much as 6 days at a time, and high-cadence IR spectral scans spanning 2 days, represent the most intensive set of observations available from the early part of ISON's apparition. These observations were used to investigate the comet's detailed behavior, including variability in the lightcurve and changes in the coma morphology. ISON experienced a gradual brightening throughout this time period, with A(0)f rho increasing from 1150 cm in January to 1430 cm in March. Although no periodic variability was detected to a level <3%, DI did record several events showing the comet spontaneously brightening by 10-15% for several hours, indicating that the comet was experiencing spontaneous bursts of enhanced activity. These small outbursts may be the result of residual pockets of the volatiles that drove the rapid brightening seen between 8 and 5 AU. No changes were detected in the coma morphology over the course of the observations, and no gas emission was detected in either the narrowband comet gas filters or the IR spectra.

The size-frequency distribution of H > 13 NEOs and ARM target candidates detected by Pan-STARRS1	ICARUS			English	Article						Near-Earth objects; Asteroids; Asteroids; Dynamics	NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS; SURVEY TELESCOPE ARRAY; PAN-STARRS; DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; MAIN-BELT; ASTEROIDS; CHELYABINSK; IMPACTORS; AIRBURST	We determine the absolute magnitude (H) distribution (or size-frequency distribution, SFD; N(H)alpha 10(alpha H) where a is the slope of the distribution) for near-Earth objects (NEO) with 13 < H < 30 and Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM) targets with 27 < H < 31 that were detected by the 1st telescope of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1; e.g. Kaiser et al., 2002; Kaiser, 2004; Hodapp et al., 2004). The NEO and ARM target detection efficiencies were calculated using the Greenstreet et al. (2012) NEO orbit distribution. The debiased Pan-STARRS1 NEO absolute magnitude distribution is more complex than a single slope power law - it shows two transitions - at H similar to 16 from steep to shallow slope, and in the 21 < H < 23 interval from a shallow to steep slope, which is consistent with other recent works (e.g. Mainzer et al., 2011c; Brown et al., 2013; Harris and D'Abramo, 2015). We fit alpha = 0.48 +/- 0.02 for NEOs with 13 < H < 16, alpha = 0.33 +/- 0.01 for NEOs with 16 < H < 22, and alpha = 0.62 +/- 0.03 for the smaller objects with H > 22. There is also another change in slope from steep to shallow around H = 27. The three ARM target candidates detected by Pan-STARRS1 in one year of surveying have a corrected SFD with slope alpha = 0.40(-0.45)(+0.33). We also show that the window for follow up observations of small (H greater than or similar to 22) NEOs with the NASA IRTF telescope and Arecibo and Goldstone radars are extremely short-on order of days, and procedures for fast response must be implemented in order to measure physical characteristics of small Earth approaching objects. CFHT's MegaCam and Pan-STARRSI have longer observing windows and are capable of following-up more NEOs due to their deeper limiting magnitudes and wider fields of view. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Aerogel volatiles concentrator and analyzer (AVCA) - Collection and concentration of trace volatile organics in aerogel for spectroscopic detection	ICARUS			English	Article						Aerogel; Spectroscopic analysis; Volatile detection	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; SOL-GEL PROCESS; CHEMISTRY; METEORITES; COMETARY; DUST	A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of using silica aerogel to collect and concentrate ambient trace organics for spectroscopic analysis. Silica aerogel was exposed to atmospheres containing trace amounts of polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The organics present were concentrated in the aerogels by factors varying from 10 to more than 1000 over the levels found in the atmospheres, depending on the specific organic present. Since silica aerogel is transparent over a wide range of optical and near infrared wavelengths, UV-induced fluorescence, Raman and infrared spectroscopies were used to detect and identify the organics collected by the aerogel. Measurements were conducted to determine the sensitivity of these spectroscopic methods for determining organics concentrated by aerogels and the effectiveness of this method for identifying systems containing multiple organic species. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were added to simulated Mars regolith and then vaporized by modest heating in the presence of aerogel. The aerogels adsorbed and concentrated the PAHs, which were detected by induced fluorescence and Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thermophysical properties along Curiosity's traverse in Gale crater, Mars, derived from the REMS ground temperature sensor	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Surface geological processes; Infrared observations; Mars; Atmosphere	SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; WATER ICE CLOUDS; THERMAL INERTIA; OPTICAL DEPTH; SURFACE-PROPERTIES; ATMOSPHERIC DUST; GUSEV CRATER; ROVER; AEROSOL	The REMS instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, has measured ground temperature nearly continuously at hourly intervals for two Mars years. Coverage of the entire diurnal cycle at 1 Hz is available every few martian days. We compare these measurements with predictions of surface atmosphere thermal models to derive the apparent thermal inertia and thermally derived albedo along the rover's traverse after accounting for the radiative effects of atmospheric water ice during fall and winter, as is necessary to match the measured seasonal trend. The REMS measurements can distinguish between active sand, other loose materials, mudstone, and sandstone based on their thermophysical properties. However, the apparent thermal inertias of bedrock-dominated surfaces (similar to 350-550 J m(-2) K-1 s-(1/2)) are lower than expected. We use rover imagery and the detailed shape of the diurnal ground temperature curve to explore whether lateral or vertical heterogeneity in the surface materials within the sensor footprint might explain the low inertias. We find that the bedrock component of the surface can have a thermal inertia as high as 650-1700 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) for mudstone sites and 700 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) for sandstone sites in models runs that include lateral and vertical mixing. Although the results of our forward modeling approach may be non-unique, they demonstrate the potential to extract information about lateral and vertical variations in thermophysical properties from temporally resolved measurements of ground temperature.

Low Hesperian P-CO2 constrained from in situ mineralogical analysis at Gale Crater, Mars	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Hesperian Mars; martian atmosphere; Mars Science Laboratory; Gale Crater; carbon dioxide	YELLOWKNIFE BAY; PRECIPITATION KINETICS; REDOX CHEMISTRY; CLAY-MINERALS; CARBON; EVOLUTION; SIDERITE; DIAGENESIS; HISTORY; ORIGIN	Carbon dioxide is an essential atmospheric component in martian climate models that attempt to reconcile a faint young sun with planetwide evidence of liquid water in the Noachian and Early Hesperian. In this study, we use mineral and contextual sedimentary environmental data measured by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Rover Curiosity to estimate the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) coinciding with a long-lived lake system in Gale Crater at similar to 3.5 Ga. A reaction-transport model that simulates mineralogy observed within the Sheepbed member at Yellowknife Bay (YKB), by coupling mineral equilibria with carbonate precipitation kinetics and rates of sedimentation, indicates atmospheric PCO2 levels in the 10s mbar range. At such low PCO2 levels, existing climate models are unable to warm Hesperian Mars anywhere near the freezing point of water, and other gases are required to raise atmospheric pressure to prevent lake waters from being lost to the atmosphere. Thus, either lacustrine features of Gale formed in a cold environment by a mechanism yet to be determined, or the climatemodels still lack an essential component that would serve to elevate surface temperatures, at least locally, on Hesperian Mars. Our results also impose restrictions on the potential role of atmospheric CO2 in inferred warmer conditions and valley network formation of the late Noachian.

An investigation of the bluish material on Ceres	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CASSINI-VIMS; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; WATER ICE; SURFACE; SPECTROSCOPY; PARTICLES; SYSTEM; DARK	The dwarf planet Ceres shows spatially well-defined regions, which exhibit a negative (blue) spectral slope between 0.5 and 2.5 mu m. Comparisons with planetary bodies known to exhibit a blue slope and spectral properties of materials identified on Ceres's surface based on infrared wavelength signatures indicate that the spectral changes could be related to physical properties of the surface material rather than variations in its composition. The close association of bluish surface regions to fresh impact craters implies a possible relationship to an impact-triggered alteration and/or space weathering processes. The bluish regions could be linked with blankets of ultrafine grains and partly amorphous phyllosilicates, which form larger agglomerates due to the sticky behavior of impact-induced phyllosilicate dust and/or the amorphization of the ejecta material during the impact process. Space weathering processes (micrometeoritic impacts, temperature changes) cause a reversal of the agglutination process and a recrystallization of the surface material with time resulting in a reddening of the spectral slope.

While differential acceleration measurements performed with different atomic species under free fall test the validity of the EP, minute displacements between the test masses in a gravity gradient produce a false EP-violating signal that limits the precision of the test. We show that gravity inversion and modulation using a gimbal mount can suppress the systematics due to gravity gradients caused by both moving and stationary parts of the instrument as well as the environment, strongly reducing the need to overlap two species.

Collision-induced absorption by N-2 near 2.16 mu m: Calculations, model, and consequences for atmospheric remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							N2-N2 PAIRS; SPECTRA; TEMPERATURES; O-2; DEPENDENCE; BANDS; N2	Classical molecular dynamics simulations (CMDS) are used for calculations of the collision-induced absorption (CIA) by pure N-2 in the (2.1-2.2 mu m) region of the first overtone band. They lead to reasonable (+/- 15%) agreement with the only two laboratory measurements available, at 97 K and room temperature. Based on these experiment/theory comparisons, empirical corrections are made to the CMDS-calculated CIA of pure N-2 in the 200-300 K temperature range. In addition, the contribution of N-2-O-2 collisions is, in the absence of any laboratory measurement, calculated and a simple semiempirical model (the first of its kind) is built in order to predict the CIA of N-2 under Earth atmosphere conditions. This is successfully validated by comparisons with ground-based atmospheric transmission spectra in the 2.1-2.2 mu m region.

Planet-induced Stellar Pulsations in HAT-P-2 ' s Eccentric System	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						methods: numerical; planet-star interactions; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability; planets and satellites: individual (HAT-P-2b); techniques: photometric	HOT JUPITERS; MU-M; ASTROPHYSICS MESA; PHASE VARIATIONS; BINARY-SYSTEMS; RED GIANT; TRANSIT; CURVES; STARS; PHOTOMETRY	Extrasolar planets on eccentric short-period orbits provide a laboratory in which to study radiative and tidal interactions between a planet and its host star under extreme forcing conditions. Studying such systems probes how the planet's atmosphere redistributes the time-varying heat flux from its host and how the host star responds to transient tidal distortion. Here, we report the insights into the planet-star interactions in HAT-P-2's eccentric planetary system gained from the analysis of similar to 350 hr of 4.5 mu m observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The observations show no sign of orbit-to-orbit variability nor of orbital evolution of the eccentric planetary companion, HAT-P-2b. The extensive coverage allows us to better differentiate instrumental systematics from the transient heating of HAT-P-2b's 4.5 mu m photosphere and yields the detection of stellar pulsations with an amplitude of approximately 40 ppm. These pulsation modes correspond to exact harmonics of the planet's orbital frequency, indicative of a tidal origin. Transient tidal effects can excite pulsation modes in the envelope of a star, but, to date, such pulsations had only been detected in highly eccentric stellar binaries. Current stellar models are unable to reproduce HAT-P-2's pulsations, suggesting that our understanding of the interactions at play in this system is incomplete.

A New Compton-thick AGN in Our Cosmic Backyard: Unveiling the Buried Nucleus in NGC 1448 with NuSTAR	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; techniques: spectroscopic; X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: individual (NGC 1448)	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; X-RAY-EMISSION; SUBARCSECOND MIDINFRARED VIEW; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; SWIFT-BAT SURVEY; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; NEARBY GALAXIES; COMPLETE CENSUS; HOST GALAXIES	NGC 1448 is one of the nearest luminous galaxies (L-8-1000(mu m) > 10(9) L-circle dot) to ours (z = 0.00390), and yet the active galactic nucleus (AGN) it hosts was only recently discovered, in 2009. In this paper, we present an analysis of the nuclear source across three wavebands: mid-infrared (MIR) continuum, optical, and X-rays. We observed the source with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (N(u)STAR), and combined these data with archival Chandra data to perform broadband X-ray spectral fitting (approximate to 0.5-40 keV) of the AGN for the first time. Our X-ray spectral analysis reveals that the AGN is buried under a Compton-thick (CT) column of obscuring gas along our line of sight, with a column density of N-H(los)greater than or similar to 2.5 x 10(24) cm(-2). The best-fitting torus models measured an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of L-2-10, int = (3.5-7.6). x. 10(40)erg s(-1), making NGC 1448 one of the lowest luminosity CTAGNs known. In addition to the NuSTAR observation, we also performed optical spectroscopy for the nucleus in this edge-on galaxy using the European Southern Observatory New Technology Telescope. We reclassify the optical nuclear spectrum as a Seyfert on the basis of the Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich diagnostic diagrams, thus identifying the AGN at optical wavelengths for the first time. We also present high spatial resolution MIR observations of NGC 1448 with Gemini/T-ReCS, in which a compact nucleus is clearly detected. The absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity measured from our X-ray spectral analysis agrees with that predicted from the optical [O III]lambda 5007 angstrom emission line and the MIR 12 mu m. continuum, further supporting the CT nature of the AGN.

At the time the ground-based astrometry was published, however, the SN had not faded sufficiently for post-explosion HST follow-up observations to determine a more precise astrometric solution and/or confirm if the pre-explosion source had disappeared, both of which are necessary to ultimately disentangle the possible progenitor scenarios. Here we present HST/WFC3 imaging of the SN 2010jl field obtained in 2014, 2015, and 2016 when the SN had faded sufficiently to allow for new constraints on the progenitor. The SN, which is still detected in the new images, is offset by 0.'' 061 +/- 0.'' 008 (15 +/- 2 pc) from the underlying and extended source of emission that contributes at least partially, if not entirely, to the blue source previously suggested as the candidate progenitor in the WFPC2 data. This point alone rules out the possibility that the blue source in the pre-explosion images is the exploding star, but may instead suggest an association with a young (< 5-6 Myr) cluster and still argues for a massive (> 30M(circle dot)) progenitor. We obtain new upper limits on the flux from a single star at the SN position in the pre-explosion WFPC2 and Spitzer/IRAC images that may ultimately be used to constrain the progenitor properties.

Modeling the Anomalous Microwave Emission with Spinning Nanoparticles: No PAHs Required	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dust, extinction; radiation mechanisms: general; radio continuum: ISM	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; DIFFUSE INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; GRAIN-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; DUST EMISSION; INFRARED-EMISSION; TRANSLUCENT CLOUDS; GALACTIC EMISSION; MILKY-WAY; PLANCK; POLARIZATION	In light of recent observational results indicating an apparent lack of correlation between the anomalous microwave emission (AME) and mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we assess whether rotational emission from spinning silicate and/or iron nanoparticles could account for the observed AME without violating observational constraints on interstellar abundances, ultraviolet extinction, and infrared emission. By modifying the SpDust code to compute the rotational emission from these grains, we find that nanosilicate grains could account for the entirety of the observed AME, whereas iron grains could be responsible for only a fraction, even for extreme assumptions on the amount of interstellar iron concentrated in ultrasmall iron nanoparticles. Given the added complexity of contributions from multiple grain populations to the total spinning dust emission, as well as existing uncertainties due to the poorly constrained grain size, charge, and dipole moment distributions, we discuss generic, carrier-independent predictions of spinning dust theory and observational tests that could help identify the AME carrier(s).

The prevailing theory has been that these are the core-collapse explosions of very massive stars embedded in helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM). We report optical observations of six new SNe Ibn: PTF11rfh, PTF12ldy, iPTF14aki, iPTF15ul, SN 2015G, and iPTF15akq. This brings the sample size of such objects in the literature to 22. We also report new data, including a near-infrared spectrum, on the Type Ibn SN 2015U. In order to characterize the class as a whole, we analyze the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the full Type Ibn sample. We find that, despite the expectation that CSM interaction would generate a heterogeneous set of light curves, as seen in SNe IIn, most Type Ibn light curves are quite similar in shape, declining at rates around 0.1 mag day(-1) during the first month after maximum light, with a few significant exceptions. Early spectra of SNe Ibn come in at least two varieties, one that shows narrow P Cygni lines and another dominated by broader emission lines, both around maximum light, which may be an indication of differences in the state of the progenitor system at the time of explosion. Alternatively, the spectral diversity could arise from viewing-angle effects or merely from a lack of early spectroscopic coverage. Together, the relative light curve homogeneity and narrow spectral features suggest that the CSM consists of a spatially confined shell of helium surrounded by a less dense extended wind.

Aerosol scattering effects on water vapor retrievals over the Los Angeles Basin	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SIMULATED RETRIEVALS; OPTICAL DEPTH; CO2 EMISSIONS; CLARS-FTS; ALGORITHM; CH4; UNCERTAINTIES; REANALYSIS; CALIFORNIA; SATELLITE	In this study, we propose a novel approach to describe the scattering effects of atmospheric aerosols in a complex urban environment using water vapor (H2O) slant column measurements in the near infrared. This approach is demonstrated using measurements from the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the top of Mt. Wilson, California, and a two-stream-exact single scattering (2S-ESS) radiative transfer (RT) model. From the spectral measurements, we retrieve H2O slant column density (SCD) using 15 different absorption bands between 4000 and 8000 cm(-1). Due to the wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering, large variations in H2O SCD retrievals are observed as a function of wavelength. Moreover, the variations are found to be correlated with aerosol optical depths (AODs) measured at the AERONET-Caltech station. Simulation results from the RT model reproduce this correlation and show that the aerosol scattering effect is the primary contributor to the variations in the wavelength dependence of the H2O SCD retrievals. A significant linear correlation is also found between variations in H2O SCD retrievals from different bands and corresponding AOD data; this correlation is associated with the asymmetry parameter, which is a first-order measure of the aerosol scattering phase function. The evidence from both measurements and simulations suggests that wavelength-dependent aerosol scattering effects can be derived using H2O retrievals from multiple bands. This understanding of aerosol scattering effects on H2O retrievals suggests a promising way to quantify the effect of aerosol scattering on greenhouse gas retrievals and could potentially contribute towards reducing biases in greenhouse gas retrievals from space.

Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres	SCIENCE			English	Article							WATER-ICE; MATTER; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; SPECTROSCOPY	Organic compounds occur in some chondritic meteorites, and their signatures on solar system bodies have been sought for decades. Spectral signatures of organics have not been unambiguously identified on the surfaces of asteroids, whereas they have been detected on cometary nuclei. Data returned by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on board the Dawn spacecraft show a clear detection of an organic absorption feature at 3.4 micrometers on dwarf planet Ceres. This signature is characteristic of aliphatic organic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of similar to 1000 square kilometers close to the similar to 50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and organic material indicates a very complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.

The NR simulations expand the domain of calibration toward larger mass ratios and spins, as compared to the previous EOBNR model. Merger-ringdown waveforms computed in black-hole perturbation theory for Kerr spins close to extremal provide additional inputs to the calibration. For the inspiral-plunge phase, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently explore the calibration space. For the merger-ringdown phase, we fit the NR signals with phenomenological formulae. After extrapolation of the calibrated model to arbitrary mass ratios and spins, the (dominant-mode) EOBNR waveforms have faithfulness-at design Advanced-LIGO sensitivity-above 99% against all the NR waveforms, including 16 additional waveforms used for validation, when maximizing only on initial phase and time. This implies a negligible loss in event rate due to modeling for these binary configurations. We find that future NR simulations at mass ratios greater than or similar to 4 and double spin greater than or similar to 0.8 will be crucial to resolving discrepancies between different ways of extrapolating waveform models. We also find that some of the NR simulations that already exist in such region of parameter space are too short to constrain the low-frequency portion of the models. Finally, we build a reduced-order version of the EOBNR model to speed up waveform generation by orders of magnitude, thus enabling intensive data-analysis applications during the upcoming observation runs of Advanced LIGO.

Interpreting millimeter-wave radiances over tropical convective clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							MICROWAVE RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; SCATTERING PROPERTIES; 183 GHZ; PART I; PRECIPITATION; PARAMETERIZATION; ALGORITHMS; PARTICLES; DATABASE; MODEL	Attempts to interpret the measurements of millimeter-wave radiometers over tropical storms must overcome the difficulty of modeling the scattering signatures of hydrometeors at these frequencies. Most approaches to date try to retrieve surface precipitation, to which the observations are not directly sensitive. In fact, millimeter wavelengths are most sensitive to the scattering from solid hydrometeors within the upper levels of the cloud. Millimeter-wavelength radiometers have a definite advantage over the lower frequency radiometers in that they have finer spatial resolution to resolve deep convection. Preliminary analyses summarized here indicate that the measurements are indeed sensitive to the depth and intensity of convection. The challenge is to derive a robust approach to make quantitative estimates of the characteristics of the convection directly from the observations, and conversely to derive a robust forward representation of the dependence of the radiances on the underlying moisture fields, to enable effective data assimilation. This is accomplished using a two-step semiempirical approach: first, nearly simultaneous coincident observations by millimeter-wave radiometers and orbiting atmospheric profiling radars are used to enforce unbiased consistency between modeled brightness temperatures and radar and radiometer observations; second, the departure from the first-step mean empirical relations are explained in terms of the moisture variables, using cloud-resolving simulations with different microphysical schemes, including an original microphysical representation that proves to be more consistent with remote sensing observations than existing schemes. The results are a retrieval approach and a forward representation that are unbiased by construction, with uncertainties quantified by the corresponding conditional variances.	[Haddad, Z. S.; Sy, O.

Impacts of coal dust from an active mine on the spectral reflectance of Arctic surface snow in Svalbard, Norway	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							LIGHT-ABSORBING IMPURITIES; INDUSTRIAL BLACK CARBON; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; GRAIN-SIZE; SOOT; ALBEDO; ANTARCTICA; DEPOSITION; RESOLUTION; PARTICLES	Light-absorbing particles (LAPs) in snow such as dust and black carbon influence the radiative forcing at the Earth's surface, which has major implications for global climate models. LAPs also significantly influence the melting of glaciers, sea ice, and seasonal snow. Here we present an in situ study of surface snow near an active coal mine in the Norwegian Arctic. We couple measurements of spectral hemispherical directional reflectance factor (HDRF) with measurements of LAPs characterized in two ways, as refractory black carbon using a Single Particle Soot Photometer and the total light absorption of LAPs measured with the Light Absorption Heating Method. The Snow Ice and Aerosol Radiation model was constrained by LAP measurements. Results were compared to observed spectral albedo measurements. Modeled and observed albedos were similar at the cleaner and more remote sites. However, the modeled spectral albedos do not fully account for the low spectral albedo measured next to the mine. LAP measurements also showed a large variation in particle sizes (tenths to tens of microns) related to transport distance of the particles from the mine. Here we find that LAPs from coal dust reduce the spectral HDRF by up to 84% next to the mine and 55% 0.5 km downwind of the mine. The coupling of extreme LAP observations (1 ng g(-1) to 4863 ng g(-1)) with HDRF measurements from 350 to 2500nm has facilitated the development of spectral band pairs, which could be used in the future to remotely assess LAPs in Arctic snow.

In this study, we optimize the fault geometry and invert for fault slip based on coseismic GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for the 2016 M-w 6.2 Amatrice earthquake in Italy. Our results show that nearly all the fault slip occurred between 3 and 6 km depth but extends 20 km along strike. There was less than 4 cm static surface displacement at the town Amatrice where the most devastating damage occurred. Landslides triggered by earthquake ground shaking are not uncommon, but triggered landslides with submeter movement are challenging to be observed in the field. We find evidence of coseismically triggered deep-seated landslides northwest and northeast of the epicenter where coseismic peak ground acceleration was estimated >0.5 g. By combining ascending and descending InSAR data, we are able to estimate the landslide thickness as at least 100 and 80 m near Monte Vettore and west of Castelluccio, respectively. The landslide near Monte Vettore terminates on the preexisting fault Monte Vettore Fault (MVEF) scarp. Our results imply that the long-term fault slip rate of MVEF estimated based on paleoseismic studies could potentially have errors due to triggered landslides from nearby earthquake events.

CO2 emission of Indonesian fires in 2015 estimated from satellite-derived atmospheric CO2 concentrations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; XCO2 RETRIEVALS	Indonesia experienced an exceptional number of fires in 2015 as a result of droughts related to the recent El Nio event and human activities. These fires released large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Emission databases such as the Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 and the Global Fire Emission Database version 4s estimated the CO2 emission to be approximately 1100 MtCO(2) in the time period from July to November 2015. This emission was indirectly estimated by using parameters like burned area, fire radiative power, and emission factors. In the study presented in this paper, we estimate the Indonesian fire CO2 emission by using the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2, XCO2, derived from measurements of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite mission. The estimated CO2 emission is 748 +/- 209 MtCO(2), which is about 30% lower than provided by the emission databases.

The vanishing cryovolcanoes of Ceres	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WATER ICE; DIFFERENTIATION; SATELLITES; TOPOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; RATES	Ahuna Mons is a 4 km tall mountain on Ceres interpreted as a geologically young cryovolcanic dome. Other possible cryovolcanic features are more ambiguous, implying that cryovolcanism is only a recent phenomenon or that other cryovolcanic structures have been modified beyond easy identification. We test the hypothesis that Cerean cryovolcanic domes viscously relax, precluding ancient domes from recognition. We use numerical models to predict flow velocities of Ahuna Mons to be 10-500 m/Myr, depending upon assumptions about ice content, rheology, grain size, and thermal parameters. Slower flow rates in this range are sufficiently fast to induce extensive relaxation of cryovolcanic structures over 10(8)-10(9) years, but gradual enough for Ahuna Mons to remain identifiable today. Positive topographic features, including a tholus underlying Ahuna Mons, may represent relaxed cryovolcanic structures. A composition for Ahuna Mons of >40% ice explains the observed distribution of cryovolcanic structures because viscous relaxation renders old cryovolcanoes unrecognizable.

Here, we use geometrically complex three-dimensional mechanical models driven by current geodetic strain rates to test two proposed subsurface models of the fault system. We find that the model that incorporates a ramp geometry for the Ventura-Pitas Point fault better reproduces both the regional long term geologic slip rate data and interseismic GPS observations of uplift in the Santa Ynez Mountains. The model-calculated average reverse slip rate for the Ventura-Pitas Point fault is 3.5 +/- 0.3 mm/yr, although slip rates are spatially variable on the fault surface with > 8 mm/yr predicted on portions of the lower ramp section at depth.

We use a three-dimensional inversion constrained by multibeam echo sounding data offshore and bed topography from a mass conservation reconstruction on land. The seamless bed elevation data refine details of the Pine Island sub-ice shelf cavity, a slightly thinner cavity beneath Thwaites, and previously unknown deep (> 1200 m) channels beneath the Crosson and Dotson ice shelves that shallow (500 m and 750 m, respectively) near the ice shelf fronts. These sub-ice shelf channels define the natural pathways for warm, circumpolar deep water to reach the glacier grounding lines, melt the ice shelves from below, and constrain the pattern of past and future glacial retreat.

Tundra photosynthesis captured by satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PERMAFROST CARBON; GROWING-SEASON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION; ECOSYSTEM; SNOW; SIMULATIONS; FLUXES; CYCLE; VULNERABILITY	Accurately quantifying the timing and magnitude of respiration and photosynthesis by high-latitude ecosystems is important for understanding how a warming climate influences global carbon cycling. Data-driven estimates of photosynthesis across Arctic regions often rely on satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI); we find that satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provide a more direct proxy for photosynthesis. We model Alaskan tundra CO2 cycling (2012-2014) according to temperature and shortwave radiation and alternately input EVI or SIF to prescribe the annual seasonal cycle of photosynthesis. We find that EVI-based seasonality indicates spring "green-up" to occur 9 days prior to SIF-based estimates, and that SIF-based estimates agree with aircraft and tower measurements of CO2. Adopting SIF, instead of EVI, for modeling the seasonal cycle of tundra photosynthesis can result in more accurate estimates of growing season duration and net carbon uptake by arctic vegetation.

Satellite sensors were capable of detecting biophysical signatures associated with the wastewater, compared to ambient ocean waters, enabling monitoring of environmental impacts over a greater spatial extent than in situ sampling alone. Thermal satellite sensors measured decreased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the surfacing plumes. Ocean color satellite sensors did not measure a distinguishable biological response in terms of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations during the short lived, three-day long, 2006 HTP diversion. A period of decreased chl-a concentration was observed during the three-week long 2012 OCSD diversion, likely in association with enhanced chlorination of the discharged wastewater that suppressed the phytoplankton response and/or significant uptake by heterotrophic bacteria. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data were able to identify and track the 2006 HTP wastewater plume through changes in surface roughness related to the oily components of the treated surfacing wastewater. Overall, it was found that chl-a and SST values must have differences of at least 1 mg m(-3) and 0.5 degrees C, respectively, in comparison with adjacent waters for wastewater plumes and their biophysical impact to be detectable from satellite. For a wastewater plume to be identifiable in SAR imagery, wind speeds must range between similar to 3 and 8 m s(-1). The findings of this study illustrate the benefit of utilizing multiple satellite sensors to monitor the rapidly changing environmental response to surfacing wastewater plumes, and can help inform future wastewater diversions in coastal areas.

OCO-2 was successfully launched on 2 July 2014 and has gathered more than 2 years of observations. The v7/v7r operational data products from September 2014 to January 2016 are discussed here. On monthly timescales, 7 to 12% of these measurements are sufficiently cloud and aerosol free to yield estimates of the column-averaged atmospheric CO2 dry air mole fraction, XCO2, that pass all quality tests. During the first year of operations, the observing strategy, instrument calibration, and retrieval algorithm were optimized to improve both the data yield and the accuracy of the products. With these changes, global maps of XCO2 derived from the OCO-2 data are revealing some of the most robust features of the atmospheric carbon cycle. This includes XCO2 enhancements co-located with intense fossil fuel emissions in eastern US and eastern China, which are most obvious between October and December, when the north-south XCO2 gradient is small. Enhanced XCO2 coin-cident with biomass burning in the Amazon, central Africa, and Indonesia is also evident in this season. In May and June, when the north- south XCO2 gradient is largest, these sources are less apparent in global maps. During this part of the year, OCO- 2 maps show a more than 10 ppm reduction in XCO2 across the Northern Hemisphere, as photosynthesis by the land biosphere rapidly absorbs CO2. As the carbon cycle science community continues to analyze these OCO-2 data, information on regional-scale sources 9emitters) and sinks 9absorbers) which impart XCO2 changes on the order of 1 ppm, as well as far more subtle features, will emerge from this high-resolution global dataset.

Different sensors and survey configurations can affect the metrics derived from the LiDAR data. We evaluate the ability of the metrics derived from the echo-based and CHM data models to estimate AGB in three different biomes, as well as the impact of point density on the metrics derived from them. Results: Our results show that differences among metrics derived at different point densities were significantly different from zero, with a larger impact on CHM-based than echo-based metrics, particularly when the point density was reduced to 1 point m(-2). Both data models-echo-based and CHM-performed similarly well in estimating AGB at the three study sites. For the temperate forest in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA, R-2 ranged from 0.79 to 0.8 and RMSE (reIRMSE) from 69.69 (35.59%) to 70.71 (36.12%) Mg ha(-1) for the echo-based model and from 0.76 to 0.78 and 73.84 (37.72%) to 128.20 (65.49%) Mg ha(-1) for the CHM-based model. For the moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, the models gave R-2 ranging between 0.70 and 0.71 and RMSE between 30.08 (12.36%) and 30.32 (12.46) Mg ha(-1)[between 0.69-0.70 and 30.42 (12.50%) and 61.30 (25.19%) Mg ha(-1)] for the echo-based [CHM-based] models. Finally, for the Atlantic forest in the Sierra do Mar, Brazil, R-2 was between 0.58-0.69 and RMSE between 37.73 (8.67%) and 39.77 (9.14%) Mg ha(-1) for the echo-based model, whereas for the CHM R-2 was between 0.37-0.45 and RMSE between 45.43 (10.44%) and 67.23 (15.45%) Mg ha(-1). Conclusions: Metrics derived from the CHM show a higher dependence on point density than metrics derived from the echo-based data model. Despite the median of the differences between metrics derived at different point densities differing significantly from zero, the mean change was close to zero and smaller than the standard deviation except for very low point densities (1 point m(-2)). The application of calibrated models to estimate AGB on metrics derived from thinned datasets resulted in less than 5% error when metrics were derived from the echo-based model. For CHM-based metrics, the same level of error was obtained for point densities higher than 5 points m(-2). The fact that reducing point density does not introduce significant errors in AGB estimates is important for biomass monitoring and for an effective implementation of climate change mitigation policies such as REDD + due to its implications for the costs of data acquisition. Both data models showed similar capability to estimate AGB when point density was greater than or equal to 5 point m(-2).

The predissociation rates of the c (3)Pi(-)(u) (v, N) levels by direct and indirect spin-spin and spin-orbit coupling between c (3)Pi(u) -b (3)Sigma(+)(u) fine structure levels, have been also determined. The present investigation achieved good agreement with measured lifetimes of the c (3)Pi(-)(u) fine structure levels without adjustment. A comparison of the calculated and observed lifetimes of metastable H-2, HD, and D-2 suggests that the c (3)Pi(-)(u) -b (3)Sigma(+)(u) magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transition moments underestimate the spontaneous emission rate of the metastable levels by similar to 370 s(-1). The measured and calculated lifetimes of H-2, HD, and D-2 fine structure levels are in very good agreement after the adjustment of 370 s(-1) to the spontaneous decay rate of the c (3)Pi(-)(u) -b (3)Sigma(+)(u) transition. The calculated energies, transition probabilities, and predissociation rates obtained in the present work, along with the c (3)Pi(u) state excitation function, are sufficient to determine the c (3)Pi(u) state emission cross section, the kinetic energy distribution of H(1s) atoms, and the energy deposition rate of the (1)Sigma(+)(g) -c (3)Pi(u) excitation. In a previous investigation by Berg and Ottinger (1994 J. Chem. Phys. 100 8746), the authors were forced to insert a large scale factor into the predissociation rate in order to reconcile with measured lifetimes. Errors introduced in the approximations made in the previous investigations are discussed in the text. The H-2 c (3)Pi(u) state has the second largest triplet state excitation cross section. Predissociation and spontaneous emission of the c (3)Pi(u) state plays an important role in the energy deposition of H-2-dominated atmospheres.

The data set currently spans the years 2008-2015, and measurements are ongoing at Kiruna. The spectra are inverted using an optimal estimation method to retrieve altitude profiles of CO concentrations in the atmosphere within an average altitude range of 48-84 km. Atmospheric temperature data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder aboard the US Air Force meteorological satellite DMSP-F18, are used in the inversion of KIMRA spectra between January 2011 and May 2014. This KIMRA CO data set is compared with CO data from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Aura satellite: there is a maximum bias for KIMRA of similar to 0.65 ppmv at 68 km (corresponding to 14.7% of the mean CO value at 68 km) and a maximum relative bias of 22% (0.44 ppmv) at 60 km. Standard deviations of the differences between profiles are similar in magnitude to the estimated uncertainties in the profiles. Correlations between the instruments are within 0.87 and 0.94. These numbers indicate agreement between the instruments. To expand the CO data set outside of the lifetime of DMSP-F18, another inversion setup was used that incorporates modelled temperatures from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The effect on the retrieved CO profiles when using a different temperature data set in the inversion was assessed. A comparison of the two overlapping KIMRA CO data sets shows a positive bias of < 5% in the extended data set and a correlation > 0.98 between the lower retrievable altitude limit and 82.5 km. The extended data set shows a larger range (<= 6 %) of CO concentrations that is not explained by random error estimates. Measurements are continuing and the extended KIMRA CO time series currently spans 2008-2015, with gaps corresponding to non-operation and summer periods when CO concentrations below similar to 90 km drop to very low values.

Revised geometric estimates of the North Galactic Pole and the Sun's height above the Galactic mid-plane	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Galaxy: centre; Galaxy: disc; Galaxy: fundamental parameters; Galaxy: general; Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics; Galaxy: structure	OPEN CLUSTERS; SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD; INTERSTELLAR EXTINCTION; STELLAR POPULATION; GALAXY; STARS; DISTANCE; CATALOG; DISPLACEMENT; SYSTEM	Astronomers are entering an era of mu as-level astrometry utilizing the 5-decade-old IAU Galactic coordinate system which was only originally defined to similar to 0 degrees.1 accuracy, and where the dynamical centre of the Galaxy (Sgr A*) is located similar to 0 degrees.07 from the origin. We calculate new independent estimates of the North Galactic Pole (NGP) using recent catalogues of Galactic disc tracer objects such as embedded and open clusters, infrared bubbles, dark clouds and young massive stars. Using these catalogues, we provide two new estimates of the NGP. Solution 1 is an 'unconstrained' NGP determined by the Galactic tracer sources, which does not take into account the location of Sgr A*, and which lies 90.degrees 120 +/- 0 degrees.029 from Sgr A*, and Solution 2 is a 'constrained' NGP which lies exactly 90 degrees from Sgr A*. The 'unconstrained' NGP has International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) position: alpha(NGP) = 192 degrees.729 +/- 0 degrees.035, delta(NGP) = 27 degrees.084 +/- 0 degrees.023 and theta= 122 degrees.928 +/- 0 degrees.016. The 'constrained' NGP which lies exactly 90 theta away from Sgr A* has ICRS position: alpha(NGP) = 192 degrees.728 +/- 0 degrees.010, delta(NGP) = 26 degrees.863 +/- 0 degrees.019 and theta = 122 degrees.928 +/- 0 degrees.016. The difference between the solutions is likely due to the Sun lying above the Galactic mid-plane. Considering the angular separation between Sgr A* and our unconstrained NGP, and if one adopts the recent estimate of the Galactocentric distance for the Sun of R-0 = 8.2 +/- 0.1 kpc, then we estimate that the Sun lies z(circle dot) similar or equal to 17 +/- 5 pc above the Galactic mid-plane. Our value of z(circle dot) is consistent with the true median of 55 previous estimates published over the past century of the Sun's height above the Galactic mid-plane (z(circle dot) similar or equal to 17 +/- 2 pc).

DES Collaboration	Cosmic voids and void lensing in the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS; 1ST DATA; GRAVITY; RESOLUTION; EVOLUTION; DENSITY; CLUES; SYSTEMATICS; SIMULATION	Cosmic voids are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information about the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an increasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void studies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position errors of >= 50 Mpc h(-1)which can render many voids undetectable. We present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys, validate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-z redMaGiC galaxy sample of the DES Science Verification data. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding voids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the line-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-z scatter, the number of voids found in simulated spectroscopic and photometric galaxy catalogues is within 20 per cent for all transverse void sizes, and indistinguishable for the largest voids (R-v >= 70 Mpc h(-1)). The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric voids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the algorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.8, we identify 87 voids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc h(-1), and carry out a stacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of 4.4 sigma, the lensing measurement confirms that the voids are truly underdense in the matter field and hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics in the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the viability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.

SCExAO traces the disk from r similar to 0."3 to r similar to 1" (34-114 au). The disk is oriented in a near east-west direction (PA similar to 75 degrees), is inclined by i similar to 70 degrees-75 degrees, and is strongly forward-scattering (g > 0.5). It is an extended disk rather than a sharp ring; a second, diffuse dust population extends from the disk's eastern side. While HD 36546 intrinsic properties are consistent with a wide age range (t similar to 1-250 Myr), its kinematics and analysis of coeval stars suggest a young age (3-10 Myr) and a possible connection to Taurus-Auriga's star formation history. SCExAO's planet-to-star contrast ratios are comparable to the first-light Gemini Planet Imager contrasts; for an age of 10 Myr, we rule out planets with masses comparable to HR 8799 b beyond a projected separation of 23 au. A massive icy planetesimal disk or an unseen super-Jovian planet at r > 20 au may explain the disk's visibility. The HD 36546 debris disk may be the youngest debris disk yet imaged, is the first newly identified object from the now-operational SCExAO extreme AO system, is ideally suited for spectroscopic follow-up with SCExAO/CHARIS in 2017, and may be a key probe of icy planet formation and planet-disk interactions.

The Effects of Ram-pressure Stripping and Supernova Winds on the Tidal Stirring of Disky Dwarfs: Enhanced Transformation into Dwarf Spheroidals	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: formation; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: structure; Local Group; methods: numerical	DARK-MATTER CORES; LOCAL GROUP; GALAXIES; ORIGIN; MASS; GAS; FEEDBACK; CUSPS; MILKY; SATELLITES	A conclusive model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies still remains elusive. Owing to their proximity to the massive spirals Milky Way (MW) and M31, various environmental processes have been invoked to explain their origin. In this context, the tidal stirring model postulates that interactions with MW-sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs, resembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, into systems with the kinematic and structural properties of dSphs. Using N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the dependence of this transformation mechanism on the gas fraction, f(gas), in the disk of the progenitor dwarf. Our numerical experiments incorporate for the first time the combined effects of radiative cooling, ram-pressure stripping, star formation, supernova (SN) winds, and a cosmic UV background. For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported dwarfs with gas fractions akin to those of observed dIrrs (f(gas) greater than or similar to 0.5), demonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs relative to their collisionless (f(gas) = 0) counterparts. We argue that the combination of ram-pressure stripping and SN winds causes the gas-rich dwarfs to respond more impulsively to tides, augmenting their transformation. When f(gas) greater than or similar to 0.5, disky dwarfs on previously unfavorable low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are still able to transform. On the widest orbits, the transformation is incomplete; the dwarfs retain significant rotational support, a relatively flat shape, and some gas, naturally resembling transition-type systems. We conclude that tidal stirring constitutes a prevalent evolutionary mechanism for shaping the structure of dwarf galaxies within the currently favored CDM cosmological paradigm.

J	Wakita, S; Nozawa, T; Hasegawa, Y				Wakita, Shigeru; Nozawa, Takaya; Hasegawa, Yasuhiro			Diffusion of Oxygen Isotopes in Thermally Evolving Planetesimals and Size Ranges of Presolar Silicate Grains	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						meteorites; meteors; meteoroids; planets and satellites: formation	EXTINCTION CURVES; DUST GRAINS; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; PRIMITIVE CHONDRITES; METAMORPHIC HISTORY; INTERPLANETARY DUST; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; PETROLOGIC TYPE; ABUNDANCES; EVOLUTION	Presolar grains are small particles found in meteorites through their isotopic compositions, which are considerably different from those of materials in the solar system. If some isotopes in presolar grains diffused out beyond their grain sizes when they were embedded in parent bodies of meteorites, their isotopic compositions could be washed out, and hence the grains could no longer be identified as presolar grains. We explore this possibility for the first time by self-consistently simulating the thermal evolution of planetesimals and the diffusion length of O-18 in presolar silicate grains. Our results show that presolar silicate grains smaller than similar to 0.03 mu m cannot keep their original isotopic compositions even if the host planetesimals experienced a maximum temperature as low as 600 degrees C. Since this temperature corresponds to that experienced by petrologic type 3 chondrites, isotopic diffusion can constrain the size of presolar silicate grains discovered in such chondrites to be larger than similar to 0.03 mu m. We also find that the diffusion length of 18O reaches similar to 0.3- 2 mu m in planetesimals that were heated up to 700- 800 degrees C. This indicates that, if the original size of presolar grains spans a range from similar to 0.001 mu m to similar to 0.3 mu m like that in the interstellar medium, then the isotopic records of the presolar grains may be almost completely lost in such highly thermalized parent bodies. We propose that isotopic diffusion could be a key process to control the size distribution and abundance of presolar grains in some types of chondrites.

Here we present the spectral analysis of these data sets along with an earlier observation and study the relativistic reflection and the primary coronal source. The data show strong reflection features in the form of both narrow and broad iron lines plus a Compton reflection hump. A cutoff energy is significantly detected in all exposures. The shape of the reflection spectrum does not change in the two years spanned by the observations, suggesting a stable geometry. A strong positive correlation is found between the cutoff energy and both the hard X-ray flux and spectral index. The measurements imply that the coronal plasma is not at the runaway electron-positron pair limit, and instead contains mostly electrons. The observed variability in the coronal properties is driven by a variable optical depth. A constant heating-to-cooling ratio is measured, implying that there is a feedback mechanism in which a significant fraction of the photons cooling the corona are due to reprocessed hard X-rays.

The NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey: The 40-month Catalog and the Properties of the Distant High-energy X-Ray Source Population	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general; surveys; Xrays: general Supporting material: figure sets; machine-readable tables	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; MEDIUM-SENSITIVITY SURVEY; DEEP FIELD-SOUTH; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; AREA SURVEY HELLAS; SWIFT-BAT SURVEY; OPTICAL-IDENTIFICATION; MIDINFRARED SELECTION; EXTRAGALACTIC SURVEYS; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION	We present the first full catalog and science results for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) serendipitous survey. The catalog incorporates data taken during the first 40 months of NuSTAR operation, which provide approximate to 20 Ms of effective exposure time over 331 fields, with an areal coverage of 13 deg2, and 497 sources detected in total over the 324 keV energy range. There are 276 sources with spectroscopic redshifts and classifications, largely resulting from our extensive campaign of ground-based spectroscopic follow-up. We characterize the overall sample in terms of the X-ray, optical, and infrared source properties. The sample is primarily composed of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), detected over a large range in redshift from z = 0.002 to 3.4 (median of < Z > = 0.56), but also includes 16 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. There is a large range in X-ray flux, from log(L10-40 (keV)/erg s(-1) cm(-2)) approximate to-14 to -11, and in rest-frame 1040 keV luminosity, from log(L10-40 (keV)/erg s(-1)) approximate to 39 to 46, with a median of 44.1. Approximately 79% of the NuSTAR sources have lower-energy (<10 keV) X-ray counterparts from XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Swift XRT. The mid-infrared (MIR) analysis, using WISE all-sky survey data, shows that MIR AGN color selections miss a large fraction of the NuSTAR-selected AGN population, from (similar to)15% at the highest luminosities (L-X >10(44) erg s(-1)) to approximate to 80% at the lowest luminosities (L-X <10(43) erg s(-1)). Our optical spectroscopic analysis finds that the observed fraction of optically obscured AGNs (i.e., the type 2 fraction) is F-TYPE (2) =53(-15)(+14)% , for a well-defined subset of the 824 keV selected sample. This is higher, albeit at a low significance level, than the type 2 fraction measured for redshift- and luminosity-matched AGNs selected by <10 keV X-ray missions.	[Lansbury, G.

The sensitivity of the NGVS imaging allows us to continuously probe galaxy colors over a factor of similar to 2 x 105 in luminosity, from brightest cluster galaxies to scales overlapping classical satellites of the Milky Way (M-g' similar to -9; M-*. similar to 10(6)M(circle dot)), within a single environment. Remarkably, we find the first evidence that the red sequence (RS) flattens in all colors at the faint-magnitude end (starting between -14 <= M-g' <= -13, around M-* similar to 4 x 10(7)M(circle dot)), with the slope decreasing to similar to 60% or less of its value at brighter magnitudes. This could indicate that the stellar populations of faint dwarfs in Virgo's core share similar characteristics (e.g., constant mean age) over similar to 3 mag in luminosity, suggesting that these galaxies were quenched coevally, likely via pre-processing in smaller hosts. We also compare our results to galaxy formation models, finding that the RS in model clusters have slopes at intermediate magnitudes that are too shallow, and in the case of semianalytic models, do not reproduce the flattening seen at both extremes (bright/faint) of the Virgo RS. Deficiencies in the chemical evolution of model galaxies likely contribute to the model-data discrepancies at all masses, while overly efficient quenching may also be a factor at dwarf scales. Deep UV and near-IR photometry are required to unambiguously diagnose the cause of the faint-end flattening.

All correlations must die: Assessing the significance of a stochastic gravitational-wave background in pulsar timing arrays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PRECISION; LIMITS; EFFICIENT; PACKAGE; MERGERS; TEMPO2; SIGNAL; NOISE; MODEL; TIME	We present two methods for determining the significance of a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background affecting a pulsar-timing array, where detection is based on evidence for quadrupolar spatial correlations between pulsars. Rather than constructing noise simulations, we eliminate the GWB spatial correlations in the true data sets to assess detection significance with all real data features intact. In our first method, we perform random phase shifts in the signal-model basis functions. This phase shifting eliminates signal phase coherence between pulsars, while keeping the statistical properties of the pulsar timing residuals intact. We then explore a method to null correlations between pulsars by using a "scrambled" overlap-reduction function in the signal model for the array. This scrambled function is orthogonal to what we expect of a real GW background signal. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods using Bayesian model selection on a set of simulated data sets that contain a stochastic GW signal, timing noise, undiagnosed glitches, and uncertainties in the Solar system ephemeris. Finally, we introduce an overarching formalism under which these two techniques are naturally linked. These methods are immediately applicable to all current pulsar-timing array data sets, and should become standard tools for future analyses.	[Taylor, S.

That conflict is expressed by Bell's inequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no statistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and anything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous experiments, this "freedom of choice" was addressed by ensuring that selection of measurement settings via conventional "quantum random number generators" was spacelike separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left open the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices and measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each experimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell's inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as "cosmic setting generators." In our tests with polarization-entangled photons, measurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way stars while simultaneously ensuring locality. Assuming fair sampling for all detected photons, and that each stellar photon's color was set at emission, we observe statistically significant. greater than or similar to 7.31s and. greater than or similar to 11.93 sigma violations of Bell's inequality with estimated p values of. less than or similar to 1.8 x 10(-13) and. less than or similar to 4.0 x 10(-33), respectively, thereby pushing back by similar to 600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist influences could have engineered the observed Bell violation.

We present a comprehensive mapping of ice velocity using a suite of satellite data from year 1991 to 2015, combined with ice thickness data from NASA Operation IceBridge, to calculate ice discharge. We find that ice discharge increased significantly after 2011 in Prince of Wales Icefield, maintained or decreased in other sectors, whereas glacier surges have little impact on long-term trends in ice discharge. During 1991-2005, the QEI mass loss averaged 6.3 +/- 1.1 Gt yr(-1), 52% from ice discharge and the rest from surface mass balance (SMB). During 2005-2014, the mass loss from ice discharge averaged 3.5 +/- 0.2 Gt yr(-1) (10%) versus 29.6 +/- 3.0 Gt yr(-1) (90%) from SMB. SMB processes therefore dominate the QEI mass balance, with ice dynamics playing a significant role only in a few basins.

Simultaneous constraints on cosmology and photometric redshift bias from weak lensing and galaxy clustering	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: statistics; cosmology: observations; dark energy; dark matter; large-scale structure of Universe	COSMIC SHEAR; PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; CROSS-CORRELATIONS; SELF-CALIBRATION; POWER SPECTRUM; TOMOGRAPHY; DISTRIBUTIONS; REQUIREMENTS; IMPACT	We investigate the expected cosmological constraints from a combination of cosmic shear and large-scale galaxy clustering using realistic photometric redshift distributions. Introducing a systematic bias in the lensing distributions (of 0.05 in redshift) produces a >2 sigma bias in the recovered matter power spectrum amplitude and dark energy equation of state for preliminary Stage III surveys. We demonstrate that cosmological error can be largely removed by marginalizing over biases in the assumed weak-lensing redshift distributions. Furthermore, the cosmological constraining power is retained despite removing much of the information on the lensing redshift biases. This finding relies upon high-quality redshift estimates for the clustering sample, but does not require spectroscopy. All galaxies in this analysis can thus be assumed to come from a single photometric survey. We show that this internal constraint on redshift biases arises from complementary degeneracy directions between cosmic shear and the combination of galaxy clustering and shear-density cross-correlations. Finally we examine a case where the assumed redshift distributions differ from the truth by more than a simple uniform bias. We find that the effectiveness of this self-calibration method will depend on the survey details and the nature of the uncertainties on the estimated redshift distributions.	[Samuroff, S.; Troxel, M.

Particularly puzzling are the planets found near the silicate sublimation front. We investigate conditions near the front in the protostellar disk around a young intermediate-mass star, using the first global 3D radiation nonideal MHD simulations in this context. We treat the starlight heating; the silicate grains' sublimation and deposition at the local, time-varying temperature and density; temperature-dependent ohmic dissipation; and various initial magnetic fields. The results show magnetorotational turbulence around the sublimation front at 0.5 au. The disk interior to 0.8 au is turbulent, with velocities exceeding 10% of the sound speed. Beyond 0.8 au is the dead zone, cooler than 1000 K and with turbulence orders of magnitude weaker. A local pressure maximum just inside the dead zone concentrates solid particles, favoring their growth. Over many orbits, a vortex develops at the dead zone's inner edge, increasing the disk's thickness locally by around 10%. We synthetically observe the results using Monte Carlo transfer calculations, finding that the sublimation front is near-infrared bright. The models with net vertical magnetic fields develop extended, magnetically supported atmospheres that reprocess extra starlight, raising the near-infrared flux 20%. The vortex throws a nonaxisymmetric shadow on the outer disk. At wavelengths > 2 mu m, the flux varies several percent on monthly timescales. The variations are more regular when the vortex is present. The vortex is directly visible as an arc at ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths, given sub-au spatial resolution.

We study intensity mapping of the H alpha 6563 angstrom, [O III] 5007 angstrom, [O II] 3727 angstrom, and H beta 4861 angstrom lines at 0.8 <= z <= 5.2. The mean intensities of these four emission lines are estimated using the observed luminosity functions (LFs), cosmological simulations, and the star formation rate density (SFRD) derived from observations at z less than or similar to 5. We calculate the intensity power spectra and consider the foreground contamination of other lines at lower redshifts. We use the proposed NASA small explorer SPHEREx (the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer) as a case study for the detectability of the intensity power spectra of the four emission lines. We also investigate the cross-correlation with the 21 cm line probed by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), Tianlai experiment and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) at 0.8 <= z <= 2.4. We find both the auto and cross power spectra can be well measured for the H alpha, [O III] and [O II] lines at z less than or similar to 3, while it is more challenging for the H beta line. Finally, we estimate the constraint on the SFRD from intensity mapping, and find we can reach an accuracy higher than 7% at z less than or similar to 4, which is better than with the usual method of measurements using the LFs of galaxies.

Factors influencing the skill of synthesized satellite wind products in the tropical Pacific	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL TRENDS; SURFACE; OCEAN; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS; CURRENTS; SENSOR; ARRAY; ENSO	Given the importance of tropical Pacific winds to global climate, it is interesting to examine differences in the mean and trend among various wind products, and their implications for ocean circulation. Past analysis has revealed that despite the assimilation of observational data, there remain large differences among reanalysis products. Thus, here we examine if satellite-based synthesis products may provide more consistent estimate than reanalysis. Reanalysis product winds are, however, typically used as a background constraint in constructing the synthesis products to fill spatiotemporal gaps and to deal with satellite wind direction ambiguity. Our study identified two important factors that influence both the mean and trends from synthesized wind products. First, the choice of background wind product in synthesized satellite wind products affects the mean and long-term trends, which has implications for simulations of ocean circulation, sea level, and presumably SST. Second, we identify a clear need for developing a better understanding of, and correcting differences between in situ observations of absolute winds with the satellite-derived relative winds prior to synthesizing. This correction requires careful analysis of satellite surface winds with existing colocated in situ measurements of surface winds and currents, and will benefit from near-surface current observations of the proposed Tropical Pacific Observing System. These results also illustrate the difficulty in independently evaluating the synthesis wind products because the in situ data have been utilized at numerous steps during their development. Addressing these identified issues effectively, will require enhanced collaborations among the wind observation (both satellite and in situ), reanalysis, and synthesis communities.

Mapping the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect toward MACS J0717.5+3745 with NIKA	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						techniques: high angular resolution; galaxies: clusters: individual: MACS J0717.5+3745; galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium	HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTION; STRONG-LENSING ANALYSIS; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; 30 M TELESCOPE; GALAXY CLUSTERS; XMM-NEWTON; INDUCTANCE DETECTORS; PECULIAR VELOCITIES; CROSS-CALIBRATION; COMPLETE SAMPLE	Measurement of the gas velocity distribution in galaxy clusters provides insight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form in the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be obtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is challenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic effects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report resolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple merger MACS J0717.5 + 3745 (z = 0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal (tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we extract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The kSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and + 3.4 sigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us and coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a major merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight velocity of MACS J0717.5 + 3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra, we fit this model to constrain the gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the first time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i. e. that is model-dependent). Our results are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and thanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the structure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination and systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter galaxies. Among the sources that we detect with NIKA, we find one which is likely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.

Urban Pollutant Transport and Infiltration into Buildings Using Perfluorocarbon Tracers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						indoor air quality (IAQ); air pollution; dispersion experiments; dynamics of indoor air contaminants; human exposure; indoor; outdoor ratio; perfluorocarbons; tracer; infiltration	IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; DISPERSION EXPERIMENTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; EXPOSURE; VARIABILITY; ATMOSPHERE; PRODUCTS; IMPACTS; SCHOOLS	People spend the majority of their time indoors and therefore the quality of indoor air is worthy of investigation; indoor air quality is affected by indoor sources of pollutants and from pollutants entering buildings from outdoors. In this study, unique perfluorocarbon tracers were released in five experiments at a 100 m and similar to 2 km distance from a large university building in Manchester, UK and tracer was also released inside the building to measure the amount of outdoor material penetrating into buildings and the flow of material within the building itself. Air samples of the tracer were taken in several rooms within the building, and a CO2 tracer was used within the building to estimate air-exchange rates. Air-exchange rates were found to vary between 0.57 and 10.90 per hour. Indoor perfluorocarbon tracer concentrations were paired to outdoor tracer concentrations, and in-out ratios were found to vary between 0.01 and 3.6. The largest room with the lowest air-exchange rate exhibited elevated tracer concentrations for over 60 min after the release had finished, but generally had the lowest concentrations, the room with the highest ventilation rates had the highest concentration over 30 min, but the peak decayed more rapidly. Tracer concentrations indoors compared to outdoors imply that pollutants remain within buildings after they have cleared outside, which must be considered when evaluating human exposure to outdoor pollutants.

Measuring the electron neutrino mass with improved sensitivity: the HOLMES experiment	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Cryogenic detectors; Neutrino detectors; Superconductive detectors (bolometers tunnel junctions etc); X-ray detectors	HO-163; DECAY	HOLMES is a new experiment aiming at directly measuring the neutrino mass with a sensitivity below 2 eV. HOLMES will perform a calorimetric measurement of the energy released in the decay of Ho-163. The calorimetric measurement eliminates systematic uncertainties arising from the use of external beta sources, as in experiments with spectrometers. This measurement was proposed in 1982 by A. De Rujula and M. Lusignoli, but only recently the detector technological progress has allowed to design a sensitive experiment. HOLMES will deploy a 1000 pixels array of low temperature microcalorimeters with implanted 163Ho nuclei. HOLMES, besides being an important step forward in the direct neutrino mass measurement with a calorimetric approach, will also establish the potential of this approach to extend the sensitivity down to 0.1 eV and lower. The detectors used for the HOLMES experiment will be Mo/Cu bilayers TESs (Transition Edge Sensors) on SiNx membrane with gold absorbers. Microwave multiplexed rf-SQUIDs are the best available technique to read out large array of such detectors. An extensive R&D activity is in progress in order to maximize the multiplexing factor while preserving the performances of the individual detectors. To embed the 163Ho into the gold absorbers a custom mass separator ion implanter is being developed. The current activities are focused on the the single detector performances optimization and on the 163Ho isotope production and embedding. A preliminary measurement of a sub-array of 4 x 16 detectors is planned late in 2017. In this contribution we present the HOLMES project with its technical challenges, its status and perspectives.

J	Nguyen, H; Cressie, N; Braverman, A				Hai Nguyen; Cressie, Noel; Braverman, Amy			Multivariate Spatial Data Fusion for Very Large Remote Sensing Datasets	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						EM algorithm; Fixed Rank Kriging; multivariate geostatistics; Spatial Random; Effects model	COLUMN OBSERVING NETWORK; CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA; DATA SETS; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION	Global maps of total-column carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction (in units of parts per million) are important tools for climate research since they provide insights into the spatial distribution of carbon intake and emissions as well as their seasonal and annual evolutions. Currently, two main remote sensing instruments for total-column CO2 are the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), both of which produce estimates of CO2 concentration, called profiles, at 20 different pressure levels. Operationally, each profile estimate is then convolved into a single estimate of column-averaged CO2 using a linear pressure weighting function. This total-column CO2 is then used for subsequent analyses such as Level 3 map generation and colocation for validation. In principle, total-column CO2 in these applications may be more efficiently estimated by making optimal estimates of the vector-valued CO2 profiles and applying the pressure weighting function afterwards. These estimates will be more efficient if there is multivariate dependence between CO2 values in the profile. In this article, we describe a methodology that uses a modified Spatial Random Effects model to account for the multivariate nature of the data fusion of OCO-2 and GOSAT. We show that multivariate fusion of the profiles has improved mean squared error relative to scalar fusion of the column-averaged CO2 values from OCO-2 and GOSAT. The computations scale linearly with the number of data points, making it suitable for the typically massive remote sensing datasets. Furthermore, the methodology properly accounts for differences in instrument footprint, measurement-error characteristics, and data coverages.

A comprehensive timing model will produce featureless residuals, which are presumably composed of dominating noise and weak physical effects excluded from the timing model (e. g. gravitational waves). In order to apply optimal statistical methods for detecting weak gravitational wave signals, we need to know the statistical properties of noise components in the residuals. In this paper we utilize a variety of non-parametric statistical tests to analyze the whiteness and Gaussianity of the NorthAmerican Nanohertz Observatory for GravitationalWaves (NANOGrav) 5year timing data, which are obtained from Arecibo Observatory and Green Bank Telescope from 2005 to 2010. We find that most of the data are consistent with white noise; many data deviate from Gaussianity at different levels, nevertheless, removing outliers in some pulsars will mitigate the deviations.

PREPARING FOR ADVANCED LIGO: A STAR-GALAXY SEPARATION CATALOG FOR THE PALOMAR TRANSIENT FACTORY	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; galaxies: statistics; methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; stars: statistics; surveys	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; OSCILLATION SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; VARIABLE-STARS; DATA RELEASES; SDSS; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; COUNTERPART; SEARCH; FIELD	The search for fast optical transients, such as the expected electromagnetic counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, is riddled with false positives (FPs) ranging from asteroids to stellar flares. While moving objects are readily rejected via image pairs separated by similar to 1 hr, stellar flares represent a challenging foreground, significantly outnumbering rapidly evolving explosions. Identifying stellar sources close to and fainter than the transient detection limit can eliminate these FPs. Here, we present a method to reliably identify stars in deep co-adds of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) imaging. Our machine-learning methodology utilizes the random forest (RF) algorithm, which is trained using > 3 x 10(6) sources with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. When evaluated on an independent test set, the PTF RF model outperforms the SExtractor star classifier by similar to 4%. For faint sources (r' >= 21 mag), which dominate the field population, the PTF RF model produces a similar to 19% improvement over SExtractor. To avoid false negatives in the PTF transient-candidate stream, we adopt a conservative stellar classification threshold, corresponding to a galaxy misclassification rate of 0.005. Ultimately, similar to 1.70 x 10(8) objects are included in our PTF point-source catalog, of which only similar to 10(6) are expected to be galaxies. We demonstrate that the PTF RF catalog reveals transients that otherwise would have been missed. To leverage its superior image quality, we additionally create an SDSS point-source catalog, which is also tuned to have a galaxy misclassification rate of 0.005. These catalogs have been incorporated into the PTF real-time pipelines to automatically reject stellar sources as non-extragalactic transients.	[Miller, A.

OBSERVED ASTEROID SURFACE AREA IN THE THERMAL INFRARED	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: general; radiation mechanisms: thermal	MAIN BELT ASTEROIDS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; MODEL CALIBRATION; YARKOVSKY; DIAMETERS; EMISSION; SHAPE	The rapid accumulation of thermal infrared observations and shape models of asteroids has led to increased interest in thermophysical modeling. Most of these infrared observations are unresolved. We consider what fraction of an asteroid's surface area contributes the bulk of the emitted thermal flux for two model asteroids of different shapes over a range of thermal parameters. The resulting observed surface in the infrared is generally more fragmented than the area observed in visible wavelengths, indicating high sensitivity to shape. For objects with low values of the thermal parameter, small fractions of the surface contribute the majority of thermally emitted flux. Calculating observed areas could enable the production of spatially resolved thermal inertia maps from non-resolved observations of asteroids.	[Nugent, C.

Stagnant Shells in the Vicinity of the Dusty Wolf-Rayet-OB Binary WR 112	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						infrared: stars; stars: individual (WR 112); stars: winds; outflows; stars: Wolf-Rayet	MASSIVE STARS; QUINTUPLET CLUSTER; INTERSTELLAR DUST; EMISSION; EVOLUTION; YELLOW; SPECTROMETER; SPECTROSCOPY; SUPERGIANTS; CONSISTENT	We present high spatial resolution mid-infrared images of the nebula around the late-type carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC)-OB binary system WR. 112 taken by the recently upgraded VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared (VISIR) with the PAH1, Ne II_2, and Q3 filters. The observations reveal a morphology resembling a series of arc-like filaments and broken shells. Dust temperatures and masses are derived for each of the identified filamentary structures, which exhibit temperatures ranging from 179(-6)(+8) K at the exterior W2 filament to 355(-25)(+37) K in the central 3.. The total dust mass summed over the features is 2.6 +/- 0.4 x 10(-5)M(circle dot). A multi-epoch analysis of mid-IR photometry of WR. 112 over the past similar to 20 years reveals no significant variability in the observed dust temperature and mass. The morphology of the mid-IR dust emission from WR. 112 also exhibits no significant expansion from imaging data taken in 2001, 2007, and 2016, which disputes the current interpretation of the nebula as a high expansion velocity (similar to 1200 km s(-1)) "pinwheel"-shaped outflow driven by the central WC-OB collidingwind binary. An upper limit of less than or similar to 120 km s(-1) is derived for the expansion velocity assuming a distance of 4.15. kpc. The upper limit on the average total mass-loss rate from the central 3 '' of WR. 112 is estimated to be less than or similar to 8 x 10(-6)M(circle dot)year(-1). We leave its true nature as an open question, but propose that the WR. 112 nebula may have formed in the outflow during a previous red or yellow supergiant phase of the central Wolf-Rayet star.

Hya association (TWA) is presented. This census is built from a literature compilation supplemented with new spectra and 17 new radial velocities from ongoing membership surveys, as well as a reanalysis of Hipparcos data that confirmed HR. 4334 (A2 Vn) as a member. Although the dominant uncertainty in the IMF remains census incompleteness, a detailed statistical treatment is carried out to make the IMF determination independent of binning while accounting for small number statistics. The currently known high-likelihood members are fitted by a log-normal distribution with a central mass of 0.21(-0.06) M-+0.11(circle dot) Me and a characteristic width of 0.8(-0.1)(+0.2) dex in the 12M(Jup)-2M(circle dot) range, whereas a Salpeter power law with alpha= 2.2(-0.5)(+1.1) best describes the IMF slope in the 0.1-2M(circle dot) range. This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which may be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A tentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2MASS. J11472421-2040204 and 2MASS. J11193254-1137466 is identified: this indicates that there might be as many as 10(-5)(+13) similar members of TWA with hot-start model-dependent masses estimated at similar to 5-7M(Jup), most of which would be too faint to be detected in 2MASS. Our new radial velocity measurements corroborate the membership of 2MASS. J11472421-2040204, and secure TWA. 28 (M8.5 gamma), TWA. 29 (M9.5 gamma), and TWA. 33 (M4.5 e) as members. The discovery of 2MASS. J09553336-0208403, a young L7-type interloper unrelated to TWA, is also presented.

However, how to actually measure its constituents (substrate- to-metal donation and metal-to-substrate back-donation) is yet uncertain. Recently, we demonstrated that the DCD components can be neatly disentangled and the pi back-donation component put in strict correlation with some experimental observables. In the present work we make a further crucial step forward, showing that, in a large set of charged and neutral N-heterocyclic carbene complexes of gold(I), a specific component of the NMR chemical shift tensor of the carbenic carbon provides a selective measure of the sigma donation. This work opens the possibility of 1) to characterize unambiguously the electronic structure of a metal fragment (LAu(In+/0 in this case) by actually measuring its sigma-withdrawing ability, 2) to quickly establish a comparative trend for the ligand trans effect, and 3) to achieve a more rigorous control of the ligand electronic effect, which is a key aspect for the design of new catalysts and metal complexes.

J	Bellan, J				Bellan, Josette			Direct numerical simulation of a high-pressure turbulent reacting temporal mixing layer	COMBUSTION AND FLAME			English	Article						High-pressure combustion; Uphill diffusion during high-pressure combustion; Flame index at high pressure; Direct numerical simulation	MASS DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS; AUTOIGNITION; COMBUSTION; IGNITION; METHANE; HEPTANE; AIR	Direct Numerical Simulation realizations were created of a temporal mixing layer in which combustion occurs under high-pressure (high-p) turbulent conditions. The model combines the formulation of Masi, et al. (2013) for describing multi-species mixing under high-p conditions and a single-step chemical reaction of rate consistent with ignition prediction (Borghesi, and Bellan, 2015). In each simulation the computations are pursued past a time at which a maximum average-volumetric p is attained; most analysis is performed at this time, t(pp)(*). The ensemble of realizations explores the effect of the initial Reynolds number, Re-0, of the initial pressure, p(0), and of the initial composition of the two mixing-layer streams. The results show that the thermodynamic energy added by the reaction at the small scales is partially dissipated and partially backscattered. The formation of turbulent small scales is initiated by the morphological changes in the flow through stretching and twisting rather than vice versa. The reaction establishes primarily in the oxidizer stream and is preponderantly of diffusion type. Overwhelmingly, the higher reaction rates occur in the diffusion flame, particularly in regions of high density-gradient magnitude. At higher po the reaction rate reaches higher values and occurs in regions of higher density gradients. The range of reaction rates is independent of the Re-0 value but the magnitude of the density gradients increases with Re-0. When H2O and CO2 are initially present, uphill diffusion dominates over regular diffusion and occurs in regions of smaller density-gradient magnitude whereas regular diffusion occurs in regions of larger density-gradient magnitude where the reaction is more vigorous. H2O is more prone than CO2 to regular diffusion in the larger density-gradient magnitude regions. When H2O and CO2 only form in the flame, both H2O and CO2 are subject to regular diffusion over the entire range of density-gradient values. The dissipation probability density function is a log normal distribution at large dissipation values. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Three pronounced dry periods occurred during c. AD 490-610, 780-870, and 1010-1080, and low precipitation generally prevailed during the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (c. AD 950-1350), a finding that fills an important gap in knowledge of the spatial extent of droughts across North America during that period. During the cooler Little Ice Age' interval (c. AD 1350-1800), inferred water balance was generally more positive. Seven peaks in charcoal abundance represent fire events during both wet and dry periods. Unusually high charcoal and inorganic sediment deposition c. AD 1700 could reflect human activity in the watershed, as might an abrupt rise in the relative abundances of planktonic and tychoplanktonic diatoms in Wolf Lake during the AD 1860s. The diatom record displays periodicities of c. 256 and 512years in addition to high-frequency fluctuations, suggesting that significant precipitation variability is likely to continue to disrupt climatic trends in this region.

It will make available frequent ocean surface wind speed observations throughout the life cycle of tropical storms and hurricanes. In this study, the impact of CYGNSS ocean surface winds on numerical simulations of a hurricane case is assessed with a research version of the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model and a Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation analysis system in a regional observing system simulation experiment framework. Two different methods for reducing the CYGNSS data volume were tested: one in which the winds were thinned and one in which the winds were superobbed. The results suggest that assimilation of the CYGNSS winds has great potential to improve hurricane track and intensity simulations through improved representations of the surface wind fields, hurricane inner-core structures, and surface fluxes. The assimilation of the superobbed CYGNSS data seems to be more effective in improving hurricane track forecasts than thinning the data.

To support physically-based modeling of LAI processes, daily measurements of dust and black carbon (BC) stratigraphy, optical grain size, snow density and spectral albedo were collected over the 2013 ablation season in the Rocky Mountains, CO. Surface impurity concentrations exhibited a wide range of values (0.02- 6.0 mg g(-1) pptw) with 98% of mass being deposited by three episodic dust events in April. Even minor dust loading initiated albedo decline, and the negative relationship between dust concentrations and albedo was log-linear. As melt progressed, individual dust layers coalesced and emerged at the snow surface, with minimal mass loss to meltwater scavenging. The observations show that the convergence of dust layers at the surface reduced albedo to 0.3 and snow depth declined similar to 50% faster than other years with similar depth but less dust. The rapid melt led to an unexpected reduction in both grain size and density in uppermost surface layers. BC concentrations covaried with dust concentrations but were several orders of magnitude lower (< 1- 20 ppb).	[Skiles, S. McKenzie] Utah Valley Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Orem, UT 84058 USA; [Skiles, S.

A method to retrieve the spectral complex refractive index and single scattering optical properties of dust deposited in mountain snow	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						energy balance; ice/atmosphere interactions; snow/ice surface processes; snow	SAHARAN-MINERAL-DUST; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; ICE; AEROSOLS; ALBEDO; SAMPLES; RATES; ALPS; UV	Dust deposition to snow can have regionally important climatic and hydrologic impacts resulting from direct reduction of surface albedo and indirectly from the initiation of snow albedo feedbacks. Modeling the radiative impacts of dust deposited in snow requires knowledge of the optical properties of both components. Here we present an inversion technique to retrieve the effective optical properties of dust deposited in mountain snow cover from measurements of hemispherical dust reflectance and particle size distributions using radiative transfer modeling. First, modeled reflectance is produced from single scattering properties modeled with Mie theory for a specified grain size distribution over a range of values for the imaginary part of the complex refractive index (k = 0.00001-0.1). Then, a multi-step look-up table process is employed to retrieve k(lambda) and single scattering optical properties by matching measured to modeled reflectance across the shortwave and near infrared. The real part of the complex refractive index, n, for dust aerosols ranges between 1.5 and 1.6 and a sensitivity analysis shows the method is relatively insensitive to the choice of n within this range, 1.525 was used here. Using the values retrieved by this method to update dust optical properties in a snow + aerosol radiative transfer model reduces errors in springtime albedo modeling by 50-70%.	[Skiles, S.

Customized Real-Time Interior-Point Methods for Onboard Powered-Descent Guidance	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							LOSSLESS CONVEXIFICATION; CONVEX; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	This paper presents a new onboard-implementable, real-time convex optimization-based powered-descent guidance algorithm for planetary pinpoint landing. Earlier work provided the theoretical basis of convexification, the equivalent representation of the fuel-optimal pinpoint landing trajectory optimization problem with nonconvex control constraints as a convex optimization problem. Once the trajectory optimization problem is convexified, interior-point method algorithms can be used to solve the problem to global optimality. Though having this guarantee of convergence motivated earlier convexification results, there were no real-time interior point method algorithms available for the computation of optimal trajectories on flight computers. This paper presents the first such algorithm developed for onboard use and flight-tested on a terrestrial rocket with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the NASA Flight Opportunities Program in 2013. First, earlier convexification results are summarized and the resulting second-order cone-programming problem for fuel-optimal trajectory optimization is presented. Then, the proposed, fairly generic, second-order cone-programming interior point method algorithm is presented in detail with an overview of the customization process for real-time computations. Customization exploits a specific problem structure to increase the computational speed, which is shown to decrease run times by two to three orders of magnitude in many applications. A new convexification result for maximal-divert trajectories with active velocity constraints is also presented herein.

Here, guidance means generating feedforward reference trajectories for control systems. This paper presents terrestrial flight-test demonstrations of large diverts planned by G-FOLD onboard a vertical-takeoff/vertical-landing rocket. The G-FOLD parser, which transforms the guidance problem into a second-order cone program and so encodes the divert constraints, is described at an engineering level, including new and modified constraints incorporated for these flight tests. Several practical issues, such as discretization effects, are addressed, and the flight-test architecture is presented. A total of eight flight tests were performed. In the first three, the rocket executed diverts of increasing size preplanned by G-FOLD on the ground. Then G-FOLD was demonstrated running onboard five times. Three qualitatively different types of diverts were performed, demonstrating G-FOLD over a nontrivial area of the phase space of divert boundary conditions. With one exception not involving G-FOLD, the rocket then followed diverts planned onboard to meter-level precision, consistent with preflight performance predictions. These flight tests are believed to be the first demonstrations of large diverts with constrained, onboard powered-descent guidance, readying the way for adoption of G-FOLD by future missions.

Characterizing Drought in India Using GRACE Observations of Terrestrial Water Storage Deficit	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; RIVER-BASIN; METEOROLOGICAL SUBDIVISIONS; SUMMER MONSOON; VARIABILITY; INDEXES; VEGETATION; FREQUENCY; DATASET; STRESS	Frequent recurrences of drought in India have had major societal, economical, and environmental impacts. While region-specific assessments are abundant, exhaustive appraisal over large spatial scales has been insubstantial. Here a new drought index called Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) is devised and analyzed for holistic representation of drought. The crux of the method is the employment of terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) for quantification of drought intensity and severity. Drought events in recent times are well identified and quantified using the approach over four homogenous rainfall regions of India over the period from April 2002 to April 2015. Among the four regions, the highest peak deficit of -158.00 mm is observed in January 2015 over central India. While the drought of 2002-04 is prominent in peninsular and west-central India, the drought of 2009-10 and 2012-13 is conspicuous in almost all four regions of India. The longest deficit period of 23 months (from February 2009 to December 2010) and the highest severity value of -26.31 are observed in central and northwestern India, respectively. WSDI values show an increasing trend in west-central India (0.07 yr(-1)), indicating recovery from previously existing drought conditions. On the contrary, a decreasing trend in WSDI is observed in north-western (-0.07 yr(-1)) and central (-0.18 yr(-1)) India. Results demonstrate considerable confidence in the potential of WSDI for robust characterization of drought over large spatial scales.

High-temperature condensate clouds in super-hot Jupiter atmospheres	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual: WASP; 12b	MASS DWARF STARS; GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARF; MODEL ATMOSPHERES; SUBSTELLAR ATMOSPHERES; T-DWARF; CHEMISTRY; CIRCULATION; WASP-12B; DUST	Deciphering the role of clouds is central to our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, as they have a direct impact on the temperature and pressure structure, and observational properties of the planet. Super-hot Jupiters occupy a temperature regime similar to low-mass M-dwarfs, where minimal cloud condensation is expected. However, observations of exoplanets such as WASP-12b (T-eq similar to 2500 K) result in a transmission spectrum indicative of a cloudy atmosphere. We re-examine the temperature and pressure space occupied by these super-hot Jupiter atmospheres, to explore the role of the initial Al-and Ti-bearing condensates as the main source of cloud material. Due to the high temperatures, a majority of the more common refractory material is not depleted into deeper layers and would remain in the vapour phase. The lack of depletion into deeper layers means that these materials with relatively low cloud masses can become significant absorbers in the upper atmosphere. We provide condensation curves for the initial Al-and Ti-bearing condensates which may be used to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of metallicity on cloud masses, as planets with metal-rich hosts potentially form more opaque clouds because more mass is available for condensation. Increased metallicity also pushes the point of condensation to hotter, deeper layers in the planetary atmosphere further increasing the density of the cloud. We suggest that planets around metal-rich hosts are more likely to have thick refractory clouds, and discuss the implication on the observed spectra of WASP-12b.	[Wakeford, H. R.; Mandell, A.

In order to explain the exposure to cold extremes more comprehensively, this study investigates multiple aspects of boreal winter cold extremes, i.e., frequency, persistence, and entropy (Markovian descriptors). Cold extremes are defined by the bottom 10th percentile of daily minimum temperatures during 1950-2014 over the northern hemisphere. The spatial and temporal distributions of Markovian descriptors during 65 years are examined. Climatological mean fields show the spatial coincidence of higher frequency, shorter persistence, and higher entropy of cold extremes, and vice versa. In regard to the temporal variations over six representative regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, all regions share a decreasing tendency of frequency with the increases in regional winter mean temperature. By contrast, persistence and entropy show their intrinsic decadal variability depending on regions irrespective of the regional temperature variability, which give different information from frequency. Therefore, the exposure to cold extremes would not simply decrease with regional warming. Rather these results indicate that the descriptors with multiple aspects of the extremes would be needed to embrace the topical features as well as the holistic nature of cold extremes.

Fast and efficient model identification and parameter estimation techniques for various sources of deformation are crucial for process understanding, volcano hazard assessment and early warning purposes. As a simple model that can be a basis for rapid inversion techniques, we present a compound dislocation model (CDM) that is composed of three mutually orthogonal rectangular dislocations (RDs). We present new RD solutions, which are free of artefact singularities and that also possess full rotational degrees of freedom. The CDM can represent both planar intrusions in the near field and volumetric sources of inflation and deflation in the far field. Therefore, this source model can be applied to shallow dikes and sills, as well as to deep planar and equidimensional sources of any geometry, including oblate, prolate and other triaxial ellipsoidal shapes. In either case the sources may possess any arbitrary orientation in space. After systematically evaluating the CDM, we apply it to the co-eruptive displacements of the 2015 Calbuco eruption observed by the Sentinel-1A satellite in both ascending and descending orbits. The results show that the deformation source is a deflating vertical lens-shaped source at an approximate depth of 8 km centred beneath Calbuco volcano. The parameters of the optimal source model clearly show that it is significantly different from an isotropic point source or a single dislocation model. The Calbuco example reflects the convenience of using the CDM for a rapid interpretation of deformation data.

The Mushroom: A half-sky energetic ion and electron detector	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							PARTICLE; INSTRUMENT; MESSENGER	We present a time-of-flight mass spectrometer design for the measurement of ions in the similar to 30keV to 10 MeV range for protons (up to similar to 40 MeV and similar to 150 MeV for He and heavy ions, respectively) and similar to 30 keV to 1 MeV range for electrons, covering half of the sky with 80 apertures. The instrument, known as the "Mushroom," owing to its shape, solves the field of view problem for magnetospheric and heliospheric missions that employ three-axis stabilized spacecraft, yet still require extended angular coverage; the Mushroom is also compatible with a spinning spacecraft. The most important new feature of the Mushroom is the method through which uncomplicated electrostatic optics and clean position sensing combine to permit many apertures to fit into a compact, low-mass sensor head (or wedge), several of which (ideally eight) compose a full instrument. Most of the sensor head's volume is an empty, equipotential region, resulting in the modest 250 g mass of each 10-aperture wedge. The Mushroom is capable of separating ion species across most of its energy range and angular field of view. For example, separation of the neighboring He-3 and He-4 isotopes is excellent; the full width at half maximum mass resolution has been measured to be 0.24 amu to 0.32 amu, respectively. Converting this to a Gaussian width sigma(m) in mass m, this represents a sigma(m)/m mass resolution better than 0.04. This separation is highly desirable for the flight program for which the first Mushroom was built, the Solar Probe Plus mission. More generally, we estimate the mass resolution to be sigma(m)/m approximate to 0.1, but this is energy, mass, and angularly dependent. We also discuss the solid-state detector stack capability, which extends the energy range of protons and helium, with composition, to similar to 100 MeV.	[Hill, M. E.; Mitchell, D. G.; Andrews, G.

Two sources of dayside intense, quasi-coherent plasmaspheric hiss: A new mechanism for the slot region?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTIONS; DISCRETE CHORUS EMISSIONS; RADIATION BELT ELECTRONS; PITCH-ANGLE DIFFUSION; SUDDEN COMMENCEMENTS; ELF HISS; ORIGIN; SUBSTORM; MAGNETOSPHERE; POLAR	A study of dayside plasmaspheric hiss at frequencies from similar to 22 Hz to similar to 1.0 kHz was carried out by using 1 year of Polar data. It is shown that intense, dayside plasmaspheric hiss is correlated with solar wind pressure with P > 2.5 nPa. The dayside effect is most prominent in the similar to 300 to similar to 650 Hz range. Intense dayside waves are also present during SYM-H< similar to 5 nT. The latter is centered at local noon, with the greatest intensities in the L = 2 to 3 region. Assuming drift of similar to 25 keV electrons from midnight to the wave magnetic local time, plasmaspheric hiss is shown to be highly correlated with precursor AE* and SYM-H* indices, indicating that the hiss is associated with substorms and small injection events. Our hypothesis is that both sets of waves originate as outer zone (L = 6 to 10) chorus and then propagate into the plasmasphere. Fourteen high-intensity dayside plasmaspheric hiss events were analyzed to identify the wave k, polarization, and the degree of coherency. The waves are found to be obliquely propagating, elliptically polarized and quasi- coherent (similar to 0.5 to 0.8 correlation coefficient). It is hypothesized that the dayside plasmaspheric hiss is quasi- coherent because the chorus has been recently generated in the outer magnetosphere and have propagated directly into the plasmasphere. It is possible that the quasi- coherency of the dayside hiss at L = 2 to 3 may be an alternate explanation for the generation of the energetic particle slot region.

Nonlinear ionospheric responses to large-amplitude infrasonic-acoustic waves generated by undersea earthquakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							TOHOKU-OKI EARTHQUAKE; ELECTRON-CONTENT OBSERVATION; PACIFIC COAST; GRAVITY-WAVES; TSUNAMI; FIELD; DISTURBANCES; PROPAGATION; SIMULATION	Numerical models of ionospheric coupling with the neutral atmosphere are used to investigate perturbations of plasma density, vertically integrated total electron content (TEC), neutral velocity, and neutral temperature associated with large-amplitude acoustic waves generated by the initial ocean surface displacements from strong undersea earthquakes. A simplified source model for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is constructed from estimates of initial ocean surface responses to approximate the vertical motions over realistic spatial and temporal scales. Resulting TEC perturbations from modeling case studies appear consistent with observational data, reproducing pronounced TEC depletions which are shown to be a consequence of the impacts of nonlinear, dissipating acoustic waves. Thermospheric acoustic compressional velocities are similar to +/- 250-300 m/s, superposed with downward flows of similar amplitudes, and temperature perturbations are similar to 300 K, while the dominant wave periodicity in the thermosphere is similar to 3-4 min. Results capture acoustic wave processes including reflection, onset of resonance, and nonlinear steepening and dissipation-ultimately leading to the formation of ionospheric TEC depletions "holes"-that are consistent with reported observations. Three additional simulations illustrate the dependence of atmospheric acoustic wave and subsequent ionospheric responses on the surface displacement amplitude, which is varied from the Tohoku case study by factors of 1/100, 1/10, and 2. Collectively, results suggest that TEC depletions may only accompany very-large amplitude thermospheric acoustic waves necessary to induce a nonlinear response, here with saturated compressional velocities similar to 200-250 m/s generated by sea surface displacements exceeding similar to 1 m occurring over a 3 min time period.

Attribution of interminimum changes in global and hemispheric total electron content	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							SOLAR MINIMUM; IONOSPHERE	We use a new data product of electron column density (total electron content, or TEC) maps to estimate and attribute the interminimum changes (the differences between annual averages centered on the 2008 and 1996 solar minima) in TEC global and hemispheric averages (dividing the globe in three different ways). We attribute the observed changes to corresponding changes in solar and geomagnetic activity. The new TEC map product was constructed with temporally consistent processing, and it resolves some of the apparent inconsistencies of earlier studies. The estimated global average TEC interminimum change is -19.3% +/- 1.0% (2 sigma uncertainty), of which -9.1% is attributable to the interminimum change in solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance (as represented by the F-10.7 index), -2.2% is attributable to the change in geomagnetic activity (Kp index), and -9.3% remains unattributed. The hemispheric results are very similar to the global results, but the values tend to be slightly larger in the Southern Hemisphere, at low latitudes, and at night, compared to the opposing respective hemispheres. The interminimum changes and temporal variations of thermospheric mass density anomalies (i.e., the difference between the data and the empirical model) are very similar to those of the global and hemispheric TEC residuals, suggesting that they are driven by a common, globally distributed mechanism. Thermospheric composition changes and additional (unobserved) decreases in solar EUV irradiance are possible mechanisms behind the TEC and mass density unattributed changes; we estimate a plausible range of -6% to -13% for the solar EUV irradiance interminimum change.

Note: Improved heater design for high-temperature hollow cathodes	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article								We present an improved heater design for thermionic cathodes using a rhenium filament encased in a boron nitride ceramic sleeve. This heater is relatively simple to fabricate, yet has been successfully used to reliably and repeatably light a lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) hollow cathode based on a previously published design without noticeable filament degradation over hundreds of hours of operation. The high decomposition temperature of boron nitride (2800 C for inert environments) and melting point for rhenium (3180 C) make this heater especially attractive for use with LaB6, which may require operating temperatures upwards of 1700 C. While boron nitride decomposes in air above 1000 C, the heater was used only at vacuum with an inert gas discharge, and no degradation was observed. Limitations of current state of the art cathode heaters are also discussed and compared with the rhenium-boron nitride combination.	[McDonald, M.

Solder material experiencing low temperature inelastic stress and random vibration loading: predicted remaining useful lifetime	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							JOINTS; RELIABILITY; FATIGUE	Although there exist promising ways to avoid inelastic strains in solder joints of the second level interconnections in IC package designs, it still appears more typical than not that the peripheral joints of a package/PCB assembly experience inelastic strains. This takes place at low temperature conditions, when the deviation from the high fabrication temperature is the largest and the induced thermal stresses are the highest. On the other hand, it is well known that it is the combination of low temperatures and repetitive dynamic loading that accelerate dramatically the propagation of fatigue cracks, whether elastic or inelastic. Accordingly, a modification of the recently suggested Boltzmann-Arrhenius-Zhurkov model is developed for the evaluation of the remaining useful lifetime of the second level solder joint interconnection whose peripheral joints experience inelastic strains. The experimental basis of the approach is the highly focused and highly cost-effective failure-oriented-accelerated-testing (FOAT). The FOAT specimens are subjected in our methodology to the combined action of low temperatures (not to elevated temperatures, as in the classical Arrhenius model) and random vibrations with the given input energy spectrum. The suggested methodology is viewed as a possible, effective and attractive alternative to temperature cycling. As long as inelastic deformations take place, it is assumed that it is these deformations that determine the fatigue lifetime of the solder material, and the state of stress in the elastic mid-portion of the assembly does not have to be accounted for. The roles of the size and stiffness of this mid-portion have to be considered, however, when determining the very existence and establishing the size of the inelastic zones at the peripheral portions of the designs. The general concept is illustrated by a numerical example. Although this example is carried out for a ball-grid-array design, it is applicable to highly popular column-grid-array (CGA) and quad-flat-no-lead (QFN) designs as well. It is noteworthy that it is much easier to avoid inelastic strains in CGA and QFN structures than in the addressed BGA design. The random vibrations are considered in the developed methodology as a white noise of the given (m/s(2))(2)/Hz-the ratio of the acceleration amplitudes squared to the vibration frequency.

The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on board the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity on the surface of Mars has been measuring this effect for over four Earth years (about two Martian years). The anticorrelation between the recorded surface Galactic Cosmic Ray-induced dose rates and pressure changes has been investigated by Rafkin et al. (2014) and the long-term solar modulation has also been empirically analyzed and modeled by Guo et al. (2015). This paper employs the newly updated HZETRN2015 code to model the Martian atmospheric shielding effect on the accumulated dose rates and the change of this effect under different solar modulation and atmospheric conditions. The modeled results are compared with the most up-to-date (from 14 August 2012 to 29 June 2016) observations of the RAD instrument on the surface of Mars. Both model and measurements agree reasonably well and show the atmospheric shielding effect under weak solar modulation conditions and the decline of this effect as solar modulation becomes stronger. This result is important for better risk estimations of future human explorations to Mars under different heliospheric and Martian atmospheric conditions.

Probabilistic Palmgren-Miner rule, with application to solder materials experiencing elastic deformations	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							THERMAL-STRESSES; PREDICTED STRESSES	It has been recently shown that there are effective ways not only to reduce the interfacial stresses in electronic packaging assemblies with solder joint arrays as the second level of interconnections, but to do that to an extent that inelastic strains in the peripheral joints, where the induced thermal stresses and strains are the highest, are avoided. While various and numerous modifications of the empirical Coffin-Manson relationship are used to predict the fatigue life of solder materials experiencing inelastic strains and operated in low cycle fatigue conditions, the Palmgren-Miner rule of the linear accumulation of fatigue damages, although suggested many decades ago, is still viewed by many material scientists and reliability physicists as a suitable model that enables one to quantify the cumulative fatigue damage in metals experiencing elastic strains. In this analysis the Palmgren-Miner rule is extended for the case of random loading, and a simple formalism is suggested for the evaluation of the remaining useful lifetime for a solder material subjected to random loading and experiencing elastic thermally induced shearing deformations. Special highly focused and highly cost effective accelerated tests have to be conducted, of course, to establish the S-N curve for the given solder material. In the future work we intend to extend the suggested methodology to take into account various aspects of the physics-of-failure: the role of the growth kinetics of intermetallic compound layers; the random number, size and orientation of grains in the joints; position of the joint with respect to the mid-cross-section of the assembly (peripheral joints are more prone to elevated interfacial stresses); assembly size, etc. All this effort, important as it is, is, however, beyond the scope of this analysis, which is aimed at the extension of the classical Palmgren-Miner rule for the case of random loading.

Using an optical observation from the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory, we revise the redshift of the source from the previously reported z = 1.77 to z = 0.532, and we estimate the mass of the central black hole, log (MBH/M-circle dot) = 9.08 +/- 0.18. The X-ray spectrum of this source can be well described by a power law of photon index Gamma = 1.82 +/- 0.05 with E-cut = 152(-54)(+103) keV, in the rest frame of the source. Assuming a Comptonization model, we estimate the coronal temperature to be kT(e) = 42 +/- 3 keV and kTe = 56 +/- 3 keVfor a spherical and a slab geometry, respectively. The coronal properties are comparable to the ones derived for local active galactic nuclei, despite a difference of around one order of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity ( L-2 (-) (10) = 1.93 x 10(45) erg s(-1)). The quasar is X-ray loud, with an unusually flat observed optical-to-X-ray spectral slope alpha(OX) = 1.00 +/- 0.02, and has an exceptionally strong optical [O-III] line. Assuming that both the X-ray emission and the [O-III] line are isotropic, these two extreme properties can be explained by a nearly edge-on disc, leading to a reduction in the observed ultraviolet continuum light.

This derivation is based on the discrete representation of a sparse random medium (such as forest canopy) along with the solution to the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations. In addition to taking into account the random motion of scatterers, which has been investigated in previous work, the derived repeat-pass InSAR correlation model in this paper includes the effects of moisture-induced dielectric fluctuations. This is accomplished by incorporating a separate correlation profile that takes into account these fluctuations into the framework. Once constructed, the mathematical formulation of this scattering model is cast into a modified version of the Random Volume over Ground model such that it can separately take into account dielectric fluctuations in the ground and volume components. This model is then validated using a modified version of ESA's PolSARproSim simulation to show that similar results can be obtained from both the simulation and the theoretical model.

Although marker-based registration techniques (based on retroreflective spherical targets) are commonly used in practice, a blind marker-free approach is preferable, insofar as it supports rapid operational data acquisition. To support these efforts, we extend the pairwise registration approach of our earlier work, and develop a graph-theoretical framework to perform blind marker-free global registration of multiple point cloud data sets. Pairwise pose estimates are weighted based on their estimated error, in order to overcome pose conflict while exploiting redundant information and improving precision. The proposed approach was tested for eight diverse New England forest sites, with 25 scans collected at each site. Quantitative assessment was provided via a novel embedded confidence metric, with a mean estimated root-mean-square error of 7.2 cm and 89% of scans connected to the reference node. This paper assesses the validity of the embedded multiview registration confidence metric and evaluates the performance of the proposed registration algorithm.

J	Fattahi, H; Agram, P; Simons, M				Fattahi, Heresh; Agram, Piyush; Simons, Mark			A Network-Based Enhanced Spectral Diversity Approach for TOPS Time-Series Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Coregistration; interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); spectral diversity; terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS)	ILLAPEL EARTHQUAKE CHILE; M(W)8.3 ILLAPEL; WIDE-BAND; INTERFEROMETRY; DEFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; ACCURACY; MODEL	For multitemporal analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired with a terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS) mode, all acquisitions from a given satellite track must be coregistered to a reference coordinate system with accuracies better than 0.001 of a pixel (assuming full SAR resolution) in the azimuth direction. Such a high accuracy can be achieved through geometric coregistration, using precise satellite orbits and a digital elevation model, followed by a refinement step using a time-series analysis of coregistration errors. These errors represent the misregistration between all TOPS acquisitions relative to the reference coordinate system. We develop a workflow to estimate the time series of azimuth misregistration using a network-based enhanced spectral diversity (NESD) approach, in order to reduce the impact of temporal decorrelation on coregistration. Example time series of misregistration inferred for five tracks of Sentinel-1 TOPS acquisitions indicates a maximum relative azimuth misregistration of less than 0.01 of the full azimuth resolution between the TOPS acquisitions in the studied areas. Standard deviation of the estimated misregistration time series for different stacks varies from 1.1e-3 to 2e-3 of the azimuth resolution, equivalent to 1.6-2.8 cm orbital uncertainty in the azimuth direction. These values fall within the 1-sigma orbital uncertainty of the Sentinel-1 orbits and imply that orbital uncertainty is most likely the main source of the constant azimuth misregistration between different TOPS acquisitions. We propagate the uncertainty of individual misregistration estimated with ESD to the misregistration time series estimated with NESD and investigate the different challenges for operationalizing NESD.

Pulse Compression Waveform and Filter Optimization for Spaceborne Cloud and Precipitation Radar	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Meteorological radar; optimization; pulse compression methods; radar remote sensing; radar clutter; radar cross-sections; spaceborne radar	SURFACE CLUTTER; CROSS-SECTIONS; SEA-SURFACE; BAND; DESIGN	The optimal design of pulse compression waveform/filter pairs for use with near-nadir spaceborne radar in low earth orbit for the observation of clouds and precipitation is discussed. An optimization technique is introduced that considers performance metrics specific to the remote sensing of clouds and precipitation from such platforms. Specifically, the sensitivity of the radar to precipitation and clouds is maximized as close to the ground as required. The sensitivity of the radar near the surface is typically limited by the pulse compression range sidelobes from the surface's echo. Optimization of the waveform/filter pair's performance is facilitated by a time-domain radar scattering model to simulate radar reflectivity range profiles. The presented radar-scattering model accounts for the radar's configuration constraints and platform motion, as well as the spatial distribution and relative motion of the scatterers. In this paper, the optimization of both linear frequency modulation (LFM) and nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) waveforms is considered. It is demonstrated that the LFM waveforms provide superior performance over NLFM waveforms for application subject to unmitigated Doppler shifts.

A major challenge for the future will be to ensure the short-term and long-term provision of accessible and safe freshwater to meet the needs of the rapidly growing human population and changes in land cover and land use, where conservation and protection play a key role. Through a Bayesian spatial statistical method, a time-dependent approach for groundwater vulnerability assessment is developed to account for both the recent status of groundwater contamination and its evolution, as required by the European Union (Groundwater Directive, 2006/118/EC). This approach combines natural and anthropogenic factors to identify areas with a critical combination of high levels and increasing trends of nitrate concentrations, together with a quantitative evaluation of how different future scenarios would impact the quality of groundwater resources in a given area. In particular, the proposed approach can determine potential impacts on groundwater resources if policies are maintained at the status quo or if new measures are implemented for safeguarding groundwater quality, as natural factors are changing under climatic or anthropogenic stresses.

Inside Port Foster, the water column is divided into two layers separated by a temperature-forced, seasonal pycnocline at similar to 40-60m. The circulation of the upper layer is in an anticlockwise direction, with mean geostrophic currents of similar to 0.04-0.10ms(-1). The lower layer, from similar to 60 m to the seabed, shows coastal-trapped waves travelling in a clockwise direction, possibly triggered by local wind gusts. Local sea ice melt in areas surrounding the underwater hot springs of Pendulum Cove appears as a fresh, warm anomaly down to 30m.

A CATALOG OF COMPANIONS TO KEPLER STARS FROM HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; catalogs; planets and satellites: detection; surveys; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: photometric	CANDIDATE HOST STARS; LASER ADAPTIVE OPTICS; FALSE-POSITIVE RATE; CIRCLE-PLUS PLANET; SOLAR-TYPE STARS; SUN-LIKE STAR; BINARY STARS; STELLAR MULTIPLICITY; HABITABLE ZONE; TRANSIT CANDIDATES	We present results from high-resolution, optical to near-IR imaging of host stars of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), identified in the original Kepler field. Part of the data were obtained under the Kepler imaging follow-up observation program over six years (2009-2015). Almost 90% of stars that are hosts to planet candidates or confirmed planets were observed. We combine measurements of companions to KOI host stars from different bands to create a comprehensive catalog of projected separations, position angles, and magnitude differences for all detected companion stars (some of which may not be bound). Our compilation includes 2297 companions around 1903 primary stars. From high-resolution imaging, we find that similar to 10% (similar to 30%) of the observed stars have at least one companion detected within 1 ''(4 ''). The true fraction of systems with close (less than or similar to 4 '') companions is larger than the observed one due to the limited sensitivities of the imaging data. We derive correction factors for planet radii caused by the dilution of the transit depth: assuming that planets orbit the primary stars or the brightest companion stars, the average correction factors are 1.06 and 3.09, respectively. The true effect of transit dilution lies in between these two cases and varies with each system. Applying these factors to planet radii decreases the number of KOI planets with radii smaller than 2 R-circle plus by similar to 2%-23% and thus affects planet occurrence rates. This effect will also be important for the yield of small planets from future transit missions such as TESS.	[Furlan, E.; Ciardi, D.

UKIRT MICROLENSING SURVEYS AS A PATHFINDER FOR WFIRST: THE DETECTION OF FIVE HIGHLY EXTINGUISHED LOW-|b| EVENTS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxy: bulge; gravitational lensing: micro	GALACTIC BULGE; OPTICAL DEPTH; POPULATION; SEXTRACTOR; BINARY; SYSTEM; FIELD	Optical microlensing surveys are restricted from detecting events near the Galactic plane and center, where the event rate is thought to be the highest due to the high optical extinction of these fields. In the near-infrared (NIR), however, the lower extinction leads to a corresponding increase in event detections and is a primary driver for the wavelength coverage of the WFIRST microlensing survey. During the 2015 and 2016 bulge observing seasons, we conducted NIR microlensing surveys with UKIRT in conjunction with and in support of the Spitzer and Kepler microlensing campaigns. Here, we report on five highly extinguished (A(H) = 0.81-1.97), low-Galactic latitude (-0.98 <= b <= -0.36) microlensing events discovered from our 2016 survey. Four of them were monitored with an hourly cadence by optical surveys but were not reported as discoveries, likely due to the high extinction. Our UKIRT surveys and suggested future NIR surveys enable the first measurement of the microlensing event rate in the NIR. This wavelength regime overlaps with the bandpass of the filter in which the WFIRST microlensing survey will conduct its highest-cadence observations, making this event rate derivation critically important for optimizing its yield.

Theoretical models predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency and temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WASP-43b spectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve observations of WASP-43b (P = 0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5. mu m. The first 3.6. mu m visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking unphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other visits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST data. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would need to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal emission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly retrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high altitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating (less than or similar to 1 day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting measured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current Spitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission measurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O abundance (2.5 x 10(-5)-1.1 x 10(-4) at 1 sigma confidence) and, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we derive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar (0.4-1.7). Using the retrieved global CO+CO2 abundance under the same assumptions, we estimate a comparable metallicity of 0.3-1.7x solar. This is the first time that precise abundance and metallicity constraints have been determined from multiple molecular tracers for a transiting exoplanet.

DIFFERENT ORIGINS OR DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONS? DECODING THE SPECTRAL DIVERSITY AMONG C-TYPE ASTEROIDS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						meteorites, meteors, meteoroids; methods: data analysis; methods: laboratory:solid state; methods: observational; minor planets, asteroids: general; techniques: spectroscopic	INTERPLANETARY DUST PARTICLES; SPITZER-SPACE-TELESCOPE; 3 MU-M; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; MAIN-BELT; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; THERMAL METAMORPHISM; JUPITER TROJANS; DARK MATERIAL; OLIVINE	Anhydrous pyroxene-rich interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) have been proposed as surface analogs for about two-thirds of all C-complex asteroids. However, this suggestion appears to be. inconsistent with the presence of hydrated silicates on the surfaces of some of these asteroids, including Ceres. Here, we report the presence of enstatite (pyroxene) on the surface of two C-type asteroids (Ceres and Eugenia) based on their spectral properties in the mid-infrared range. The presence of this component is particularly unexpected in the case of Ceres, because. most thermal evolution models predict a surface consisting of hydrated compounds only. The most plausible scenario is that Ceres' surface has been partially contaminated by exogenous enstatite-rich material, possibly coming from the Beagle asteroid family. This scenario questions a similar origin for Ceres and the remaining C-types, and it possibly supports recent results obtained by the Dawn mission (NASA) that Ceres may have formed in the very outer solar system. Concerning the smaller D similar to 200 km C-types such as Eugenia, both their derived surface composition (enstatite and amorphous silicates) and low density (< 1.5 g cm (3)) suggest that these bodies accreted from the same building blocks, namely chondritic porous, pyroxene-rich IDPs and volatiles (mostly water ice), and that a significant volume fraction of these bodies has remained unaffected by hydrothermal activity likely implying a late accretion. In addition, their current heliocentric distance may best explain the presence or absence of water ice at their surfaces. Finally, we raise the possibility that CI chondrites, Tagish-Lake-like material, or hydrated IDPs may be representative samples of the cores of these bodies.

Spectrophotometric properties of dwarf planet Ceres from the VIR spectrometer on board the Dawn mission	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: Ceres; techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic; techniques: imaging spectroscopy; planets and satellites: surfaces; methods: data analysis	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; DISK-RESOLVED PHOTOMETRY; ASTEROID 21 LUTETIA; SATURNS MAIN RINGS; GALILEO PHOTOMETRY; RADIAL PROFILES; PHASE CURVES; LIGHT-CURVE; VESTA; NUCLEUS	Aims. We present a study of the spectrophotometric properties of dwarf planet Ceres in the visual-to-infrared (VIS-IR) spectral range by means of hyper-spectral images acquired by the VIR imaging spectrometer on board the NASA Dawn mission. Methods. Disk-resolved observations with a phase angle within the 7 degrees < alpha < 132 degrees interval were used to characterize Ceres' phase curve in the 0.465-4.05 mu m spectral range. Hapke's model was applied to perform the photometric correction of the dataset to standard observation geometry at VIS-IR wavelength, allowing us to produce albedo and color maps of the surface. The V-band magnitude phase function of Ceres has been computed from disk-resolved images and fitted with both the classical linear model and H-G formalism. Results. The single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter at 0.55 mu m are w = 0.14 +/- 0.02 and xi = 0.11 +/- 0.08, respectively (two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function); at the same wavelength, Ceres' geometric albedo as derived from our modeling is 0.094 +/- 0.007; the roughness parameter is (theta) over bar = 29 degrees +/- 6 degrees. Albedo maps indicate small variability on a global scale with an average reflectance at standard geometry of 0.034 +/- 0.003. Nonetheless, isolated areas such as the Occator bright spots, Haulani, and Oxo show an albedo much higher than average. We measure a significant spectral phase reddening, and the average spectral slope of Ceres' surface after photometric correction is 1.1% k angstrom(-1) and 0.85% k angstrom(-1) at VIS and IR wavelengths, respectively. Broadband color indices are V-R = 0.38 +/- 0.01 and R I = 0.33 +/- 0.02. Color maps show that the brightest features typically exhibit smaller slopes. The H-G modeling of the V-band magnitude phase curve for alpha < 30 degrees gives H = 3.14 +/- 0.04 and G = 0.10 +/- 0.04, while the classical linear model provides V(1; 1; 0 degrees) = 3.48 +/- 0.03 and beta = 0.036 +/- 0.002. The comparison of our results with spectrophotometric properties of other minor bodies indicates that Ceres has a less back-scattering phase function and a slightly higher albedo than comets and C-type objects. However, the latter represents the closest match in the usual asteroid taxonomy.	[Ciarniello, M.; De Sanctis, M. C.; Raponi, A.; Longobardo, A.; Palomba, E.; Carrozzo, F.

HR8799 is orbited by at least four giant planets, making it a prime target for the recently commissioned Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (VLT/SPHERE). As such, it was observed on five consecutive nights during the SPHERE science verification in December 2014. Aims. We aim to take full advantage of the SPHERE capabilities to derive accurate astrometric measurements based on H-band images acquired with the Infra-Red Dual-band Imaging and Spectroscopy (IRDIS) subsystem, and to explore the ultimate astrometric performance of SPHERE in this observing mode. We also aim to present a detailed analysis of the orbital parameters for the four planets. Methods. We performed thorough post-processing of the IRDIS images with the Vortex Imaging Processing (VIP) package to derive a robust astrometric measurement for the four planets. This includes the identification and careful evaluation of the different contributions to the error budget, including systematic errors. Combining our astrometric measurements with the ones previously published in the literature, we constrain the orbital parameters of the four planets using PyAstrOFit, our new open-source python package dedicated to orbital fitting using Bayesian inference with Monte-Carlo Markov Chain sampling. Results. We report the astrometric positions for epoch 2014.93 with an accuracy down to 2.0 mas, mainly limited by the astrometric calibration of IRDIS. For each planet, we derive the posterior probability density functions for the six Keplerian elements and identify sets of highly probable orbits. For planet d, there is clear evidence for nonzero eccentricity (e similar to 0.35), without completely excluding solutions with smaller eccentricities. The three other planets are consistent with circular orbits, although their probability distributions spread beyond e = 0.2, and show a peak at e similar or equal to 0.1 for planet e. The four planets have consistent inclinations of approximately 30 degrees with respect to the sky plane, but the confidence intervals for the longitude of the ascending node are disjointed for planets b and c, and we find tentative evidence for non-coplanarity between planets b and c at the 2 sigma level.

Generating synthetic fjord bathymetry for coastal Greenland	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							ICE-SHEET MODEL; OVERDEEPENINGS BENEATH; WEST GREENLAND; DATA SET; GLACIER; TOPOGRAPHY; SHELF; MORPHOLOGY; THICKNESS; INTERPOLATION	Bed topography is a critical boundary for the numerical modelling of ice sheets and ice-ocean interactions. A persistent issue with existing topography products for the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet and surrounding sea floor is the poor representation of coastal bathymetry, especially in regions of floating ice and near the grounding line. Sparse data coverage, and the resultant coarse resolution at the ice-ocean boundary, poses issues in our ability to model ice flow advance and retreat from the present position. In addition, as fjord bathymetry is known to exert strong control on ocean circulation and ice-ocean forcing, the lack of bed data leads to an inability to model these processes adequately. Since the release of the last complete Greenland bed topography-bathymetry product, new observational bathymetry data have become available. These data can be used to constrain bathymetry, but many fjords remain completely unsampled and therefore poorly resolved. Here, as part of the development of the next generation of Greenland bed topography products, we present a new method for constraining the bathymetry of fjord systems in regions where data coverage is sparse. For these cases, we generate synthetic fjord geometries using a method conditioned by surveys of terrestrial glacial valleys as well as existing sinuous feature interpolation schemes. Our approach enables the capture of the general bathymetry profile of a fjord in north-west Greenland close to Cape York, when compared to observational data. We validate our synthetic approach by demonstrating reduced overestimation of depths compared to past attempts to constrain fjord bathymetry. We also present an analysis of the spectral characteristics of fjord centrelines using recently acquired bathymetric observations, demonstrating how a stochastic model of fjord bathymetry could be parameterised and used to create different realisations.

Since significant magma-related displacements are expected, short-term deformation provides important constraints on the crustal mechanisms involved both in active rifting and in transfer of extensional deformation between spreading axes. Using InSAR and GPS data, we analyse the surface deformation in the whole Central Afar region in detail, focusing on both the extensional deformation across the Quaternary magmato-tectonic rift segments, and on the zones of deformation transfer between active segments and spreading axes. The largest deformation occurs across the two recently activated Asal-Ghoubbet (AG) and Manda Hararo-Dabbahu (MH-D) magmato-tectonic segments with very high strain rates, whereas the other Quaternary active segments do not concentrate any large strain, suggesting that these rifts are either sealed during interdyking periods or not mature enough to remain a plate boundary. Outside of these segments, the GPS horizontal velocity field shows a regular gradient following a clockwise rotation of the displacements from the Southeast to the East of Afar, with respect to Nubia. Very few shallow creeping structures can be identified as well in the InSAR data. However, using these data together with the strain rate tensor and the rotations rates deduced from GPS baselines, the present-day strain field over Central Afar is consistent with the main tectonic structures, and therefore with the long-term deformation. We investigate the current kinematics of the triple junction included in our GPS data set by building simple block models. The deformation in Central Afar can be described by adding a central microblock evolving separately from the three surrounding plates. In this model, the northern block boundary corresponds to a deep EW-trending trans-tensional dislocation, locked from the surface to 10-13 km and joining at depth the active spreading axes of the Red Sea and the Aden Ridge, from AG to MH-D rift segments. Over the long-term, this plate configuration could explain the presence of the en-echelon magmatic basins and subrifts. However, the transient behaviour of the spreading axes implies that the deformation in Central Afar evolves depending on the availability of magma supply within the well-established segments.

Bistatic radar observations of the Moon using Mini-RF on LRO and the Arecibo Observatory	ICARUS			English	Article						Moon; Radar observations; Ices; Regoliths; Impact processes	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; COHERENT-BACKSCATTER; WATER ICE; REGOLITH PROPERTIES; LUNAR PROSPECTOR; POLAR CRATERS; DEPOSITS; POLARIZATION; IMAGES; EJECTA	The Miniature Radio Frequency (Mini-RF) instrument aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a hybrid dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that operated in concert with the Arecibo Observatory to collect bistatic radar data of the lunar nearside from 2012 to 2015. The purpose of this bistatic campaign was to characterize the radar scattering properties of the surface and near-surface, as a function of bistatic angle, for a variety of lunar terrains and search for a coherent bacicscatter opposition effect indicative of the presence of water ice. A variety of lunar terrain types were sampled over a range of incidence and bistatic angles; including mare, highland, pyroclastic, crater ejecta, and crater floor materials. Responses consistent with an opposition effect were observed for the ejecta of several Copernican-aged craters and the floor of the south-polar crater Cabeus. The responses of ejecta material varied by crater in a manner that suggests a relationship with crater age. The response for Cabeus was observed within the portion of its floor that is not in permanent shadow. The character of the response differs from that of crater ejecta and appears unique with respect to all other lunar terrains observed. Analysis of data for this region suggests that the unique nature of the response may indicate the presence of near-surface deposits of water ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Space weathering effects in Diviner Lunar Radiometer multispectral infrared measurements of the lunar Christiansen Feature: Characteristics and mitigation	ICARUS			English	Article						Moon; Solar wind; Infrared observations; Moon, surface	MAGNETIC-ANOMALIES; IRON CONCENTRATION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; EMISSION-SPECTRA; SURFACE; MOON; SOILS; ORIGIN; SELENE; CRATER	Multispectral infrared measurements by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment on the Lunar Renaissance Orbiter enable the characterization of the position of the Christiansen Feature, a thermal infrared spectral feature that laboratory work has shown is proportional to the bulk silica content of lunar surface materials. Diviner measurements show that the position of this feature is also influenced by the changes in optical and physical properties of the lunar surface with exposure to space, the process known as space weathering. Large rayed craters and lunar swirls show corresponding Christiansen Feature anomalies. The space weathering effect is likely due to differences in thermal gradients in the optical surface imposed by the space weathering control of albedo. However, inspected at high resolution, locations with extreme compositions and Christiansen Feature wavelength positions - silica-rich and olivine-rich areas do not have extreme albedos, and fall off the albedo- Christiansen Feature wavelength position trend occupied by most of the Moon. These areas demonstrate that the Christiansen Feature wavelength position contains compositional information and is not solely dictated by albedo. An optical maturity parameter derived from near-IR measurements is used to partly correct Diviner data for space weathering influences. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Application of Triple Collocation in Ground-Based Validation of Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) Level 2 Data Products	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Remote sensing; soil moisture; Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP); triple collocation (TC)	ERROR CHARACTERIZATION; RETRIEVAL; SCATTEROMETER; STABILITY; MISSION; ASCAT	The validation of the soil moisture retrievals from the recently launched National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) satellite is important prior to their full public release. Uncertainty in attempts to characterize footprint-scale surface-layer soil moisture using point-scale ground observations has generally limited past validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products to densely instrumented sites covering an area approximating the satellite ground footprint. However, by leveraging independent soil moisture information obtained from land surface modeling and/or alternative remote sensing products, triple collocation (TC) techniques offer a strategy for characterizing upscaling errors in sparser ground measurements and removing the impact of such error on the evaluation of remotely sensed soil moisture products. Here, we propose and validate a TC-based strategy designed to utilize existing sparse soil moisture networks (typically with a single sampling point per satellite footprint) to obtain an unbiased correlation validation metric for satellite surface soil moisture retrieval products. Application of this TC strategy at five SMAP core validation sites suggests that unbiased estimates of correlation between the satellite product and the true footprint average can be obtained-even in cases where ground observations provide only one single reference point within the footprint. An example of preliminary validation results from the application of this TC strategy to the SMAP Level 2 Soil Moisture Passive (beta release version) product is presented.

We present a methodology to estimate the biomass consumed and the carbon released by the California Rim fire by integrating postfire airborne LiDAR and multitemporal Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. First, a support vector regression (SVR) model was trained to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) from LiDAR-derived metrics over the unburned area. The selected model estimated AGB with an R-2 of 0.82 and RMSE of 59.98 Mg/ha. Second, LiDAR-based biomass estimates were extrapolated to the entire area before and after the fire, using Landsat OLI reflectance bands, Normalized Difference Infrared Index, and the elevation derived from LiDAR data. The extrapolation was performed using SVR models that resulted in R-2 of 0.73 and 0.79 and RMSE of 87.18 (Mg/ha) and 75.43 (Mg/ha) for the postfire and prefire images, respectively. After removing bias from the AGB extrapolations using a linear relationship between estimated and observed values, we estimated the biomass consumption from postfire LiDAR and prefire Landsat maps to be 6.58 +/- 0.03 Tg (10(12) g), which translate into 12.06 +/- 0.06 Tg CO2(e) released to the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions of 2.57 million cars.

The question of how to effectively deploy new or remove current rain gauges in order to create optimal rainfall information is becoming more and more important. On the other hand, larger-scaled, remotely sensed rainfall measurements, although poorer quality compared with traditional rain gauge rainfall measurements, provide an insight into the local storm characteristics, which are sought by traditional methods for designing a rain gauge network. Based on these facts, this study proposes a new methodology for rain gauge network design using remotely sensed rainfall datasets that aims to explore how many gauges are essential and where they should be placed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the redundancy of the radar grid network and to determine the number of rain gauges while the potential locations are determined by cluster analysis (CA) selection. The proposed methodology has been performed on 373 different storm events measured by a weather radar grid network and compared against an existing dense rain gauge network in southwestern England. Because of the simple structure, the proposed scheme could be easily implemented in other study areas. This study provides a new insight into rain gauge network design that is also a preliminary attempt to use remotely sensed data to solve the traditional rain gauge problems.

The SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey: 850 mu m maps, catalogues and number counts	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; surveys; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; cosmology: observations	DEEP FIELD-SOUTH; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXY POPULATION; DEGREE EXTRAGALACTIC SURVEY; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; SURVEY ALMA RESOLVES; MOLECULAR GAS; BOLOMETER CAMERA; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTION; INFRARED PROPERTIES; SUPER-MAP	We present a catalogue of similar to 3000 submillimetre sources detected (>= 3.5 sigma) at 850 mu m over similar to 5 deg(2) surveyed as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS). This is the largest survey of its kind at 850 mu m, increasing the sample size of 850 mu m selected submillimetre galaxies by an order of magnitude. The wide 850 mu m survey component of S2CLS covers the extragalactic fields: UKIDSS-UDS, COSMOS, Akari-NEP, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North, SSA22 and GOODS-North. The average 1s depth of S2CLS is 1.2 mJy beam(-1), approaching the SCUBA-2 850 mu m confusion limit, which we determine to be sigma(c) approximate to 0.8 mJy beam(-1). We measure the 850 mu m number counts, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to approximately 4 per cent at S-850 approximate to 3 mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate field-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5 degrees-1 degrees scales are generally within 50 per cent of the S2CLS mean for S-850 > 3 mJy, with scatter consistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties, although there is a marginal (2 sigma) density enhancement in GOODS-North. The observed counts are in reasonable agreement with recent phenomenological and semi-analytic models, although determining the shape of the faint-end slope (S-850 < 3 mJy) remains a key test. The large solid angle of S2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S-850 > 10 mJy there are approximately 10 sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive up-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of 850 mu m emission,	[Geach, J.

DES Collaboration	Cosmology from large-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; 100 SQUARE DEGREES; PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; WEAK; CFHTLENS; PRECISION; MODEL; DEPENDENCE; EFFICIENT; I.	We present cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) using a combined analysis of angular clustering of red galaxies and their cross-correlation with weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies. We use a 139 deg(2) contiguous patch of DES data from the Science Verification (SV) period of observations. Using large-scale measurements, we constrain the matter density of the Universe as Omega(m) = 0.31 +/- 0.09 and the clustering amplitude of the matter power spectrum as sigma(8) = 0.74 +/- 0.13 after marginalizing over seven nuisance parameters and three additional cosmological parameters. This translates into S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.16) = 0.74 +/- 0.12 for our fiducial lens redshift bin at 0.35 < z < 0.5, while S-8 = 0.78 +/- 0.09 using two bins over the range 0.2 < z < 0.5. We study the robustness of the results under changes in the data vectors, modelling and systematics treatment, including photometric redshift and shear calibration uncertainties, and find consistency in the derived cosmological parameters. We show that our results are consistent with previous cosmological analyses from DES and other data sets and conclude with a joint analysis of DES angular clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background data, baryon accoustic oscillations and Supernova Type Ia measurements.

It also plays a key role in the climate system, and the development and persistence of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. However, sparse and uneven observations have made it difficult to quantify the global distribution and dynamics of surface soil moisture. Here we introduce a metric of soil moisture memory and use a full year of global observations from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission to show that surface soil moisture-a storage believed to make up less than 0.001% of the global freshwater budget by volume, and equivalent to an, on average, 8-mm thin layer of water covering all land surfaces-plays a significant role in the water cycle. Specifically, we find that surface soil moisture retains a median 14% of precipitation falling on land after three days. Furthermore, the retained fraction of the surface soil moisture storage after three days is highest over arid regions, and in regions where drainage to groundwater storage is lowest. We conclude that lower groundwater storage in these regions is due not only to lower precipitation, but also to the complex partitioning of the water cycle by the surface soil moisture storage layer at the land surface.

Visibility Estimation for the CHARA/JouFLU Exozodi Survey	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; techniques: high angular resolution; (stars:) circumstellar matter	INFRARED INTERFEROMETRIC SURVEY; OPTICAL INTERFEROMETER; BEAM COMBINER; CHARA ARRAY; STELLAR INTERFEROMETER; CIRCUMSTELLAR MATERIAL; STARS; CHARA/FLUOR; VLTI; VEGA	We discuss the estimation of the interferometric visibility (fringe contrast) for the Exozodi survey conducted at the CHARA array with the JouFLU beam combiner. We investigate the use of the statistical median to estimate the uncalibrated visibility from an ensemble of fringe exposures. Under a broad range of operating conditions, numerical simulations indicate that this estimator has a smaller bias compared with other estimators. We also propose an improved method for calibrating visibilities, which not only takes into account the time interval between observations of calibrators and science targets, but also the uncertainties of the calibrators' raw visibilities. We test our methods with data corresponding to stars that do not display the exozodi phenomenon. The results of our tests show that the proposed method yields smaller biases and errors. The relative reduction in bias and error is generally modest, but can be as high as similar to 20%-40% for the brightest stars of the CHARA data and statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (CL).

The Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) is a coordinated activity to compare reanalysis data sets using a variety of key diagnostics. The objectives of this project are to identify differences among reanalyses and understand their underlying causes, to provide guidance on appropriate usage of various reanalysis products in scientific studies, particularly those of relevance to SPARC, and to contribute to future improvements in the reanalysis products by establishing collaborative links between reanalysis centres and data users. The project focuses predominantly on differences among reanalyses, although studies that include operational analyses and studies comparing reanalyses with observations are also included when appropriate. The emphasis is on diagnostics of the upper troposphere, stratosphere, and lower mesosphere. This paper summarizes the motivation and goals of the S-RIP activity and extensively reviews key technical aspects of the reanalysis data sets that are the focus of this activity. The special issue "The SPARC Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP)" in this journal serves to collect research with relevance to the S-RIP in preparation for the publication of the planned two (interim and full) S-RIP reports.

The inspiral evolution is described using third-order post-Newtonian equations both for the equations of motion of the binary, and its far-zone radiation field. This latter component also includes instantaneous, tails and tails-of-tails contributions, and a contribution due to nonlinear memory. This framework reduces to the post-Newtonian approximant TaylorT4 at third post-Newtonian order in the zero-eccentricity limit. To improve phase accuracy, we also incorporate higher-order post-Newtonian corrections for the energy flux of quasicircular binaries and gravitational self-force corrections to the binding energy of compact binaries. This enhanced prescription for the inspiral evolution is combined with a fully analytical prescription for the merger-ringdown evolution constructed using a catalog of numerical relativity simulations. We show that this inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model reproduces the effective-one-body model of Ref. [Y. Pan et al., Phys. Rev. D 89, 061501 (2014).] for quasicircular black hole binaries with mass ratios between 1 to 15 in the zero-eccentricity limit over a wide range of the parameter space under consideration. Using a set of eccentric numerical relativity simulations, not used during calibration, we show that our new eccentric model reproduces the true features of eccentric compact binary coalescence throughout merger. We use this model to show that the gravitational-wave transients GW150914 and GW151226 can be effectively recovered with template banks of quasicircular, spin-aligned waveforms if the eccentricity e(0) of these systems when they enter the aLIGO band at a gravitational-wave frequency of 14 Hz satisfies e(0)(GW150914) <= 0.15 and e(0)(GW151226) <= 0.1. We also find that varying the spin combinations of the quasicircular, spin-aligned template waveforms does not improve the recovery of nonspinning, eccentric signals when e(0) >= 0.1. This suggests that these two signal manifolds are predominantly orthogonal.	[Huerta, E.

Molecular hydrogen production from amorphous solid water during low energy electron irradiation	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LOW-MASS PROTOSTAR; INTERSTELLAR HEAVY-WATER; SOLAR-TYPE PROTOSTARS; DEUTERIUM FRACTIONATION; STIMULATED DESORPTION; INNER REGIONS; DEUTERATED MOLECULES; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; IRAS 16293-2422	This work investigates the production of molecular hydrogen isotopologues (H-2, HD, and D-2) during low energy electron irradiation of layered and isotopically labelled thin films of amorphous solid water (ASW) in ultrahigh vacuum. Experimentally, the production of these molecules with both irradiation time and incident electron energy in the range 400 to 500 eV is reported as a function of the depth of a buried D2O layer in an H2O film. H-2 is produced consistently in all measurements, reflecting the H2O component of the film, though it does exhibit a modest reduction in intensity at the time corresponding to product escape from the buried D2O layer. In contrast, HD and D-2 production exhibit peaks at times corresponding to product escape from the buried D2O layer in the composite film. These features broaden the deeper the HD or D-2 is formed due to diffusion. A simple random-walk model is presented that can qualitatively explain the appearance profile of these peaks as a function of the incident electron penetration.	[Gadallah, Kamel A.

Transient reducing greenhouse warming on early Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; valley networks; astrobiology; methane; hydrogen; paleoclimate	COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; TITANS ATMOSPHERE; METHANE; CO2; CLIMATE; WATER; CARBON; TEMPERATURES; PREDICTIONS; EVOLUTION	The evidence for abundant liquid water on early Mars despite the faint young Sun is a long-standing problem in planetary research. Here we present new ab initio spectroscopic and line-by-line climate calculations of the warming potential of reduced atmospheres on early Mars. We show that the strength of both CO2-H-2 and CO2-CH4 collision-induced absorption (CIA) has previously been significantly underestimated. Contrary to previous expectations, methane could have acted as a powerful greenhouse gas on early Mars due to CO2-CH4 CIA in the critical 250-500cm(-1) spectral window region. In atmospheres of 0.5bar CO2 or more, percent levels of H-2 or CH4 raise annual mean surface temperatures by tens of degrees, with temperatures reaching 273K for pressures of 1.25-2bars and 2-10% of H-2 and CH4. Methane and hydrogen produced following aqueous alteration of Mars' crust could have combined with volcanically outgassed CO2 to form transient atmospheres of this composition 4.5-3.5Ga. Our results also suggest that inhabited exoplanets could retain surface liquid water at significant distances from their host stars.

We develop a method to enhance InSAR performances for such difficult terrain conditions and construct an 8year timeline of the surface deformation over a 60,000 km(2) area. The ground movement induced by the active layer's response to climate forcing is limited to Cenozoic sedimentary basins and is spatially variable in both its seasonal amplitude (2.5-12mm) and multiannual trend (-2 to 3mm/yr). A degree-day integrated model adjusted to the data indicates that subsidence occurs when the surface temperature exceeds zero (May to October) over areas where seasonal movements are large (>8mm). The period of subsidence is delayed by 1-2months over areas where smaller seasonal movements are observed, suggesting an unsaturated soil where water occurs in the deeper part of the active layer.

As only sparse and irregular measurements of ocean heat below 2000m depth exist, one of the most challenging questions in global climate change studies is whether the excess heat has already penetrated into the deep ocean. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of satellite and in situ measurements to report that a significant deep-ocean warming occurred in the subtropical South Pacific Ocean over the past decade (2005-2014). The local accumulation of heat accounted for up to a quarter of the global ocean heat increase, with directly and indirectly inferred deep ocean (below 2000m) contribution of 2.41.4 and 6.1-10.14.4%, respectively. We further demonstrate that this heat accumulation is consistent with a decade-long intensification of the subtropical convergence, possibly linked to the persistent La Nina-like state.

J	Herold, N; Behrangi, A; Alexander, LV				Herold, Nicholas; Behrangi, Ali; Alexander, Lisa V.			Large uncertainties in observed daily precipitation extremes over land	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE; SATELLITE; INDEXES; RAIN; TEMPERATURE; RESOLUTION; MODEL	We explore uncertainties in observed daily precipitation extremes over the terrestrial tropics and subtropics (50 degrees S-50 degrees N) based on five commonly used products: the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre-Full Data Daily (GPCC-FDD) dataset, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multi-satellite research product (T3B42 v7), the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project's One-Degree Daily (GPCP-1DD) dataset. We use the precipitation indices R10mm and Rx1day, developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices, to explore the behavior of "moderate" and "extreme" extremes, respectively. In order to assess the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to different grid sizes we perform our calculations on four common spatial resolutions (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees, 1 degrees x1 degrees, 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees, and 3.75 degrees x 2.5 degrees). The impact of the chosen "order of operation" in calculating these indices is also determined. Our results show that moderate extremes are relatively insensitive to product and resolution choice, while extreme extremes can be very sensitive. For example, at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees quasi-global mean Rx1day values vary from 37 mm in PERSIANN-CDR to 62 mm in T3B42. We find that the interproduct spread becomes prominent at resolutions of 1 degrees x 1 degrees and finer, thus establishing a minimum effective resolution at which observational products agree. Without improvements in interproduct spread, these exceedingly large observational uncertainties at high spatial resolution may limit the usefulness of model evaluations. As has been found previously, resolution sensitivity can be largely eliminated by applying an order of operation where indices are calculated prior to regridding. However, this approach is not appropriate when true area averages are desired (e.g., for model evaluations).

On the response of MODIS cloud coverage to global mean surface air temperature	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							RADIATIVE KERNELS; OPTICAL-THICKNESS; PART II; TRENDS; FEEDBACK; TERRA; INSTRUMENT; SATELLITE; IMPACT; ISCCP	The global surface temperature change (Delta T-s) mediated cloud cover response is directly related to cloud-climate feedback. Using satellite remote sensing data to relate cloud and climate requires a well-calibrated, stable, and consistent long-term cloud data record. The Collection 5.1 (C5) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud observations have been widely used for this purpose. However, the MODIS data quality varies greatly with the surface type, spectral region, cloud type, and time periods of study, which calls for additional caution when applying such data to studies on cloud cover temporal trends and variability. Using 15 years of cloud observations made by Terra and Aqua MODIS, we analyze the Delta T-s-mediated cloud cover response for different cloud types by linearly regressing the monthly anomaly of cloud cover (Delta C) with the monthly anomaly of global T-s. The Collection 6 (C6) Aqua data exhibit a similar cloud response to the long-term counterpart simulated by advanced climate models. A robust increase in altitude with increasing Delta T-s is found for high clouds, while a robust decrease of Delta C is noticed for optically thick low clouds. The large differences between C5 and C6 results are from improvements in calibration and cloud retrieval algorithms. The large positive cloud cover responses with data after 2010 and the strong sensitivity to time period obtained from the Terra (C5 and C6) data are likely due to calibration drift that has not been corrected, suggesting that the previous estimate of the short-term cloud cover response from the these data should be revisited.

Comparing simulated PSC optical properties with CALIPSO observations during the 2010 Antarctic winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							POLAR STRATOSPHERIC CLOUDS; NITRIC-ACID TRIHYDRATE; COMMUNITY CLIMATE MODEL; ARCTIC STRATOSPHERE; OZONE DEPLETION; HETEROGENEOUS FORMATION; LIDAR OBSERVATIONS; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; NUCLEATION; DENITRIFICATION	We simulate polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) during the Antarctic winter of 2010 using the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model/Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (SD-WACCM/CARMA) model. The current PSC model contains microphysical schemes for supercooled ternary solutions (STS) and nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, as well as a prognostic treatment for PSC ice particles and dehydration. Our simulations and CALIPSO satellite data suggest two major NAT particle formation mechanisms. The first mechanism is the nucleation of NAT from STS. Our model, with homogeneous nucleation rates of NAT from STS constrained by observations from the Arctic winter of 2010-2011, reproduces optical properties observed by CALIPSO over Antarctica in May and the timing of denitrification observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder within their uncertainties. On the other hand, the CALIPSO data indicate that our simulations are missing clouds containing small NAT particles with large number densities. We suggest these particles are most likely to form from ice clouds or STS in gravity waves, as found by previous investigations. The simulated cloud coverage agrees with the CALIPSO cloud coverage within a few percent on average with a correlation coefficient of 0.83. However, using the CALIPSO classification algorithm, simulated ice clouds often fall into Mix categories under the denitrified and dehydrated conditions. The model needs an improved ice microphysical representation, not only to allow ice particles to be a source of NAT but also to provide information on ice cloud particle number and size so that ice cloud optical properties can be more precisely calculated for comparison with CALIPSO data.

Chemical concentrations of various species and emission sources of several precursors are simultaneously optimized. This is expected to improve the emission inversion because the emission estimates are influenced by biases in the modelled tropospheric chemistry, which can be partly corrected by also optimizing the concentrations. We present detailed distributions of the estimated emission distributions for all major regions, the diurnal and seasonal variability, and the evolution of these emissions over the 10-year period. The estimated regional total emissions show a strong positive trend over India (+29 % decade(-1)), China (+26 % decade(-1)), and the Middle East (+20 % decade(-1)), and a negative trend over the USA (-38 % decade(-1)), southern Africa (-8.2 % decade(-1)), and western Europe (-8.8 % decade(-1)). The negative trends in the USA and western Europe are larger during 2005-2010 relative to 2011-2014, whereas the trend in China becomes negative after 2011. The data assimilation also suggests a large uncertainty in anthropogenic and fire-related emission factors and an important underestimation of soil NOx sources in the emission inventories. Despite the large trends observed for individual regions, the global total emission is almost constant between 2005 (47.9 Tg N yr(-1)) and 2014 (47.5 Tg N yr(-1)).

J	Jiang, XN				Jiang, Xianan			Key processes for the eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation based on multimodel simulations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							STATIC ENERGY BUDGET; VERTICAL STRUCTURE; PHYSICAL PROCESSES; MOISTURE MODES; MJO; CLIMATE; WEATHER; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; TROPICS	As a prominent climate variability mode with widespread influences on global weather extremes, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) remains poorly represented in the latest generation of general circulation models (GCMs), with a particular challenge in simulating its eastward propagating convective signals. In this study, by analyzing multimodel simulations from a recent global MJO model evaluation project, an effort is made to identify key processes for the eastward propagation of the MJO through analyses of moisture entropy (ME) processes under a "moisture mode" framework for the MJO. The column-integrated horizontal ME advection is found to play a critical role for the eastward propagation of the MJO in both observations and good MJO models, with a primary contribution through advection of the lower tropospheric seasonal mean ME by the MJO anomalous circulations. By contrast, the horizontal ME advection effect for the eastward propagation is greatly underestimated in poor MJO GCMs, due to model deficiencies in simulating both the seasonal mean ME pattern and MJO circulations, leading to a largely stationary MJO mode in these GCMs. These results thus pinpoint an important guidance toward improved representation of the MJO in climate and weather forecast models. While this study mainly focuses on fundamental physics for the MJO propagation over the Indian Ocean, complex influences by the Maritime Continent on the MJO and also ME processes associated with the MJO over the western Pacific warrant further investigations.

Direct atmosphere opacity observations from CALIPSO provide new constraints on cloud-radiation interactions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; CLIMATE; BIASES; PHASE	The spaceborne lidar CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) directly measures atmospheric opacity. In 8 years of CALIPSO observations, we find that 69% of vertical profiles penetrate through the complete atmosphere. The remaining 31% do not reach the surface, due to opaque clouds. The global mean altitude of full attenuation of the lidar beam (z_opaque) is 3.2 km, but there are large regional variations in this altitude. Of relevance to cloud-climate studies, the annual zonal mean longwave cloud radiative effect and annual zonal mean z_opaque weighted by opaque cloud cover are highly correlated (0.94). The annual zonal mean shortwave cloud radiative effect and annual zonal mean opaque cloud cover are also correlated (-0.95). The new diagnostics introduced here are implemented within a simulator framework to enable scale-aware and definition-aware evaluation of the LMDZ5B global climate model. The evaluation shows that the model overestimates opaque cloud cover (31% obs. versus 38% model) and z_opaque (3.2 km obs. versus 5.1 km model). In contrast, the model underestimates thin cloud cover (35% obs. versus 14% model). Further assessment shows that reasonable agreement between modeled and observed longwave cloud radiative effects results from compensating errors between insufficient warming by thin clouds and excessive warming due to overestimating both z_opaque and opaque cloud cover. This work shows the power of spaceborne lidar observations to directly constrain cloud-radiation interactions in both observations and models.

Despite its relatively small area, the coastal plain could be a significant dust source; however, its effect is not well quantified as it is not well approximated in global or even regional models. In addition, because of close proximity to the Red Sea, a significant amount of dust from the coastal areas could be deposited into the Red Sea and serve as a vital component of the nutrient balance of marine ecosystems. In the current study, we apply the offline Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) to better quantify dust emission from the coastal plain during the period of 2009-2011. We verify the spatial and temporal variability in model results using independent weather station reports. We also compare the results with the MERRA Aerosol Reanalysis (MERRAero). We show that the best results are obtained with 1 km model spatial resolution and dust source function based on Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) measurements. We present the dust emission spatial pattern, as well as estimates of seasonal and diurnal variability in dust event frequency and intensity, and discuss the emission regime in the major dust generation hot spot areas. We demonstrate the contrasting seasonal dust cycles in the northern and southern parts of the coastal plain and discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for dust generation. This study provides the first estimates of the fine-scale spatial and temporal distribution of dust emissions from the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain constrained by MERRAero and short-term WRF-Chem simulations. The estimate of total dust emission from the coastal plain, tuned to fit emissions in MERRAero, is 7.5 +/- 0.5 Mt a(-1). Small interannual variability indicates that the study area is a stable dust source. The mineralogical composition analysis shows that the coastal plain generates around 76 +/- 5 kt of iron oxides and 6 +/- 0.4 kt of phosphorus annually. Over 65% of dust is emitted from the northern part of the coastal plain.	[Anisimov, Anatolii; Tao, Weichun; Stenchikov, Georgiy; Kalenderski, Stoitchko; Prakash, P.

ALMA Observations of the Water Fountain Pre-planetary Nebula IRAS 16342-3814: High-velocity Bipolar Jets and an Expanding Torus	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: AGB and post-AGB; stars: mass-loss; stars: winds, outflows; techniques: interferometric	YOUNG PLANETARY-NEBULAE; EVOLVED STARS; DUST SHELL; AGB; PROTOPLANETARY; (CO)-C-12; EMISSION; CO	We have mapped (CO)-C-12 J = 3-2 and other molecular lines from the "water fountain" bipolar pre-planetary nebula (PPN) IRAS 16342-3814 with similar to 0 ''. 35 resolution using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We find (i) two very high-speed knotty, jet-like molecular outflows; (ii) a central high-density (> few x 10(6) cm(-3)), expanding torus of diameter 1300 au; and (iii) the circumstellar envelope of the progenitor AGB, generated by a sudden, very large increase in the mass-loss rate to > 3.5 x 10(-4) Me-circle dot yr(-1) in the past similar to 455 years. Strong continuum emission at 0.89 mm from a central source (690 mJy), if due to thermally emitting dust, implies a substantial mass (0.017M(circle dot)) of very large (similar to millimeter-sized) grains. The measured expansion ages of the above structural components imply that the torus (age similar to 160 years) and the younger high-velocity outflow (age similar to 110 years) were formed soon after the sharp increase in the AGB mass-loss rate. Assuming a binary model for the jets in IRAS 16342, the high momentum rate for the dominant jet-outflow in IRAS 16342 implies a high minimum accretion rate, ruling out standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind accretion and wind Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) models with white-dwarf or main-sequence companions.

HST PanCET Program: A Cloudy Atmosphere for the Promising JWST Target WASP-101b	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual (WASP-101b); techniques: spectroscopic	MASS DWARF STARS; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; HOT-JUPITER EXOPLANETS; TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM; GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; CHEMISTRY; SPECTROSCOPY; WATER; EMISSION	We present results from the first observations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury program for WASP-101b, a highly inflated hot Jupiter and one of the community targets proposed for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Science (ERS) program. From a single HST Wide Field Camera 3 observation, we find that the near-infrared transmission spectrum of WASP-101b contains no significant H2O absorption features and we rule out a clear atmosphere at 13 sigma. Therefore, WASP-101b is not an optimum target for a JWST ERS program aimed at observing strong molecular transmission features. We compare WASP-101b to the well-studied and nearly identical hot Jupiter WASP-31b. These twin planets show similar temperature-pressure profiles and atmospheric features in the near-infrared. We suggest exoplanets in the same parameter space as WASP-101b and WASP-31b will also exhibit cloudy transmission spectral features. For future HST exoplanet studies, our analysis also suggests that a lower count limit needs to be exceeded per pixel on the detector in order to avoid unwanted instrumental systematics.	[Wakeford, H.

EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT ENERGY INPUT IN THE LATE PHASE OF A SOLAR FLARE FROM NuSTAR X-RAY OBSERVATIONS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Sun: flares; Sun: particle emission; Sun: X-rays; gamma rays	ACTIVE CORONAL PHENOMENA; ULTRAVIOLET LATE-PHASE; YOHKOH SXT IMAGES; GIANT ARCHES; ATOMIC DATABASE; MASS EJECTION; EMISSION; REGIONS; RHESSI; RECONNECTION	We present observations of the occulted active region AR 12222 during the third Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) solar campaign on 2014 December 11, with concurrent Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA and FOXSI-2 sounding rocket observations. The active region produced a medium-size solar flare 1 day before the observations, at similar to 18 UT on 2014 December 10, with the post-flare loops still visible at the time of NuSTAR observations. The time evolution of the source emission in the SDO/AIA 335 angstrom channel reveals the characteristics of an extreme-ultraviolet late-phase event, caused by the continuous formation of new post-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectral fitting of NuSTAR observations yields an isothermal source, with temperature 3.8-4.6 MK, emission measure (0.3-1.8)x 10(46) cm(-3), and density estimated at (2.5-6.0) x 10(8) cm(-3). The observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived NuSTAR temperature range, favoring temperature values in the range of 4.0-4.3 MK. By examining the post-flare loops' cooling times and energy content, we estimate that at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooled between the onset of the flare and NuSTAR observations, with their total thermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content at flare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only the flare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can lead to a large underestimation of its value.

ON THE EARLY-TIME EXCESS EMISSION IN HYDROGEN-POOR SUPERLUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual (PTF 12dam, iPTF 13dcc)	LIGHT CURVES; LUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE; SHOCK-BREAKOUT; IC SUPERNOVAE; HOST GALAXY; ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS; MASS-LOSS; EXPLOSIONS; TRANSIENT; MAGNETAR	We present the light curves of the hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) PTF 12dam and iPTF 13dcc, discovered by the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory. Both show excess emission at early times and a slowly declining light curve at late times. The early bump in PTF 12dam is very similar in duration (similar to 10 days) and brightness relative to the main peak (2-3 mag fainter) compared to that observed in other SLSNe I. In contrast, the long-duration (>30 days) early excess emission in iPTF 13dcc, whose brightness competes with that of the main peak, appears to be of a different nature. We construct bolometric light curves for both targets, and fit a variety of light-curve models to both the early bump and main peak in an attempt to understand the nature of these explosions. Even though the slope of the late-time decline in the light curves of both SLSNe is suggestively close to that expected from the radioactive decay of Ni-56 and Co-56, the amount of nickel required to power the full light curves is too large considering the estimated ejecta mass. The magnetar model including an increasing escape fraction provides a reasonable description of the PTF 12dam observations. However, neither the basic nor the double-peaked magnetar model is capable of reproducing the light curve of iPTF 13dcc. A model combining a shock breakout in an extended envelope with late-time magnetar energy injection provides a reasonable fit to the iPTF 13dcc observations. Finally, we find that the light curves of both PTF 12dam and iPTF 13dcc can be adequately fit with the model involving interaction with the circumstellar medium.

NuSTAR OBSERVATIONS OF WISE J1036+0449, A GALAXY AT z similar to 1 OBSCURED BY HOT DUST	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						infrared: galaxies; galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; quasars: general; quasars: individual (WISE J1036+0449)	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; ULTRALUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES; X-RAY-EMISSION; SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; XMM-NEWTON; HOST GALAXIES; HIGH-REDSHIFT	Hot dust-obscured galaxies (hot DOGs), selected from Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer's all-sky infrared survey, host some of the most powerful active galactic nuclei known and may represent an important stage in the evolution of galaxies. Most known hot DOGs are located at z > 1.5, due in part to a strong bias against identifying them at lower redshift related to the selection criteria. We present a new selection method that identifies 153 hot DOG candidates at z similar to 1, where they are significantly brighter and easier to study. We validate this approach by measuring a redshift z = 1.009 and finding a spectral energy distribution similar to that of higher-redshift hot DOGs for one of these objects, WISE J1036+ 0449 (L-Bol similar or equal to 8 x 10(46) erg s(-1)). We find evidence of a broadened component in Mg II, which would imply a black hole mass of M-BH similar or equal to 2 x 10(8) M-circle dot and an Eddington ratio of lambda(Edd) similar or equal to 2.7. WISE J1036+ 0449 is the first hot DOG detected by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and observations show that the source is heavily obscured, with a column density of N-II similar or equal to (2-15) x 10(23)cm(-2). The source has an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of similar to 6 x 10(44)erg s(-1), a value significantly lower than that expected from the mid-infrared/X-ray correlation. We also find that other hot DOGs observed by X-ray facilities show a similar deficiency of X-ray flux. We discuss the origin of the X-ray weakness and the absorption properties of hot DOGs. Hot DOGs at z <= 1 could be excellent laboratories to probe the characteristics of the accretion flow and of the X-ray emitting plasma at extreme values of the Eddington ratio.

SPACE TELESCOPE AND OPTICAL REVERBERATION MAPPING PROJECT. VI. REVERBERATING DISK MODELS FOR NGC 5548	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (NGC 5548); galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; QUASAR ACCRETION DISKS; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLE; BROAD-LINE REGION; X-RAY; CONTINUUM EMISSION; EMITTING REGIONS; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; VARIABILITY; SIZE	We conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk. The 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 angstrom to 9157 angstrom) combine simultaneous Hubble Space Telescope, Swift, and ground-based observations over a 180 day period from 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as the reverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a central time-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination i = 36 degrees +/- 10 degrees, temperature T-1= (44 +/- 6) x 10(3) K at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radius slope (T proportional to r(-alpha)) of alpha = 0.99 +/- 0.03. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlates poorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that the X-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over the observing period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, and mean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for a standard blackbody accretion disk accreting at L/L-Edd = 0.1.

One challenge in nulling interferometry is to achieve a deep achromatic null with a simple optical system. One such system is a "fiber nuller," a nulling interferometer in which light from two incoming beams is combined at the tip of a single-mode optical fiber. This Letter describes the use of a diffraction grating to adjust the phase of the light so that achromatic destructive interference is achieved at the fiber tip. A deep (4 x 10(-5)) achromatic null was achieved in the astronomical K-band, thus showing a performance with the potential for observing brown dwarfs and bright (young or hot) extrasolar giant planets.

Enhanced Resolution of Chiral Amino Acids with Capillary Electrophoresis for Biosignature Detection in Extraterrestrial Samples	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; MARS ORGANIC ANALYZER; IN-SITU ANALYSIS; BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN; ZONE ELECTROPHORESIS; MONO LAKE; SEPARATION; EXPLORATION; SELECTORS; SURFACE	Amino acids are fundamental building blocks of terrestrial life as well as ubiquitous byproducts of abiotic reactions. In order to distinguish between amino acids formed by abiotic versus biotic processes it is possible to use chemical distributions to identify patterns unique to life. This article describes two capillary electrophoresis methods capable of resolving 17 amino acids found in high abundance in both biotic and abiotic samples (seven enantiomer pairs d/l-Ala, -Asp, -Glu, -His, -Leu, -Ser, -Val and the three achiral amino acids Gly, beta-Ala, and GABA). To resolve the 13 neutral amino acids one method utilizes a background electrolyte containing gamma-cyclodextrin and sodium taurocholate micelles. The acidic amino acid enantiomers were resolved with gamma-cyclodextrin alone. These methods allow detection limits down to 5 nM for the neutral amino acids and 500 nM for acidic amino acids and were used to analyze samples collected from Mono Lake with minimal sample preparation.

Geomorphologic mapping of titan's polar terrains: Constraining surface processes and landscape evolution	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Geological processes; Titan hydrology; Titan surface	CASSINI RADAR; FLUVIAL EROSION; SALINITY CRISIS; SEAS; TOPOGRAPHY; LAKES; SHORELINES; EVAPORITES; MORPHOLOGY; FEATURES	We present a geomorphologic map of Titan's polar terrains. The map was generated from a combination of Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Imaging Science Subsystem imaging products, as well as altimetry, SARTopo and radargrammetry topographic datasets. In combining imagery with topographic data, our geomorphologic map reveals a stratigraphic sequence from which we infer process interactions between units. In mapping both polar regions with the same geomorphologic units, we conclude that processes that formed the terrains of the north polar region also acted to form the landscape we observe at the south. Uniform, SAR-dark plains are interpreted as sedimentary deposits, and are bounded by moderately dissected uplands. These plains contain the highest density of filled and empty lake depressions, and canyons. These units unconformably overlay a basement rock that outcrops as mountains and SARbright dissected terrains at various elevations across both poles. All these units are then superposed by surficial units that slope towards the seas, suggestive of subsequent overland transport of sediment. From estimates of the depths of the embedded empty depressions and canyons that drain into the seas, the SAR-dark plains must be >600 m thick in places, though the thickness may vary across the poles. At the lowest elevations of each polar region, there are large seas, which are currently liquid methane/ethane filled at the north and empty at the south. The large plains deposits and the surrounding hillslopes may represent remnant landforms that are a result of previously vast polar oceans, where larger liquid bodies may have allowed for a sustained accumulation of soluble and insoluble sediments, potentially forming layered sedimentary deposits. Coupled with vertical crustal movements, the resulting layers would be of varying solubilities and erosional resistances, allowing formation of the complex landscape that we observe today.

Ejecta cloud from the AIDA space project kinetic impact on the secondary of a binary asteroid: I. mechanical environment and dynamical model	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids dynamics; Accretion; Collisional physics; Interplanetary dust; Cratering	MOMENTUM-TRANSFER; PARTICLES; EVOLUTION; REGOLITH; DENSITY; ORIGIN	An understanding of the post-impact dynamics of ejecta clouds are crucial to the planning of a kinetic impact mission to an asteroid, and also has great implications for the history of planetary formation. The purpose of this article is to track the evolution of ejecta produced by AIDA mission, which targets for kinetic impact the secondary of near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos on 2022, and to feedback essential informations to AIDA's ongoing phase-A study. We present a detailed dynamic model for the simulation of an ejecta cloud from a binary asteroid that synthesizes all relevant forces based on a previous analysis of the mechanical environment. We apply our method to gain insight into the expected response of Didymos to the AIDA impact, including the subsequent evolution of debris and dust. The crater scaling relations from laboratory experiments are employed to approximate the distributions of ejecta mass and launching speed. The size distribution of fragments is modeled with a power law fitted from observations of real asteroid surface. A full-scale demonstration is simulated using parameters specified by the mission. We report the results of the simulation, which include the computed spread of the ejecta cloud and the recorded history of ejecta accretion and escape. The violent period of the ejecta evolution is found to be short, and is followed by a stage where the remaining ejecta is gradually cleared. Solar radiation pressure proves to be efficient in cleaning dust-size ejecta, and the simulation results after two weeks shows that large debris on polar orbits (perpendicular to the binary orbital plane) has a survival advantage over smaller ejecta and ejecta that keeps to low latitudes.

We compute the stability of iron nanoparticles to sublimation in the interstellar radiation field, finding that iron clusters can persist down to a radius of similar or equal to 4.5 angstrom, and perhaps smaller. We employ laboratory data on small iron clusters to compute the photoelectric yields as a function of grain size and the resulting grain charge distribution in various interstellar environments, finding that iron nanoparticles can acquire negative charges, particularly in regions with high gas temperatures and ionization fractions. If greater than or similar to 10% of the interstellar iron is in the form of ultrasmall iron clusters, the photoelectric heating rate from dust may be increased by up to tens of percent relative to dust models with only carbonaceous and silicate grains.

We numerically explore one of the chondrule forming processes-planetesimal collisions. Previous studies have found that impact jetting via protoplanet-planetesimal collisions can make chondrules with 1% of the impactors' mass, when the impact velocity exceeds 2.5 km s(-1). Based on the mineralogical data of chondrules, undifferentiated planetesimals would be more suitable for chondrule-forming collisions than potentially differentiated protoplanets. We examine planetesimal-planetesimal collisions using a shock physics code and find two things: one is that planetesimal-planetesimal collisions produce nearly the same amount of chondrules as protoplanet-planetesimal collisions (similar to 1%). The other is that the amount of produced chondrules becomes larger as the impact velocity increases when two planetesimals collide with each other. We also find that progenitors of chondrules can originate from deeper regions of large targets (planetesimals or protoplanets) than small impactors (planetesimals). The composition of targets is therefore important, to fully account for the mineralogical data of currently sampled chondrules.

FERMI-LAT Collaboration; DES Collaboration	SEARCHING FOR DARK MATTER ANNIHILATION IN RECENTLY DISCOVERED MILKY WAY SATELLITES WITH FERMI-LAT	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark matter; galaxies: dwarf; gamma rays: galaxies	LARGE-AREA TELESCOPE; DWARF SPHEROIDAL GALAXIES; GAMMA-RAY EMISSION; ALL-SKY SURVEY; GLOBULAR-CLUSTER; TRIANGULUM II; RETICULUM 2; HYDRA II; FAINT; KINEMATICS	We search for excess gamma-ray emission coincident with the positions of confirmed and candidate Milky Way satellite galaxies using six years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our sample of 45 stellar systems includes 28 kinematically confirmed dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and 17 recently discovered systems that have photometric characteristics consistent with the population of known dSphs. For each of these targets, the relative predicted gamma-ray flux due to dark matter annihilation is taken from kinematic analysis if available, and estimated from a distance-based scaling relation otherwise, assuming that the stellar systems are DM-dominated dSphs. LAT data coincident with four of the newly discovered targets show a slight preference (each similar to 2 sigma local) for gamma-ray emission in excess of the background. However, the ensemble of derived gamma-ray flux upper limits for individual targets is consistent with the expectation from analyzing random blank-sky regions, and a combined analysis of the population of stellar systems yields no globally significant excess (global significance < 1 sigma). Our analysis has increased sensitivity compared to the analysis of 15 confirmed dSphs by Ackermann et al. The observed constraints on the DM annihilation cross section are statistically consistent with the background expectation, improving by a factor of similar to 2 for large DM masses (m(DM, b<(b)over bar>) greater than or similar to 1 TeV and m(DM, tau+tau-) greater than or similar to 70 GeV) and weakening by a factor of similar to 1.5 at lower masses relative to previously observed limits.

SPITZER OBSERVATIONS CONFIRM AND RESCUE THE HABITABLE-ZONE SUPER-EARTH K2-18b FOR FUTURE CHARACTERIZATION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrobiology; planets and satellites: detection; planets and satellites: individual (K2-18b); techniques: photometric	M-DWARFS; PLANET POPULATION; COOL; K2; PHOTOMETRY; TEMPERATURE; DISTINGUISH; CANDIDATES; ATMOSPHERE; EMISSION	The recent detections of two transit events attributed to the super-Earth candidate K2-18b have provided the unprecedented prospect of spectroscopically studying a habitable-zone planet outside the solar system. Orbiting a nearby M2.5 dwarf and receiving virtually the same stellar insolation as Earth, K2-18b would be a prime candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization of a habitable-zone exoplanet using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Here, we report the detection of a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the two transit events discovered by K2, confirming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by a super-Earth in a 33 day orbit, ruling out the alternative scenario of two similarly sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75 day Kepler Space Telescope (K2) observation. We also find, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer occurred 1.85 hr (7 sigma) before the predicted transit time. Our joint analysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of the transit is not caused by transit timing variations, but the result of an inaccurate ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in the K2 photometry. We refit the ephemeris and find that K2-18b would have been lost for future atmospheric characterizations with HST and JWST if we had not secured its ephemeris shortly after the discovery. We caution that immediate follow-up observations as presented here will also be critical for confirming and securing future planets discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), in particular if only two transit events are covered by the relatively short 27-day TESS campaigns.

The light curve showed two distinct peaks with absolute magnitudes M-r <= -12.4 and M-r similar or equal to -12, on 2014 November 11 and 2015 February 17, respectively. The spectral energy distributions during the second maximum show a cool outburst temperature of approximate to 3700 K and low expansion velocities (approximate to -300 km s(-1)) for the H I, Ca II, Ba II, and K I lines. From archival data spanning 15-8 years before the outburst, we find a single source consistent with the optically discovered transient, which we attribute to being the progenitor; it has properties consistent with being an F-type yellow supergiant with L similar to 8.7 x 10(4) L-circle dot, T-eff approximate to 7000. K, and an estimated mass of M1= 18 +/- 1 M-circle dot. This star has likely just finished the H-burning phase in the core, started expanding, and is now crossing the Hertzsprung gap. Based on the combination of observed properties, we argue that the progenitor is a binary system, with the more evolved system overfilling the Roche lobe. Comparison with binary evolution models suggests that the outburst was an extremely rare phenomenon, likely associated with the ejection of the common envelope of a massive star. The initial mass of the primary fills the gap between the merger candidates V838 Mon (5-10 M-circle dot) and NGC. 4490-OT. (30M(circle dot)).	[Blagorodnova, N.; Kasliwal, M.

SCExAO AND GPI Y JH BAND PHOTOMETRY AND INTEGRAL FIELD SPECTROSCOPY OF THE YOUNG BROWN DWARF COMPANION TO HD 1160	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; planetary systems; stars: low-mass; techniques: imaging spectroscopy	LOW-MASS STARS; PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; FINDING CAMPAIGN DISCOVERY; DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANET; UPPER SCORPIUS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; MESA ISOCHRONES; GIANT PLANETS; BINARY; SYSTEM	We present high signal-to-noise ratio, precise Y JH photometry and Y band (0.957-1.120 mu m) spectroscopy of HD 1160 B, a young substellar companion discovered from the Gemini NICI Planet Finding Campaign using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument and the Gemini Planet Imager. HD 1160 B has typical mid-M dwarf-like infrared colors and a spectral type of M5.5(-0.5)(+1.0), where the blue edge of our Y band spectrum rules out earlier spectral types. Atmospheric modeling suggests HD 1160 B has an effective temperature of 3000-3100 K, a surface gravity of log g - 4-4.5, a radius of. 1.55 +/- 0.10 R-J, and a luminosity of log L/L circle dot - 2.76 +/- 0.05. Neither the primary's Hertzspring-Russell diagram position nor atmospheric modeling of HD 1160 B show evidence for a subsolar metallicity. Interpretation of the HD 1160 B spectroscopy depends on which stellar system components are used to estimate the age. Considering HD 1160 A, B and C jointly, we derive an age of 80-125 Myr, implying that HD 1160 B straddles the hydrogen-burning limit (70-90 M-J) If we consider HD 1160 A alone, younger ages (20-125 Myr) and a brown dwarf-like mass (35-90 M-J) are possible. Interferometric measurements of the primary, a precise Gaia parallax, and moderate-resolution spectroscopy can better constrain the system's age and how HD 1160 B fits within the context of (sub) stellar evolution.

The outer disk is revealed in reprocessed archival Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS-F110W images, as well as new coronagraphic H-band images from the Very Large Telescope SPHERE instrument. The disk extends from 1 1 (65 au) to 4.'' 6 (250 au) and is seen at an inclination of 73 degrees, which refines previous measurements at lower angular resolution. We also report no companion detection larger than 3 M-Jup at projected separations beyond 20 au from the star (0.'' 34). Comparison between the F110W and H-band images is consistent with a gray color of 49 Ceti's dust, indicating grains larger than greater than or similar to 2 mu m. Our photometric measurements indicate a scattering efficiency/infrared excess ratio of 0.2-0.4, relatively low compared to other characterized debris disks. We find that 49 Ceti presents morphological and scattering properties very similar to the gas-rich HD 131835 system. From our constraint on the disk inclination we find that the atomic gas previously detected in absorption must extend to the inner disk, and that the latter must be depleted of CO gas. Building on previous studies, we propose a schematic view of the system describing the dust and gas structure around 49 Ceti and hypothetical scenarios for the gas nature and origin.

The Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102 as Seen on Milliarcsecond Angular Scales	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; radio continuum: galaxies; techniques: high angular resolution	ACCRETING BLACK-HOLES; FUNDAMENTAL PLANE; SUPERLUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE; SUPERGIANT PULSES; NEUTRON-STARS; HOST-GALAXY; TRANSIENTS; STARBURST; REMNANT; IMPACT	The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond localization (similar to 100 mas precision) of FRB. 121102 using the Very Large Array has led to its unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent emission. Here, we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations using the European VLBI Network and the 305 m Arecibo telescope, which simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a projected linear separation of less than or similar to 40 pc (less than or similar to 12 mas angular separation, at 95% confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and persistent radio source (similar to 2-4 mas at 1.7 GHz), which are both similar to the expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a projected size constrained to be less than or similar to 0.7 pc (less than or similar to 0.2 mas angular extent at 5.0 GHz) and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of T-b greater than or similar to 5 x 10(7) K. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between FRB. 121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB. 121102 that best match the observed data.

The Host Galaxy and Redshift of the Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB 121102	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: distances and redshifts; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: ISM; stars: magnetars; stars: neutron	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SOUTHERN SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC STANDARDS; EMISSION-LINE GALAXIES; WARM IONIZED MEDIUM; GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; DWARF GALAXIES; DATA RELEASE; REIONIZATION HISTORY; STARBURST GALAXIES	The precise localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB 121102) has provided the first unambiguous association ( chance coincidence probability p less than or similar to 3 x 10(-4)) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio counterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart and find that it is an extended (0".6- 0".8) object displaying prominent Balmer and [O III] emission lines. Based on the spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a low-metallicity, star-forming, m(r') = 25.1 AB mag dwarf galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.19273(8), corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc. From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host galaxy to have a diameter less than or similar to 4 kpc and a stellar mass of M-* similar to (4-7) x 10(7)M(circle dot), assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to 3M(circle dot)L(circle dot)(-1). Based on the Ha flux, we estimate the star formation rate of the host to be 0.4M(circle dot)yr(-1) and a substantial host dispersion measure (DM) depth less than or similar to 324 pc cm(-3). The net DM contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102' s location reported by Marcote et al. is offset from the galaxy's center of light by similar to 200 mas and the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB 121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.

This work evaluates the impact of using advanced numerical solvers for transient ice-flow simulations conducted with the JPL-UCI Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We identify optimal numerical solvers by testing a broad suite of readily available solvers, ranging from direct sparse solvers to preconditioned iterative methods, on the commonly used Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-Order ice sheet Models benchmark tests. Three types of analyses are considered: mass transport, horizontal stress balance, and incompressibility. The results of the fastest solvers for each analysis type are ranked based on their scalability across mesh size and basal boundary conditions. We find that the fastest iterative solvers are similar to 1.5-100 times faster than the default direct solver used in ISSM, with speed-ups improving rapidly with increased mesh resolution. We provide a set of recommendations for users in search of efficient solvers to use for transient ice-flow simulations, enabling higher-resolution meshes and faster turnaround time. The end result will be improved transient simulations for short-term, highly resolved forward projections (10-100 year time scale) and also improved long-term paleo-reconstructions using higher-order representations of stresses in the ice. This analysis will also enable a new generation of comprehensive uncertainty quantification assessments of forward sea-level rise projections, which rely heavily on ensemble or sampling approaches that are inherently expensive.

Here, by analysing shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements along 137 degrees E in the northwest Pacific of 2004-2016, we show that the observed upper ocean velocities are comprised of balanced geostrophic flows and unbalanced internal waves. The transition length scale, L-t, separating these two motions, is found to depend strongly on the energy level of local mesoscale eddy variability. In the eddy-abundant western boundary current region of Kuroshio, L-t can be shorter than 15 km, whereas L-t exceeds 200 km along the path of relatively stable North Equatorial Current. Judicious separation between the geostrophic and internal wave signals represents both a challenge and an opportunity for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission.

Extensive water ice within Ceres' aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy	SCIENCE			English	Article							METEORITE; ASTEROIDS; MODEL	The surface elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its regolith ice content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA's Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that surface materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres' carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between surface and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the regolith contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of water ice, confirming theoretical predictions that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the surface.

These measurements are calibrated and then combined into soundings that are analyzed to retrieve spatially resolved estimates of the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction, XCO2. Variations of XCO2 in space and time are then analyzed in the context of the atmospheric transport to quantify surface sources and sinks of CO2. This is a particularly challenging remote-sensing observation because all but the largest emission sources and natural absorbers produce only small (< 0.25 %) changes in the background XCO2 field. High measurement precision is therefore essential to resolve these small variations, and high accuracy is needed because small biases in the retrieved XCO2 distribution could be misinterpreted as evidence for CO2 fluxes. To meet its demanding measurement requirements, each OCO-2 spectrometer channel collects 24 spectra s(-1) across a narrow (< 10 km) swath as the observatory flies over the sunlit hemisphere, yielding almost 1 million soundings each day. On monthly timescales, between 7 and 12% of these soundings pass the cloud screens and other data quality filters to yield full-column estimates of XCO2. Each of these soundings has an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution (< 3 km(2)/sounding), spectral resolving power (lambda /Delta lambda > 17 000), dynamic range (similar to 10(4)), and sensitivity (continuum signal-to-noise ratio > 400). The OCO-2 instrument performance was extensively characterized and calibrated prior to launch. In general, the instrument has performed as expected during its first 18 months in orbit. However, ongoing calibration and science analysis activities have revealed a number of subtle radiometric and spectroscopic challenges that affect the yield and quality of the OCO-2 data products. These issues include increased numbers of bad pixels, transient artifacts introduced by cosmic rays, radiance discontinuities for spatially non-uniform scenes, a misunderstanding of the instrument polarization orientation, and time-dependent changes in the throughput of the oxygen A-band channel. Here, we describe the OCO-2 instrument, its data products, and its on-orbit performance. We then summarize calibration challenges encountered during its first 18 months in orbit and the methods used to mitigate their impact on the calibrated radiance spectra distributed to the science community.

A direct localization of a fast radio burst and its host	NATURE			English	Article							GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; PHOTOMETRIC SYSTEM; DISPERSION MEASURE; ALPHA SURVEY; MILKY-WAY; GALAXIES; PULSES; STARS; EMISSION; REDSHIFT	Fast radio bursts(1,2) are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities that are orders of magnitude larger than those of all known short-duration radio transients(3). So far all fast radio bursts have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on the contemporaneous variability of field sources(4) or the presence of peculiar field stars(5) or galaxies(4). These attempts have not resulted in an unambiguous association(6,7) with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here we report the subarcsecond localization of the fast radio burst FRB 121102, the only known repeating burst source(8-11), using high-time-resolution radio interferometric observations that directly image the bursts. Our precise localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 milliarcseconds of a faint 180-microJansky persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with non-thermal emission, and a faint (twenty-fifth magnitude) optical counterpart. The flux density of the persistent radio source varies by around ten per cent on day timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size of less than 1.7 milliarcseconds. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Localization and identification of a host or counterpart has been essential to understanding the origins and physics of other kinds of transient events, including gamma-ray bursts(12,13) and tidal disruption events(14). However, if other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct subarcsecond localizations may be the only way to provide reliable associations.

Enhanced association and dissociation of heteronuclear Feshbach molecules in a microgravity environment	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION; INTERACTING FERMI GAS; FEW-BODY SYSTEMS; ULTRACOLD MOLECULES; ATOM-INTERFEROMETER; COOLING ATOMS; SPACE; RESONANCES	We study the association and dissociation dynamics of weakly bound heteronuclear Feshbach molecules using transverse radio-frequency fields for expected parameters accessible through the microgravity environment of NASA's Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) aboard the International Space Station, including subnanokelvin temperatures and atomic densities as low as 108/cm(3). We show that under such conditions, thermal and loss effects can be greatly suppressed, resulting in a high efficiency of both association and dissociation of Feshbach molecules with a mean size exceeding 10(4)a(0) and allowing for the coherence in atom-molecule transitions to be clearly observable. Our theoretical model for heteronuclear mixtures includes thermal, loss, and density effects in a simple and conceptually clear manner. We derive the temperature, density, and scattering length regimes of K-41-Rb-87 that allow optimal association or dissociation efficiency with minimal heating and loss to guide upcoming experiments with ultracold atomic gases in space.

Observations of Low-Frequency Magnetic Waves due to Newborn Interstellar Pickup Ions Using ACE, Ulysses, and Voyager Data	16TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS CONFERENCE: TURBULENCE, STRUCTURES, AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION THROUGHOUT THE HELIOSPHERE AND BEYOND	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	16th Annual International Astrophysics Conference on Turbulence, Structures, and Particle Acceleration Throughout the Heliosphere and Beyond (AIAC)	MAR 06-10, 2017	Santa Fe, NM				LATITUDE SOLAR-WIND; TURBULENCE; FIELD; SPECTRUM; HYDROGEN; HELIUM; DISSIPATION; EXCITATION; EVOLUTION; PROTON	Wave excitation by newborn interstellar pickup ions (PUIs) plays a significant role in theories that attempt to describe IBEX and Voyager observations in the solar wind and heliosheath. The same dynamic processes can be far-reaching and extend into the inner heliosphere to at least 1AU and likely to smaller heliocentric distances. While the high-resolution magnetic field measurements required to study these waves are not yet available in the heliosheath, we have studied a range of available observations and found evidence of waves due to interstellar PUIs using ACE (1998-2015 at 1 AU), Ulysses (1996-2006 at 2 to 5 AU, high and low latitudes) and Voyager (1978-1979 and 2 to 6 AU) observations. Efforts to extend the Voyager observations to 35 AU are ongoing. We have examined these data sets and report on observations of low-frequency waves that result from newborn interstellar pickup H+ and He+ ions. Although not as common as theory originally predicted, we presently have identified 524 independent occurrences. Our conclusion from studying these waves is that they are seen only when the ambient turbulence is sufficiently weak. The instability that generates these waves requires a slow accumulation of wave energy over several to tens of hours to achieve observable wave amplitudes. In regions where the turbulence is moderate to strong, the turbulence absorbs the wave energy before it can reach observable levels nd transports the energy to the dissipation scales where it heats the background thermal particles. Only intervals with the weakest turbulence will perinit energy accumulation over this tiie scale. These conditions are most often, but not exclusively, achieved in solar wind rarefaction regions.

This paper presents the implementation of this optimization using Gauss Pseudospectral OPtimization Software (GPOPS-II) in combination with a Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer (SNOPT) as the nonlinear programing (NLP) solver. The solution obtained is an input to the propulsion, Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC), mechanical design, aerodynamic and thermal analysis teams, which use it to size systems, tune algorithms and update models. A sensitivity analysis of variables of interest, like dry mass and trajectory altitude is presented.

The blade dimensions investigated are thicknesses of 1, 1.5mm and 2mm, width of 120 to 184mm, surface contact speeds of 0 to 15m/s, and penetration depth of up to 140mm. Earth snow is used as a conceptual comet analogue. Comet surface analogues used for experimentation are variations of foam glass and a simulant developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An apparatus developed for this study inserts blades into simulants via spring potential energy and blade kinetic energy. During insertion, recordings at >60kHz are made for forces acting on the blade and for the blade position. Parameters varied to explore effects on penetration dynamics include penetrated material, blade material and dimensions, blade speed at surface contact, and spring potential energy at blade surface contact. The physics-based penetration model presented is shown to be useful for predicting the interaction between the blade shaped penetrators and comet-line materials. Behaviors predicted include penetration time, maximum penetration resistance, penetration velocity profile, and penetration resistance vs. depth profile. The model input variables are blade dimensions, comet microstructure strength, blade-comet friction (friction coefficient and cavity pressure), comet grain friction (as a damping coefficient), and system energy at contact. The penetration model has applications beyond studying penetration behavior. An optimization routine is shown to be useful for estimating comet/simulant mechanical properties from experiments. The prediction of penetration performance for a large design space enables identification of advantageous designs with less experiments than would otherwise be practical.

One of the limitations in damage area extraction is that the decorrelation caused by the disaster is commonly coupled with the natural changes. Also, the interpretation of the coherence is troublesome and requires the coherence model. The approach used in this study is based on the modified coherence model for a case of long-temporal and zero-spatial baseline. The inversion processes yield the temporal decorrelation contributions of ground and volume, respectively, having the physical meaning. We additionally applied simple statistical probability estimation method for the damage area to isolate the contributions of disaster from the natural changes. In this study, we used UAVSAR data acquired over Lake fire which occurred in June, 2015.

DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE SMAP ENHANCED PASSIVE SOIL MOISTURE PRODUCT	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS				Since the beginning of its routine science operation in March 2015, the NASA SMAP observatory has been returning interference-mitigated brightness temperature observations at L-band (1.41 GHz) frequency from space. The resulting data enable frequent global mapping of soil moisture with a retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3) at a 36 km spatial scale. This paper describes the development and validation of an enhanced version of the current standard soil moisture product. Compared with the standard product that is posted on a 36 km grid, the new enhanced product is posted on a 9 km grid. Derived from the same time-ordered brightness temperature observations that feed the current standard passive soil moisture product, the enhanced passive soil moisture product leverages on the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique that more fully utilizes the additional information from the original radiometer observations to achieve global mapping of soil moisture with enhanced clarity. The resulting enhanced soil moisture product was assessed using long-term in situ soil moisture observations from core validation sites located in diverse biomes and was found to exhibit an average retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3). As of December 2016, the enhanced soil moisture product has been made available to the public from the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

The SMAP radiometer began acquiring routine science data on March 31, 2015 and continues to operate nominally. SMAP's radiometer-derived standard soil moisture product (L2SMP) provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36-km fixed Earth grid using brightness temperature observations and ancillary data. A beta quality version of L2SMP was released to the public in October, 2015, Version 3 validated L2SMP soil moisture data were released in May, 2016, and Version 4 L2SMP data were released in December, 2016. Version 4 data are processed using the same soil moisture retrieval algorithms as previous versions, but now include retrieved soil moisture from both the 6 am descending orbits and the 6 pm ascending orbits. Validation of 19 months of the standard L2SMP product was done for both AM and PM retrievals using in situ measurements from global core cal/val sites. Accuracy of the soil moisture retrievals averaged over the core sites showed that SMAP accuracy requirements are being met.

The launch of the Sentinel-1 (S-1) constellation provides these capabilities and calls for the development and validation of pre-operational SSM products at high resolution. The objective of this paper is to present and initially assess a SSM retrieval algorithm developed in view of S-1 data exploitation. The activity is supported by a large scientific community engaged in fostering a more effective interaction between researchers working in the field of high and low resolution SSM retrieval.

AMSR2 fills the void left by the loss of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) after almost 10 years. Both missions provide brightness temperature observations that are used to retrieve soil moisture. Merging AMSR-E and AMSR2 will help build a consistent long-term dataset. Before tackling the integration of AMSR-E and AMSR2 it is necessary to conduct a thorough validation and assessment of the AMSR2 soil moisture products. This study focuses on validation of the AMSR2 soil moisture products by comparison with in situ reference data from a set of core validation sites. Three products that rely on different algorithms were evaluated; the JAXA Soil Moisture Algorithm (JAXA), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), and the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA).

It has been widely adopted as a primary preprocessing step for numerous applications. In this paper, we perform a literature survey of various pansharpening algorithms including the most advanced deep learning approaches for both multispectral and hyperspectral images. We further evaluate the effect of the resolution difference on anomaly detection. Synthetic multispectral and hyperspectral images are generated to evaluate the performance of anomaly detection on high resolution images. Eight state-of-the-art MSI and HSI pansharpening methods are compared in this paper. Experimental results show that, performing anomaly detection on high resolution images improves the detection rate, and at the mean time suppresses the false alarm rate.

EPIC 201702477b: A TRANSITING BROWN DWARF FROM K2 IN A 41DAY ORBIT	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic	RADIAL-VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS; EXTRASOLAR PLANET VALIDATION; JUPITER-MASS COMPANION; LHS 6343 C; SOPHIE VELOCIMETRY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; GIANT EXOPLANETS; ECLIPSING BINARY; KEPLER MISSION; CANDIDATES	We report the discovery of EPIC 201702477b, a transiting brown dwarf in a long period (40.73691 +/- 0.00037 day) and eccentric (e = 0.2281 +/- 0.0026) orbit. This system was initially reported as a planetary candidate based on two transit events seen in K2 Campaign 1 photometry and later validated as an exoplanet candidate. We confirm the transit and refine the ephemeris with two subsequent ground-based detections of the transit using the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope 1 m telescope network. We rule out any transit timing variations above the level of similar to 30 s. Using high precision radial velocity measurements from HARPS and SOPHIE we identify the transiting companion as a brown dwarf with a mass, radius, and bulk density of 66.9 +/- 1.7 M-J, 0.757 +/- 0.065 R-J, and 191 +/- 51 g cm(-3) respectively. EPIC 201702477b is the smallest radius brown dwarf yet discovered, with a mass just below the H-burning limit. It has the highest density of any planet, substellar mass object, or main-sequence star discovered so far. We find evidence in the set of known transiting brown dwarfs for two populations of objects-high mass brown dwarfs and low mass brown dwarfs. The higher-mass population have radii in very close agreement to theoretical models, and show a lower-mass limit around 60 M-J. This may be the signature of mass-dependent ejection of systems during the formation process.	[Bayliss, D.; Bouchy, F.; Diaz, R.

Here, we present a new image of the third inner disk component of HD 141569 A made in the L' band (3.8 mu m) during the commissioning of the vector vortex coronagraph that has recently been installed in the near-infrared imager and spectrograph NIRC2 behind the W.M. Keck Observatory Keck II adaptive optics system. We used reference point-spread function subtraction, which reveals the innermost disk component from the inner working distance of similar or equal to 23 au and up to similar or equal to 70 au. The spatial scale of our detection roughly corresponds to the optical and near-infrared scattered light, thermal Q, N, and 8.6 mu m PAH emission reported earlier. We also see an outward progression in dust location from the L' band to the H band (Very Large Telescope/SPHERE image) to the visible (Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS image), which is likely indicative of dust blowout. The warm disk component is nested deep inside the two outer belts imaged by HST-NICMOS in 1999 (at 406 and 245 au, respectively). We fit our new L'-band image and spectral energy distribution of HD 141569 A with the radiative transfer code MCFOST. Our best-fit models favor pure olivine grains and are consistent with the composition of the outer belts. While our image shows a putative very faint point-like clump or source embedded in the inner disk, we did not detect any true companion within the gap between the inner disk and the first outer ring, at a sensitivity of a few Jupiter masses.

With HIP 79124 B at a projected separation of 186.5 mas, both the small inner working angle of the vortex coronagraph and the related imaging improvements were crucial in imaging this close companion directly. Due to higher Strehl ratios and more relaxed contrasts in L' band versus H band, this new coronagraphic capability will enable high-contrast, small-angle observations of nearby young exoplanets and disks on a par with those of shorter-wavelength extreme adaptive optics coronagraphs.

This paper reports the observation of an arc-like structure to the north of GG Tau Ab, and part of a circumstellar structure that is noticeable around GG Tau Aa, extending to a distance of approximately 28 au from the primary star. The speckle noise around GG Tau Ab constrains its disk radius to < 13 au. Based on the size of the circumbinary ring and the circumstellar disk around GG Tau Aa, the semimajor axis of the binary's orbit is likely to be 62 au. A comparison of the present observations with previous Atacama Large Millimeter Array and near-infrared H-2 emission observations suggests that the north arc could be part of a large streamer flowing from the circumbinary ring to sustain the circumstellar disks. According to the previous studies, the circumstellar disk around GG Tau Aa has enough mass and can sustain itself for a duration sufficient for planet formation; thus, our study indicates that planets can form within close (separation. 100 au) young binary systems.

From a polarized intensity image, taken with the HiCIAO instrument of the Subaru Telescope, we deduce the position angle and the inclination angle of the disk. The disk is found to extend out to 68 +/- 12 AU in scattered light and no clear structure is observed. Our inner working angle of 24 AU does not allow us to detect a central decrease in intensity similar to that seen at 30 AU in the 880 mu m continuum observations. We compare the observations with multiple disk models based on the spectral energy distribution (SED) and submm interferometry and find that an inner rim of the outer disk at 30 AU containing small silicate grains produces a polarized intensity signal which is an order of magnitude larger than observed. We show that a model in which the small dust grains extend smoothly into the cavity found for large grains is closer to the actual H-band observations. A comparison of models with di ff erent dust size distributions suggests that the dust in the disk might have undergone significant processing compared to the interstellar medium.

THE NANOGRAV NINE-YEAR DATA SET: EXCESS NOISE IN MILLISECOND PULSAR ARRIVAL TIMES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational waves; pulsars: general	INTERSTELLAR SCINTILLATION; TIMING OBSERVATIONS; SPIN NOISE; PRECISION; DISPERSION; LIMITS; PROPAGATION	Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy using a pulsar timing array requires high-quality millisecond pulsars (MSPs), correctable interstellar propagation delays, and high-precision measurements of pulse times of arrival. Here we identify noise in timing residuals that exceeds that predicted for arrival time estimation for MSPs observed by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. We characterize the excess noise using variance and structure function analyses. We find that 26 out of 37 pulsars show inconsistencies with a white-noise-only model based on the short timescale analysis of each pulsar, and we demonstrate that the excess noise has a red power spectrum for 15 pulsars. We also decompose the excess noise into chromatic (radio-frequency-dependent) and achromatic components. Associating the achromatic red-noise component with spin noise and including additional power-spectrum-based estimates from the literature, we estimate a scaling law in terms of spin parameters (frequency and frequency derivative) and data-span length and compare it to the scaling law of Shannon & Cordes. We briefly discuss our results in terms of detection of GWs at nanohertz frequencies.	[Lam, M. T.; Jones, M. L.; McLaughlin, M.

XXII. SHELL FEATURE EARLY-TYPE DWARF GALAXIES IN THE VIRGO CLUSTER	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: formation; galaxies: interactions; galaxies: peculiar; galaxies: structure; globular clusters: individual (Virgo)	STAR-FORMATION; TIDAL INTERACTION; MERGING GALAXIES; MASS; LUMINOSITY; MERGERS; CORE; CATALOG; EVOLUTION; REMNANT	The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey is a deep (with a 2 sigma detection limit mu g = 29 mag arcsec(-2) in the g-band) optical panchromatic survey targeting the Virgo cluster from its core to virial radius, for a total areal coverage of 104 square degrees. As such, the survey is well suited for the study of galaxies' outskirts, haloes, and low surface brightness features that arise from dynamical interactions within the cluster environment. We report the discovery of extremely faint (mu g > 25 mag arcsec(-2)) shells in three Virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies: VCC. 1361, VCC. 1447, and VCC. 1668. Among them, VCC. 1447 has an absolute magnitude Mg = -11.71 mag and is the least massive galaxy with a shell system discovered to date. We present a detailed study of these low surface brightness features. We detect between three and four shells in each of our galaxies. Within the uncertainties, we find no evidence of a color difference between the galaxy main body and shell features. The observed arcs of the shells are located up to several effective radii of the galaxies. We further explore the origin of these low surface brightness features with the help of idealized numerical simulations. We find that a near equal mass merger is best able to reproduce the main properties of the shells, including their quite symmetric appearance and their alignment along the major axis of the galaxy. The simulations provide support for a formation scenario in which a recent merger, between two near-equal mass, gas-free dwarf galaxies, forms the observed shell systems.

The use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) as a reactant in these ALD processes has allowed for the demonstration of thin films of magnesium, aluminum, and lithium fluoride at deposition temperatures as low as 100 degrees C. These films are used for anti-reflection coatings, optical filters, and solar-rejection filters integrated directly onto Si sensors, and as protective coatings for reflective aluminum optics in the UV. The low deposition temperature enables deposition directly on Si sensors without impacting device performance, as well as the coating of polymeric diffraction gratings. The use of HF-based chemistry is shown to yield new atomic layer etching (ALE) procedures that can be used for the same device developments. Applications related to terrestrial and space astronomy, astrophysics missions, and particle physics experiments are discussed.	[Hennessy, J.; Jewell, A.

In-Space Chemical Propulsion System Roadmap	CHEMICAL ROCKET PROPULSION: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS	Springer Aerospace Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Workshop on Combustion and Propulsion - New Energetic Materials for Space Exploration	JUN 09-10, 2014	Politecnico Milano, Campus Bovisa, Milan, ITALY		Politecnico Milano, Campus Bovisa			In-space propulsion begins where the launch vehicle upper stage leaves off, performing the functions of primary propulsion, reaction control, station keeping, precision pointing, and orbital maneuvering. The main engines used in space provide the primary propulsive force for orbit transfer, planetary trajectories, and extraplanetary landing and ascent. The reaction control and orbitalmaneuvering systems provide the propulsive force for orbit maintenance, position control, station keeping, and spacecraft attitude control. Advanced in-space propulsion technologies will enable much more effective exploration of our solar system and will permit mission designers to plan missions to "fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations" with greater reliability and safety. With wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are "best" for future missions is a difficult one. A portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations. A large fraction of the rocket engines in use today are chemical rockets; that is, they obtain the energy needed to generate thrust by chemical reactions to create a hot gas that is expanded to produce thrust. A significant limitation of chemical propulsion is that it has a relatively low specific impulse (I-s or thrust per mass flow rate of propellant). A significant improvement (> 30 %) in I-s can be obtained by using cryogenic propellants, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, for example. Historically, these propellants have not been applied beyond upper stages.

H.; Manning, Evan			AIRS/CrIS data continuity for Climate Change Analysis	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXII	AUG 06-10, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE				AIRS and CrIS are in very similar 1: 30 PM ascending node orbits, with 12 km diameter footprints at nadir. Data from both instruments have have been available for the past 5 years. The level to which AIRS and CrIS observations agree for large area averages is a metric of how well data from different, but nominally equivalent, instruments can be concatenated to create the long time series necessary to reliably characterize climate change. We limit our analysis to 900 cm-1 atmospheric window channels. For random nadir sampled tropical zone data AIRS and CrIS agree within 100 mK, if the nine CrIS detector elements are averaged. Under tropical mean condition the CrIS elements disagree from each other by 0.5K. Under extreme condition the measurements of the nine CrIS elements are between 2K colder to 3 K warmer than AIRS. It is at present unclear why the nine CRIS detector elements disagree with each other by much more than their mean disagrees with the equivalent AIRS result. The observed effect may be decreased or at least more aggressive quality flagged in a future release of the CrIS calibrated radiances. If AIRS and CrIS were not in the same orbit at the same time, one might interpret the observed differences as evidence of a "climate change".	[Aumann, H.

The initial on-orbit calibration estimates of the two TIRS spectral bands indicated large average radiometric calibration errors, -0.29 and -0.51 W/m(2) sr mu m or -2.1K and -4.4K at 300K in Bands 10 and 11, respectively, as well as high variability in the errors, 0.87K and 1.67K (1-sigma), respectively. The average error was corrected in operational processing in January 2014, though, this adjustment did not improve the variability. The source of the variability was determined to be stray light from far outside the field of view of the telescope. An algorithm for modeling the stray light effect was developed and implemented in the Landsat-8 processing system in February 2017. The new process has improved the overall calibration of the two TIRS bands, reducing the residual variability in the calibration from 0.87K to 0.51K at 300K for Band 10 and from 1.67K to 0.84K at 300K for Band 11. There are residual average lifetime bias errors in each band: 0.04 W/m(2) sr mu m (0.30K) and -0.04 W/m(2) sr mu m (-0.29K), for Bands 10 and 11, respectively.

Operating in the 350-1700 nm spectral region with 5.7 nm sampling, SWIS is capable of simultaneously addressing the demanding needs of coastal ocean science and snow and ice monitoring. New key technologies that facilitate the development of this instrument include a linear variable anti-reflection (LVAR) detector coating for stray light management, and a single drive on-board calibration mechanism utilizing a transmissive diffuser for solar calibration. We provide an overview of the SWIS instrument design and potential science applications and describe the instrument assembly and alignment, supported by laboratory measurements.

Radiometric and spectral stray light correction for the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) coastal ocean sensor	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXII	AUG 06-10, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		imaging spectroscopy; Dyson spectrometer; coastal ocean; instrument calibration	CALIBRATION	The airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) instrument is based on a fast (F/1.8) Dyson spectrometer operating at 350-1050 nm and a two-mirror telescope combined with a Teledyne HyViSI 6604A detector array. Raw PRISM data contain electronic and optical artifacts that must be removed prior to radiometric calibration. We provide an overview of the process transforming raw digital numbers to calibrated radiance values. Electronic panel artifacts are first corrected using empirical relationships developed from laboratory data. The instrument spectral response functions (SRF) are reconstructed using a measurement-based optimization technique. Removal of SRF effects from the data improves retrieval of true spectra, particularly in the typically low-signal near-ultraviolet and near-infrared regions. As a final step, radiometric calibration is performed using corrected measurements of an object of known radiance. Implementation of the complete calibration procedure maximizes data quality in preparation for subsequent processing steps, such as atmospheric removal and spectral signature classification.

Hyperspectral sounder performance for cold scenes	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXII	AUG 06-10, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		AIRS; CrIS; hyperspectral; infrared sounder; Deep Convective Clouds; cold clouds		We investigate the use of 200K scenes as a valuable "stress test" for the evaluation of the calibration of AIRS and CrIS. Under these conditions both instruments show artifacts much larger than the nominal stated radiometric accuracy of about 0.1-0.2 K. Except for the AIRS shortwave trend, both instruments clearly perform well at the 1 K level even for these extremely low scene temperatures. Unfortunately, changes in extremes, in this case cold extremes, are of great interest to the evaluation of climate change effects, such as changes in the height of the tropopause or the frequency of severe storms. The evaluation of the AIRS performance at extremely low scene temperatures has been key to identifying the need for updating the polarization coefficients in the L1B software Version 7. These changes are expected to eliminate a large fraction of the observed AIRS artifacts. The CrIS instrument teams is also working on refining the calibration.

CIRAS was awarded under the ESTO In-flight Validation of Earth Science Technologies (InVEST) program in 2015 and is currently under development at NASA JPL with key subsystems being developed by industry. CIRAS incorporates key new instrument technologies including a 2D array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The second key technology is an MWIR Grating Spectrometer (MGS) designed to provide imaging spectroscopy for atmospheric sounding in a CubeSat volume. The MGS is under development by Ball Aerospace with the grating and slit developed by JPL. The third key technology is a blackbody fabricated with JPL's black silicon to have very high emissivity in a flat plate construction. JPL will also develop the mechanical, electronic and thermal subsystems for CIRAS, while the spacecraft will be a 6U CubeSat developed by Blue Canyon Technologies.

However, scale mismatches between SIF and ground-based GPP have posed challenges toward fully exploiting these data. We used SIF obtained at high spatial sampling rates and resolution by NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite to elucidate GPP-SIF relationships across space and time in the U.S. Corn Belt. Strong linear scaling functions (R(2)0.79) that were consistent across instantaneous to monthly time scales were obtained for corn ecosystems and for a heterogeneous landscape based on tall tower observations. Although the slope of the corn function was similar to 56% higher than for the landscape, SIF was similar for corn (C-4) and soybean (C-3). Taken together, there is strong observational evidence showing robust linear GPP-SIF scaling that is sensitive to plant physiology but insensitive to the spatial or temporal scale.

Chemistry of diagenetic features analyzed by ChemCam at Pahrump Hills, Gale crater, Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars surface; Geological processes; Mineralogy	INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; INSTRUMENT SUITE; ROVER; SULFATE; TARGETS; ROCKS; UNIT	The Curiosity rover's campaign at Pahrump Hills provides the first analyses of lower Mount Sharp strata. Here we report ChemCam elemental composition of a diverse assemblage of post-depositional features embedded in, or cross-cutting, the host rock. ChemCam results demonstrate their compositional diversity, especially compared to the surrounding host rock: (i) Dendritic aggregates and relief enhanced features, characterized by a magnesium enhancement and sulfur detection, and interpreted as Mg-sulfates; (ii) A localized observation that displays iron enrichment associated with sulfur, interpreted as Fe-sulfate; (iii) Dark raised ridges with varying Mg- and Ca-enriched compositions compared to host rock; (iv) Several dark-toned veins with calcium enhancement associated with fluorine detection, interpreted as fluorite veins. (v) Light-toned veins with enhanced calcium associated with sulfur detection, and interpreted as Ca-sulfates. The diversity of the Pahrump Hills diagenetic assemblage suggests a complex post depositional history for fine-grained sediments for which the origin has been interpreted as fluvial and lacustrine. Assessment of the spatial and relative temporal distribution of these features shows that the Mg-sulfate features are predominant in the lower part of the section, suggesting local modification of the sediments by early diagenetic fluids. In contrast, light-toned Ca-sulfate veins occur in the whole section and cross-cut all other features. A relatively late stage shift in geochemical conditions could explain this observation. The Pahrump Hills diagenetic features have no equivalent compared to targets analyzed in other locations at Gale crater. Only the light-toned Ca-sulfate veins are present elsewhere, along Curiosity's path, suggesting they formed through a common late-stage process that occurred at over a broad area.

From the fits, we find that CH4 mixing ratios at the 8NPHS are consistent with those reported by Kim et al. (2014) in equatorial regions. We propose possible mechanisms to account for the temperature of the 8NPHS homopause, which is relatively cool compared with the temperatures of other auroral regions, including locally-fixed and transient but energetic auroral particle precipitation.

Radar observations and shape model of asteroid 16 Psyche	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; Asteroids Composition; Surfaces Asteroids; Radar	MAIN-BELT ASTEROIDS; INDUCED SEISMIC ACTIVITY; LIGHTCURVE INVERSION; OPTIMIZATION METHODS; ASTROMETRIC MASSES; 21 LUTETIA; DENSITY; METEORITE; GRAVITY; SIZE	Using the S-band radar at Arecibo Observatory, we observed 16 Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid in the main belt. We obtained 18 radar imaging and 6 continuous wave runs in November and December 2015, and combined these with 16 continuous wave runs from 2005 and 6 recent adaptive-optics (AO) images (Drummond et al., 2016) to generate a three-dimensional shape model of Psyche. Our model is consistent with a previously published AO image (Hanus et al., 2013) and three multi-chord occultations. Our shape model has dimensions 279 x 232 x 189 km (+/- 10%), D-eff =226 +/- 23 km, and is 6% larger than, but within the uncertainties of, the most recently published size and shape model generated from the inversion of lightcurves (Hanus et al., 2013). Psyche is roughly ellipsoidal but displays a mass-deficit over a region spanning 90 degrees of longitude. There is also evidence for two similar to 50-70 km wide depressions near its south pole. Our size and published masses lead to an overall bulk density estimate of 4500 +/- 1400 kgm(-3). Psyche's mean radar albedo of 0.37 +/- 0.09 is consistent with a near-surface regolith composed largely of iron-nickel and similar to 40% porosity. Its radar reflectivity varies by a factor of 1.6 as the asteroid rotates, suggesting global variations in metal abundance or bulk density in the near surface. The variations in radar albedo appear to correlate with large and small-scale shape features. Our size and Psyche's published absolute magnitude lead to an optical albedo of p(v)=0.15 +/- 0.03, and there is evidence for albedo variegations that correlate with shape features.

A Physics-Based Algorithm for the Simultaneous Retrieval of Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity From VIIRS Thermal Infrared Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Cross validation; intercomparison; Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)/NPOESS satellites; land surface temperature (LST); multispectral remote sensing; radiative transfer; spectral emissivity retrieval; Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER MODEL; MODIS DATA; EARTH-SCIENCE; VALIDATION; ASTER; RADIOMETER; SATELLITE; PRODUCTS; SEPARATION; ASSIMILATION	Land surface temperature (LST) is a key climate variable for studying the energy and water balance of the earth surface and monitoring the effects of climate change. This paper presents a physics-based temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of LST and emissivity (LST&E) from the thermal infrared bands of the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) payload. The new VIIRS LST&E product (VNP21) was developed to provide continuity with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) equivalent LST&E product (MxD21) product, which is available in Collection 6, and to address inconsistencies between the current MODIS and VIIRS split-window LST products. The TES algorithm uses full radiative transfer simulations to isolate the surface emitted radiance, and an emissivity calibration curve based on the variability in the surface radiance data to dynamically retrieve both LST and spectral emissivity. Furthermore, an improved water vapor scaling model was implemented to improve the accuracy and stability of the atmospheric correction for conditions with high atmospheric water vapor content. An independent assessment of the VIIRS LST retrievals was performed against in situ LST measurements over two dedicated validation sites at Lake Tahoe and Salton Sea in the Southwestern USA, while the VIIRS emissivity retrievals were evaluated with the latest ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset Version 3 (GEDv3). The bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) in retrieved VIIRS LST were 0.50 and 1.40 K, respectively for the two sites combined, while mean emissivity differences between VIIRS and ASTER GEDv3 were 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0.3% for bands M14 (8.55 mu m), M15 (10.76 mu m), and M16 (12.01 mu m), respectively, with an RMSE of 1%. We further demonstrate close agreement between the MODIS and VIIRS TES algorithm LST products to within similar to 0.3 K difference, as opposed to the current MODIS and VIIRS split window products, which had an average difference of 3 K.

Using information generated from overlapping aerial laser scanning (ALS) flight paths with multiple scan angles over a forest canopy can help to remove the occlusion effects between foliage elements, ultimately creating a relative comprehensive PCD. In this paper, we develop a novel physically based scan angle correction algorithm to retrieve the effective leaf area index (LAIe) of a forest canopy using ALS. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of scan angle and the number of ALS overpass lines from adjacent flight paths over a forest canopy on directional gap fraction (DGF) estimates. Our results suggest that ALS-based LAIe estimates capture 71.35% of the variations in LAIe derived from digital hemispherical photography. A forest canopy point cloud created using PCD from multiple overlapping ALS flight paths was sufficient to quantitatively reveal the anisotropy characteristics of DGF variations. These results suggest that scan angle information should not be neglected in retrieving forest canopy structural parameters, especially when using ALS data collected with a wide scan angle ( i.e., -30 degrees to 30 degrees in this paper). Finally, this paper provides a solid foundation to characterize the 3-D spatial distribution of a forest radiation regime using ALS-based forest PCD.

It is an important issue because detrainment of ice from updrafts influences the development of stratiform anvils, impacts radiation, and can affect GCM climate sensitivity. Recent studies have shown that the CMIP5 configurations of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) GCM simulated upper-tropospheric ice water content (IWC) that exceeded an estimated upper bound by a factor of 2. Partly in response to this bias, a new GCM parameterization of convective cloud ice has been developed that incorporates new ice particle fall speeds and convective outflow particle size distributions (PSDs) from the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA), NASA Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4), DOE ARM-NASA Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E), and DOE ARM Small Particles in Cirrus (SPARTICUS) field campaigns. The new parameterization assumes a normalized gamma PSD with two novel developments: no explicit assumption for particle habit in the calculation of mass distributions, and a formulation for translating ice particle fall speeds as a function of maximum diameter into fall speeds as a function of melted-equivalent diameter. Two parameters (particle volume-and projected area-weighted equivalent diameter) are diagnosed as a function of temperature and IWC in the convective plume, and these parameters constrain the shape and scale of the normalized gamma PSD. The diagnosed fall speeds and PSDs are combined with the GCM's parameterized convective updraft vertical velocity to partition convective updraft condensate into precipitating and detrained components. A 5-yr prescribed sea surface temperature GCM simulation shows a 30%-50% decrease in upper-tropospheric deep convective IWC, bringing the tropical and global mean ice water path into closer agreement with CloudSat best estimates.

Each was taking measurements between February 2004 and April 2012 (ACE-FTS and MLS are currently operational), providing hundreds of profile coincidences in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and during local morning and evening. Focusing on determining diurnal and hemispheric biases in the ACE-FTS data, this study compares ACE-FTS version 3.5 profiles that are collocated with MIPAS and MLS, and analyzes the differences between instrument retrievals for Northern and Southern hemispheres and for local morning and evening data. For O-3, ACE-FTS is typically within 5% of mid-stratospheric MIPAS and MLS data and exhibits a positive bias of similar to 10 to 20% in the upper stratosphere - lower mesosphere. For H2O, ACEFTS exhibits an average bias of 5% between 20 and 60 km. For N2O, ACE-FTS agrees with MIPAS and MLS within 20 to +10% up to 45 km and 35 km, respectively. For HNO3, ACEFTS typically agrees within +/- 10% below 30 km, and exhibits a positive bias of similar to 10 to 20% above 30 km. With respect to MIPAS CO, ACE-FTS exhibits an average - 11% bias between 28 and 50 km, and at higher altitudes a positive bias on the order of 10% ( > 100%) in the winter (summer). With respect to winter MLS CO, ACE-FTS is typically within 10% between 25 and 40 km, and has an average bias of - 11% above 40 km. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The oxygen bands are obvious choices to quantify airmass since the mixing ratio of oxygen is fixed over the full range of atmospheric conditions. The OCO-2 mission is currently retrieving carbon dioxide concentration using the oxygen A-band for airmass normalization. The 0.25% accuracy desired for the carbon dioxide concentration has pushed the required state-of-the-art for oxygen spectroscopy. To measure 02 A-band cross-sections with such accuracy through the full range of atmospheric pressure requires a sophisticated line shape model (Rautian or Speed-Dependent Voigt) with line mixing (LM) and collision induced absorption (CIA). Models of each of these phenomena exist, however, this work presents an integrated self-consistent model developed to ensure the best accuracy. It is also important to consider multiple sources of spectroscopic data for such a study in order to improve the dynamic range of the model and to minimize effects of instrumentation and associated systematic errors. The techniques of Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS) and Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) allow complimentary information for such an analysis. We utilize multispectrum fitting software to generate a comprehensive new database with improved accuracy based on these datasets. The extensive information will be made available as a multi-dimensional cross-section (ABSCO) table and the parameterization will be offered for inclusion in the HITRANonline database.

Microstructure investigations of Yb- and Bi-doped Mg2Si prepared from metal hydrides for thermoelectric applications	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Magnesium silicide; Thermoelectric materials; Ytterbium; Bismuth	SILICON; SEMICONDUCTORS; YTTERBIUM; SYSTEM; MGH2	Within the field of thermoelectric materials for energy conversion magnesium silicide, Mg2Si, is an outstanding candidate due to its low density, abundant constituents and low toxicity. However electronic and thermal tuning of the material is a required necessity to improve its Figure of Merit, zT. Doping of Yb via reactive YbH2 into the structure is performed with the goal of reducing the thermal conductivity. Hydrogen is released as a by-product at high temperatures allowing for facile incorporation of Yb into the structure. We report on the properties of Yb-and Bi-doped Mg2Si prepared with MgH2 and YbH2 with the focus on the synthetic conditions, and samples' microstructure, investigated by various electron microscopy techniques. Yb is found in the form of both Yb3Si5 inclusions and Yb dopant segregated at the grain boundary substituting for Mg. The addition of 1 at% Yb concentration reduced the thermal conductivity, providing a value of 30 mW/cm K at 800 K. In order to adjust carrier concentration, the sample is additionally doped with Bi. The impact of the microstructure on the transport properties of the obtained material is studied. Idealy, the reduction of the thermal conductivity is achieved by doping with Yb and the electronic transport is adjusted by doping with Bi. Large grain microstructure facilitates the electronic transport. However, the synthetic conditions that provide the optimized microstructure for electrical transport do not facilitate the additional Yb dopant incorporation. Therefore, the Yb and Bi containing sample with the optimized microstructure provides a zT=0.46 at 800 K.

Among the brightest ACT sources, these represent the subset of the total ACT sample lying in Herschel SPIRE fields, and all nine of the 218 GHz detections were found to have bright Herschel counterparts. By fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a modified blackbody model with power-law temperature distribution, we find the sample has a median redshift of z = 4.1(-1.0)(+1.1) (68 per cent confidence interval), as expected for 218 GHz selection, and an apparent total infrared luminosity of log10(mu LIR/L-circle dot) = 13.86(-0.30)(+0.33), which suggests that they are either strongly lensed sources or unresolved collections of unlensed DSFGs. The effective apparent diameter of the sample is root mu d = 4.2(-1.0)(+1.7) kpc, further evidence of strong lensing or multiplicity, since the typical diameter of DSFGs is 1.0-2.5 kpc. We emphasize that the effective apparent diameter derives from SED modelling without the assumption of optically thin dust (as opposed to image morphology). We find that the sources have substantial optical depth (tau = 4.2(-1.9)(+3.7)) to dust around the peak in the modified blackbody spectrum (lambda(obs) <= 500 mu m), a result that is robust to model choice.

Speckle suppression and companion detection using coherent differential imaging	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						instrumentation: high angular resolution; techniques: image processing; techniques: interferometric; brown dwarfs; planetary systems	CORONAGRAPHIC PHASE-DIVERSITY; ADAPTIVE OPTICS; VORTEX CORONAGRAPH; BROWN DWARF; CONTRAST; SUBTRACTION; TELESCOPE; STARS	Residual speckles due to aberrations arising from optical errors after the split between the wavefront sensor and the science camera path are the most significant barriers to imaging extrasolar planets. While speckles can be suppressed using the science camera in conjunction with the deformable mirror, this requires knowledge of the phase of the electric field in the focal plane. We describe a method which combines a coronagraph with a simple phase-shifting interferometer to measure and correct speckles in the full focal plane. We demonstrate its initial use on the Stellar Double Coronagraph at the Palomar Observatory. We also describe how the same hardware can be used to distinguish speckles from true companions by measuring the coherence of the optical field in the focal plane. We present results observing the brown dwarf HD49197b with this technique, demonstrating the ability to detect the presence of a companion even when it is buried in the speckle noise, without the use of any standard `calibration' techniques. We believe this is the first detection of a substellar companion using the coherence properties of light.	[Bottom, M.] CALTECH, MC 249-17,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wallace, J.

However, these predictions are yet observationally unconstrained. To validate the predictions on the influence of magnetic fields on protoplanetary discs, we apply 3D radiative transfer simulations of the polarized emission of aligned aspherical dust grains that directly link 3D global non-ideal MHD simulations to Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations show that it is feasible to observe the predicted toroidal large-scale magnetic field structures, not only in the ideal observations but also with high-angular resolution ALMA observations. Our results show further that high-angular resolution observations by ALMA are able to identify vortices embedded in outer magnetized disc regions.	[Bertrang, G.

Greenhouse gas emissions intensity of global croplands	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							NITROUS-OXIDE; METHANE EMISSION; N2O EMISSIONS; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; AGRONOMIC ASSESSMENT; FLOODED RICE; LAND-USE; CLIMATE; YIELD; CARBON	Stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fromcroplands as agricultural demand grows is a critical component of climate change mitigation(1-3). Emissions intensity metrics-including carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per kilocalorie produced ('production intensity')-can highlight regions, management practices, and crops as potential foci for mitigation(4-7). Yet the spatial and crop-wise distribution of emissions intensity has been uncertain. Here, we develop global crop-specific circa 2000 estimates of GHG emissions and GHG intensity in high spatial detail, reporting the effects of rice paddy management, peatland draining, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer on CH4, CO2 and N-2O emissions. Global mean production intensity is 0.16 Mg CO(2)e M kcal(-1), yet certain cropping practices contribute disproportionately to emissions. Peatland drainage (3.7 Mg CO(2)e M kcal(-1))-concentrated in Europe and Indonesia-accounts for 32% of these cropland emissions despite peatlands producing just 1.1% of total crop kilocalories. Methane emissions fromrice (0.58 Mg CO(2)e M kcal(-1)), a crucial food staple supplying 15% of total crop kilocalories, contribute 48% of cropland emissions, with outsized production intensity in Vietnam. In contrast, N2O emissions from N fertilizer application (0.033 Mg CO(2)e M kcal(-1)) generate only 20% of cropland emissions. We find that current total GHG emissions are largely unrelated to production intensity across crops and countries. Climate mitigation policies should therefore be directed to locations where crops have both high emissions and high intensities.

A probabilistic framework for single-station location of seismicity on Earth and Mars	PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS			English	Article						Mars; Earth; Waveforms; Marsquakes; Earthquakes; Location; Surface waves; Body-waves; Travel times	BROAD-BAND; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; TRAVEL-TIMES; WAVE; CONSTRAINTS; MANTLE; PARAMETERS; INVERSION; IMPACTS; PHASE	Locating the source of seismic energy from a single three-component seismic station is associated with large uncertainties, originating from challenges in identifying seismic phases, as well as inevitable pick and model uncertainties. The challenge is even higher for planets such as Mars, where interior structure is a priori largely unknown. In this study, we address the single-station location problem by developing a probabilistic framework that combines location estimates from multiple algorithms to estimate the probability density function (PDF) for epicentral distance, back azimuth, and origin time. Each algorithm uses independent and complementary information in the seismic signals. Together, the algorithms allow locating seismicity ranging from local to teleseismic quakes. Distances and origin times of large regional and teleseismic events (M > 5.5) are estimated from observed and theoretical body- and multi-orbit surface-wave travel times. The latter are picked from the maxima in the waveform envelopes in various frequency bands. For smaller events at local and regional distances, only first arrival picks of body waves are used, possibly in combination with fundamental Rayleigh RI waveform maxima where detectable; depth phases, such as pP or PmP, help constrain source depth and improve distance estimates. Back azimuth is determined from the polarization of the Rayleigh- and/or P-wave phases. When seismic signals are good enough for multiple approaches to be used, estimates from the various methods are combined through the product of their PDFs, resulting in an improved event location and reduced uncertainty range estimate compared to the results obtained from each algorithm independently. To verify our approach, we use both earthquake recordings from existing Earth stations and synthetic Martian seismograms. The Mars synthetics are generated with a full-waveform scheme (AxiSEM) using spherically symmetric seismic velocity, density and attenuation models of Mars that incorporate existing knowledge of Mars internal structure, and include expected ambient and instrumental noise. While our probabilistic framework is developed mainly for application to Mars in the context of the upcoming InSight mission, it is also relevant for locating seismic events on Earth in regions with sparse instrumentation.

Here, we used field plot data collected in a tropical moist forest in the central Amazon to gain a better understanding of the uncertainty associated with plot-level biomass estimates obtained specifically for the calibration of remote sensing measurements. In addition to accounting for sources of error that would be normally expected in conventional biomass estimates (e.g., measurement and allometric errors), we examined two sources of uncertainty that are specific to the calibration process and should be taken into account in most remote sensing studies: the error resulting from spatial disagreement between field and remote sensing measurements (i.e., co-location error), and the error introduced when accounting for temporal differences in data acquisition. We found that the overall uncertainty in the field biomass was typically 25% for both secondary and primary forests, but ranged from 16 to 53%. Co-location and temporal errors accounted for a large fraction of the total variance (>65%) and were identified as important targets for reducing uncertainty in studies relating tropical forest biomass to remotely sensed data. Although measurement and allometric errors were relatively unimportant when considered alone, combined they accounted for roughly 30% of the total variance on average and should not be ignored. Our results suggest that a thorough understanding of the sources of error associated with field-measured plot-level biomass estimates in tropical forests is critical to determine confidence in remote sensing estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes, and to develop strategies for reducing the overall uncertainty of remote sensing approaches.

Quantifying insect-related forest mortality with the remote sensing of snow	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Snow cover; Forest mortality; MODIS; Mountain pine beetle	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; PINE-BEETLE INFESTATION; TREE MORTALITY; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; MODIS DATA; OUTBREAK; COLORADO; IMAGERY; COVER	Greenhouse gas emissions have altered global climate significantly, increasing the frequency of drought, fire, and insect- and pathogen-related mortality in forests across the western United States. The accuracy of satellite-based estimates of canopy change has been limited by difficulties associated with discriminating overstory canopy from understory vegetation. To overcome this issue, we developed a method to quantify forest canopy cover using winter-season fractional snow covered area (F-SCA) data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) algorithm. The method utilizes time series of Fscp, data to identify images with continuous ground snow coverage and a snow-free overstory, effectively masking out the influence of understory vegetation. Using this method, we determined that MODSCAGretrieved viewable gap fraction (VGF; i.e. fraction of pixel sub-canopy viewable area) was significantly correlated with an independent product of yearly crown mortality caused by mountain pine beetles derived from Landsat imagery at 25 high-mortality sites in northern Colorado ((r) over bar = 0.96 +/- 0.03, p<0.03). Additionally, we determined the temporal lag between tree mortality and needlefall, showing that needlefall occurred an average of 2.6 +/- 1.2 years after year of attack. The canopy change detection method described herein is the first to utilize snow cover to mask understory impacts on overstory detection. The method can be applied anywhere in the seasonal snow zone and therefore has wide applicability given that 30% of the global land surface is seasonally snow covered. In this regard, the approach addresses significant limitations of previously published methods of canopy change detection and has broad implications with regard to understanding forest mortality and the representation of disturbance within hydrologic, land surface, and climate models.

Significant differences exist between commonly used composite SST reconstructions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST), the Hadley Centre SST data set (HadSST3), and the Japanese Meteorological Agency's Centennial Observation-Based Estimates of SSTs (COBE-SST) from 2003 to the present. The update from ERSST version 3b to version 4 resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last 19 years from 0.07 degrees to 0.12 degrees C per decade, indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version 4 trends generally agree with largely independent, near-global, and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys, Argo floats, and radiometer-based satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets.

However, the traditional approach to using HSMs involves graphical languages (such as UML statecharts) from which implementation code is generated (e.g. in C or C++). This is driven by the fact that state transitions in an HSM can result in execution of action code, with associated side-effects, which is implemented by code in the target implementation language. Due to this indirection, early analysis of designs becomes difficult. We propose an internal Scala DSL for writing HSMs, which makes them short, readable and easy to work with during the design phase. Writing the HSM models in Scala also allows us to use an expressive monitoring framework (also in Scala) for checking temporal properties over the HSM behaviors. We show how our approach admits writing reactive monitors that send messages to the HSM when certain sequences of events have been observed, e.g., to inject faults under certain conditions, in order to check that the system continues to operate correctly. This work is part of a larger project exploring the use of a modern high-level programming language (Scala) for modeling and verification.

Achieving sufficient contrast performance on a segmented aperture space telescope is particularly challenging due to unwanted diffraction within the telescope from amplitude and phase discontinuities in the pupil. Apodized vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that theoretically meet the performance needs for high contrast imaging with future segmented space telescopes. We investigate the sensitivity of apodized vortex coronagraphs to the expected aberrations, including segment co-phasing errors in piston and tip/tilt as well as other low-order and mid-spatial frequency aberrations. Coronagraph designs and their associated telescope requirements are identified for conceptual HabEx and LUVOIR telescope designs.

In Swarm II, CARACaS demonstrated higher levels of autonomy and more complex cooperation than previous on-water exercises, using full-sized vehicles and real-world sensing and communication. The core autonomous behaviors to support the harbor patrol scenario included Patrol, Track, Inspect, and Trail, providing the capability of finding all vessels entering the patrol area, keeping track of them, inspecting them to infer intent, and trailing suspect vessels. Significantly, CARACaS assumed responsibility for not only executing tasks safely and efficiently but also recognizing what tasks needed to be accomplished, given the current state of the world. Since the heterogeneous USV teams shared world model that evolved, such as due to (dis)appearance of vessels in the area or a change in health or availability of a USV, CARACaS replanned to generate and reallocate the new task list. Thus, human intervention was never required in the loop to task USVs during mission execution, though a supervisory role was supported in the autonomy system for mission monitoring and exception handling. Finally, CARACaS also ensured the USVs avoided hazards and obeyed the applicable rules of the road, using its local motion planning modules.

The harsh environment these missions take place in involves high levels of radiation which can cause decoding circuitry failures for the device error-correction module. For this reason, the decoder must be robust to radiation-induced errors. Previous works have studied hardware failure problem by modeling the circuitry noise as independent and constant in each component of the decoder. We propose a multi-state radiation channel which is designed to account for the dependence and duration of radiation-induced errors on different components. This model also subsumes some previously studied cases and allows for a more refined analysis. We introduce a corresponding LDPC combined Gallager B/E decoder and perform a density evolution analysis to characterize the idealized decoder performance. We optimize the decoder voting threshold parameter and apply our findings to a finite length case.

Larsen on the Occasion of his 60th Birthday	AUG 19-20, 2017	Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, DENMARK		Aalborg Univ		TEMPORAL LOGIC; MODEL CHECKING; PROGRAMS; ASPECTJ	Runtime Verification is a light-weight approach to systems verification, where actual executions of a system are processed and analyzed using rigorous techniques. In this paper we shall narrow the term's definition to represent the commonly studied variant consisting of verifying that a single system execution conforms to a specification written in a formal specification language. Runtime verification (in this sense) can be used for writing test oracles during testing when the system is too complex for full formal verification, or it can be used during deployment of the system as part of a fault protection strategy, where corrective actions may be taken in case the specification is violated. Specification languages for runtime verification appear to differ from for example temporal logics applied in model checking, in part due to the focus on monitoring of events that carry data, and specifically due to the desire to relate data values existing at different time points, resulting in new challenges in both the complexity of the monitoring approach and the expressiveness of languages. Over the recent years, numerous runtime verification specification languages have emerged, each with its different features and levels of expressiveness and usability. This paper presents an overview and a discussion of this design space.

Automated Breast Ultrasound for Ductal Pattern Reconstruction: Ground Truth File Generation and CADe Evaluation	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-MEDICAL INSTRUMENTATION AND RELATED ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES (BIOMEP 2017)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Bio-Medical Instrumentation and related Engineering and Physical Sciences (BIOMEP)	OCT 12-13, 2017	Technological Educ Inst, Athens, GREECE	Dept Biomedical Engn	Technological Educ Inst		WOMEN	The purpose of this study was the generation of ground truth files (GTFs) of the breast ducts from 3D images of the Invenia (TM) Automated Breast Ultrasound System (ABUS) system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and the application of these GTFs for the optimization of the imaging protocol and the evaluation of a computer aided detection (CADe) algorithm developed for automated duct detection. Six lactating, nursing volunteers were scanned with the ABUS before and right after breastfeeding their infants. An expert in breast ultrasound generated rough outlines of the milk-filled ducts in the transaxial slices of all image volumes and the final GTFs were created by using thresholding and smoothing tools in ImageJ. In addition, a CADe algorithm automatically segmented duct like areas and its results were compared to the expert's GTFs by estimating true positive fraction (TPF) or % overlap. The CADe output differed significantly from the expert's but both detected a smaller than expected volume of the ducts due to insufficient contrast (ducts were partially filled with milk), discontinuities, and artifacts. GTFs were used to modify the imaging protocol and improve the CADe method. In conclusion, electronic GTFs provide a valuable tool in the optimization of a tomographic imaging system, the imaging protocol, and the CADe algorithms. Their generation, however, is an extremely time consuming, strenuous process, particularly for multi-slice examinations, and alternatives based on phantoms or simulations are highly desirable.

Fourier transform absorption spectra of the 2-0 band of (CO)-C-12-O-16 mixed with CO2 have been recorded at total pressures from 156 to 1212 hPa and at 4 different temperatures between 240 K and 283 K. CO2 pressure-induced line broadening and line shift coefficients, and the associated temperature dependence have been measured in an multispectrum non-linear least squares analysis using Voigt profiles with an asymmetric profile due to line mixing. The measured CO2-broadening and CO2-shift parameters were compared with theoretical values, calculated by collaborators. In addition, the CO2-broadening and shift coefficients have been calculated for individual temperatures using the Exponential Power Gap (EPG) semi-empirical method. We also discuss the retrieved line shape parameters for Methane transitions in the spectral range known as the Methane Octad. We used high resolution spectra of pure methane and of dilute mixtures of methane in dry air, recorded with high signal to noise ratio at temperatures between 148 K and room temperature using the Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. Theoretical calculations for line parameters have been performed and the results are compared with the previously published values and with the line parameters available in the GEISA2015 [1] and HITRAN2012 [2] databases.

Fabricating with crystalline Si to improve superconducting detector performance	12TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LOW TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Workshop on Low Temperature Electronics	SEP 18-21, 2016	Tempe, AZ	Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Lake Shore Cryotron, Arizona State Univ NewSpace, IRA A				We built and measured radio-frequency (RF) loss tangent, tan delta, evaluation structures using float-zone quality silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with 5 mu m thick device layers. Superconducting Nb components were fabricated on both sides of the SOI Si device layer. Our main goals were to develop a robust fabrication for using crystalline Si (c-Si) dielectric layers with superconducting Nb components in a wafer bonding process and to confirm that tan delta with c-Si dielectric layers was reduced at RF frequencies compared to devices fabricated with amorphous dielectrics, such as SiO2 and SixNy, where tan delta similar to 10(-3). Our primary test structure used a Nb coplanar waveguide (CPW) readout structure capacitively coupled to LC resonators, where the capacitors were defined as parallel-plate capacitors on both sides of a c-Si device layer using a wafer bonding process with benzocyclobutene (BCB) wafer bonding adhesive. Our control experiment, to determine the intrinsic tan delta in the SOI device layer without wafer bonding, also used Nb CPW readout coupled to LC resonators; however, the parallel-plate capacitors were fabricated on both sides of the Si device layer using a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) to access the c-Si underside through the buried oxide and handle Si layers in the SOI wafers. We found that our wafer bonded devices demonstrated F center dot delta = (8 +/- 2) x 10(-5), where F is the filling fraction of two-level states (TLS). For the control experiment, F center dot delta = (2.0 +/- 0.6) x 10(-5), and we discuss what may be degrading the performance in the wafer bonded devices as compared to the control devices.

This paper focuses on the completed LRI Laser Ranging Processor (LRP), which includes heterodyne signal phase tracking at mu cycle/root Hz precision, differential wavefront sensing, offset frequency phase locking and Pound-Drever-Hall laser stabilization. The LRI design has characteristics that are similar to those for LISA: 1064nm NPRO laser source, science bandwidth in the mHz range, MHz-range intermediate frequency and Doppler shift, detected optical power of tens of picoWatts. Laser frequency stabilization has been demonstrated at a level below 30 Hz/root Hz, better than the LISA requirement of 300 Hz/root Hz. The LRP has completed all performance testing and environmental qualification and has been delivered to the GRACE Follow-On spacecraft. The LRI is poised to test the LISA techniques of tone-assisted time delay interferometry and arm-locking. GRACE Follow-On launches in 2017.

S	Tinto, M			IOP	Tinto, Massimo			Enhanced Gravitational Wave Science with LISA and gLISA.	11TH INTERNATIONAL LISA SYMPOSIUM	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International LISA Symposium	SEP 05-09, 2016	Univ Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	LISA	Univ Zurich			The geosynchronous Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (gLISA) is a space-based gravitational wave (GW) mission that, for the past five years, has been under joint study at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford University, the National Institute for Space Research (I.N.P.E., Brazil), and Space Systems Loral. With an arm length of 73,000 km, gLISA will display optimal sensitivity over a frequency region that is exactly in between those accessible by LISA and LIGO. Such a GW frequency band is characterized by the presence of a very large ensemble of coalescing black-hole binaries (BHBs) similar to those first observed by LIGO and with masses that are 10 to 100 times the mass of the Sun. gLISA will detect thousands of such signals with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enhance the LIGO science by measuring with high precision the parameters characterizing such signals (source direction, chirp parameter, time to coalescence, etc.) well before they will enter the LIGO band. This valuable information will improve LIGO's ability to detect these signals and facilitate its study of the merger and ring-down phases not observable by space-based detectors. If flown at the same time as the LISA mission, the two arrays will deliver a joint sensitivity that accounts for the best performance of both missions in their respective parts of the milliHertz band. This simultaneous operation will result in an optimally combined sensitivity curve that is "white" from about 3 x 10(-3) Hz to 1 Hz, making the two antennas capable of detecting, with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), BHBs with masses in the range (10 - 10(7))M-circle dot. Their ability of jointly tracking, with enhanced SNR, signals similar to that observed by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) on September 14, 2015 (the GW150914 event) will result in a larger number of observable small-mass binary black-holes and an improved precision of the parameters characterizing these sources. Together, LISA, gLISA and aLIGO will cover, with good sensitivity, the (10(-4) - 10(3)) Hz frequency band.

In addition to the profound impacts on human health and ecosystems, fine PM interacts directly and indirectly with the Earth's radiation budget, influencing weather and climate. An understanding of the PM formation mechanism is critical in the development of efficient mitigation policies to minimize the local, regional, and global impacts. The formation mechanisms leading to severe haze episodes with exceedingly high PM2.5 levels in China remain uncertain, and the abundance and chemical constituents of PM2.5 depend on the complex interplay between meteorology, emission sources, and atmospheric chemical processes. This paper discusses the various aspects relevant to persistent haze in China, including the fundamental chemistry and meteorological conditions. The similarity and difference in PM formation between Beijing and other world regions are illustrated. Future research needs relevant to persistent haze formation in China are discussed.

Just as important in the TDI scheme is the ability to suppress the rf local oscillator noises in the optical heterodyne measurements. We show that the local oscillator noises can be effectively and elegantly cancelled by employing optical frequency combs in which the rf signal phases are coherent with the optical phases. In addition, the deployment of optical combs eliminates the need for separate ultra-stable oscillators. This is a simpler and more reliable approach than the modulation scheme, and it can be applied to the most generalized TDI combinations.

It utilizes a set of interior gravity field spherical harmonics expansions to place constraints on the likely distribution of the density inhomogeneities inside a body of mass. An interior spherical harmonics expansion is defined within the interior Brillouin sphere that extends down to the surface of a body of mass allowing it to be closer and more sensitive to the regional density dispersions.

The current reference trajectory for the robotic portion, ARRM, assumes a launch on a Delta IV H in the end of the calendar year 2021, with a return for astronaut operations in cislunar space in 2026. The current baseline design allocates 245 days of stay time at the asteroid for operations and boulder collection. This paper outlines analysis completed by the ARRM mission design team to understand the sensitivity of the reference trajectory to launch date and asteroid stay time.

After successfully completing its Vesta and Ceres prime missions, Dawn is now in its extended mission, continuously exploring Ceres. After losing the second reaction wheel assembly at the end of the Vesta mission, the feasibility of the Ceres mission was at risk due to the potentially significant increase in hydrazine consumption from using only the reaction control system thrusters. This paper summarizes the intense, collaborative efforts undertaken by the project to conserve hydrazine prior to Vesta departure, during cruise to Ceres, and throughout the Ceres mission. The project's efforts in minimizing the number of turns are discussed. A special emphasis is given to describing various efforts taken by the Attitude Control Subsystem team in an attempt to reduce hydrazine consumption. These efforts include: changing default slew rates, control gain tuning, changing nadir pointing strategy with Ahead Cross Nadir pointing, hybrid control implementation using hydrazine based thrusters and two remaining reaction wheels, optimal science turn location analysis, and reaction wheel angular momentum management strategies for reducing the number of momentum unloadings. In addition to the Attitude Control Subsystem team's efforts, the Mission Design and Navigation team's efforts taken in designing hydrazine friendly orbit transfers are discussed. The trade study performed collaboratively by the Attitude Control Subsystem team and the Science Operations Support Team in choosing hydrazine friendly off-nadir targets is also discussed. Various simulation results are presented and compared against actual flight data obtained. Lastly, remaining hydrazine status at the end of the prime Ceres mission and the hydrazine management planning for the extended mission are discussed.

On Earth, asteroid impacts have produced several near extinction level events. We tend to visualize these collisions as billiard balls hitting one another. But how, exactly, do they occur? The actual dynamics is much more complex and subtle because it is highly nonlinear and involves chaos in the Three-Body Problem. In this paper we investigate the effects of Lyapunov orbits, halo orbits, and their associated invariant manifolds, on the orbital motion of SL9. We demonstrate that periodic orbits act as gateways to Jupiter, and their invariant manifolds control the dynamics of SL9 during the Initial Capture Phase.

This paper furthers that study by analyzing the sensitivity of these periodic orbits when exposed to various perturbations. In particular, the issue of transferring the initial conditions to higher fidelity models and the characterization of the resulting behavior is explored in light of the underlying dynamics.

MAVEN has performed several Deep Dip campaigns in which the orbit periapsis was lowered to an altitude range of 115 to 135 km. MAVEN accelerometer data were used during mission operations to estimate atmospheric parameters such as density, scale height, along-track gradients, and wave structures. These estimates were used to aid the MAVEN navigation team in planning maneuvers to raise and lower periapsis during Deep Dip operations. This paper describes the processes used to reconstruct atmosphere parameters from accelerometer data and presents comparisons between model and navigation-derived values.

These events potentially involve a propellant reducing flyby, a capture maneuver, and a subsequent set of flybys which reduce energy and set the orbital conditions necessary for a science campaign. This paper addresses the optimality, robustness, and flexibility of a design in the Jovian system with target conditions set by NASA's planned Europa Clipper Mission Concept. Robustness to spacecraft anomalies is achieved through the orbital design and not through propellant margin. The theoretical limits of the design space are derived before performing a broad trajectory search.

The spacecraft was set en route to Jupiter, and its Jupiter Orbit Insertion occurred on 2016-07-04 PST after a five-year cruise in deep space. The mission phase just prior to this large maneuver is called approach. As navigation team, we were responsible for precise orbit determination of the Juno spacecraft to ensure a successful orbit insertion. To evaluate the navigation performance, we employed the B-plane mapping, where the incoming hyperbolic velocity defines the plane perpendicular to it, and the time to go to hit the plane will directly map into the uncertainties of the target point. The B-plane is a convenient tool when assessing the navigation performance as it is not affected by non-linearities due to the gravitational pull of the targeted body. However, as the Jupiter Orbit Insertion approached we started to realize that the B-plane mapping uncertainties were significantly larger than expected. We found that the B-plane mapping time had tremendous influence on the covariance inflation in the B-plane. Because of the close approach distance during the Jupiter Orbit Insertion and the strong interaction with J(2) spherical harmonic coefficient, the Juno dynamics were too far from a Keplerian one assumed for the B-plane mapping. We first discuss the analytical approach of the B-plane mapping uncertainty and perform a numerical analysis to isolate the components of the Juno dynamics that cause the B-plane covariance inflation.

During this time the navigational capabilities employed have increased greatly in accuracy, as required by the scientific objectives of the missions and as enabled by improvements in technology. This paper is the fourth in a chronological sequence dealing with the evolution of deep space navigation. The time interval covered extends from roughly 2004 to 2006. The paper focuses on the observational techniques that have been used to obtain navigational information, propellant-efficient means for modifying spacecraft trajectories, and the computational methods that have been employed, tracing their evolution through eleven planetary missions.

Thanks to a dynamically well-behaved spacecraft, the delivery of Juno to JOI was done largely with only a maneuver to setup an Earth gravity assist (EGA), an EGA, an EGA clean-up maneuver, and a JOI targeting maneuver. During the last several weeks of the approach to JOI, the dominant uncertainties in the predicted trajectory were from the Jupiter barycenter ephemeris. In this paper, we discuss the maneuver and orbit determination (OD) strategy for successfully arriving at JOI, the challenges of calculating a correction to the Jupiter barycenter ephemeris using only radiometric data types, and how the ephemeris estimates during approach to JOI compare to a post-JOI trajectory reconstruction.

These applications include both links between spacecraft and links between spacecraft and ground. The Interagency Operation Advisory Group (IOAG) has stated that there is a strong business case for international cross support of spacecraft optical links. It further concluded that in order to enable cross support the links must be standardized. This paper will overview the history and structure of the space communications international standards body, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), that will develop the standards and provide an update on the proceedings of the Optical Communications Working Group within CCSDS. This paper will also describe the set of optical communications standards being developed and outline some of the issues that must be addressed in the next few years. The paper will address, in particular, the ongoing work on application scenarios for deep space to ground called High Photon Efficiency, for LEO to ground called Low Complexity, for inter-satellite and near Earth to ground called High Data Rate, as well as associated atmospheric measurement techniques and link operations concepts.

A 22 cm diameter flight laser transceiver (FLT) is being developed for space flight. The FLT will be designed to transmit an average laser power of 4W at 1550 nm and receive a weak 1064 nm laser signal (>100 femtowatts). Use of the Hale telescope at Palomar Mountain, CA, retrofitted with a photon-counting receiver to detect the downlink from space, is planned. The Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) at Table Mountain, CA will transmit a 1064 nm laser beacon to serve as a pointing reference for the FLT and support low-rate uplink data-rates. The DSOC FLT is part of the baseline payload for the Psyche mission spacecraft recently selected for flight by NASA, providing link demonstration opportunities during the mission cruise phase. Link demonstration opportunities at distances of approximately 0.1 to 2 astronomical units (AU) are expected. The DSOC system is being designed to support downlink data-rates of 0.2 to > 200 Mb/s and uplink data rates of approximately 1.6 kb/s. A status update of DSOC Project activities on flight and ground development will be summarized in this paper.

Several hundreds of CubeSats have already been successfully launched in the past few years and the number of announced launches grows every year. These platforms provide an easy access to space for universities and organizations which otherwise could not afford it. However, these spacecraft still rely on RF communications, where the spectrum is already crowded and cannot support the growing demand for data transmission to the ground. Lasercom holds the promise to be the solution to this problem, with a potential improvement of several orders of magnitude in the transmission capacity, while keeping a low size, weight and power. Between 2016 and 2017, The Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS), a joint institute of the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, brought together a group of space scientists and lasercom engineers to address the current challenges that this technology faces, in order to enable it to compete with RF and eventually replace it when high-data rate is needed. After two one-week workshops, the working group started developing a report addressing three study cases: low Earth orbit, crosslinks and deep space. This paper presents the main points and conclusions of these KISS workshops.

We have been analyzing a number of deep-space navigation scenarios to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using optical communication systems for navigation. Our objectives were to evaluate the performance achievable with optical systems, and to study under what circumstances these systems could be sufficient to navigate the mission, reducing the requirements for radio systems to perhaps just to be a backup for emergency communications.

The traditional purpose is to detect the lack of conformance with respect to a formal specification. Numerous efforts in the field have focused on monitoring so-called parametric specifications, where events carry data, and formulas can refer to such. Since a monitor for such specifications has to store observed data, the challenge is to have an efficient representation and manipulation of Boolean operators, quantification, and lookup of data. The fundamental problem is that the actual values of the data are not necessarily bounded or provided in advance. In this work we explore the use of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) for representing observed data. Our experiments show a substantial improvement in performance compared to related work.

Versatile, ultra-low sample volume gas analyzer using a rapid, broad tuning ECQCL and a hollow fiber gas cell	NEXT-GENERATION SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGIES X	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Next-Generation Spectroscopic Technologies X	APR 10-11, 2017	Anaheim, CA	SPIE		Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR); spectroscopy; quantum cascade laser (QCL); hollow fiber optic waveguide; gas analysis; volatile organic compound (VOC)	SPECTROSCOPY	We describe a versatile mid-infrared (Mid-IR) spectroscopy system developed to measure the concentration of a wide range of gases with an ultra-low sample size. The system combines a rapidly-swept external cavity quantum cascade laser (ECQCL) with a hollow fiber gas cell. The ECQCL has sufficient spectral resolution and reproducibility to measure gases with narrow features (e.g., water, methane, ammonia, etc.), and also the spectral tuning range needed to measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs), (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons), sulfur compounds, chlorine compounds, etc. The hollow fiber is a capillary tube having an internal reflective coating optimized for transmitting the Mid-IR laser beam to a detector. Sample gas introduced into the fiber (e.g., internal volume = 0.6 ml) interacts strongly with the laser beam, and despite relatively modest path lengths (e.g., L similar to 3 m), the requisite quantity of sample needed for sensitive measurements can be significantly less than what is required using conventional IR laser spectroscopy systems. Example measurements are presented including quantification of VOCs relevant for human breath analysis with a sensitivity of similar to 2 picomoles at a 1 Hz data rate.

Polyanskiy's normal approximation combined with a linear model for the information gap of a rate-compatible code family provides a simple and accurate characterization of the behavior of feedback systems employing practical codes, such as convolutional or low-density parity-check codes. Especially for short message lengths on the order of k < 50 message bits, the newly proposed model is more accurate than Vakilinia's model in which the rate of first successful decoding has a Gaussian probability density function.

Design of Improved Quasi-Cyclic Protograph-Based Raptor-Like LDPC Codes for Short Block-Lengths	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Aachen, GERMANY	IEEE			PARITY-CHECK CODES	Protograph-based Raptor-like low-density parity check codes (PBRL codes) are a recently proposed family of easily encodable and decodable rate-compatible LDPC (RC-LDPC) codes. These codes have an excellent iterative decoding threshold and performance across all design rates. PBRL codes designed thus far, for both long and short block-lengths, have been based on optimizing the iterative decoding threshold of the protograph of the RC code family at various design rates. In this work, we propose a design method to obtain better quasi-cyclic (QC) RC-LDPC codes with PBRL structure for short block-lengths (of a few hundred bits). We achieve this by maximizing an upper bound on the minimum distance of any QC-LDPC code that can be obtained from the protograph of a PBRL ensemble. The obtained codes outperform the original PBRL codes at short block-lengths by significantly improving the error floor behavior at all design rates. Furthermore, we identify a reduction in complexity of the design procedure, facilitated by the general structure of a PBRL ensemble.	[Ranganathan, Sudarsan V.

Reducing the thickness of this protective layer can result in additional performance gains by minimizing absorption losses, and provides a path toward high Al reflectance in the challenging wavelength range of 90 to 110 nm. We have pursued the development of new atomic layer deposition processes (ALD) for the metal fluoride materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. Using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as a reactant, these films can be deposited at the low temperatures required for large-area surface-finished optics and polymeric diffraction gratings. We also report on the development and application of an atomic layer etching (ALE) procedure to controllably etch native aluminum oxide. Our ALE process utilizes the same chemistry used in the ALD of AlF3 thin films, allowing for a combination of high-performance evaporated Al layers and ultrathin ALD encapsulation without requiring vacuum transfer. Progress in demonstrating the scalability of this approach, as well as the environmental stability of ALD/ALE Al mirrors are discussed in the context of possible future applications for NASA LUVOIR and HabEx mission concepts.

Towards a Distributed Infrastructure for Data-Driven Discoveries & Analysis	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)	IEEE International Conference on Big Data		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data)	DEC 11-14, 2017	Boston, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ELSEVIER, CISCO				Big data analytics traditionally involves download of massive amounts of datasets to common server/cluster for processing. Analytic process gets slower with increasing size of required data and network conditions. Data scientists also need explicit access to data locations to download required data. Explicit access to required data may not always be granted due to security reasons. To simplify and accelerate the analytics process on distributed big data with security considerations, we proposed the Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI) for data driven discoveries. Instead of moving large amounts of data to a common place of processing, VIFI allows automatic transfer of required analytics programs to the distributed data locations for in-place processing of relevant data. VIFI allows data scientists to conduct and coordinate complex analytics processes on distributed data repositories using containerization technology and open-source workflow design tools. VIFI alleviates users from having detailed knowledge of distributed data locations, as well as required dependencies, installation and configuration of analytical libraries. In this paper, we demonstrate our current and future work to improve the VIFI architecture using previous and additional uses cases, data management layer that simplifies search of relevant data sets through addition of metadata, integration with security policies at different institutions with the proposed VIFI security layer, and the use of a user-friendly web interface to carry different VIFI activities.

Historically, data analysis required an analyst to move the data to the system computing the analysis. As the volume of data available increases, the storage, CPU, and memory requirements for this type of traditional analysis increases to a point that makes it impractical. The NEXUS approach is to remove this data movement, transform the data into a format convenient for analysis, and provide analytic functions that can be massively parallelized.

The hybrid method includes three steps: (1) calculating the generalized T matrix of every single object, (2) wave transformations and (3) solving Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations (FL). We utilize the commercial software HFSS to extract the T matrix of a single object. HFSS enables us to perform full wave simulations of single objects with complicated structures. To validate the T matrix extraction method, a sphere is used since it has analytical solutions for the T matrix. For wave transformations, we develop the robust numerical method, which is verified by the analytical solutions of spherical wave transformations. In solving FL, the wave interactions of the singles objects are taken into account. The results of the hybrid method agree with those of the HFSS brute force method. In comparison, the hybrid method is much more efficient than HFSS for vegetation scattering and applicable to large problems such as full wave simulations of a tree.

This problem requires either agents to be distinguishable or some combinatorial optimization to be solved in order to find the most convenient target-to-agent assignment. However, in many applications or mission stages, group connectivity and collision free trajectories are in fact the only desired requirements, while the robots themselves are allowed to freely generate their spatial distribution. To this end, the simplest possible case corresponds to all agents trying to maintain the same relative scalar distance. However, since it is not possible to have more than d+1 equally separated points in a d-dimensional space, we investigate solutions where interagent distances are as close as possible to desired one. We introduce a quadratic potential proportional to the error from the desired distance and equilibrium with non-null potentials are investigated. Stability of the behavior resulting from our protocol is described using elements from rigidity theory and final results are presented in form of numerical simulations.

General Electric (GE) developed ActivePoint* HMI (AP HMI) to increase plant operator efficiency and awareness. UCD was applied as a design process along with existing industry design guidelines and other design approaches. The goal of the evaluation study was to provide GE Power quantitative data on proposed benefits from the new HMI based on systematic design approaches compared to the legacy HMI product, developed by engineers with an ad hoc process. Compared to this Legacy HMI, the new AP HMI provides enhanced information architecture, simplified graphics and navigation, as well as improved alarm management allowing operators and plant maintenance personnel to focus on what is important. Nine operations staff from a power plant in France performed simulated tasks using both Legacy HMI as a baseline and AP HMI. We measured their performance and satisfaction on the use of HMI to quantify the enhanced effectiveness of AP HMI. AP HMI resulted in 33% higher success rate, 79% lower navigation time, 42% lower total time on task compared to Legacy HMI. Also, the user satisfaction for AP HMI was rated significantly higher than Legacy HMI.

HOM Writing, derived from Sutton Movement Writing and Shorthand [1], is a natural modality for encoding the movements that humans perform during various work activities. Beyond its use as a record of human movement, the intent is to use the writing as a modality of communicating to robots what movements to execute. Humanoid robots could directly map the key postures represented in the notation to their own postures, imitating the postures captured in the description, and calculating intermediate postures by interpolation. A motion generator would ensure the motor control needed to create continuous movements. This paper focuses on the generation of the activity movement scripts, and addresses two modalities of producing the scripts: 1) 'hand-coded' by a human, using an editor, and 2) automatic extraction from video, e.g. from video-recordings of a human performing an activity. A software tool developed to allow easy script writing, the HOM Editor, is described and illustrated in hand-coding of a sequence of movements. The automatic generation of scripts from video is done using the pose estimation system by Yang and Ramanan [2], which takes an image and produces the joint coordinates of the limb parts; this is illustrated with a task of moving and arranging chairs. The posture extraction from a video provided by a single camera may often lead to occlusions of body parts during activities in which objects are manipulated. We show the advantages of using an additional camera, which significantly increases the correct posture estimation, and discuss how to further improve the automatic generation of scripts.

RIMFAX will take radar soundings while the rover drives across the Martian terrain, which presents possible compatibility issues between rover and radar operations. In order to study this risk, a prototype RIMFAX antenna was attached to the flight-analogous rover Vehicle System Test Bed (VSTB) in a mechanically representative location. The prototype antenna collected spectral and time-domain data across a variety of driving operations in order to assess the radar sensitivity to rover generated noise. Conversely, the prototype antenna was driven while an engineering-model UHF antenna used for rover telecom measured received in-band power to ensure that the rover hardware was not at risk of damage. Evaluation of the data by the instrument science team showed that while rover noise was apparent to the receiver, data post-processing would yield >40 dB margin to the science requirements. Similarly, power levels received by the UHF antenna were well below damage thresholds.

CMDA provides tools to diagnostically analyze climate data for model validation and improvement, and to systematically manage analysis provenance for sharing results with other investigators. CMDA utilizes cloud computing resources, multi-threading computing, machine-learning algorithms, web service technologies, and provenance-supporting technologies to address technical challenges that the Earth science modeling and model analysis community faces in evaluating and diagnosing climate models. As CMDA technology and infrastructure have matured, we have developed the educational and scientific applications of CMDA. Educationally, CMDA supported the summer school of the JPL Center for Climate Sciences in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In the summer school, the students work on group research projects where CMDA provide datasets, analysis tools, and provenance support utility tools. Each student is assigned to a virtual machine with CMDA installed in Amazon Web Services. Scientifically, we have developed several science use cases of CMDA covering various topics, datasets, and analysis types. Each of the science use cases is described in terms of a scientific goal, datasets used, the analysis tools used, scientific results discovered, an analysis result such as output plots and data files, and a link to the corresponding analysis service call with all the input arguments filled.

The use of InSAR for this application presents a new approach and potential alternate technology to lidar with the advantage of wide-swath operation that is not hampered by cloud cover. We discuss the plans to leverage SnowEx for calibration, in particular characterizing potential biases due to interferometric penetration into the snow-cover by comparison with lidar and in situ measurements. In addition, lidar from the Airborne Snow Observatory will be used for validation of tree classifications and the derived digital surface models and snow-depth maps.

It is designed to measure the soil moisture over land using a combined active / passive L-band system. Due to the Aquarius mission, L-band model functions for ocean winds and salinity are already mature and may be directly applied to the SMAP mission. In contrast to Aquarius, the higher resolution and scanning geometry of SMAP allows for wide-swath ocean winds and salinities to be retrieved. We have found that the SMAP radiometer displays sensitivity all the way up to the most extreme wind speeds, possibly as high as 70 m/s, far beyond what is capable with typical C and Ku-band ocean wind scatterometers. In this work we use the Rapid Scatterometer (RapidScat) and Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) to further validate these SMAP radiometer-only high-wind speed retrievals.

The model leverages sparsity in signals and is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing. It is based on the basic principles of regularization and data fidelity with certain constraints using modern methods in variational optimization -namely total variation (TV), both L-1 and L-2 fidelity, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The main algorithm in this paper, TV-L-1, uses sparsity promoting energy functionals to achieve two important imaging effects. The TV term maintains boundary sharpness of content in the underlying clean image, while the L-1 fidelity allows for the equitable removal of stripes without over-or under-penalization, providing a more accurate model of presumably independent sensors with unspecified and unrestricted bias distribution. A comparison is made between the TV-L-1 and TV-L-2 models to exemplify the qualitative efficacy of an L-1 striping penalty. The model makes use of novel minimization splittings and proximal mapping operators, successfully yielding more realistic destriped images in very few iterations.

Since both missions provide Low Earth Orbit observation at the same frequency, inter-calibration of brightness temperatures measured from these two missions leading to a consistent Tb record is critical in order to have consistent and reliable science datasets. For a radiometer, stability testing and drift monitoring of measured brightness temperature are often performed by comparing measured Tb with estimated Tb using in-situ temperature measurement and/or higher frequency microwave observations. Therefore having one additional reference Tb measured by another radiometer will help characterize and calibrate a radiometer with higher accuracy and benefit both missions.

The wide coverage, fine temporal and spatial resolution, precise control of orbits and the free distribution policy bring more new chances than ever to earth observations applications. In this experiment we use Sentinel-1A data that covers a period of one year and a half (from November 2014 to June 2016) to study the ground movement of California Central Valley. Two different datasets were used and persistent scatterers interferometry technique was adopted for the time series analysis. The result indicates severe ground subsidence inside the study area, reaching a maximum rate of approximately 250 mm/yr at some locations.

The formulation is based on the PMCHWT surface integral equation which uses separate for air and ocean permittivities. The Sparse Matrix Canonical Grid (SMCG) is used to compute Method of Moments (MoM) solutions in conjunction with Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions with the surface electric field and surface magnetic field as the unknowns. Surface sizes used are up to 64 wavelengths by 64 wavelengths. Isotropic sea surfaces simulated using the Durden-Vesecky spectrum are studied for wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 10 m/s and incidence angles varying from 29 degrees to 46 degrees. Backscattering from NMM3D and composite two-scale model computations are compared with Aquarius satellite scatterometer estimates. Unlike the two-scale model, NMM3D does not impose separation between large scale roughness and small scale roughness elements. Results show that, in spite of using just the isotropic DV spectrum, NMM3D are in measurably better agreement with data than the composite surface model for co-polarized returns as well as the polarization ratio.

Despite recent advances in satellite monitoring techniques, dynamic wetland mapping needs to be improved for more accurate global inventories and also to monitor variabilities at sub-km scale over multiple decades. It has been shown that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Reflectometry (GNSS-R) signatures off inundated wetlands can be identified under different vegetation conditions including a dense rice canopy and a thick forest with tall trees, where optical sensors and monostatic radars provide limited capabilities. In this study, we will further investigate the capabilities of the GNSS-R technique for wetland monitoring from aircraft platforms.

Because wetlands are often difficult to observe in situ, remote sensing is the only viable way to map wetland extent globally. However, current remote sensing methods suffer limitations in capturing wetland extent, and more importantly, wetland dynamics at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. GNSS-Reflectometry could help fill the current observation gap, as experimental data show that ground-reflected GNSS signals are very sensitive to changes in inundated areas. Furthermore, because this technique only requires a custom developed receiver and antenna system, a constellation of such instruments can potentially be launched at relatively low cost, providing global observations at sub-daily intervals. One challenge remains, however, which is quantitatively formulating the geophysical product of reflections over the land surface in various states of inundation. Here, we use a novel reflection dataset, derived from the SMAP radar receiver, to elucidate the sensitivity of reflections to small land surface features and their seasonal variations. Additionally, we quantify the dynamic range of reflections over both open and closed wetlands, and suggest an algorithm for wetland type classification.

In particular, wetland ecosystems are often found in urban centers with dense populations and rapid changes. Wetlands provide opportunities to study impacts of rapid urbanization and expansion, climate effects and pollution. The outcomes of human activities directly impact wetlands through coupled human-natural processes, including activities such as agriculture, oil extraction and resulting land cover changes, as well as indirect effects across the entire global biosphere. Here we examine human impacts of the last several years on the La Ballona Wetland Complex in Los Angeles, California, and discuss how remote sensing techniques and modeling can provide better understanding not only for this important wetland area in a megacity but for other wetland areas in other parts of the world.

We develop a method for observations of these parameters using P-band signals of opportunity (SoOp) concept to measure the SWE. Effect of wet snow on the measurement is analyzed through modeling and it is found that for wet snow, the phase of the SoOp measurement becomes correlated to snow depth while for dry snow, phase is correlated to the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE).

The scattering matrix of the snowpack is directly obtained including both amplitude and phase. Both bistatic scattering coefficients and brightness temperatures of the snowpack are derived from full wave simulations. Simulation results demonstrate backscattering enhancement effects and coherent thin layer effects. The model is applied to study microwave signatures of the Arctic sea ice where the snow cover thickness has rapidly decreased. Microwave signatures are important in classification of sea-ice types and in quantitative characterization of snow cover properties. Both have strong impacts on the thermodynamics of sea ice. In the fully coherent model, a half-space dyadic Green's function is used in the volume integral equation to represent the effects of the underlying sea ice. Discrete dipole approximation is used to solve the volume integral equations, where parallel fast Fourier transform technique is utilized to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplications. The snowpack is represented as a bicontinuous medium. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the two horizontal dimensions to simulate an infinite lateral extent of the snowpack.

Supporting NASA SnowEx Remote Sensing Strategies and Requirements for L-Band Interferometric Snow Depth and Snow Water Equivalent Estimation	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		snow; differential interferometry; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); water resources	SLOPE	The objectives of this research are to (1) address remote sensing strategies and requirements for estimating snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) using existing L-Band interferometric data sets in coordination with field-based observations and modeling frameworks and, with this information, (2) inform the Next Generation Cold Land Processes Experiment (SnowEx) toward articulating the appropriate science and research questions for a single motivating science plan. As proposed, SnowEx is a multi-year airborne snow campaign with a primary goal of exploring multi-modal sensor observations in coordination with field campaigns to inform the next generation snow remote sensing satellite platform. Based on limitations of satellite-based optical and LiDAR instruments operating in regions of the globe with consistent cloud-cover, the fact that many snow-dominated regions are at more northerly latitudes (limited solar illumination in the middle of winter), and these snow-dominated regions often experience periods of prolonged cloud cover (due to synoptic precipitation events), a microwave remote sensing platform may be the most viable path to space for a dedicated snow remote sensing mission. Specifically, L-Band radar interferometry has shown some unique promise with an archive of historical and contemporary satellite collections from JAXA's PALSAR-1 and PALSAR-2 instruments, respectively. Moreover, with the expected NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission launch in 2020 and the unprecedented availability of dedicated global interferometric L-Band products every 12-days, as well as what is in essence a NISAR airborne simulator in JPL's UAVSAR platform, the L-Band interferometric approach to estimating snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) requires further investigation within the context of in-situ observations and modeling frameworks.

The fall 2016 campaign collected snow-free data using multiple in-situ and remote sensing platforms at two distinctly different sites in western Colorado: Grand Mesa (flat, high, partially forested plateau), and Senator Beck Basin (steep, complex sub-alpine and alpine mountain terrain). The ASO flies a scanning lidar and imaging spectrometer to measure snow depth and albedo. For the SnowEx snow-free campaign, the ASO surveys produced high-resolution digital surface models of the underlying terrain with full-waveform laser returns. These data will be used to calculate snow depths during subsequent winter surveys, and provide insight to the impact of forest canopy structure on snow accumulation and melt.

Based on theoretical modeling, the wave propagation constant in the snow is proportional to the snow density. It is shown that the phase change of reflected signal from snowpack has a quasi-linear dependence on SWE. The model has been extended to multilayer to accommodate the various vertical snow profiles. In addition, the P-band reflectivity is also sensitive to the change of root zone soil moisture. In the paper, we also shown the reflectivity calculated using coherent wave approach has excellent sensitivity to the change of soil moisture for moderate range of incidence angles. In order to validate the theoretical results, a proof of concept ground-based experiment is conducted at Fraser, CO since 2015.

The composition and properties of marine slicks dampens the short-wave field by both suppression of wave growth and increase in wave dissipation, through an increase in surface tension and a reduction in wind friction. There are, however, clear complications related to SAR marine slick detection. The first problem is that marine slicks may be confused on SAR imagery with areas of low wind and other low-backscatter ocean features such as air-sea temperature differences, rain, and freshwater plumes. The second problem is that there are two primary forms of marine slicks, one composed of biogenic material and the other related to mineral oils from natural seeps or oil spills largely from anthropogenic-related hazards. Biogenic oils, often called surface active agents or surfactants and/or natural films, occur in a thin monolayer and are highly viscoelastic oils that are a by-product of ocean plant and animal growth. Surfactants readily accumulate in convergent zones by internal waves and current/eddy fields, but are mixed into the upper ocean and rapidly disperse and disappear under windy conditions. The conundrum of detecting and isolating spilled mineral oil from biogenic films and other ocean forms of low backscatter areas has long been recognized by Werner Alpers, his students, and colleagues, and continues to this day. This rich experimental and theoretical legacy, largely focused on the use of radar and SAR, took on steam in the 1980s and continues to this day. This includes laboratory experiments, detailed examination of the properties of both mineral and biogenic slicks and the dampening effects on radar scattering, collection of radar and SAR imagery from ocean platforms, aircraft, the space shuttle, and satellites. The complications and difficulties of this seemingly relative simple notion of separating biogenic films and mineral oil, including as these materials interact with wind, waves, and currents and the use of all sorts of radar frequencies and polarizations collecting data from all over the world, continues to prove challenging in identifying a reliable methodology. In this study, we will review the past efforts of Professor Alpers and his continued influence on current efforts to clearly identify mineral oil and its properties within the vagaries of the ocean environment.

We conjecture that the results obtained from previous analyses of spaceborne polarimetric SAR data, which seem to show differences in the scattering mechanism between radar scattering from mineral oil films and biogenic slicks, result from instrument noise. Measurements carried out with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) of NASA/JPL, which has an extremely low noise floor, confirm this view and show that Bragg scattering theory applies also for scattering from mineral oil films. However, measured differences in the statistics of the radar backscattering from mineral oil films and biogenic slicks, may be real and not noise-related.

NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission, launched in January 2015, provides global retrievals of FT state every two to three days. Validating SMAP FT observations with in-situ observations is difficult due to the substantial scale mismatch between a point estimate and a satellite footprint, inducing "representativeness errors" in the in-situ observations. Triple collocation (TC) is a validation technique that addresses this problem by combining estimates from in-situ, model and spaceborne estimates to obtain error estimates for all three products, without assuming that any product is error-free. Unfortunately, it fails when applied to binary or categorical variables, such as landscape FT state. In this study, we use a new variant of TC - categorical triple collocation (CTC) - that can be applied to binary variables, to validate the SMAP FT product across northern land regions (> 45N).

In this paper, we developed a new floodwater detection algorithm based on SAR backscattered intensity using pre- and post-flood data observed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2, which provided very high-spatial-resolution L-band SAR images (PALSAR-2 SM1, 2.5 m spatial resolution) in the case of the Kinu River flood. With this algorithm, we first classified land use types in order to analyze the characterization of urban land surface backscatters. Change detection was then conducted for the pilot area using correlation coefficients based on differences in the magnitude of the backscattering intensity derived from building orientation before and right after the flood. In particular, the flooded building was more distinguishable than with a traditional detection method.

But, radar and radiometer receivers have yet to be integrated in an optimized manner for spaceborne systems. Fast sampling analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have been evolving to where we can consider in the 2025 time frame digitizing broad IF signals containing the desired radar signal, natural brightness emission and extraneous man-made RF signals (e.g. RFI) which can then be distributed and processed by radar and radiometer specific digital processors. In this way, a common RF front-end architecture can interface with an agile re-configurable backend and can be used across several systems (e.g. small, large class sensors). In this study, we designed and demonstrated a multipurpose receiver that can serve both the needs for the radar and radiometer, first focusing on Ka band.

Stress depends on the vector difference between wind and current. Using the unique capability of the scatterometer in measuring stress, we demonstrated that the effect of ocean surface stress associated with mesoscale eddies in spinning down the ocean eddies. The location of the stress centers is aligned with the temperature (buoyancy) centers at the surface. As we move away from the surface, other forces (pressure gradient) become increasingly important, and the wind centers are displaced from the surface stress centers, causing differences in wind and stress forcing of the ocean.

It uses image segmentation to spatio-temporally cluster the study region based on meteorological and land cover similarity, followed by a support vector machine based regression that computes the value of the high-resolution TB at all pixels. High resolution remote sensing products such as land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, precipitation, soil texture, and land-cover were used for disaggregation. The algorithm was implemented in Iowa, United States, from May to September 2016, and compared with the field observations of TB from Microwave Water and Energy Balance Experiment conducted as a part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAPVEX16-MicroWEX). Additionally, they were also compared with the Sentinel downscaled SMAP TB at 1km. High resolution soil moisture is subsequently derived from high resolution TB using inverse models.

Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band can capture spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture in the landscape. Both ESA and NASA have launched L-band radiometers, in the form of the SMOS and SMAP satellites respectively, to monitor soil moisture globally, every 3-day at about 40 km resolution. However, their coarse scale restricts the range of applications. While SMAP included an L-band radar to downscale the radiometer soil moisture to 9 km, the radar failed after 3 months and this initial approach is not applicable to developing a consistent long term soil moisture product across the two missions anymore. Existing optical-, radiometer-, and oversampling-based downscaling methods could be an alternative to the radar-based approach for delivering such data. Nevertheless, retrieval of a consistent high resolution soil moisture product remains a challenge, and there has been no comprehensive inter-comparison of the alternate approaches. This research undertakes an assessment of the different downscaling approaches using the SMAPEx-4 field campaign data.

This paper provides a summary of the quality assessment of its baseline soil moisture and freeze/thaw products as well as an overview of new products. The first new product explores the Backus Gilbert optimum interpolation based on the oversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer. The second one investigates the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer data using the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar ( AR) data to obtain soil moisture products at about 1 to 3 km resolution. In addition, SMAP's L-band data have been found useful for many scientific applications, including depictions of water cycles, vegetation opacity, ocean surface salinity and hurricane ocean surface wind mapping. Highlights of these new applications will be provided.

SMAP brightness temperature observations were compared with SMOS observations at 40 degrees incidence angle. The brightness temperatures from the two missions are not consistent and have a bias of about 2.7K over land with respect to each other. SMAP and SMOS missions use different retrieval algorithms and ancillary datasets which result in further inconsistencies between the soil moisture products. The reprocessed constant-angle SMOS brightness temperatures were used in the SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithm to develop a consistent multi-satellite product. The integrated product will have an increased global revisit frequency (1 day) and period of record that would be unattainable by either one of the satellites alone. Results from the development and validation of the integrated product will be presented.

VALIDATING SMAP SSS WITH IN SITU MEASUREMENTS	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		SMAP; Sea Surface Salinity; Argo float; moored buoy	SURFACE SALINITY; WIND	Sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieved from SMAP radiometer measurements is validated with in situ salinity measurements collected from Argo floats, tropical moored buoys and ship-based thermosalinograph (TSG) data. SMAP SSS achieved accuracy of 0.2 PSU on a monthly basis in comparison with Argo gridded data in the tropics and mid-latitudes. In tropical oceans, time series comparison of salinity measured at 1 m by moored buoys indicates that SMAP can track large salinity changes occurred within a month. Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from assessment of satellite retrieval. The resulting SMAP-buoy matchup analysis leads to an average standard deviation of 0.22 PSU and correlation coefficient of 0.73 on weekly scale; the average standard deviation reduced to 0.17 PSU and the correlation improved to 0.8 on monthly scale. SMAP L3 daily maps reveals salty water intrusion from the Arabian Sea into the Bay of Bengal during the Indian summer monsoon, consistent with the daily measurements collected from floats deployed during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project field campaign. In the Mediterranean Sea, the spatial pattern of SSS from SMAP is confirmed by the ship-based TSG data.

The sensitivity of ground-reflected GNSS signals to near-surface soil moisture, as recorded by spaceborne receivers	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		soil moisture; GNSS; GPS; bistatic radar; remote sensing		Spatial and temporal variations in near-surface soil moisture are important to measure for climate studies, numerical weather forecasts, and drought monitoring. Several previous studies have shown success in using ground-reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals as a form of bistatic radar to sense soil moisture. However, the ability of this type of data to sense soil moisture variations from space is still a nascent field of study. In the past two years, three satellites have been launched that were either designed to capture ground-reflected GNSS signals or have been modified to record these signals. The data provided by these satellites are giving scientists an unprecedented opportunity to investigate their ability to detect changes in Earth's land surface, including but certainly not limited to near-surface soil moisture. This paper will present spaceborne observations of ground-reflected GNSS signals and evaluate their sensitivity to near-surface soil moisture. This sensitivity will be compared to empirical and theoretical sensitivities of monostatic L-band radar measurements to soil moisture. We will also comment on possibilities for retrieval algorithm development, using techniques employed for monostatic radar as a guide.

In a recent report, the National Research Council developed a "value framework" for Earth observing systems with a focus on prioritizing NASA observations that merit long-term continuity. In this paper, we refer to this framework to discuss how high value observations arise from opportunistic use of signals generated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS. The increasing number of GNSS constellations internationally, likely to be permanently deployed, suggests that the geosciences community will benefit by adopting these signals for a variety of remote sensing needs. We describe recent progress in using these observations scientifically and developing technology to exploit them. We conclude that dedicated constellations of GNSS science instruments in low Earth orbit capable of receiving both direct and reflected GNSS signals will provide excellent science return in a broad range of areas, and constitute a high value Earth observing system.

It can also provide important information about the wave field, leading to development of more realistic wave models and therefore improving forecasts of wave setup and overtopping processes. Satellite altimeters have a long history of mapping the variability of the Earth's open ocean. However, this is not the case for coastal areas because of the limitations of technology and difficulties in processing and interpretation of data near coastal surface (due land contamination and rapid variations due to tides and atmospheric effects). There is, therefore, a need for more accurate Sea Surface Height (SSH) near coastal areas. Bistatic altimetry using signals of opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital communication signals) may provide additional measurements in coastal areas through oblique incidence angles and high bandwidth (400 MHz). In this study, we investigate the capabilities of SoOp technique for coastal altimetry from spaceborne platforms.

To address this need, the conically scanning Tropospheric Water and Cloud ICE (TWICE) millimeter and sub-millimeter radiometer instrument is being developed. A low-noise, power-efficient command and data handling (C&DH) subsystem has been designed to control TWICE data acquisition and other subsystems. The C&DH prototype board meets functional, noise and size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for deployment in a 6U-class satellite. Considering the limited power resources available on such platforms, a highly-efficient power regulation board has been designed to minimize power losses and reduce system noise. Furthermore, all of the components have been tested for radiation tolerance in low-Earth orbit.

Still, it has been little used due to the scarcity of long-term time-series of lidar measurements. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) is a landscape-level monitoring system that provides ongoing remote sensing measurements with high temporal resolution over large mountainous areas to quantify snow volume and dynamics. ASO collects multi-year low-resolution lidar data (similar to 1.5 pt/m(2)) with a nominal weekly frequency up to 12 times a year. In this work, we present a new method to automatically register ASO weekly low-resolution forest lidar point clouds in order to calculate spatially consistent datasets (similar to 18 pt/m(2)) adapted to fine scale forestry studies. Our method is tested using 12 lidar datasets acquired over the Tuolumne River Basin (California) in the spring and summer of 2014. On average, the ASO lidar system provides accurate measurements in terms of geolocation (0.38m and 0.12m for the horizontal and vertical dimension, respectively) but some datasets are biased up to 1.38m and 0.53m, respectively. Our registration method successfully corrected for systematic bias improving the 3D geometry of forest point clouds.
