Correlators for Synthetic Apertures in Space	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In this paper we analyze existing technology and simulate possible work flows to find the best hardware and data processing strategies for the position solving and correlation steps of space based radio arrays at various scales. Such arrays are composed of many free flying spacecraft, and accurate knowledge of their relative positions is necessary for proper data analysis. By using signals from existing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites, each individual spacecraft may record data that can be used to solve for precise orbit determination (POD) solutions to determine the relative propagation delays between each spacecraft pair. Any errors in the position are translated into phase error of the complex correlation data. The acceptable limits of error in position before harming the localization of the radio array are tested, using localization performance of SunRISE as a test case. This work help sets requirements for future space based arrays, particularly the quality of GNSS signal needed on each spacecraft as well as correlator capabilities. It is found that there are several feasible hardware and software combinations available today that could constitute a space based array, and recommendations are provided on which combinations would be well suited for various correlation strategies.

In this paper we document the analogy algorithms as well as summarize the results of the performance of the KNN and the principle components (PCA) cluster analogy models. KNN performance is assessed by varying the number of inputs and number of neighbors. Four different clustering methods: K-means, Spectral Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principle Components Analysis (PCA), and their respective evaluation criterion are described in detail.

The Tool for Architectural Tradespace Exploration and Refinement, or "TATER", will encompass a broad set of analyses covering the driving factors needed to describe and compare concepts, from trajectories and technologies to cost and risk assessment and science value. At the core of TATER is a spacecraft design model suite, which allows a single user to design a self-consistent spacecraft with limited information. TATER estimates mass, power, and cost at the subsystem level, key design metrics that can be used to assess a concept's likelihood of meeting requirements. Thus, TATER provides users with a quantified basis for comparing design options early in the concept maturity timeline, so that the most promising options can be identified and selected for further development. Built on a framework of intertwined analyses, TATER incorporates both analytical relationships and empirical scaling models. The data sources behind the empirical models include historical actuals, proposals, and established rules-of-thumb. Originally constructed in Phoenix ModelCenter, TATER now utilizes the JPL Integrated Modeling Environment (IME), a web-based software architecture developed in-house for JPL's concurrent engineering teams. This paper describes the TATER data structure and analyses in detail, including the required inputs and expected outputs from the spacecraft design model. Additionally, the results of verification and validation activities are presented, comparing the output of TATER to that of higher-fidelity design models. These results have revealed some areas to be improved, but demonstrate that TATER is ready for pilot use in early formulation studies for preliminary feasibility checks.

This system is designed to be packaged within a 12 U envelope and deliver approximately 800 m/s Delta V to a 25 kg spacecraft. The hybrid motor uses green propellants, specifically gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer and solid Poly(Methyl MethAcrylate) (PMMA), also known as acrylic, as the fuel. This propellant combination is separated by phase and is non-toxic and non-hypergolic, making the design well suited for use within a secondary payload where safety is paramount. The hybrid motor has high performance with an I-sp of approximately 300 s and is able to be re-ignited, enabling numerous maneuvers to be conducted. The system also provides thrust vector control during main motor operation and attitude control for reaction wheel un-loading during the science mission phase. A dedicated test program has been conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the past three years to progress this design towards flight and verify the design assumptions. This paper will summarize the results of this test program and the demonstrated performance of the motor. A path to progress this system towards flight shall also be discussed.

ECOSTRESS End-to-End Radiometric Validation	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) will measure the brightness temperature (BT) of plants from the space station. This information will be used to generate products such as evapotranspiration (ET) over an effective diurnal cycle to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stresses (i.e. lack of water, sun, nutrients). The imaging radiometer on board the ECOSTRESS payload provides five thermal infrared (TIR) spectral bands with approximately 70 m pixels and a nearly 400km swath. It incorporates many new technologies such as a high-speed Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) focal plane array (FPA), black silicon calibration targets, and a thermal suppression filter allowing shortwave infrared (SWIR) bandpass. This radiometer has two on-board blackbodies to maintain calibration every sweep of the scan mirror (1.29 s). The system has undergone an end-to-end test in a thermal-vacuum (TVAC) chamber showing excellent pre-flight radiometric results. This performance is in part enabled by newly developed, high-speed, low noise, readout electronics. The readout electronics converts all 32-analog channels to digital for downstream on board processing and downlink. Noise equivalent delta temperature (NE Delta T) measurements and BT retrievals are well within requirements. The optical modulation transfer function (OMTF) is also within specification. The instrument was launched on SpaceX CRS-15 along with the Latching End Effector for Canadaarm2 as well as three Biarri-Squad cubesats. ECOSTRESS passed In-Orbit Checkout (IOC). This is where all systems as well as science/calibration data are checked and verified to be operational. The payload is currently in Phase E operations. ECOSTRESS uses a local WiFi that sends data from the payload to the ISS. Data packets are then downlinked to the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) and subsequently archived in the science data system (SDS) servers. A series of calibration targets (Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea) have been utilized to verify the top of atmosphere radiometric integrity of the science data. Other geometrical targets such as the crop fields of California and a few large bridges around CONUS have been used to verify the geolocation accuracy when compared with previous data from (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) VIIRS and ASTER.

It can provide astrometric measurements of spacecraft orbiting planets and other objects in our solar system with subnrad precision (5 nrad = 1 milli-arcsec). These measurements can be used to create a time series of positions for solar system objects in the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame, which in turn can be combined with other data to refine the planetary ephemeris. An accurate solar system ephemeris is critical for interplanetary spacecraft navigation, dynamical studies and tests of gravitational theories, the analysis of pulsar timing observations, predictions of transits, eclipses, and occultations, and other applications. We are using VLBA observations of the Juno spacecraft in orbit about Jupiter to provide accurate positions for the Jupiter system barycenter for the ephemeris development group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, using observing and data reduction techniques developed for similar observations of the Cassini spacecraft while it orbited Saturn from 2004 until 2017. The VLBA observations of Cassini helped to improve the accuracy of Saturn's orbit by nearly an order of magnitude, and we expect that our observations of Juno will produce a similar improvement in our knowledge of Jupiter's orbit. Astrometric positions are particularly useful in constraining the orientation (inclination and longitude of ascending node) of an orbit, while range measurements are most useful in constraining the semi-major axis and ellipticity. Juno's orbit around Jupiter has a longer period than initially planned due to a concern about the spacecraft main engine. The resulting extended mission duration will improve our constraints on Jupiter's orbit inclination beyond that originally expected. Our VLBA observations of Juno are scheduled during approximately every third or fourth perijove pass. During these times the Juno spacecraft is continuously tracked by the Deep Space Network and the most precise solutions for the orbit of Juno about Jupiter are available. A good spacecraft orbit solution is needed to transfer our spacecraft sky positions to planet system barycenter positions. VLBA astrometry of planetary spacecraft has previously been applied to Mars orbiting space-craft, and will also be used during the OSIRISREx mission to improve the accuracy of the orbit of the potentially hazardous asteroid Bennu.

To reduce development costs and increase commonality among these traditionally custom-built receivers, the implementation team has developed a flexible architecture built primarily around commercial off-the-shelf hardware compliant with the Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (uTCA) specification and commercial high speed 10Gbit Ethernet switches. Custom firmware and software are being developed to perform the required signal processing functions needed to replace the legacy systems in a phased implementation approach which establishes a new digital Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal distribution system first, followed by implementations of various receiver functions as dictated by need. The first of these new receivers, the Open Loop Receiver, will come online in the Fall of 2018.

A NASA team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Ames Research Center (ARC) is leading and coordinating this program. A new propellant combination: the wax-based fuel, SP7, and MON-30 were proposed for a hybrid option for the MAV propulsion system several years ago.

By imaging and determining the location of decametric-hectometric (DH) radio bursts from 0.1 MHz-25 MHz, SunRISE would provide key information on particle acceleration mechanisms associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the magnetic field topology from active regions into interplanetary space. Six small spacecraft, of a 6U form factor, would fly in a supersynchronous geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) orbit within about 10 km of each other, in a passive formation, and image the Sun in a portion of the spectrum that is blocked by the ionosphere and cannot be observed from Earth. Key aspects that enable this mission concept are that only position knowledge of the spacecraft is required, not active control, and that the architecture involves a modest amount of on-board processing coupled with significant ground-based processing for navigation, position determination, and science operations. Mission-enabling advances in software-defined radios, GPS navigation and timing, and small spacecraft technologies, developed and flown over the past few years on DARPA High Frequency Research (DHFR), the Community Initiative for Continuing Earth Radio Occultation (CICERO), and the Mars Cube One (MarCO) missions, have made this concept affordable and low-risk. The SunRISE concept would involve utilizing commercial access to space, in which the SunRISE spacecraft would be carried to their target orbit as a secondary payload in conjunction with a larger host spacecraft intended for GEO.

The vault is a box structure made out of aluminum panels. The panels are roughly 10 mm thick in order to shield the electronics from the orbital total ionizing radiation around Jupiter. The vault requires an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of at least 70 dB in order to mitigate EMI with the spacecraft radar receiver. Overall, the vault accommodates four main types of penetrations: receptacle connectors, pass-through cables, fluid lines, and vent holes. More than 150 cables penetrate the vault panels to connect to electronic boxes inside. Fluid pipes enter and exit the vault to transfer heat to the rest of the spacecraft. Vent holes provide a path for air to escape from the vault during launch. Several novel penetrations designs were created to meet EMI and radiation shielding requirements. Receptacle connectors interface to the vault panels using 1.3 mm thick Ta10W plates. Pass-through cables penetrate the vault using aluminum clamshells after being wrapped with Teflon cushion tape, Kapton tape, and copper tape. Vent hole penetrations consist of a copper mesh for EMI shielding and an aluminum radiation shield bracket to direct air out of the vault during launch. Fluid lines terminate at the vault wall using mechanical fittings that resemble a nut and bolt interface. In addition, most mechanical seams and penetrations utilize EMI gaskets to ensure proper EMI shielding. To reduce risk and confirm that the vault penetration designs were appropriate for EMI shielding, an EMI chamber at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was used to test a mock-up vault panel with multiple variations of all four types of vault penetrations. This EMI SE test also incorporated different methods for bundling pass-through cables, and a comparison of flange mounted connectors versus jam nut connectors. A low noise preamplifier and a Rohde & Schwarz spectrum analyzer measured E-field levels transmitting through the mock-up vault panel. The results showed a shielding effectiveness of 77 dB for the mock-up vault panel, which exceeds the 70 dB target for Europa Clipper. Both the flange mounted connectors and jam nut connectors exhibited similar EMI SE results at the measured frequencies, and all variations of vault penetrations showed favorable EMI SE levels. Since the flight panels will be much larger and include many more penetrations, there will be testing of the flight vault to confirm its EMI SE is compliant with environmental requirements.

Athena's mobility system includes independent steering and driving motors for six wheels as well as wheel position sensors. The rover mobility system proved particularly challenging to model due to limited visibility into lower level wheel assembly hardware, a high degree of terrain interaction, and incomplete understanding of Athena behavior. However, even with simplified models, MONSID proved able to detect 16 distinct anomaly types during functional tests and simulated science activities carried out in JPL's Mars Yard. These faults included simulated and actual motor faults as well as instances of stalls due to terrain. Additionally, several detected faults were discovered during MONSID testing that were not anticipated. System characterization during the modeling process revealed several hardware and operational problems, leading to updates in Athena's control firmware and sensor processing software.

S	Kuhn, S			IEEE	Kuhn, Stephen			From Determinism to Emergence: Systems Engineering a Step Change in Execution on Mars	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Mars rover operators have traditionally controlled the execution of behaviors using meticulously compiled "master" sequences that enforce deterministic timing and ordering of activities. While the approach is effective at managing risk and complexity, it can be inefficient. Determinism demands conservatism in all things and is mitigated only at the cost of fidelity in ground modeling of flight behavior, an elusive goal. Direct manipulation, as well as inspection by mission operators of the automation layers used to build a schedule, is both feasible and time-consuming. The Mars 2020 rover mission plans to introduce a fundamentally different high-level scheduling and execution approach. Atomic activities are constrained by operators in time, resource usage, and a structure of state dependencies, from largely reusable first principles. The rover flight software will create and re-create a schedule of activities, responding to available energy, actual activity durations and execution status, observed temperatures, and other on-board state. The solution space of possible schedules is prohibitively large and probabilistic. Direct manipulation and inspection of automation are no longer possible on the shortened tactical timelines envisioned for the mission. Schedules are permitted and expected to change substantially as execution burns down the plan. Emergent behavior is accessible depending on the interaction of a given formulation of the plan with actual on-board state. The architecture must anticipate and provide capabilities in the flight software and/or ground tools to help steer emergence. It must leverage the facilities of a highly inherited system to the greatest extent feasible. It must function in that small sliver of computational capacity available in an already diminutive processor, lest it cannibalize from executing activities the efficiency it seeks to gain. This paper discusses the challenges and considerations in systems engineering the first planned autonomous high-level activity planner on Mars.

This paper describes the framework for this effort, plans for retiring key risks and progress to date. Three of the primary risks addressed under this effort are communications link reliability, scalability and electromagnetic compatibility. In this paper, we will discuss analysis and test methods used to investigate each of these areas.

As spacecraft size decreases, physical limitations present new challenges for mission designers. These include limited instrument aperture, low communications bandwidth, and reduced attitude control. Software techniques can address these limitations to retain the capabilities of larger spacecraft, in a small form factor. These techniques move the first order science analysis, which is traditionally completed on the ground, onboard the spacecraft. This can minimize the amount of data volume required for first order decision making. We present a collection of techniques designed for mitigating limited pointing stability for target acquisition, onboard image calibration and decision making, in a low bandwidth environment. These technologies will fly on the Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout) interplanetary CubeSat mission in 2019 [1]. To support verification and validation, the flight software implementations of these algorithms have been run on New Horizons, Rosetta and terrestrially acquired data sets. These experiments validate the capability to detect the target, through noise and target location uncertainty.

Digital Holographic Microscope Trades for Extant Life Detection Applications	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			VIKING; COMPACT; MARS	Optical microscopy is one of the key technologies needed for detection of extant life on other solar system bodies. Microscopic images can be used to identify the presence of cell-like objects and discriminate probable cells from other abiotic particles of similar scale through observations of morphology. Image sequences can be used to determine particle density through observation of Brownian motion, enabling discrimination of liquid-filled vesicles from solid mineral grains; non-Brownian motion that is also inconsistent with background flow can also indicate biotic particles. Phase-sensitive imaging modes allow measurement of index of refraction and can be used to image transparent cells that might otherwise require the addition of stains. Because of the likely limited energy available for replication on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, potential unicellular life would likely be present only at very low concentrations requiring a search through substantial volumes of material at very high resolution. We have been developing digital holographic microscopes (DHM) that addresses the need for high resolution search at low concentrations. Our DHM designs provide both the sub micrometer resolution necessary to detect the smallest forms of life and the high throughput needed to do so at very low concentrations. A significant feature of the holographic recording is that all objects in a large volume can be recorded simultaneously, without the need for focus or tracking to image individual objects. We have demonstrated two promising DHM architectures for possible use in potential future life detection missions-one using conventional optics and one using gradient index optics in a "lensless" arrangement. We compare the two designs, their trade spaces, and the features that might make each preferable for specific applications.	[Lindensmith, Christian; Serabyn, Eugene; Wallace, J.

Riders on the Storm: NASA InSight Lander and the 2018 Mars Global Dust Storm	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				On May 5, 2018, NASA's InSight spacecraft, carrying an international scientific payload with which to explore the interior of Mars, launched from Vandenburg AFB, California, and began its six-and-a-half-month voyage to Mars. Four weeks later, on June 3, 2018, a powerful regional Martian dust storm surged through Meridiani Planum and within days had left the 14-year-old Opportunity rover in darkness and generating insufficient solar power to operate. On June 10, Opportunity sent signals including information that the optical depth ("tau") of the thick dust blanketing the atmosphere was an all-time high ever measured from the Martian surface, at a value of 10.8. Then Opportunity soon afterwards experienced a power fault and ceased communicating with her ground controllers. By June 20, the storm had spread across the entire planet Mars, darkening the skies at Gale Crater where the Curiosity Rover had been ascending the foothills of Mount Sharp, on the opposite side of Mars from Opportunity. Record-setting, high atmospheric dust levels continued to be measured and reported by the Curiosity team, as the storm became global. Among those keeping daily tabs on the enormous storm that swiftly enshrouded the Red Planet were the InSight flight team of engineers and scientists, whose recently-launched spacecraft was functioning quite well in flight and now five and a half months away from an unchangeable landing date at Mars November 26, 2018. As our spacecraft hurtled through interplanetary space towards its destination, the InSight team took stock of the situation. Would this enormous dust storm still be raging when InSight arrived? What, if anything, had this storm changed in the assumptions made by InSight's design and test engineers about Martian atmospheric conditions for descending to the surface, or generating power there? Would InSight survive and carry out her mission?

It's the gold standard for the development and implementation of new technologies on NASA spacecraft, and originates from the idea that technologies that have flown can be expected to fly successfully again. While the risks associated with developing a new technology and using it in space are considered by NASA and most of the space community to have been retired by a first flight, there is no guarantee of reliability or success the next time the technology is used in space. In a recent paper, Straub [1] proposed establishing a TRL 10 level that indicates "proven technology demonstrated through extended operations". After extensive discussion on the need for this and the possible definition, he suggested that a TRL definition higher than 9 would be useful in recognizing and taking advantage of higher maturity space hardware. Multiple other papers have made the case that hardware that has flown successfully and essentially unchanged multiple times will certainly have higher reliability and lower implementation risk than single flight units. The Psyche mission provides a unique case for testing these arguments about higher maturity hardware and extending the TRL scale beyond TRL 9. NASA's Psyche mission is procuring the majority of its spacecraft bus from SSL's commercial communication product line, which features spacecraft components and technologies with tens to hundreds of successful flights. In many cases, multiple generations of this hardware have been matured based on lessons learned, which guarantees reliability greatly in excess of one-shot hardware. This paper takes another look at the development of the TRL scale, arguments for its extension, and its application to NASA missions in the light of the flight proven, highly reliable commercial hardware described in this paper. We propose two additional TRL levels adopting and refining prior efforts to define levels of hardware maturity beyond TRL 9. This allows NASA to recognize and utilize the benefits of more mature technologies to build better spacecraft that can reliably explore the solar system; better, faster and cheaper than ever before.

Plastic deformation heat generation and other mechanisms were then used as inputs to a separate model developed to compute biohazard mitigation. Considerable temperature increases capable of providing biological sterility for some, but not all of the Europa Clipper's spacecraft components is indicated.

Overview of the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) Concept Architecture	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) is one of four large mission studies commissioned by NASA for the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astrophysics. HabEx has identified three driving science goals: 1) to seek out nearby worlds and explore their habitability, 2) to map out nearby planetary systems and understand the diversity of the worlds they contain, and 3) to enable new explorations of astrophysical systems from our solar system to galaxies and the universe by extending our reach in the UV through near-IR. To achieve these goals, the HabEx study has baselined a space telescope at Sun-Earth L2, with a 4 m aperture and four science instruments - a coronagraph, a starshade, a high resolution UV spectrograph, and a multi-purpose, wide-field camera. The second part of the observatory is an external starshade occulter of 52 m diameter. To achieve the precision and stability required for the coronagraph to image earth-sized exoplanets to better than 10(-10) contrast, the telescope flight system is equipped with a vector vortex coronagraph and colloidal electrospray microthrusters. The telescope takes advantage of the mass and volume launch capability of NASA's SLS Block 1B delivery system with a separate launch for the starshade on a smaller vehicle. In this paper, we provide an overview of the HabEx telescope flight system that would advance astrophysical science in the same spirit as the Hubble Space Telescope well into this century.

R.; Woerner, David F.; Caillat, Thierry; Pinkowski, Stanley			A Status Update on the eMMRTG Project	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA has employed Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) to power many missions throughout the past several decades. The Multi-Mission RTG (MMRTG) used on Mars Science Laboratory is the most recent generator developed, and the only spaceflight-qualified system currently available. The enhanced Multi-Mission RTG (eMMRTG) would be an upgrade of the MMRTG using the most current thermoelectric (TE) technology, and would provide the space community with a system that would have substantially higher end-of-design-life (EODL) power. The NASA RPS Program recently instantiated an eMMRTG system development project, evolving from an ongoing technology maturation effort at JPL to a project designed to mature and transition the skutterudite (SKD) TE couples and technology into an operational RTG. The project has made significant advances in maturing SKD technology for use in the eMMRTG, and is looking ahead to potential RTG system development. Mini-module and couple life tests have produced substantial performance data that has helped refine the couple design and support lifetime performance predictions. Additional strength and thermoelectric properties tests have been performed to verify the design specifications and robustness of the candidate TE couples. Replacing the current MMRTG couples with SKD also necessitates system design changes that must be well understood. Recent systems engineering studies have focused on minimizing risk associated with updating the flight-proven MMRTG design. Upgrading the module insulation has been shown to result in 98% lower levels of CH4/H2 outgassing products. Performance analysis has been completed using the most recent TE couple sizes in order to understand the maximum acceptable power degradation rate to achieve the required eMMRTG power of 77 W at EODL. This paper provides an update on recent SKD technology maturation efforts and the results of several systems engineering tasks that continue to pave the way for successful system development.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in collaboration with Caltech, is actively developing a tethered mobile robot, Axel, for traversing and exploring extremely steep terrain, such as Recurring Slope Lineae on Mars and vertical pits on the Moon. However, on Mars, where landing-site ellipses are large due to the presence of an atmosphere, Axel may need to traverse several kilometers from its lander untethered given its finite tether carrying capacity (similar to 300 m). This paper proposes a novel design for a hybrid mobility system that allows a pair of Axel rovers to dock, lock, and drive long distances as a four-wheeled, articulated steering vehicle. The design improves upon prior efforts to achieve DuAxel mobility by leveraging two actuated docking mechanisms attached on opposite ends of a central module to enable 'sit/stand' functionality; the prior DuAxel system was limited to skid steering, which was inefficient due to Axel's grouser-style, high-friction wheels. In the proposed system, the 'sit' configuration is achieved by aligning each dock parallel to the surface, allowing one Axel to detach and explore while the other remains docked and serves as a backup. While 'sitting', the central module rests on the ground and is outfitted with shovel-style wedges for passive anchoring to sandy terrain ( an optional drill can be integrated for anchoring to rock). In order to 'stand', the exploring Axel reattaches, locks, and both docks are rotated until Axel's tether caster arm is upright and the central module is lifted off the ground. Once upright, each Axel rotates about a pivot point for articulated, all-wheel steering, which is accomplished by applying differential wheel torques. The main contributions of this paper are i) a detailed systems design of the docking mechanism and central module, ii) kinematic modeling of articulated mobility and 'sit/stand' docking functionality, and iii) initial testing in a relevant environment to characterize the mobility of the proposed system.

A Flight-Traceable Cryogenic Thermal System for Use in a Sample-Capture Flux-Pinned Interface	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			LEVITATION; FORCE; RECONFIGURATION; STIFFNESS; MAGNET	Flux-pinned interfaces for spacecraft have been studied for almost a decade for their dynamic properties that allow designers to shape the dynamic behavior of spacecraft relative to one another. However, the efficacy of these interfaces hinges on the requirement that the type-II superconductors in the interface first be cooled below their critical temperature in the presence of a magnetic field, then held below their critical temperature for the duration of the dynamic interaction. Ground-based research often relies on consumable liquid nitrogen to cool the superconductors, but little work has been published on a flight-traceable cryocooler-based solution to meet the thermal constraints. This work provides estimates of the mass, power, and performance of a system to facilitate trade studies for potential spacecraft applications. This paper details a thermal system designed to cool three 16 mm thick, 56 mm diameter Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide disks to below their critical temperature of 88 K for a ground-based testbed. Data collected on the device shows that it successfully provides the thermal environment required for the flux-pinned interface while consuming 105 W of power. A thermal model accurately predicts heat flows and temperatures in the device. This model applied to a space environment predicts a power consumption of 67 W in a space-flight device.

Planetary surface temperature range of -135C to +40C dictate that electronics packaging solutions provide resiliency to large thermal excursions to counteract mismatches in the coefficient of thermal expansion in the myriad of materials found within space born electronics. The Mars2020 Enhanced Engineering Cameras (EECAMs) are a collection of medium-and wide-angle cameras used across the Mar2020 Flight System. The EECAMs use a commercial off the shelf (COTS) image sensor [1] packaged in a 143-pin Ceramic Pin Grid Array (PGA). Early in the EECAM development, breadboard camera electronics that used conventional thru-hole soldering techniques was subjected to limited thermal cycling to investigate packaging survivability in Martian surface thermal environments from -135C to +70C. Functional testing following 2000 cycles showed that the detector was inoperable. Visual inspection of the part exhibited sever solder joint cracking in a substantial number of pins, and in some cases resulted in complete sheering of the pins from the ceramic package substrate. We will present the steps taken to derive the thermally-resilient electronics packaging design of the Mars2020 EECAM detector. We will highlight analyses and empirical test results that lead to a wide-temperature-survivable COTS component packaging design. Details of thermal cycle testing, in-process inspections, and final packaging design will be presented.

Automated Spacecraft Operations During Soil Moisture Active Passive Prime Mission	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Autonomy and automation of spacecraft operations have been long sought goals to reduce costs and risks. Many different approaches depending on the particular mission's needs and characteristics have been tried and taken. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is a science spacecraft mission measuring soil moisture, freeze/thaw and other parameters on a global scale, to support weather forecasting, disaster response and climate research. The spacecraft is fairly conventional and is in a sun synchronous near-polar low Earth orbit. The sole instrument is an L-band passive radiometer; the active radar component is currently inoperative. Automation is a characteristic feature of SMAP flight operations. The project practices "lights-out" operations, where the control room is not staffed, except for occasional real time or contingency activities. Operators nominally work only during regular business hours. Activities are planned and set up on a weekly cadence, and automated processes conduct data processing and commanding. Continuous downlink monitoring is enabled by a sophisticated notification architecture, along with weekly telemetry review by experts. A suite of tools and processes are used to implement the automation. Other tools and resources, while not strictly speaking automation, improve efficiency and reliability, which fundamentally achieve the same benefits as automation. As might be anticipated, there are challenges with a complex ground system that link together many disparate elements. On balance, spacecraft operational costs are estimated to be much lower than if the mission was flown in a conventional manner. In summary, the overwhelming majority of commanding during science phase are performed autonomously, without direct human intervention. A very low command error rate was achieved. It is proposed this concept of operations may serve as a useful model for future missions with similar characteristics.

[1] Mars 2020 will also demonstrate technologies needed to enable future human expeditions to Mars. Utilizing the groundbreaking entry, descent, and landing (EDL) architecture pioneered by the MSL, [2] [3] Mars 2020 will launch in July 2020 and land on Mars in February 2021. Like its predecessor, Mars 2020 will deliver its rover payload to the Martian surface through the use of Apollo-derived entry guidance, a 21.45 meter supersonic Disk-Gap-Band parachute, a Descent Stage powered by throttleable Mars lander engines, and the signature Sky Crane maneuver. While Mars 2020 inherits most of its EDL architecture, software, and hardware from the MSL, a number of changes have been made to correct deficiencies, improve performance, and increase the robustness of the system. For example, Mars 2020 will take advantage of the favorable atmospheric conditions of the 2020 launch opportunity to deliver a larger and more capable rover than has landed on Mars to date. A primary focus in developing the Mars 2020 EDL system has been mitigating residual risks identified after the landing of the MSL. The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiment (ASPIRE) was performed to address new concerns about the stresses experienced by parachute canopies during inflation. Other risk reduction activities include investigating possible interactions between the parachute deployment system and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) which could lead to IMU saturation, researching the effects of airborne dust on radar ground measurements, and site-specific gravity modeling for improved fuel usage. Several enhancements were added for Mars 2020 to improve performance. The addition of Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) allows the system to land at sites with more hazardous terrain, enabling scientists to select from locations which have previously been considered inaccessible. Mars 2020 will utilize a Range Trigger for initiating parachute deployment, which reduces landing ellipse sizes by 40% compared to the Velocity Trigger approach used on the MSL. New EDL Camera hardware will capture high resolution and high frame rate images and videos of key events, such as parachute deployment and rover touchdown. Finally, the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2) sensor suite will build upon the successful MSL MEDLI experiment with the addition of heatshield pressure sensors tuned for the supersonic flight regime and backshell instrumentation. The team has faced new and unexpected challenges throughout development. Notably, the failure of the flight heatshield during a static load test has prompted the fabrication of a new unit. Also, in accommodating the first ever Mars Helicopter under the rover belly pan, the EDL design has been further constrained by reduced ground clearances. Despite these challenges, much of the EDL-related hardware and software have already been delivered, and the EDL verification and validation program is on track to be completed on schedule prior to launch in July 2020.

Like all samples that have been returned from the Moon, the Apollo 11 samples were collected from the lunar regolith, a layer of jumbled and pulverized rocks that blankets and obscures the Moon's bedrock geology. When geologists reconstruct the history of the Moon, these samples are like scattered puzzle pieces, each representing important information, but removed from the context of their formation and isolated from the bigger picture of how the Moon's crust was formed. The goal of Moon Diver is to return to Mare Tranquillitatis, taking advantage of the discovery of a natural pit cave entrance exposing a deep cross-section through both the lunar regolith as well as tens of meters of bedrock lava layers. Collecting information on the chemistry, mineralogy, and morphology of these intact bedrock layers would allow us to investigate where rocky crusts come from, how they are emplaced, and the process by which they are transformed into the regolith layer that we see from space. In doing so, the mission would combine the deep knowledge gained by Apollo with the unprecedented in situ access to secondary crust granted by the lunar mare pit to understand these fundamental processes on the Moon, and to use this knowledge as a keystone for understanding the same processes across the Solar System. The success of the Moon Diver concept hinges on accessing the subsurface. The existence of the mare pit provides a cross-section through the lunar maria. Access to the record exposed in the wall of this pit is provided by two critical space technologies: pinpoint landing (allowing the delivery of the payload close to the pit) and extreme terrain mobility (allowing the delivery of capable instruments to the cliff wall). Pinpoint landing is a closed-loop guidance and navigation capability that repeatedly matches visual features from a downward-facing camera to a priori acquired terrain maps. This body-relative navigation is then used with closed-loop control to guide the spacecraft toward its landing target, yielding a tight landing ellipse. Once on the surface, an extreme-terrain robotic explorer, called Axel, would egress from the lander and traverse tens of meters to the pit. The lander provides mechanical support, power and communication to the rover through its umbilical tether. Anchored to the lander, the two-wheeled, tail-dragger rover would pay out its tether as it traverses toward the pit. With the aid of its 300-meter tether, the rover can traverse the steep slopes of the pit funnel and rappel its vertical walls. The rover carries a surface preparation tool together with a suite of three instrument types: (a) a trio of high-resolution cameras (Mars 2020's EECAMs) for acquiring context images of the near and far walls with the near-wall pair in a stereoscopic configuration, (b) an alpha-particle-X-ray Spectrometer (MSL's APXS) for elemental composition, and (c) a multispectral microscopic imager (MMI) that uses controlled lighting for minerology. The surface-preparation tool removes dust and patina that may be present on the rock wall by grinding a small area. The surface-preparation tool, the MMI and the APXS would be deployed from their instrument bays in one of the wheel wells. The rover would independently point each of its instruments at the same target of interest on the wall with millimeter-level repeatability. Confidence in the technologies of pinpoint landing and extreme-terrain access is based on helicopter testing of terrain-relative navigation and field testing of extreme terrain mobility respectively. The latter was tested using Axel rover prototypes with integrated science instruments at multiple terrestrial analog sites including a basaltic pit in Arizona. Landing shortly after sunrise, the surface mission timeline is just shy of a lunar day (14 Earth days). Upon landing, the rover would egress from the lander, traverse toward the pit, descend along the pit funnel and rappel down its wall. Throughout its traverse, the rover would acquire multiple measurements of both regolith and mare layers. After descending to the bottom of the layers, the rover will reach a significant overhang. This void space may open into a large cave or lava tube, which could someday provide a protected location for a lunar base. For these reasons, lunar pits provide an exciting new target for lunar exploration.

Model-based fault diagnosis (MBFD) is an approach to estimating a spacecraft's health state by continuously verifying accurate behavior and diagnosing off-nominal behavior. Proper functioning of MBFD depends on 1) the quality of the diagnostic system model that is analyzed and compared to commands and onboard measurements to estimate a system's health state, and 2) the correct functionality of the diagnosis engine interrogating the model and comparing its analyses to observed system behavior. Our goal is to develop Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques for a MBFD system to provide the necessary confidence in its ability to estimate the health of on-board spacecraft components and systems accurately and precisely. Our effort is investigating two areas. First, we build on our previously-reported work in developing techniques for checking the correctness and completeness of MBFD systems. Second, we develop techniques for analyzing performance characteristics of MBFD systems (e.g., runtime, memory usage) to provide assurance that they will function within the resource-constrained environments found on spacecraft. This paper describes work we have done in both areas. For the first area, we describe our approach to developing formal definitions for a correct and complete fault diagnosis system, the application of those definitions to a systematic way of checking the correctness and completeness of a diagnostic model independently from the diagnosis engine, and the results of these checks. We also discuss the ways in which V&V techniques are related to our correctness and completeness checking techniques for a MBFD system development process. For the second area, we develop analytical expressions as functions of key parameters to estimate runtime/processing performance bounds. In parallel, we define various model structures (topologies) to enable parameterized testing to determine how specific parameters affect performance, providing a way to identify the significant contributors. These analyses lay the foundation for developing techniques and tests for evaluating false-positive and false-negative metrics, which are used to characterize MBFD diagnosis performance.

At present, models for mixed-signal components do not include significant temperature dependence, ADCs in particular. By developing comparatively generic models that are cold-capable, the ability to integrate mixed-signal parts into a larger system greatly increases. We have focused on Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) because of their widespread, critical usage in avionic subsystems and lack of available cold macro models. This paper provides an overview of testing and modeling of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) ADC across cryogenic temperature for the purposes of trend identification, performance prediction and reliability scoping with possible post-correction capability. The development of this model will hopefully permit greater integration of commercial components in larger avionics systems, decreasing development time while increasing flexibility of designers when trying to meet mission objectives.

Overview of the ASPIRE Project's Supersonic Flight Tests of a Strengthened DGB Parachute	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiments (ASPIRE) project is aimed at developing and exercising a capability for testing supersonic parachutes at Mars-relevant conditions. The initial flights for ASPIRE were targeted as a risk-reduction activity for NASA's upcoming Mars2020 mission. For this effort, two candidate Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute designs were tested at Mach number and dynamic pressure conditions relevant to Mars2020. The two parachutes under investigation were a build-to-print version of the DGB used by the Mars Science Laboratory and a strengthened version of this parachute that has the same geometry but differs in materials and construction. The first flight test (SR01) of the build-to-print parachute took place on October 4, 2017, followed by the first test of the strengthened parachute during flight SR02 on March 31, 2018. A second test of the strengthened parachute with a higher target load, SR03, took place on September 7, 2018. During the SR02 test, a Terrier-Black Brant sounding rocket delivered a payload containing the packed 21.5-m parachute, the deployment mortar, and the ASPIRE instrumentation suite to a peak altitude of 54.8 km. As the payload descended back towards the Atlantic Ocean the strengthened parachute was mortar-deployed at a Mach number of 1.97 and a dynamic pressure of 670 Pa, and produced a peak load of 55.8 klbf. During the SR03 flight, the strengthened parachute was deployed from an identical test platform at a Mach number of 1.85 and a dynamic pressure of 932 Pa, and produced a peak force of 67.4 klbf. This paper describes ASPIRE's two sounding rocket flight tests of the strengthened parachute: SR02 and SR03. It provides an overview of flight operations, test conditions, the data acquired during testing, the techniques used for post-flight reconstruction, and the reconstructed performance of the test vehicle and parachute system for each flight.

A Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) concept for launching samples off of Mars, and delivering them to orbit for further transport to Earth may utilize hybrid propulsion due to the option's predicted favorable low temperature characteristics and high performance. However, the hybrid option is still undergoing technology development to demonstrate these benefits. Once development of a capable hybrid propulsion system is proven, further work will still be required. This will include environmental testing relative to the mission, and integration with the vehicle reaction control systems and payload. Qualification of such a system will be a significant effort. It will require specialized procurements for the propellants and environments involved, and further testing of the unique design. This paper details an estimate of the tasks required to complete development efforts from Technical Readiness Level 5 (TRL 5) through qualification. A success based program was formulated to reach the required performance metrics sufficient for a standard Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Using task level inputs from team members cost and schedule were conceived for continued progress to Critical Design Review (CDR), then through Qualification.

To date, this is the best pointing on a spacecraft of its size. This paper will analyze various aspects of the performance of its key piece of hardware-the payload. First, a model of the optics and imager, which is used to simulate stellar images, will be presented. The imager parameters used in this model were derived from simple ground measurements. Next, a centroiding algorithm is provided and used on the simulated images to predict centroiding performance. These results will be shown to match on-orbit telemetry of centroiding performance, validating the modeling approach. This paper will then describe an approach for and results of a geometric camera calibration algorithm to estimate the focal length, distortion, and alignment parameters.

The motivation for this paper is to investigate methods to tailor the impact of safing events for spacecraft of different classes, destination, duration, and other categories of interest. Modeling spacecraft inoperability due to a spacecraft entering safe mode could enable mission planners to more effectively manage spacecraft margins and shape design and operations requirements during the conceptual design phase. This paper contributes to the area of safing event modeling by using available datasets to develop various distributions of frequency and recovery durations of safing events for interplanetary spacecraft missions. A safing event dataset compiled by JPL is first split into multiple subsets based on various mission classifiers. Using a previously developed mission simulation framework, a distribution of the likelihood of inoperability rates is computed through a Monte Carlo simulation. Three main safing event model types are formulated, implemented, and compared in this paper: a single Weibull distribution, a mixture of two Weibull distributions, and a Gaussian Process model. For each model type, two distributions are incorporated into the mission simulation framework: time-between-events and the recovery duration of a safing event. By specifying appropriate parameters in the mission simulation framework and Gaussian Process model, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted for a solar-electric Mars orbiter similar to the proposed Next Mars Orbiter. Mission implications from simulated outage times and safing events by each model could motivate greater operability, faster fault resolution by operations teams, and greater system margins. By incorporating Gaussian Process models into a mission simulation framework, a process is established by which historical mission data may be incorporated and used to model future safing events for interplanetary mission concepts. This enables mission planners to make more informed decisions during spacecraft development.

In these models, we have included wind models used for Titan simulation, and extrapolated wind gust models previously used for simulation in the Martian environment. We have also developed guidance and control techniques for autonomous parafoil turning in the adverse wind environment. Finally, and in order to improve the controller performance by reducing the uncertainty to environmental factors, we have also developed ways to estimate the Titan environmental parameters, i.e. the atmospheric density, and the wind magnitude, during the descent. A more complete and realistic simulation is being developed, which uses JPL's DSENDS Entry, Descent, and Landing Software framework.

For flyby spacecraft to obtain accurate data during short windows with high relative velocities, target motion compensation is often required to preserve signal amplitude and prevent pixel smear. Effects of orbital determination errors, pointing accuracy error, and timing errors are exacerbated by use of target motion compensation to varying degrees. A Monte Carlo simulation was developed to determine trends in smear and required target motion capabilities for various flyby geometries, velocities, and exposure times for a selection of Jovian and Saturnian moons of exploratory interest. Case studies are presented for a range of potential missions and their simulation results compared to show variation in errors based on differences in input parameters. Results from the simulation can inform early choices in instrument and mission design, operations and mission planning.

The Probabilistic Asteroid Impact Risk (PAIR) software tool is currently being used to model the consequences associated with this natural hazard. Given that initial orbital solutions for a threatening asteroid are subject to uncertainties, the projected impact locations can cover a large area on the Earth's surface, called the impact corridor. The impact corridor not only provides information about the extent and general shape of the exposed area, but also represents a spatial projection of the impact probability distribution on the surface of the Earth. Spatial impact probability information is crucial for asteroid risk assessment, which combines impact consequences and impact probability. While PAIR is currently capable of estimating the impact consequences for a given impact scenario, including a probabilistic representation of the impact corridor will crucially extend its utility in asteroid risk analysis. Here, we present an approach to derive the impact corridor from an initial orbital solution that provides a position and velocity state vector in Cartesian coordinates with a corresponding covariance matrix. Using a Monte Carlo method, a finite set of impact points is generated by sampling the orbital solution state space and propagating the sampled orbits to the ground. The set of impact locations is subsequently used to construct the impact corridor in continuous form on the ground. An analytical or numerical approach may be used to construct the impact corridor from a set of impact points. The analytical approach requires fitting of a probability density function to the impact location set to determine a spatial impact probability distribution. On the other hand, the numerical approach estimates the spatial impact location density at each position in the affected area and scales this information to represent impact probability. The two schemes are compared for their practical applicability within the PAIR tool. The capability to calculate probabilistic impact corridors from orbital data within the PAIR model will enable it to support additional asteroid risk analysis applications, such as risk-informed design for mitigation missions or evaluation of civil response strategies.

The platform would uses common multi-rotor propellers enclosed in a spherical shell to produce the necessary forces to roll on the ground and fly. The proposed platform would be able to achieve (a) multi-modal locomotion (fly and roll) for increased energy efficiency, (b) collision resiliency due to its impact-resistant structure, and (c) high-level of controllability due to three-dimensional actuation. This work focuses on the preliminary design trade-offs, analysis and feasibility assessment of the platform. First, a dynamic model of the robot that considers interaction with the ground is developed. Second, a control architecture for flying and rolling is proposed and evaluated in simulation. Finally, a discussion on the energy efficiency of the flying and rolling mobility modes via leveraging a derived dynamic model of the power consumption is provided.

To search for microbial life, 3-d imaging microscopes are needed that can efficiently search through sizeable liquid volumes for particles with signs of cellular structure and morphology, as well as to examine motilities. Our 3-d digital holographic microscopy approaches have been described earlier; that technique can provide sample amplitude and phase information across a volume. On the other hand, fluorescence imaging can provide complementary chemical information, and fluorescence light-field microscopy (FLFM) is an emerging approach to 3-d fluorescence imaging. Here we describe a 3-d FLFM imager concept, with the ultimate goal of combining both microscope types into a multi-mode microscope for lander instrument packages. Light-field imaging is a technique that can be used to refocus to different depths without mechanical refocusing. This technique generally results in lower resolution than standard imaging, but compensates with the ability to refocus to planes well beyond the normal depth of field. However, when imaging sparse, point-like fluorescent signals, or when simultaneous higher-resolution 3-d images of the entire field are available with a complementary 3-d microscope, such as, e.g., a digital holographic microscope, the finest spatial resolution may not be necessary for the light-field fluorescence microscope. In this paper, we first consider the parameters describing a light-field microscope, in order to be able to optimize them to our application. Refocusing to different sample planes is then modeled with a simple ray-trace algorithm. Our goal is to reach a suitable compromise between spatial resolution, field of view, and depth of field within a coincident volume of view for the fluorescence microscope and the digital holographic microscope. Even without the use of super-resolution techniques, lateral and axial resolutions on the order of several microns are possible, across a field of view on the order of a millimeter and a depth of field of a few tenths of a millimeter, both of which are comparable to the values obtained with our digital holographic microscopes. Finally, we describe a prototype fluorescent light-field microscope benchtop setup with which we have carried out initial laboratory demonstrations.

NISAR will provide a means of disentangling and clarifying spatially and temporally complex phenomena on Earth, ranging from ecosystem disturbances, to ice sheet collapse and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides. NISAR is a joint partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The NASA L-SAR and ISRO S-SAR Radar instruments will provide global and complementary datasets with a 12-day repeat cycle, for addressing compelling scientific questions in the fields of Solid Earth deformation, Ecosystems and Cryospheric sciences. The prime Science Phase for NISAR will be three years in duration. Prior to beginning the Science Phase, all the observatory elements, including the spacecraft bus, the Radar payload instruments, the JPL Engineering Payload and the Reflector Boom Assembly will be checked out during the In-Orbit Checkout or Commissioning Phase, which will last for 90 days after launch. During the Commissioning Phase, there will be a step-by-step buildup in capability to full observatory operations, starting with 'Initial Checkout', 'Reflector Boom Assembly Deployment,' 'Spacecraft Checkout' and finally 'Instrument Checkout'. Updates made to the NISAR Commissioning timeline in the Project's Phase C have focused on further refinement of the Instrument Checkout phase in particular. During this phase, both the L-SAR and S-SAR instruments will be powered on, their performance will be characterized and calibrated, initial calibrations will be performed to develop calibration strategies and demonstrate the instruments are 'calibratable' in the following 5 months of Science Calibration/Validation phase during nominal science operations. Initial power-on and calibration activities for L-SAR and S-SAR have been interleaved in the timeline. In addition, investigations of the ground processing activities (for example, data processing, data analysis, uplinks, downlinks) to be performed in between successive calibrations are currently underway. Allocating sufficient time for these ground-in-the-loop activities is critical to the development of a realistic timeline with a healthy margin.

Currently, many space missions are limited by memory capacity as there is not enough onboard memory to store the copious amounts of data obtained in a single space mission. Onboard memory systems must also be capable of providing the necessary operational robustness and fault tolerance based on system and mission requirements. Some mission requirements may include data-intensive operations such as terrain navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning, and onboard science data processing. Thus, space missions require onboard memory that has high bandwidth, high capacity, and high reliability to securely store recorded data when exposed to space radiation. To meet the aforementioned necessities, various designs of memory cubes that make use of horizontal integration of memory dies have been proposed. However, these methods require high design effort and a long lead time. Alternatively, a loaf-of-bread (LOB) design using vertical integration of DDR3 SDRAM dies has recently been proposed. Straightforward access to each individual die from the memory controller is possible in the LOB design due to the vertical integration of the dies which allows Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) dies to be used, reducing cost and lead time for designers. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively increase data storage for onboard memory while reducing the cost and effort that goes into design by presenting a 3D memory cube design utilizing 24 COTS NAND flash dies in a LOB configuration. The design includes various features that increase the data storage available while considering hazards specifically in space environments such as errors from single event effects (SEE) or single event functional interrupt (SEFI) events. Currently, the preliminary RTL code is ready with support for NAND Flash commands, error-correcting codes (ECC), and scrubbing. Features such as wear leveling, bad block management, data scrambling and a serial rapid IO (SRIO) interface to further mitigate errors due to radiation effects in the space environment will be incorporated in the future. The functionality of the memory controller has been verified via simulation of the RTL code. Further validation and testing using a FPGA board are also underway to verify the design at this stage. Therefore the proposed design addresses the need for increased memory storage while also allowing COTS dies to be used. This paves way for reduced design efforts as well as the incorporation of state-of-the-art memory dies in space missions.

Peter			Cryobotics: Extreme Cold Environment Testing of Strain Wave Gear Sets	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In designing and building equipment to operate in extreme environments, including cryogenic temperature conditions, realistic performance testing is essential. The technology focus area, cryobotics, concerns robotic systems and rotating machinery that must operate at cryogenic temperatures in environments that include Earth, low Earth orbit, Mars, Moon, asteroids, Solar orbit, planetary orbit, or those encountered during travel among these destinations. Another given aspect is that cryogenic temperatures (below about 150 K) will be encountered and must, therefore, be dealt with early in the design process. The heat transmission effects of these temperatures, as well as the large temperature differences (Delta T) and quick changes in temperatures (thermal transients), and thermal cycling must be understood by testing in relevant environments. Knowing what factors are more relevant than others is key to being able to come up with an adequate experimental approach and build an appropriate test apparatus. The applications include mining equipment, spacecraft mechanisms, rotating machinery for superconducting power generation, cryofuel pumping systems, and so forth. Participating with science and industry partners in tribology research, dry lube technology, and material science in a collaborative way is a key facet of the focus area of cryobotics. This paper addresses the design, checkout, and testing of an extreme cold environment test chamber and the initial testing of Harmonic Drive strain wave gear sets and bulk metallic glass flexsplines in strain wave gear sets. This chamber was specifically designed for testing actuator subsystems, such as planetary gearboxes, strain wave gear sets, and full actuators in vacuum and at approximately 100 kelvin (K) and below. This chamber's capabilities include life testing while under specific loads, gear efficiency, gear wear, temperature monitoring, and other operational parameters.

The Psyche mission will determine if (16) Psyche is the core of a larger differentiated body. As part of the development of this mission a Verification and Validation (V&V) engineer was assigned early in the project's design Phase B. This paper will discuss some of the strategies that the Psyche team is using to take full advantage of the early planning for V&V on flight projects and specifically how the Psyche mission is approaching these tasks. This paper will discuss the effects of having a V&V mindset on: 1) The Psyche requirements development process, and how focusing not only on how the team will verify these requirements but also on developing the tools necessary to track and monitor that verification feeds back into the requirement development process. 2) The Psyche testbed development, and how using a verification mindset is useful for identifying holes in the testbed development process, including the required testbed speed and how to think about testbed certification early in the process while encouraging trades and developing relationships with the testbed team. 3) Developing new V&V Tools for Psyche, and how developing tools early in the project development process means that they can influence the development of other requirement and scheduling tools. 4) Verification Activity Planning, which is typically done to a preliminary level during Phase B of the project, and is important for understanding the major testing that is needed to ensure that the system as built represents the design. On Psyche we are not only focused on bringing this planning to a preliminary level, we are also developing a V&V focused schedule to help us de-conflict V&V activities that may require similar resources early on in the program's development. 5) Validation Planning, for which we are working with the testbed and model development teams to ensure that their models can be effectively validated and that the plans to do so are in place.

Main objective of this mission is to gain more knowledge of the evolution of terrestrial planets. Beside a number of different scientific instruments onboard the lander, there are two instruments that will perform measurements on the Martian ground. One of the instruments is the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), which was developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to measure the heat flow of the Martian outer crust. It uses a hammering mechanism equipped with heating foils on the outer hull for regolith thermal conductivity measurements and pulls a tether approx. 5 m into the soil. The tether is equipped with temperature elements for the determination of temperature gradients in the ground. There is the need of a separate system to be able to perform those activities on the surface. This system is called the "HP3 Support System". Its main task is to ensure a stable, nearly perpendicular position of the hammering mechanism relative to the soil on the Martian surface before initial penetration. It also houses the instrument for penetration depth measurement and serves as electrical connection to the lander. The paper gives an overview of the development and the qualification of the structure of the Support System. It will focus on the mechanical design, the analysis of the structural dynamics but in particular on the testing which includes standard environmental testing but also numerous development tests that are very mission specific. The mechanical design of the Support System is mainly driven by a unique set of requirements derived from the working environment on Mars, the deployment from the lander deck and the mechanically separated operation on the surface. The instrument design will be explained to show which design elements were implemented to ensure proper functionality. Various development tests were developed and performed to show compliance of the instrument design to the requirements. Such tests are: Separation Tests from the lander deck in cold environment under various tilt angles, Tether Deployment Tests, under various temperatures, foldings and routings, Feet Sliding Resistance Tests on sand with different slopes and the "Cold Drop and Dig test", which covers the initial hammering phase of the Mole. The paper will give an overview on all tests necessary for the support system qualification and will describe test setups and the results.

We utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open source software to create a low-cost accessible platform for the potential use in commercial and research applications. The system is scalable, with the capability of swarm formation in both static and dynamic configurations using real-time path planning and optimized target assignment. The group of UAVs used in this study consists of multiple quadcopters, each equipped with an on-board computer, a flight controller, and COTS telemetry and GPS modules. Commands are sent to the swarm via a ground station. The ground station and UAVs communicate via a WiFi datalink. The system has demonstrated path-planning with collision avoidance capabilities through simulations. This study shows via simulation and partially through experimentation that swarm autonomy can be implemented effectively and cost-efficiently. This creates an ease of access for the use of a swarm of UAVs for a variety of applications including 3D mapping, and search and rescue across a variety of terrains with increasing difficulty. By integrating other sensors and instruments, this swarm can be used to measure a variety of parameters, locating targets and creating formations around them to best study the targets in areas where ground navigation and viewpoints are non-optimal.

An Ultra-Stable Mid-Infrared Sensor for the Detection of Bio-Signatures by Means of Transit Spectroscopy	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			PLANETS	The discovery of the Trappist-1 system, which consists of an ultra cool M-dwarf star orbited by 7 planets, 3 of which are located in the habitable zone, has demonstrated that these types of planetary systems around dwarf stars are very common. Such systems are well suited for the study of exoplanets. In particular the search for bio-signatures in the atmosphere of planets in the habitable zone around M-stars will be a high-priority science goal of future space missions. The mid-infrared (mid-IR) band between 3 and 15 microns is probably the best available band for this science, because the spectral lines of methane, ozone, and nitrous oxide can be found in this spectral range. he coexistence of these constituents in a planets atmosphere would be a very strong indicator for life on the planet. Mid-IR transit spectrometers on future space missions such as Origins Space Telescope (OST) will be the instrument of choice to detect these bio-signatures in exoplanets around M-dwarfs. Current mid-IR detectors are based on impurity band conduction (IBC) devices such as Si:As detectors. Charge trapping in these device leads to a time and exposure dependent response. As a result, this detector class is not expected to provide the required 5 ppm stability needed for a reliable detection of the aforementioned spectral lines. While efforts are under way to improve IBC detectors, it is un-clear how far the performance can be improved. Here we describe the development of an ultra-stable Mid-IR Array Spectrometer demonstration for Exoplanet Transits (MI-RASET), which includes a calibration system that, as we show, is needed to achieve the required sensitivity for the detection of atmospheric bio-signatures in habitable-zone planets around M-dwarfs. The spectrometer will be demonstrated with arrays of Transition Edge Sensor detectors (TES). These devices are known to have a very linear response and are intrinsically very stable. Furthermore, the required detector parameters (sensitivity, dynamic range) for space based mid-IR transit spectroscopy can be easily met with existing devices. No new detector developments are required, only the absorbers need to be optimized for the wavelength range of the instrument. This project will include the development of a high-accuracy calibration system with a stable reference source which itself will be monitored in the visible (0.5 mu m) by a photo diode. At this wavelength the precision of the load temperature measurement exceeds that of an in-band calibration. This scheme will allow for real time monitoring of the detector gain and offset, which we anticipate will result in a background limited performance with the required stability of better than 5 ppm for the detection of bio-signatures in a designated spectrometer flying e.g. on the OST space telescope, and as such will help to answer one of NASA's prime questions: "Are we alone?"

Mars Cube One (MarCO) is the first CubeSat mission developed for interplanetary operation. MarCO is a technology demonstration mission comprised of two identical, solar powered 6U satellites with several key goals, including that of providing a bent pipe telecom relay to Earth for NASA's InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission during its Entry, Descent, and Landing sequence. MarCO launched on the same rocket as InSight and makes use of the Deep Space Network for communications and ranging. It therefore has an attitude control system and propulsion system suitable for operating in several pointing modes, providing desaturations for reaction wheel momentum buildup, and thrusting to change the spacecraft trajectory. Because the spacecraft design is constrained to the CubeSat standards and because of the distances of the spacecraft from Earth and the Sun, the components used for attitude control and propulsion must meet tight size, mass, and power requirements. Autonomous modes of operation are also critical to ensure that the spacecraft can function safely with periods of several hours occurring between consecutive communication periods. A robust testing sequence was required to ensure that the spacecraft functions were exercised and that the operations team understood how the spacecraft were expected to behave after launch. This paper discusses several elements of the MarCO attitude control and propulsion systems. The paper begins with a discussion of the hardware that was selected for the two systems as well as descriptions of the interface between the attitude control and propulsion systems and the interface between these systems and the rest of the spacecraft's command and data handling system. Next, the paper summarizes the different types of tests that were performed at the system and spacecraft levels. Test data is included for some of these tests which helped define the methods by which the spacecraft is operated in space. Lastly, the paper lists a series of lessons-learned for developing attitude control and propulsion systems for interplanetary CubeSats.

InSight/MarCO Opportunistic Multiple Spacecraft Per Antenna (OMSPA) Demonstration	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				As smallsats become increasingly capable, longer-lived, and have more secondary payload launch opportunities to beyond-GEO destinations, they are expected to play an increasing role in deep space science investigations. This expectation is borne out by several relatively recent NASA Science Mission Directorate solicitations regarding smallsat studies and small innovative missions. With the potential for these smallsats to substantially add to the number of spacecraft operating in deep space, we need to be thinking about ways to support communications with all of them without the huge expense of trying to build a commensurate number of deep space antennas. One approach to this challenge might involve making greater use of beam-sharing techniques that allow all the spacecraft within the beamwidth of a single ground antenna to simultaneously downlink to the antenna. One of these techniques, Opportunistic Multiple Spacecraft Per Antenna (OMSPA), may be particularly suited to smallsats. In the concept for this technique, smallsats within the scheduled ground antenna beam of some other spacecraft, make opportunistic use of that spacecraft's beam by transmitting "open-loop" to a recorder associated with the antenna. These transmissions get captured on the recorder and can be later retrieved, demodulated, and decoded so that the smallsats can recover their data - all without them having to schedule the antenna itself and compete with larger missions for antenna time. Widespread use of such a technique could lead to more efficient use of receiver antenna resources and result in a dramatic increase in downlink throughput. An opportunity to demonstrate the technique occurred in May 2018, when the Mars CubeSat One (MarCO) mission, consisting of two nanospacecraft (MarCO-A & B) launched alongside InSight, a NASA Mars lander mission. To demonstrate the capabilities of OMSPA for this launch window opportunity, X-band downlink telemetry was recorded for all three spacecraft (InSight, MarCO-A, and MarCO-B) at both the Deep Space Network (DSN), using its 34-m antennas, and at Morehead State University (MSU) using its 21-m antenna - with all of the involved antennas pointed at InSight. Open-loop recordings were collected at the DSN using wideband very long baseline science receivers and at MSU using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices operated using GNU Radio. All the recordings were then processed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL) using an OMSPA Software Receiver, a signal processing/communications tool used to extract telemetry transfer frames from baseband samples. The results of extracting telemetry data from InSight/MarCO recordings collected by the DSN and at MSU are described in this article. In particular, details pertaining to the processing chain used by the OMSPA Software Receiver to demodulate the DSN and MSU recordings are presented, from carrier/symbol synchronization, to frame alignment using attached sync markers (ASMs), followed by error correction code decoding. Validation results with closed-loop data obtained by the DSN are also presented in order to highlight the viability of OMSPA for future multiple spacecraft demodulation opportunities.

X-band PN Delta DOR Signal Design and Implementation on the JPL Iris Transponder	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				This paper describes the design and implementation of the Pseudorandom-Noise (PN) Delta Differential One-way Ranging (DDOR) signal format on the JPL Iris Cubesat Software Defined Radio. The Iris radio is now in-flight use in Deep Space onboard the MARCO spacecraft and will soon be utilized to multiple EM-1 missions. The spread spectrum Delta DOR format enables more accurate differential ranging measurements over the classical DOR tone format, and it is applicable to deep space missions that require accurate navigation or require accurate angular position measurements for another purpose such as determining the ephemeris of a planet or small body. The classical Delta-DOR technique makes time delay measurements of spacecraft and quasar signals to determine spacecraft angular position in the radio reference frame defined by the quasar coordinates. The measurement system is configured to provide common-mode error cancellation as nearly as possible. In the PN DOR mode, instead of a spacecraft modulating their downlink, with a sinusoidal signal, referred to as a DOR tone as done in the classical DOR mode, the sinusoidal tone is replaced with a spread spectrum signal. Using a spread spectrum DOR signal instead of a DOR tone enables cancellation of effects due to phase dispersion across the channels used to record quasar signals. This error source, referred to as phase dispersion or phase ripple, is currently the dominant measurement error for the classical DOR format. PN spreading will improve on classical DOR performance accuracy because by choosing the PN spreading code and shaping filter carefully, the spacecraft signal can be made to closely resemble the quasar signal resulting in reduction of the Delta-DOR error due to phase dispersion by 80% to 90% over the classical DDOR approach. The article will describe the choice of a Gold code sequence that possesses good autocorrelation properties as well as excellent cross-correlation properties that was used to spread the DOR tone, and the choice of root-raised-cosine (RRC) chip-shaping filter to reduce the amount of excess-bandwidth of the output waveform. The paper will also describe the path that was taken for the FPGA implementation on the Iris radio including a Simulink model of the PN DDOR module that is used for automatic HDL code generation. This module was then integrated into the Iris firmware and verified. Future work includes the integration of the designed subsystem into the Universal Space Transponder and extension of the derived waveform to the KA-band. We hope that the outlined PN DDOR implementation can be integrated into an upcoming mission that utilizes the Iris radio (such as EM-1 missions).

The concept of Titan Aerial Daughtercraft (TAD) was introduced in 2014, where small-scale (e.g. < 10 kg) VTOL aircraft would conduct multiple sorties from a mothership (lander or balloon), recharging batteries from a radioisotope power source (RPS) on the mothership between sorties. More recently, NASA has funded a study of a much larger Titan rotorcraft (similar to 450 kg) that would carry its own RPS. The TAD concept is still worth further analysis as a low-cost element of mission architectures where the mothership is a lander, balloon, or other large mobility system. To compare the potential performance of daughtercraft that are rotary-wing only or fixed/rotary-wing hybrids, this study examines potential flight durations and flight radius for small-scale (4 to 10 kg) quadcopters and tailsitters. For notional system parameters, a payload mass fraction of 25%, and a conservative battery model, energy estimation modeling for lander-based scenarios shows maximum flight endurance at Titan's surface for 10 kg quadcopter and tailsitter as 9.3 hours and 12.4 hours, respectively, and maximum sortie radius from a lander as 89 km and 125 km, respectively. Modeling of balloon-based scenarios estimated the mass potentially available for payload as a function of the total TAD mass and the float altitude of the balloon. For a balloon floating at 10 km above the surface and a 10 kg TAD, the model gave available mass of about 2.8 kg for a quadcopter and 3.5 kg for a tailsitter. Non-aerodynamic power dominates aerodynamic power at the lowest mass, but becomes a less significant fraction of the total as mass increases. The tailsitter has little or no advantage over the quadcopter at the lowest mass, but increasing advantage as mass increases.

High precision measurements with state-of-the-art equipment have achieved RV precision on the order of 0.5 m s(-1). Given that Earth's induced RV on the sun is on the order of 10 cm s(-1), this regime represents the next milestone on the path to finding Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars. We describe the Vacuum Extreme Radial Velocity Experiment (VERVE), a single mode fiber-fed high-resolution echelle spectrometer which integrates interferometry with spectroscopy with the aim of achieving RV precision at the 10 cm s(-1) level, on par with the ESPRESSO spectrograph (Pepe et al., 2014 [1]). The addition of interferometry relaxes the spectral calibration requirement by several orders of magnitude. We detail the spectral calibration of VERVE, including the development of a precise forward model and a data reduction pipeline to facilitate spectral extraction. We examine the model's agreement with the spectra of various calibration sources and present the results of spectral extractions performed on 635 nm and 780 nm laser sources to demonstrate VERVE's spectroscopic capabilities. We note the 10 cm s(-1) RV precision threshold for detecting Earth-like planets, and show that the similar to 2 pixel agreement we achieve is consistent with this requirement. We briefly introduce results pertaining to interferometry and conclude by describing the future stages of testing to prepare VERVE for novel RV measurements.

S	Velazco, JE			IEEE	Velazco, Jose E.			Omnidirectional Optical Communicator	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				We are developing an inter-satellite omnidirectional optical communicator (ISOC) that will enable cross-link communications between spacecraft at Gbps data rates over distances of up to thousands of kilometers in free space. The ISOC will allow superfast cross-links and will be a technology enabler for swarms and formation flying spacecraft. The ISOC under development features a truncated dodecahedron geometry that can hold an array of fast photodiode detectors and gimbal-less MEMS scanning mirrors. The main goals of the ISOC development include: 1) full sky coverage, 2) Gbps data rates and 3) the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous links. We have developed two omnidirectional communicator prototypes capable of full-duplex operation. We are using advanced single-mode laser diodes operating at 850 nm capable of producing hundreds of milliwatts of laser radiation. We are also employing MEMS-based beam steering mirrors, and fast PIN photodiodes to achieve long-range communications. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve full duplex operation at 1 Gbps data rates over 200 km and slightly lower data rates at longer distances. In this paper we describe the overall ISOC architecture and present the design tradeoffs for gigabit data-rate operation. We also present preliminary NRZ On-Off Keying communications simulation results obtained using our optical link budget model. The ISOC is ideally suited for crosslink communications among small spacecraft, especially for those forming a swarm and/or a constellation. Small spacecraft furnished with ISOC communications systems, should be able to communicate at gigabit per second rates over long distances. This data rate enhancement can allow real-time, global science measurements and/or ultra-high fidelity observations from tens or hundreds of Earth-orbiting satellites, or permit high-bandwidth, direct-to-earth communications for planetary missions.

The current JVLA covers this frequency range employing five distinct receiver packages. We estimate that reducing the number of receiving systems required to cover the full frequency range should reduce operating costs. The receiver package we developed consists of a quad-ridge feed horn, low-noise amplifiers (LNA), and a down-converter to analog intermediate frequencies. Both the feedhorn and the LNA are cryogenically cooled. On the LNA front we pursued two 848 GHz MMIC designs, the first using 70-nm gallium arsenide, metamorphic high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMT), and the second using 35-nm indium phosphide HEMTs.

S	Verma, V; Leger, C			IEEE	Verma, Vandi; Leger, Chris			SSim: NASA Mars Rover Robotics Flight Software Simulation	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Each new Mars rover has pursued increasingly richer science while tolerating a wider variety of environmental conditions and hardware degradation over longer mission operation duration. Sojourner operated for 83 sols (Martian days), Spirit for 2208 sols, and Opportunity is at 5111 sols, and Curiosity operation is ongoing at 2208 sols. To handle this increase in capability, the complexity of onboard flight software has increased. MSL (also known as Curiosity), uses more flight software lines of code than all previous missions to Mars combined, including both successes and failures[1]. MSL has more than 4,200 commands with as many as dozens of arguments, 54,000 parameters, and tens of thousands of additional state variables. A single high-level command may perform hours of configurable robotic arm and sampling behavior. Incorrect usage can result in the loss of an activity or the loss of the mission. Surface Simulation ("SSim") was developed to address the challenge of making full and effective use of many capabilities of MSL, while managing complexity and risk. SSim is software that performs rapid context sensitive simulation of flight software. NASA Mars missions are comprised of three phases: several months of Cruise, a brief but exciting Entry Descent and Landing (EDL), and a Surface mission that typically lasts as long as the hardware survives. SSim is meant for use during the surface phase when the mission fulfills its primary objectives. The focus of SSim on MSL was the robotic flight software, including rover mobility and navigation, robotic arm manipulation, and sample acquisition, processing, and delivery. It can execute behaviors in simulation a thousand times faster than they execute in real time on the flight compute element. SSim is used by rover drivers to develop and validate command sequences throughout the planning cycle. SSim has been used to plan all of the Curiosity robotic operations since landing and is expected to continue to be used for the remaining life of the rover. Due to the impact of SSim on MSL, the Mars 2020 mission plans to increase the scope of SSim during flight operations, simulating not only rover planner operations, but all surface operations, including the instrument, power, thermal and telecommunication behavior. SSim is part of the Rover Sequencing and Visualization (RSVP) suite of Rover Planning tools [2]. In the paper we provide an overview of SSim architecture, design, implementation, and usage on MSL, as well as an overview of plans for Mars 2020.

S	Verma, V; Kuhn, S			IEEE	Verma, Vandi; Kuhn, Stephen			Refactoring the Curiosity Rover's Sample Handling Architecture on Mars	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Curiosity Mars rover sample handling hardware and software were architected assuming that end-to-end sampling operations would occur in a single rover position, from acquisition of a powdered sample with a scoop or drill, through to the cleaning out of all sample residue in the sample chain. However, after analysis of the first drilled samples in Yellowknife Bay, the science team wanted to iterate with additional experiments on Mars and in laboratories on Earth to better understand their results and increase the value of science returned. With the architecture as conceived, the time needed to do so was in direct competition with the exploration of other targets and satisfaction of success criteria during the prime mission. The science team desired the capability to "cache" the sample for future use while continuing progress towards mission objectives by driving away and maintaining use of the robotic arm for contact science. Allowing sample to move about freely in this state risked hardware damage, ending the ability to deliver sample using the nominal path. In this paper we present the approaches that were developed to repurpose some of the sampling hardware into a series of caches and catchments that reduced this hardware risk to a level acceptable during the prime mission. This approach presented new challenges for rover planners, who had to learn to command the robotic arm using new routines that were too complicated to manage without assistance. The rover planner Software Simulation ("SSim") was updated to track the turret gravity vector and sample state, generating an execution error or breakpoint as constraints were violated. Sample from the Cumberland drill target was cached for over 9 months, facilitating a number of scientific discoveries. As data accumulated and the mission transitioned into extended operations, the cached sample capability evolved to significantly simplify operations and reduce overhead.

Recently, we introduced a two-way ranging method ([1], [2], [3]) which eliminates the need for the downlink PN ranging signal. In this telemetry ranging scheme, the requisite timing measurements are obtained from a data-bearing downlink telemetry signal. In the present paper, we extend the telemetry ranging concept by also eliminating the uplink PN signal, which is replaced by a data-bearing telecommand signal. We describe the architecture and concept of such a system, and describe the fundamental limitations of tracking the timing of uplink telecommand signals when demod-remod correlation techniques are employed via Cramer-Rao bounds. An end-to-end performance analysis shows that in typical scenarios, ranging performance comparable to conventional PN ranging can be achieved.

S	Waldram, N; Cornford, S; Piette, M; Plattsmier, G			IEEE	Waldram, Nicholas; Cornford, Steven; Piette, Marie; Plattsmier, George			Cross Lifecycle Modeling in MBSE	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Infusion and Modernization Initiative (MIAMI) is a NASA-wide effort to lay the groundwork for an integrated framework of tools and technology to advance the objectives of Systems Engineering at NASA, with emphasis on efficiency, interconnectivity, and breadth of scope. Within the MIAMI effort, the Sounding Rocket Team, led by George Plattsmier (MSFC) and George Turner (GSFC), has implemented MBSE within the domain of NASA Sounding Rocket Operations Contract (NSROC) Sounding Rocket missions, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to outline system architectures, requirements, mission assurance, stakeholders, events, and deliverables. The current team effort supports the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-Ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) experiment. The rocket team, focused on the mission planning and execution domain, is working in tandem with a MIAMI Sounding Rocket MaGIXS experiment team, focused on the experiment domain, to model the mission, systems, experiment, and interfaces to produce and deploy an integrated mission model. Through communication and coordination between NASA and the Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO), the MIAMI Sounding Rocket team is tailoring their pilot efforts to specific deliverables identified as critical throughout the full mission lifecycle by Nathan Empson (Mission Operations Manager) and others at SRPO. These products, as part of an overall NASA MBSE pilot effort, will enable evaluation of the utility of MBSE for sounding rocket missions. The team coordinates their work through a spiral development process punctuated by "sprints" to seam together the advancements in defining architecture and behavior of the systems involved, with the various technologies and analyses used to bolster the modeling effort. For developing technologies and modeling patterns, the team continues to interface with the Computer Aided Engineering Systems Environment (CAESE) team at JPL to explore and expand the system "model" from a MagicDraw server project to a nodal system of tools and services that delivers to stakeholders at various levels of cognizance. This environment is centered around an " authoritative source of truth", known as the Integrated Mission Model upon which several interfaces are integrated such that users throughout all regions of the model see data, commits, updates, and structural changes in real time for a better collaboration workspace throughout the project. In the current instance of this modeling network, the Integrated Mission model uses the individual MagicDraw models for the rocket team and the experiment team, where modelers commit up to the master model, and use synchronized checkouts and updates. This allows for better version control, user permission allocation, and support for distributed work efforts to improve collaborative efficiency. The current state and future state of the team effort is to appropriate the tools and libraries available to meet the desired use-cases requested by NSROC. Throughout the process of MBSE integration, the larger goal through MIAMI is to project high-level modeling concepts and implementations into useable and tractable deliverables for small missions. Additionally, through support and development of the model as applied to MaGIXS, re-usability is achieved so that the efficiency of modeling itself is improved.

However, digital holographic microscopy (DHM), a high-resolution, volumetric imaging technique that is well-suited for examining microbial species is typically monochromatic. Thus, the spectral properties of bacteria are not probed with DHM save only for the wavelength of operation. Here we describe a new DHM instrument which enhances the method via the simultaneous recording of wavelength multiplexed holograms of the sample. This coarse spectral encoding is akin to labeling with RGB values, thereby producing colorized images of the species which enables a new dimension of characterization. This new instrument is derived from a previous architecture which has already demonstrated superior opto/mechanical stability. Herein, this novel instrument is described, and the results of experimental measurements taken with this new instrument are shown.	[Wallace, J.

Categorized as a sub-orbital sounding rocket mission, the program is more risk tolerant than a typical JPL flight mission; thus more leeway is allowed in tailoring institutional requirements. However, since ASPIRE is a risk reduction activity for Mars 2020, its test results are significant to JPL and directly impact decisions for a flagship planetary mission. This, combined with the wide scope and complexity of ASPIRE - which spans multiple NASA sites, and includes distinct flight, ground, launch vehicle, and mission systems - creates unique programmatic challenges. Furthermore, as a program composed of multiple test missions, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach between launches. As a result, the project has developed an adapted version of typical systems engineering functions such as verification and validation ( V&V), resource management, risk management, engineering change requests, and lifecycle management. A set of project guidelines has been established to accommodate the small team size, low budget, and higher risk posture of the project while also maintaining the highest possible chance of mission success and quality of engineering data products. This paper describes ASPIRE's unique approach to systems engineering functions, and evaluates successes and lessons learned.

In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is the exploitation of available resources at the site of a landed spacecraft on the surface of another planetary body. This can include harvesting of atmosphere, regolith, or rock for direct use (e.g. as radiation or micrometeorite shielding) or for separation/purification (e.g. for propellant production). The objective of this study is to try to identify a potential ISRU architecture, specifically for extracting water from hydrated minerals identified from orbital multispectral imaging on Mars, which can be implemented in an affordable way. By its nature this architecture must incorporate not only all the conventional excavate/scoop/haul/dump/process functions of a terrestrial mining operation on Earth, but also the sorts of maintenance and repair capabilities which any terrestrial mining operation would require in order to stay operational for an extended duration. The early concepts described in this study are intended for Mars, but also can be adaptable to lunar and other solar system planetary bodies.	[Wilcox, Brian H.; Nayar, Hari; Howe, A.

The third option may be the most attractive in terms of cost effectiveness and frequency of access, which are the main drawbacks of the first two, respectively. In the past 5 years, over 50 satellites have been launched from U.S. soil en route to geosynchronous orbit and beyond. Many of these launches do not use the full capability of the launch vehicle, leaving an opportunity for a small secondary spacecraft to get a ride to geosynchronous transfer orbit ( GTO). Starting from an ESPA-ring rideshare to GTO, a solar-electric propulsion ( SEP) powered spacecraft can make its own way to Mars orbit to perform a useful mission. In this paper, we explore the mission design space for small, ESPA-class ( 200-450 kg) spacecraft transferring from GTO to Mars orbit. This is accomplished by creating tools that jointly optimize low-thrust trajectories and spacecraft subsystems to create feasible mission concepts. An example is given of an Areostationary telecom orbiter that reaches Mars in 2 years with a dry mass of 200 kg.

We used the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Serially Concatenated convolutionally coded Pulse Position Modulation (SCPPM) prototype software [1] to obtain coded performance curves under different operating conditions with varying signal power, background noise power, code rates, and PPM modulation orders. Comparison with traditional, deterministic analysis shows that extra margin needs to be reserved to compensate for the performance losses caused by uncertainties of the link parameters.

For flight mission and spacecraft design, reliable wireless systems will expand the scientific applications and research opportunities of planetary explorations. To retire key risks to use of wireless technologies in spacecraft design and space applications, in this research, we analyze its capability and propagation in the test and operational environments including thermal chamber and on-board of a rover at JPL Mars yard. The software-based wireless system consists a transmitting antenna, two receiving antennas, and a software defined radio, which enable one to transmit and receive multiple frequency band wireless signals with different modulations and a flexible data rate. Here, we summarize the signal propagation analysis of different test and operational scenarios. The propagation analysis demonstrates that the design of two receiving antennas provides about 20 dB improvement in the received power comparing to the single-antenna result. Additionally, the chamber test result shows significant multipath effects observed from the data collected from the two scenarios: 1) transmitting and receiving antennas are inside of the chamber, and 2) the inside-chamber receiving antennas receive signals from the outside-chamber transmitter. The statistical analysis of the Mars yard test indicates that signal power has relatively small standard deviation for the scenario in which transmitting and receiving antennas are aligned in the line of sight direction with a distance. The standard deviations increase for other scenarios that transmitter is set on rover's wheel, and receiving antennas are on the top of the rover probably due to multi-path effects. The investigation of propagation analysis will be beneficial to a design of a reliable wireless system toward the development of the spacecraft wireless networks in support of NASA's future flight missions (such as planetary aerobots, rovers, and spacecraft).

The systems consist of a set of type-II superconductors field cooled below their critical temperature using a cryocooler, and operate on an orbiting sample container with a series of permanent magnets spaced around the exterior, along with an integrated layer of shielding to preserve the magnetic properties of the returned samples. Benefits of the approaches include passive, non-contact capture and orientation, as well as a reduction in the number of actuators relative to various mechanical methods. System prototypes were developed, characterized, and tested in a microgravity environment to demonstrate feasibility. Flux pinning models were developed that accounts for magnet geometry, superconductor geometry, superconductor training geometry, superconductor temperature, superconductor material properties, and magnetic field shape, and output forces and torques the superconductors imparts on the OS via the magnets. Magnetic models of the OS were developed to evaluate magnetic shield effectiveness and demonstrate successful shielding of the sample. A vision system using AprilTag fiducials was used on a free-floating OS in a microgravity environment to estimate relative OS position and orientation while in motion. Integrated Capture, Containment, and Return System ( CCRS) Capture and Orient Module ( COM) payload concepts for an Earth Return Orbiter ( ERO) using flux pinning were proposed and assessed based on relevant system evaluation criteria, such as mass, actuator count, and power consumption.

This technology is an improvement over the technology that is currently used in space applications, which lags behind state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment by several generations. MPSoC technology integrates all computational power required by next-generation space exploration science instruments onto a single chip. This paper describes the automation and the integration of hardware/software co-verification tools (LiveCheckHSI) for the Xilinx Zynq-based SoC control and data handling avionics system that have been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for next generation imaging spectrometers (NGIS). The NGIS acquires and compresses images in real-time, in addition to programming the spectrometer (frame rate, exposure time), focus step motor, and heaters and reporting telemetry. The SoC and MPSoC technologies combining heterogeneous supercomputing capability with high performance FPGAs allow for the integration of verification tools such as LiveCheckHSI into the deployment device itself. This approach allows to by-pass the traditional independent Ground Support Equipment (GSE) systems for acquisition, processing, and visualization of hyperspectral images which can be prohibitive in terms of hardware and software. This capability also permits on-chip verification for flight systems and extends embedded testing and verification tools beyond the pre-implementation formal verification and post-implementation such as VIVADO HardwareDebug /Chipscope with hardware in the loop. The first part of the paper describes the automation tools integrated into the remote LiveCheckHSI such as AutoSweep, Recording and Scripting capability. The second part of the paper describes the deployment of LiveCheckHSI into the MPSoC device itself using Yocto and Qt C++ framework.

Constraint-Based Off-Nominal Behavior Modeling for Europa Clipper	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The risk assessment for the Europa Clipper mission evaluates the probability of mission failure based on the failure rates of individual components and dependencies among them. The probabilities are calculated by integrating the failure probability density functions over the intervals of time within which a fault may occur. The response of the spacecraft to different faults can result in different schedules of activities, changing both the failure probability density functions and the time intervals of integration. This paper describes an approach to generating the schedules for the different fault cases and determining the associated time intervals. In order to represent the behavior of the spacecraft using a simple, declarative syntax, we employ a language based on ontologies of behavior and scenarios. A constraint-based analysis engine uses the declarative specification to identify bounds on system parameters and fill in details of behavior. These bounds include the time windows within which certain faults can occur, which are also the bounds for integration in the calculation of failure probability. Determining these time windows is a constraint optimization problem. For an individual fault in Clipper's propulsion subsystem, the engine is able to solve for values of the time window, but it cannot directly solve for the windows when they are functions of the times of previous faults. We used Mathematica to solve for these functions, and for more complicated scenarios, the functions are nearly too large to manage. We discuss this challenge of maintaining a closed-form calculation for more detailed fault models, and present the model of propulsion fault response behavior that illustrates the challenge. We also discuss some advantages of the behavior modeling language, comparing to a mixed integer-linear program model. Time windows are given for some of the many scenarios of interest.

Several unique advantages over traditional mechanical capture systems include robustness to control failures, contactless reorientation of the capture target, and collision mitigation. This study describes a series of experiments performed in a microgravity environment during a parabolic-flight campaign to measure the dynamic behavior of a flux-pinned interface in a flight-traceable environment. This paper presents the performance of a flux-pinned interface in the full six degrees of freedom in terms of several quantifiable metrics: success of capture at various energetic states, momentum change, system damping, and interface stiffness of the two spacecraft bodies.

Part of the planetary protection process would involve a process called "breaking the chain of contact (BTC)", where any returned material reaching Earth for further analysis would have to be sealed inside a container at extremely high confidence. The sterilization process would require destroying any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of the container. A novel process for containing returning samples has been conceived and is under development at JPL. The process consists of using induction heated brazing to synchronously sterilize, separate, seam and seal the container. The braze material is heated to the melting temperature that is higher than 500 degrees C and, thus, it assures sterilizing exposed areas since all carbon bonds are broken above this temperature. The container consists of double walls with "Earth clean" interstitial space. The process consists of two-steps, where one is intended to be prepared on Earth and the second would be executed on orbit around Mars. The latest results of this study will be described and discussed.

Ocean plates form at the ridge before cooling and thickening with age. This is supported by observations that include bathymetry and heat flow. Beneath older seafloor the observed age trend is more muted. Surface waves also find plate seismic velocity and thickness increasing with age, consistent with a cooling plate, possibly more muted at older ages. Teleseismic scattered waves find a discontinuity that increases in depth with age beneath young seafloor, flattening with a scatter-centered at 64 +/- 11 km depth beneath older seafloor. Active source reflections support low-velocity channels at similar depths. The discontinuity and channel depths are centered on the gradual velocity drops predicted for a cooling plate and also imaged by surface waves. The discontinuities implied by scattered waves are sharper than typically predicted for a thermal model. This suggests that although plate thickness is thermally controlled, another mechanism is required to define the base of ocean plates, such as melt. Anisotropic constraints are also important for our understanding of the plate, although precise depth resolution and links to defining the base of ocean plates are challenging.

The frequency-diverse operation enables all-electronic data-acquisition by means of a simple frequency-sweep and requires no mechanically moving apparatus or phase shifting circuits for imaging. Leveraging a tensor model for the scattering behavior, as opposed to a scalar model, enables the extraction of further information from the imaged objects. This is shown by means of frequency-diverse polarimetric imaging of complex objects, such as the letters of the word "DUKE", and comparing the reconstructed polarimetric images to the reflectivity-only reconstructions of the same objects.

The methods do not assume any orbital knowledge of the target spacecraft, thus can be used for both quiescent and maneuvering spacecraft. We show by simulations that this approach can achieve meter-level three-dimension (3D) positioning accuracy with reasonable time delay measurement accuracy. The methods leverage on existing satellites and natural features (lunar case) with accurately known positions that can act as references, and/or in the case of the GEO places a dedicated "reference" spacecraft into an eccentric geosynchronous orbit over a region of interest (e.g., sky above North America). The ground antennas track the signals transmitted or reflected by the target and the reference spacecraft to measure their signals' time difference of arrival (TDOA). There are two modes of operations: "Single-differencing" - this approach assumes a transmitting radar illuminating both the reference and an uncooperative spacecraft (the target), and the ground radar antennas receiving the radar echoes to derive the relative position between the reference and the target. Double-differencing - this approach applies to the scenarios when either a) the target and/or the reference spacecraft with difference clocks transmitting one-way ranging signals to the ground, or b) multiple uplink radars are used to illuminate the reference and the target. We outline the mathematical derivations of the above schemes, and provide the accuracy performance simulations for some realistic and hypothetical scenarios. We also discuss some other applications.

We consider the problem of early classification of the hostile behavior of agents in a dynamic maritime domain and propose a solution using multinomial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To enable early detection of hostile behaviors, the proposed approach encodes as observable symbols the rate of change (instead of static values) for parameters relevant to the task. We discuss our implementation of a one-versus-all intent classifier using multinomial HMMs and present the results of our system on three types of hostile behaviors (ram, herd, block) and a benign behavior.

WP-GITM was previously applied to simulate the ionospheric perturbations resulted from the epicentral crustal movement by assuming spherical acoustic-gravity waves originated from a point source, which was specified by the seismic measurement at a single location nearby the epicenter. In this work, we extend WP-GITM to include the effects of Rayleigh surface waves and adapt WP-GITM to utilize seismic measurements from more than one location in the attempt to capture the radiation pattern of the seismic source. We apply the new WP-GITM to model the near-field co-seismic ionospheric perturbations during the 16 September 2015 Illapel earthquake. The comparison between the simulated ionospheric total electron content perturbations and the GPS observations shows promising results.

The DSOC project, under development by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will test space-to-ground high-bandwidth laser communications while en route to the Psyche-16 asteroid in the main asteroid belt, in what will be the longest range high rate optical communications link in history. The LTA is based on a master-oscillator power-amplifier optical architecture, using highly-efficient cladding-pumped amplification. The transmitter is designed to deliver average optical output powers >4 W at 1550 nm for low power consumption data links at >100 Mbps. The output signal operates across multiple pulse-position modulation (PPM) orders and pulse-widths to optimize the space-to-ground link. The architecture is designed for high-reliability and radiation hardness, and features hardware interlocks and secondary signal/pumping paths to reduce single points of failure. We also detail the effective management of optical nonlinearities which could damage the LTA or impact the communications link. These include the suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering, self-phase modulation, and pulse-to-pulse energy variation (PEV), which arises from the gain dynamics of the power amplifier, and will manifest when the LTA is configured for large pulse energies and long inter-pulse delays. The LTA also incorporates hardware and software controls to enable autonomous operation, including closed-loop control of intra-stage and output power levels, modulator bias control, and detailed reporting of LTA status through telemetry.

Towards solid-state beam steering using a 7-emitter 1550 nm optical phased array	FREE-SPACE LASER COMMUNICATIONS XXXI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Free-Space Laser Communications XXXI	FEB 04-06, 2019	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		coherent combination; optical phased array; FPGA		We present the preliminary design and experimental results of a 1550 nm solid-state beam pointing system based on an optical phased array (OPA) architecture. OPAs manipulate the distribution of optical power in the far-field by controlling the phase of individual emitters in an array. This allows OPAs to steer the beam in the far field without any mechanical components (e.g., steering mirrors). The beam-steering system presented here uses waveguide electro-optic modulators to actuate the phase of each element in a 7-emitter OPA, enabling kHz bandwidth steering with sub-milliradian pointing precision. The control system used to stabilize and control the phase of each emitter in the OPA exploits a technique called digitally enhanced heterodyne interferometry, allowing the phase of each emitter to be measured simultaneously at a single photodetector, dramatically simplifying the optical system. All digital signal processing is performed using a field-programmable gate-array. Applications of this technology include free-space link acquisition and tracking for satellite-to-satellite laser communications and light detection and ranging (LiDAR).

However, ground observation networks are sparse, and snowpack models are often poorly-constrained by these observations. Spatially-continuous satellite data are available, yet only snow covered area (SCA) is easily monitored through this approach, despite the need for volumetric water content of the snow, or snow water equivalent. In this study, we investigate the potential to create spatially-continuous, computationally-efficient SWE maps that leverages in situ and remotely sensed snow information to improve understanding of spatial snowpack distribution across the West. A statistical model that integrates in situ and remotely-sensed snow disappearance observations for bias-corrected, spatially-continuous estimates of date of snow disappearance (DSD), with in situ peak SWE, distributed meteorology, and terrain data to produce a topographically-aware, annual estimate of peak SWE at a 500-m horizontal resolution. This lightweight, observationally-based snowpack model can be used to generate a high-resolution SWE dataset over large spatial areas useful for the development and validation of large-scale hydrologic models across the snow-dominated western U.S.	[Heldmyer, Aaron; Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, 450 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 450 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah] NASA, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA	Heldmyer, A (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

Observations of Radio Magnetars with the Deep Space Network	ADVANCES IN ASTRONOMY			English	Article							TRANSIENT MAGNETAR; PULSAR; DISCOVERY; EMISSION; YOUNG	The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a worldwide array of radio telescopes which supports NASA's interplanetary spacecraft missions. When the DSN antennas are not communicating with spacecraft, they provide a valuable resource for performing observations of radio magnetars, searches for new pulsars at the Galactic Center, and additional pulsar-related studies. We describe the DSN's capabilities for carrying out these types of observations. We also present results from observations of three radio magnetars, PSR J1745-2900, PSR J1622-4950, and XTE J1810-197, and the transitional magnetar candidate, PSR J1119-6127, using the DSN radio telescopes near Canberra, Australia.

The formation of gullies on Mars today	MARTIAN GULLIES AND THEIR EARTH ANALOGUES	Geological Society Special Publication		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Workshop on Martian Gullies - Martian Gullies and their Earth Analogues	JUN 20-21, 2016	Geol Soc London, London, ENGLAND		Geol Soc London		SUBLIMATION-DRIVEN ACTIVITY; DEBRIS-FLOW ACTIVITY; LONG-TERM EVOLUTION; MARTIAN GULLIES; LIQUID WATER; CO2 ICE; HIRISE OBSERVATIONS; GROUND ICE; DEPOSITS; CLIMATE	A decade of high-resolution monitoring has revealed extensive activity in fresh Martian gullies. Flows within the gullies are diverse: they can be relatively light, neutral or dark, colourful or bland, and range from superficial deposits to 10 m-scale topographic changes. We observed erosion and transport of material within gullies, new terraces, freshly eroded channel segments, migrating sinuous curves, channel abandonment, and lobate deposits. We also observed early stages of gully initiation, demonstrating that these processes are not merely modifying pre-existing land-forms. The timing of activity closely correlates with the presence of seasonal CO2 frost, so the current changes must be part of ongoing gully formation that is driven largely by its presence. We suggest that the cumulative effect of many flows erodes alcoves and channels, and builds lobate aprons, with no involvement of liquid water. Instead, flows may be fluidized by sublimation of entrained CO2 ice or other mechanisms. The frequent activity is likely to have erased any features dating from high-obliquity periods, so fresh gully geomorphology at middle and high latitudes is not evidence for past liquid water. CO2 ice-driven processes may have been important throughout Martian geological history and their deposits could exist in the rock record, perhaps resembling debris-flow sediments.

In some areas, a few hundred cubic metres of downslope sand movement have been observed, sometimes moving the dune brink 'backwards'. Based on morphological and activity-timing similarities of these north polar features to southern dune gullies, identifying the processes forming these features is likely to have relevance for understanding the general evolution/modification of dune gullies. To determine alcove-formation model constraints, we have surveyed seven dune fields, each over 1-4 Mars winters. Consistent with earlier reports, we found that alcove-formation activity occurs during the autumn-winter seasons, before or while the stable seasonal frost layer is deposited. We propose a new model in which alcove formation occurs during the autumn, and springtime sublimation activity then enhances the feature. Summertime winds blow sand into the new alcoves, erasing small alcoves over a few Mars years. Based on the observed rate of alcove erasure, we estimated the effective aeolian sand transport flux. From this, we proposed that alcove formation may account for 2-20% of the total sand movement within these dune fields.

The alternative of CubeSat-based advanced infrared and microwave sounders for high impact weather forecasting	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						OSSE; Cubesat; sounder; high-impact weather	ASSIMILATION; RADIANCE	The advanced infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) sounding systems have been providing atmospheric sounding information critical for nowcasting and improving weather forecasts through data assimilation in numerical weather prediction. In recent years, advanced IR and MW sounder systems are being proposed to be onboard CubeSats that are much more cost efficient than traditional satellite systems. An impact study using a regional Observing System Simulation Experiment on a local severe storm (LSS) was carried out to evaluate the alternative of using advanced MW and IR sounders for high-impact weather forecasting in mitigating the potential data gap of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) or Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). It was found that either MicroMAS-2 or the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) on a single CubeSat was able to provide a positive impact on the LSS forecast, and more CubeSats with increased data coverage yielded larger positive impacts. MicroMAS-2 has the potential to mitigate the loss of ATMS, and CIRAS the loss of CrIS, on SNPP or JPSS, especially when multiple CubeSats are launched. There are several approximations and limitations to the present study, but these represent efficiencies appropriate to the principal goal of the study gauging the relative values of these sensors.

Observing the corona and inner heliosphere with Parker Solar Probe	NUOVO CIMENTO C-COLLOQUIA AND COMMUNICATIONS IN PHYSICS			English	Article								The recently launched Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission is expected to provide unprecedented views of the solar corona and inner heliosphere. In addition to instruments devoted to taking measurements of the local solar wind, the spacecraft carries a visible imager: the Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR). WISPR will take advantage of the proximity of the spacecraft to the Sun to perform local imaging of the near-Sun environment. WISPR will observe coronal structures at high spatial and time resolutions, although the observed plane-of-sky will rapidly change because of the fast transit at the perihelia. We present a concise description of the PSP mission, with particular regard to the WISPR instrument, discussing its main scientific goals, targets of observations, and outlining the possible synergies with current and upcoming space missions.

We first present a frequency-diverse computational imaging system developed by Duke University for security-screening applications at K-band (17.5-26.5 GHz) frequencies. Following, we show a millimeter-wave spotlight imaging concept and its conceptual integration with the K-band system as interesting example of sensor fusion. We also demonstrate the application of computational frequency-diverse imaging for polarimetric imaging and phase retrieval problems. We show that using the concept of computational frequency-diverse imaging and quasi-random measurement bases, high-fidelity images of objects can be retrieved without the need for any mechanical scanning apparatus and phase shifting circuits. Increasing the frequency-band of operation, we also demonstrate a 340 GHz radar developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and its application for standoff detection. We demonstrate a new technique to characterize the point-spread-function (PSF) of radars operating at submillimeter-wave frequencies.

New Paradigms in Defining Optimum Cost Conditions in Thermoelectric Energy Recovery Designs	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	15th European Conference on Thermoelectrics (ECT)	SEP 25-27, 2017	Padua, ITALY	European Thermoelectr Soc, Italian Thermoelectric Assoc, INSTM, ICMATE Inst		Thermoelectric systems; energy recovery; cost analysis; cost-performannce optimization; heat exchanger effects		Cost is just as important as power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste heat recovery (WHR) thermoelectric generators (TEG). Prior work [1] has shown that the system design that minimizes cost (e.g., the G [$/W] value) can be close to the designs that maximize power, but these design regimes are not necessarily aligned with high system conversion efficiency or power density. Recent work [2-5] further explores the impact of heat exchanger conditions on the optimum TEG fill factors and cost scaling of a waste heat recovery thermoelectric generator with a detailed treatment of the hot side exhaust heat exchanger. The cost scaling analysis considers the overall TEG system costs, including TE material costs, manufacturing costs, and specifically heat exchanger costs; and the performance analysis accounts for heat lost to the environment and updated relationships between the optimum hot-side and cold-side conductances that maximize power output. The optimum fill factor, F-opt, to minimize TEG energy recovery system costs is strongly dependent on the heat leakage fraction, sigma, the mass flow rate of the exhaust, the hot-side heat exchanger effectiveness, heat exchanger UA(u), and interfacial heat flux [1]. A more rigorous analysis and conclusion for the optimum fill factor was recently introduced and characterized at the 14th European Conference on Thermoelectrics [5] in 2016. A new, more comprehensive relationship for F-opt has created an updated, more rigorous relationship for the optimum cost, G(opt), relationship for thermoelectric energy recovery systems. These new [G(opt), F-opt] relationships are explored and characterized to show the inherent design complexities. The heat exchanger costs can often dominate the TEG cost equation and it is critical to fully understand the tradeoff between heat exchanger performance, TEG manufacturing and material costs, optimum TEG fill factors, and TE performance to establish potentially optimum design points within the cost-performance design space. This work explores and characterizes new design tradeoffs and new cost minimization relationships within this cost-performance design space for a typical thermoelectric energy recovery system application where the interplay between optimum TEG fill factors, TE device design parameters, and heat exchanger design parameters can impact system footprint, volume, and mass in weight-sensitive applications. This work shows how heat exchanger UAu, interfacial heat flux, and Fopt govern cost minimization and create and control cost regimes within the overall cost-performance design domain. This shift of emphasis acknowledging the interdependence of optimum TE fill factors, heat exchanger performance, and interfacial heat flux has significant implications on thermoelectric WHR system designs, their performance, and their operation.

Exploring new models for improving planetary rover operations efficiency through the 2016 CanMars Mars Sample Return (MSR) analogue deployment	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; Rover; Analogue mission; Sample return; Mission operations	HABITABILITY	Approaches to rover mission operations were investigated in the framework of the CanMars Mars Sample Return (MSR) analogue mission deployments. Improving the efficiency of operations is a necessity for future planetary missions, including Mars 2020, which seek to combine sample targeting with in situ investigations in the fixed amount of time available in primary science operations and with increasingly high public and science community expectations for results. Analogue missions provide an important opportunity to experiment with mission operation strategies and learn lessons that can be incorporated in future missions. Improving the efficiency of operations was a key objective of the 2015 and 2016 CanMars mission deployment. The mission overall operations organisation for CanMars is described with comparison to current implementation of Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Science Laboratory missions. Approaches being tested included 3-sol plan sequences with increased use of waypoints for teach and return as part of a global Walkabout approach, use of Strategic Observation days to focus the Science Team's efforts, and consideration to improvements in how information is exchanged tactically and strategically in operations.

J	Hendricks, TJ				Hendricks, Terry J.			Thermoelectric System Economics: Where the Laws of Thermoelectrics, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Economics Intersect	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article								Thermoelectric technology has key benefits and strengths in many terrestrial energy recovery applications. Thermoelectric system cost is a key factor governing final decisions on the use of thermoelectric energy recovery systems in all terrestrial applications; thus cost being just as important as power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste energy recovery (WER) thermoelectric generators (TEG). New integrated cost analysis / thermoelectric analysis approaches have now shown key relationships and interdependencies between overall TEG system costs, including TE material costs, manufacturing costs, and specifically heat exchanger costs; and the TE performance design metrics such as TE material properties, TE device design parameters, heat exchanger performance metrics such as hot-side and cold-side conductances and UA values, and hot side heat flux in achieving optimal TEG WER designs. These new approaches have led to a new thermoelectric system economics paradigm that strongly influences TEG cost and performance decisions. While prior work provided foundations for the latest cost scaling analysis / TE performance analysis, this new work offers new insights and understandings and provides the basis for new thermoelectric system economics. Optimum TEG system cost conditions can now be tied directly to the TE materials, TEG design parameters, and heat exchanger design parameters through critical non-dimensional analysis. The non-dimensional analysis and metrics show the TEG system cost and performance interdependencies and intercouplings in one unifying and cohesive relationship. Prior work by T.J. Hendricks, S.K. Yee, and S. LeBlanc, J of Electronic Mater, 45, (3 ) , 1751-1761, 2015 has shown that the system design that minimizes cost (e.g., the G [$/W] value) can be close to designs that maximize power, but these design regimes are not necessarily aligned with high system conversion efficiency or high specific power. Key sensitivities and interrelationships between critical cost metrics and critical TE performance and design metrics in the new thermoelectric system economics paradigm are explored. Quantitative data showing these sensitivities and their implications on TEG system design in terrestrial WER applications are presented. Critical non-dimensional parameter mapping has shown where heat exchanger cost-dominated conditions, TE material or manufacturing cost-dominated conditions, and combinations of cost conditions control and drive the overall TEG cost and performance. This new cost-performance paradigm shows the required pathways and challenges to achieving TEG system costs of $1-$3/W-elec.

Ocean angular momentum from a recent global state estimate, with assessment of uncertainties	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Earth rotation variations; Satellite geodesy; Satellite gravity; Sea level change; Time variable gravity	MODEL; EXCITATION	Earth rotation studies require accurate knowledge of the global oceanic velocity and mass fields, for proper accounting of ocean angular momentum (OAM) effects on the planetary budget. We analyse a new OAM series (1992-2015) based on the solution of a global general circulation model constrained to most existing ocean data. The impact of the data-constrained optimization on OAM is substantial, and particularly essential for calculating effects of global mean ocean mass changes, which can be important for determining annual cycles and long term trends in OAM. The contributions of sea ice to OAM variations, also estimated, are found to be negligible. Uncertainties in OAM series are assessed by comparison with other available estimates. Results indicate low signal-to-noise ratios for all the analysed OAM series. Comparisons with geodetic, atmospheric and hydrologic data, in the context of the planetary angular momentum budget, point to the continued need for improvements in some or all of the series. Possible paths are offered for producing better OAM estimates in the future.	[Quinn, K. J.; Ponte, R.

The NASA Roadmap to Ocean Worlds	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Roadmap; Enceladus; Titan; Europa; Triton; NASA	SUBSURFACE OCEAN; ICE SHELL; EUROPA; WATER; ENCELADUS; SATELLITES; EVOLUTION; INTERIOR; PLANETS; CONSTRAINTS	In this article, we summarize the work of the NASA Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) group. The aim of this group is to assemble the scientific framework that will guide the exploration of ocean worlds, and to identify and prioritize science objectives for ocean worlds over the next several decades. The overarching goal of an Ocean Worlds exploration program as defined by ROW is to "identify ocean worlds, characterize their oceans, evaluate their habitability, search for life, and ultimately understand any life we find." The ROW team supports the creation of an exploration program that studies the full spectrum of ocean worlds, that is, not just the exploration of known ocean worlds such as Europa but candidate ocean worlds such as Triton as well. The ROW team finds that the confirmed ocean worlds Enceladus, Titan, and Europa are the highest priority bodies to target in the near term to address ROW goals. Triton is the highest priority candidate ocean world to target in the near term. A major finding of this study is that, to map out a coherent Ocean Worlds Program, significant input is required from studies here on Earth; rigorous Research and Analysis studies are called for to enable some future ocean worlds missions to be thoughtfully planned and undertaken. A second finding is that progress needs to be made in the area of collaborations between Earth ocean scientists and extraterrestrial ocean scientists.

However, given the extreme brightness ratio and small angular separation between planets and their host stars, the planet signal-to-noise ratio will likely be limited by the unwanted coupling of starlight into the fiber. To address this issue, we utilize a wavefront control loop and a deformable mirror to systematically reject starlight from the fiber by measuring what is transmitted through the fiber. The wavefront control algorithm is based on the formalism of electric field conjugation (EFC), which in our case accounts for the spatial mode selectivity of the fiber. This is achieved by using a control output that is the overlap integral of the electric field with the fundamental mode of a single-mode fiber. This quantity can be estimated by pairwise image plane probes injected using a deformable mirror. We present simulation and laboratory results that demonstrate our approach offers a significant improvement in starlight suppression through the fiber relative to a conventional EFC controller. With our experimental setup, which provides an initial normalized intensity of 3 x 10(-4) in the fiber at an angular separation of 4 lambda/D, we obtain a final normalized intensity of 3 x 10(-6) in monochromatic light at lambda = 635 nm through the fiber (100x suppression factor) and 2 x 10(-5) in Delta lambda/lambda = 8% broadband light about lambda = 625 nm (10x suppression factor). The fiber-based approach improves the sensitivity of spectral measurements at high contrast and may serve as an integral part of future space-based exoplanet imaging missions as well as ground-based instruments.

An equation for cloud-base height tendency isolates the individual cloud-modulating mechanisms that control the evolution of boundary-layer liquid-water static energy (S-1) and total water mixing ratio (qT). With a suitable spin-up procedure, the control simulation performs admirably compared with observed estimates of liquid water content, vertical velocity variance, and radiative fluxes sampled during an aircraft field campaign. Investigation of the cloud response to various environmental forcing scenarios was addressed through a suite of sensitivity simulations, including variations in subsidence velocity, surface fluxes, wind shear near the inversion, and radiative forcing. In the control simulation, rising cloud-base tendencies are associated with entrainment warming/drying and short-wave absorption, whereas lowering cloud-base tendencies are driven by long-wave cooling. Even in the presence of substantial afternoon solar heating, entrainment fluxes remained active. The thin cloud demonstrated unexpected resiliency, with mixed-layer analysis indicating that, as the short-wave flux decreases later in the afternoon, the relative contribution of long-wave cooling often becomes large enough to offset entrainment warming/drying and result in a reversal of cloud-base tendency. The evolution of cloud-base tendency is found to be insensitive to the net radiative flux divergence for most of the simulations (liquid water path ranging from similar to 10-50 g/m(2)). Error analysis in comparison with LES S-1 and qT budgets suggests that our method of entrainment flux calculation could be improved by a more complete understanding of entrainment-layer physics.

A 3D printed TE10 rectangular to TE01 circular waveguide transition for polymer waveguide characterization	2019 92ND ARFTG MICROWAVE MEASUREMENT CONFERENCE (ARFTG)			English	Proceedings Paper	92nd ARFTG Microwave Measurement Conference (ARFTG)	JAN 19-22, 2019	Orlando, FL	IEEE, MTT S, ARFTG		rectangular to circular transition; mode transducer; polymer waveguide; mm-wave	DESIGN	In this paper we present a copper plated 3D printed implementation of the Marie rectangular to circular wave-guide transition. The copper plated 3D printed structure allows to overcome machining limitation when dealing with curved surfaces, confining the signal propagation in air, thus avoiding losses from the printing polymers. waveguide flanges are employed at both the rectangular (WR-12) and circular port to perform a full TRL calibration when the transitions are used in a VNA environment. A step diameter taper is used on the circular port of the transition to facilitate testing of circular polymer waveguides of different diameters. Experimental characterization is carried out for multiple samples of polymer (i.e., Teflon) waveguides in the 65-90 GIlz range.

The backscattering ratio of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko dust coma as seen by OSIRIS onboard Rosetta	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						scattering; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	PHASE FUNCTION	Remote sensing observations of dust particles ejected from comets provide important hints on the intimate nature of the materials composing these primitive objects. The measurement of dust coma backscattering ratio, BSR, defined as the ratio of the reflectance at phase angle 0 degrees and 30 degrees, helps tuning theoretical models aimed at solving the inverse scattering problem deriving information on the nature of the ejected particles. The Rosetta/OSIRIS camera sampled the coma phase function of comet 67P, with four series acquired at low phase angles from 2015 January to 2016 May. We also added previously published data to our analysis to increase the temporal resolution of our findings. We measured a BSR in the range similar to [1.7-3.6], broader than the range found in literature from ground-based observations of other comets. We found that during the post-perihelion phase, the BSR is systematically larger than the classical cometary dust values only for nucleocentric distances smaller than similar to 100 km. We explain this trend in terms of a cloud of chunks orbiting the nucleus at distances <100 km ejected during perihelion and slowly collapsing on the nucleus over a few months because of the coma gas drag. This also implies that the threshold particle size for the dust phase function to become similar to the nucleus phase function is between 2.5 mm and 0.1 m, taking into account previous Rosetta findings.

Tests of gravitational symmetries with pulsar binary J1713+0747	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitation; binaries: general; stars: neutron; pulsars: individual (PSR J1713+0747)	STRONG EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE; RELATIVISTIC GRAVITY; LORENTZ INVARIANCE; CONSERVATION-LAWS; SCALAR THEORIES; MASS; DENSITY; LIMITS; STARS	Symmetries play a fundamental role in modern theories of gravity. The strong equivalence principle (SEP) constitutes a collection of gravitational symmetries which are all implemented by general relativity. Alternative theories, however, are generally expected to violate some aspects of SEP. We test three aspects of SEP using observed change rates in the orbital period and eccentricity of binary pulsar J1713+0747: (1) the gravitational constant's constancy as part of locational invariance of gravitation; (2) the universality of free fall (UFF) for strongly self-gravitating bodies; (3) the post-Newtonian parameter to in gravitational Lorentz invariance. Based on the pulsar timing result of the combined data set from the North American Nanohertz Gravitational Observatory and the European Pulsar Timing Array, we find (G) over dot/G = (-0.1 +/- 0.9) x 10(-12) yr(-1) , which is weaker than Solar system limits, but applies for strongly self-gravitating objects. Furthermore, we obtain an improved test for a UFF violation by a strongly self-gravitating mass falling in the gravitational field of our Galaxy, with a limit of vertical bar Delta vertical bar< 0.002 (95 per cent C.L.). Finally, we derive an improved limit on the self-acceleration of a gravitationally bound rotating body, to a preferred reference frame in the Universe, with -3 x 10(-20) < <(alpha)over cap>(3) < 4 x 10(-20) (95 per cent C.L.). These results are based on direct UFF and (alpha) over cap (3 )tests using pulsar binaries, and they overcome various limitations of previous tests of this kind.

These analyses differ in many aspects: the data sets, the shear and photometric redshift estimation algorithms, the theory model assumptions, and the inference pipelines. To assess the robustness of the existing cosmic shear results, we present in this paper a unified analysis of four of the recent cosmic shear surveys: the Deep Lens Survey (DLL), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), the Science Verification data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SV), and the 450 deg(2) release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KIDS-450). By using a unified pipeline, we show how the cosmological constraints are sensitive to the various details of the pipeline. We identify several analysis choices that can shift the cosmological constraints by a significant fraction of the uncertainties. For our fiducial analysis choice, considering a Gaussian covariance, conservative scale cuts, assuming no baryonic feedback contamination, identical cosmological parameter priors and intrinsic alignment treatments, we find the constraints (mean, 16 per cent and 84 per cent confidence intervals) on the parameter S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) to be S-8 = 0.942(-0.045)(+0.046)(DLS), 0.657(-0.070)(+0.071)(CFHTLenS), 0.844(-0.061)(+0.062) (DES-SV), and 0.755(-0.049)(+0.048)(KiDS-450). From the goodness-of-fit and the Bayesian evidence ratio, we determine that amongst the four surveys, the two more recent surveys, DES-SV and KiDS-450, have acceptable goodness of fit and are consistent with each other. The combined constraints are S-8 = 0.790(-0.041)(+0.042), which is in good agreement with the first year of DES cosmic shear results and recent CMB constraints from the Planck satellite.

Seasonal changes in plant-water relations influence patterns of leaf display in Miombo woodlands: evidence of water conservative strategies	TREE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hydraulic conductivity; leaf phenology; Miombo woodlands; plant-water relations; xylem safety margin	HYDRAULIC SAFETY MARGINS; DEVELOPING LEAVES; XYLEM CAVITATION; DRY FOREST; SOIL-WATER; PHENOLOGY; TREE; EMBOLISM; SAVANNA; STEM	Water availability has frequently been linked to seasonal leaf display in seasonally dry ecosystems, but there have been few ecohydrological investigations of this link. Miombo woodland is a dominant seasonally dry tropical forest ecosystem type in southern Africa; however, there are few data on the relationship between seasonal dynamics in plant-water relations and patterns of leaf display for Miombo woodland. Here we investigate this relationship among nine key Miombo woodland tree species differing in drought tolerance ability and leaf phenology. Results of this study showed that seasonal patterns of leaf phenology varied significantly with seasonal changes in stem water relations among the nine species. Leaf shedding coincided with the attainment of seasonal minimum stem water potential. Leaf flush occurred following xylem rehydration at the peak of the dry season suggesting that endogenous plant factors play a pivotal role in seasonal leaf display in this forest type. Drought-tolerant deciduous species suffered significantly higher seasonal losses in xylem hydraulic conductivity than the drought-intolerant semi-evergreen tree species (P < 0.05). There was a significant and positive correlation between species drought tolerance index and species' seasonal loss in hydraulic conductivity (P < 0.05), confirming the ecological role of long-distance xylem transport in this seasonally dry tropical forest. Our results reveal that water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests selects for water conservative traits that protect the vulnerable xylem transport system. Therefore, seasonal rhythms in xylem transport dictate patterns of leaf display in seasonally dry tropical forests.

The Taphonomy of Proterozoic Microbial Mats and Implications for Early Diagenetic Silicification	GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Proterozoic; Taphonomy; Angmaat Formation; microbial mats; silicification	MESOPROTEROZOIC BORDEN BASIN; STRELLEY POOL FORMATION; DISMAL LAKES GROUP; BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; SILICA DIAGENESIS; BAFFIN-ISLAND; NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS; BYLOT SUPERGROUP; CARBONATE RAMP	The complex nature of growth and decomposition in microbial mats results in a broad range of microbial preservation. Such taphonomic variability complicates both the description of microbial elements preserved within geologic materials and the potential interpretation of microbial biomarkers. This study uses a taphonomic assessment to explore the preservation of different microbial components within silicified microbial mats of the late Mesoproterozoic (similar to 1.0 Ga) Angmaat Formation, Bylot Supergroup, Baffin Island. The Angmaat Formation consists of unmetamorphosed and essentially undeformed strata that represent intertidal to supratidal deposition within an evaporative microbial flat. Early diagenetic silicification preserved microbial communities across a range of environments, from those episodically exposed to persistently submerged. Here, we present the development of a new methodology involving the use of high-resolution image mosaics to investigate the taphonomy of microfossils preserved in these mats. A taphonomic grade is assigned using a modified classification that accounts for both the taphonomic preservation state (good, fair, poor) of individual microfossils, as well as the degree of compaction of the overall mat. We show that although various taphonomic states occur within each of the silicified mats, the overall taphonomic assessment differentiates between well-preserved mats that are interpreted to have been silicified during active growth, to highly degraded and compacted mats that are interpreted to represent preservation during later stages of biological decomposition. These data indicate that even small changes in the timing of silicification may have substantial implications on our identification of microbial biomarkers and, therefore, our interpretation of early Earth ecosystems.

Thermal, Deformation, and Degassing Remote Sensing Time Series (CE 2000-2017) at the 47 most Active Volcanoes in Latin America: Implications for Volcanic Systems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							SOUFRIERE HILLS VOLCANO; MODERATE-MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKES; CENTRAL ANDES; SOUTHERN ANDES; VILLARRICA VOLCANO; COPAHUE VOLCANO; LASCAR VOLCANO; PACAYA VOLCANO; EXTRUSION RATE; CORDON CAULLE	Volcanoes are hazardous to local and global populations, but only a fraction are continuously monitored by ground-based sensors. For example, in Latin America, more than 60% of Holocene volcanoes are unmonitored, meaning long-term multiparameter data sets of volcanic activity are rare and sparse. We use satellite observations of degassing, thermal anomalies, and surface deformation spanning 17years at 47 of the most active volcanoes in Latin America and compare these data sets to ground-based observations archived by the Global Volcanism Program. This first comparison of multisatellite time series on a regional scale provides information regarding volcanic behavior during, noneruptive, pre-eruptive, syneruptive, and posteruptive periods. For example, at Copahue volcano, deviations from background activity in all three types of satellite measurements were manifested months to years in advance of renewed eruptive activity in 2012. By quantifying the amount of degassing, thermal output, and deformation measured at each of these volcanoes, we test the classification of these volcanoes as open or closed volcanic systems. We find that similar to 28% of the volcanoes do not fall into either classification, and the rest show elements of both, demonstrating a dynamic range of behavior that can change over time. Finally, we recommend how volcano monitoring could be improved through better coordination of available satellite-based capabilities and new instruments.

Surface Roughness and Gravitational Slope Distributions of Vesta and Ceres	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						asteroid; surface; roughness; impact cratering; impact ejecta	TOPOGRAPHIC ROUGHNESS; GRAVITY-FIELD; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; GEOLOGIC FEATURES; ROTATION PERIOD; SPIN POLE; 433 EROS; MERCURY; SHAPE; MARS	Heavily cratered terrains dominate the surfaces of asteroid 4 Vesta and dwarf planet 1 Ceres. The data from the Dawn spacecraft allowed reconstruction of high-resolution shape models of these bodies. We used the stereophotoclinometric shape models to compute gravitational slopes and topographic roughness of Vesta and Ceres. We compute the slope distributions of Vesta and Ceres and compare them to those of the other bodies with heavily cratered terrains. The distribution of slopes of Vesta and Ceres has a kink at approximate to 34 degrees. The slope distribution is steeper for slopes higher than approximate to 34 degrees. The Moon and Mars have a similar kink but at a lower (shallower) slope (approximate to 29 degrees-30 degrees). We hypothesize that this kink corresponds to the angle of repose, which is higher on the two minor bodies compared to that of Mars and the Moon. We have also analyzed the topographic roughness of Vesta and Ceres. Vesta's topography is characterized by lower roughness in the southern hemisphere that was resurfaced by giant impacts. The roughness of Ceres is mostly controlled by regional-scale geology with no significant large-scale variations. Large, fresh craters have smooth ejecta blankets on both Vesta and Ceres unlike previously observed rough ejecta on the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. On Ceres, the smooth ejecta craters also have smooth floors explained by impact slurry. Lineaments of elevated roughness are abundant on Ceres, whereas are nearly absent on Vesta. The roughness maps we produced provide a synoptic view of the surface texture and could be used to aid geologic mapping. Plain Language Summary We have computed and analyzed surface slopes of Vesta and Ceres. We find a deficiency of slopes steeper than a certain critical angle. We hypothesize that this angle is the angle of repose. Angle of repose is the natural maximum angle at which a pile of granular material can stay at rest. In addition, we find that this critical angle is approximately 4 degrees-5 degrees higher on Ceres and Vesta compared to Moon and Mars. This reason of this difference is unknown. We have also looked at the surface of roughness of Vesta and Ceres. We found that large, fresh craters on Vesta and Ceres have smooth surroundings, unlike craters on the Moon, Mars, and Mercury that have rough surroundings. On Ceres, craters also have smooth floors explained by impact slurry. Rays of high roughness are often seen on Ceres, whereas are nearly absent on Vesta. The roughness maps we produced provide a global view of the surface texture and could be used to aid geologic mapping.	[Ermakov, Anton I.; Scully, Jennifer E.

Water Vapor Contribution to Ceres' Exosphere From Observed Surface Ice and Postulated Ice-Exposing Impacts	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Ceres; water ice stability; impact craters; exosphere	SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; GROUND ICE; MODEL; PREDICTIONS; CONSTRAINTS; DEPOSITS; HISTORY; BELT	Telescopic observations have detected an exosphere around Ceres, composed of either water vapor or its photolytic products. Proposed mechanisms for its formation include sublimation or sputtering from solar energetic particles of buried ice, surface ice, or an optically thin seasonal polar cap. We estimate the amount of water vapor produced by known exposures of water ice, detected in Dawn spacecraft image and spectral data and by ice exposures from subresolution impact craters. We use thermal and sublimation modeling to take into account slope, orientation, and, in the case of water ice within craters, shadowing due to crater walls. We use a Monte Carlo approach to calculate the number of ice-exposing impacts, where they occur on Ceres' surface, and how long the ice within the impact crater remains bright (e.g., less than one monolayer of sublimation lag). We find that the observed water ice patches on Ceres could account for 0.06kg/s of water vapor to (with Oxo crater as the main contributor) and that ice-exposing impacts that remain bright in appearance after one Ceres year supply 0.08-0.56kg/s of vapor, depending on the regolith volume fraction of the ice. While water ice has not been detected to date at Occator crater, if it were present we find that Occator is unlikely to be a major contributor of vapor. We find a typical background water vapor production rate from all of Ceres, combining surface and buried ice, of about a few tenths of a kilogram per second. Plain Language Summary Ceres, the closest dwarf planet to the Sun, may be periodically surrounded with water vapor. This water vapor could be coming from water ice, either exposed at the surface or buried, undergoing temperature changes during Ceres' day and year. Vapor could also be released from ice that is bombarded by solar energetic particles. In this paper, we calculate how much water vapor could be produced from ice currently exposed on the surface of Ceres due to changes in temperature. We calculate the water vapor produced from observed surface water ice patches identified in Dawn spacecraft mission data. We also calculate water vapor produced from likely water ice patches that are exposed to space after a new impact crater forms but are too small to be seen by the Dawn spacecraft's instruments. We find that from these sources plus water vapor produced from buried water ice tables (calculated in other papers), about a few tenths of a kilogram per second of water vapor is likely to be escaping Ceres at the present day.

Abiotic Input of Fixed Nitrogen by Bolide Impacts to Gale Crater During the Hesperian: Insights From the Mars Science Laboratory	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; nitrogen fixation; nitrates; bolide impacts; Gale crater; Curiosity	ROCKNEST AEOLIAN DEPOSIT; NITRIC-OXIDE; NOX PRODUCTION; EARLY EARTH; EVOLUTION; ATMOSPHERE; FIXATION; HYDROGEN; SEDIMENTARY; VOLCANISM	Molecular hydrogen (H-2) from volcanic emissions is suggested to warm the Martian surface when carbon dioxide (CO2) levels dropped from the Noachian (4100 to 3700 Myr) to the Hesperian (3700 to 3000 Myr). Its presence is expected to shift the conversion of molecular nitrogen (N-2) into different forms of fixed nitrogen (N). Here we present experimental data and theoretical calculations that investigate the efficiency of nitrogen fixation by bolide impacts in CO2-N-2 atmospheres with or without H-2. Surprisingly, nitric oxide (NO) was produced more efficiently in 20% H-2 in spite of being a reducing agent and not likely to increase the rate of nitrogen oxidation. Nevertheless, its presence led to a faster cooling of the shock wave raising the freeze-out temperature of NO resulting in an enhanced yield. We estimate that the nitrogen fixation rate by bolide impacts varied from 7x10(-4) to 2x10(-3)gNMyr(-1)cm(-2) and could imply fluvial concentration to explain the nitrogen (1.40.7gNMyr(-1)cm(-2)) detected as nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) by Curiosity at Yellowknife Bay. One possible explanation is that the nitrogen detected in the lacustrine sediments at Gale was deposited entirely on the crater's surface and was subsequently dissolved and transported by superficial and ground waters to the lake during favorable wet climatic conditions. The nitrogen content sharply decreases in younger sediments of the Murray formation suggesting a decline of H-2 in the atmosphere and the rise of oxidizing conditions causing a shortage in the supply to putative microbial life. Plain Language Summary Climate models are able to warm early Mars when CO2 sources were strong but fail at later times when liquid water still flowed on the surface. A possible solution for the climate puzzle is the presence of abundant H-2 arising from volcanic emissions that could have kept the planet from freezing. H-2 could have also played a key role in the chemistry of the atmosphere. Curiosity discovered the presence of nitrites and nitrates, forms of fixed nitrogen that are required for the origin and sustainability of life in sediments in Gale crater. Here we present theoretical and experimental data that quantify the conversion of molecular nitrogen into fixed nitrogen in the presence and absence of H-2 by the entry shocks of asteroids in the Martian atmosphere and surface. Fixed nitrogen was originally deposited on the surface of Gale crater and then transported to the lake during favorable wet climatic conditions. We found that H-2 is required to yield sufficient fixed nitrogen to explain its detection. The levels of fixed nitrogen sharply dropped in younger sediments suggesting a decline of H-2 in the atmosphere and the rise of oxidizing conditions causing a nitrogen crisis to putative microbial communities.

Alan			Geologic Landforms and Chronostratigraphic History of Charon as Revealed by a Hemispheric Geologic Map	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						New Horizons; Charon; geologic map; tectonics; ice; comparative planetology	PLUTO; IMAGER; ICE	Geologic mapping has been used for over 200years as a technique to synthesize a complicated surface into a more simplified product, identifying similar types of surface features, and placing them into a relative stratigraphy. Geomorphologic mapping has applied those principles to other terrestrial bodies throughout the solar system and has formed an important product set to understand these surfaces, plan future exploration, and conduct different scientific endeavors. We created a geomorphologic map of the New Horizons encounter hemisphere of Pluto's binary companion, Charon. Ten primary geomorphologic unit categories were identified, covering approximately 35% of Charon's surface, and we used lower resolution data to speculate about other regions of Charon. Over 1,000 linear features were mapped, nearly 90% of them are tectonic in nature, and we use these to provide evidence of Charon being active in its past. Additionally, we placed the mapped features into a chronostratigraphic sequence, and we present a possible surface history for the body. The northern terrain typified by large crustal blocks is the oldest, having fractured early in Charon's history, and potentially similar blocks were submerged in a cryoflow of which the now solid surface of Vulcan Planitia is the remnant today. Plain Language Summary Planetary scientists will create geologic maps of a surface to perform different kinds of studies. Geologic maps identify features of different types and help to distill many different kinds of data into an easier to use format from which scientific investigations can be done. We have created such a map for Pluto's largest companion, Charon, imaged during the flyby of New Horizons in July 2015. This geologic map covers approximately 35% of the best-imaged region of Charon, and we mapped 16 different geologic units, over 1,000 linear features, and a variety of albedo features. We developed a chronology that places these features in time-order, and we provide potential interpretations of the different features that we mapped. We found that Charon has potentially one of the most convincing examples of possible large cryoflow(s) of any heretofore imaged body in the solar system.

Downscaling Vertical GPS Observations to Derive Watershed-Scale Hydrologic Loading in the Northern Rockies	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME; STORAGE; PRECIPITATION; DETECTABILITY; DEFORMATION; PREDICTION; COMPONENT; PATTERNS; UPLIFT; EARTH	GPS time series of vertical displacement include the elastic response of the Earth to a combination of regional and local loading signals arising from hydrologic mass transfer. The regional loading, controlled by seasonal, synoptic precipitation patterns, dominates the displacement of individual stations and is highly correlated among stations with separation distances from 10 to 300km. The local loading, controlled by small-scale precipitation and storage variability, has much shorter correlation lengths of <30km. We develop a new method to separate the regional and local contributions using common mode analysis and show that GPS is capable of measuring the local hydrologic load changes at watershed scales of tens of kilometers. Using this methodology, GPS-measured displacement provides an integrated measurement of hydrologic load at a spatial scale between the existing long-wavelength resolution of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and point measurement resolution of a precipitation station. Thus, GPS time series record critical observations for monitoring integrated hydrologic budgets at scales useful for water management and assessment of the hydro-ecological response to climate change. Plain Language Summary Even though estimating water quantity is critical for human communities, there are few good methods for doing so, especially in areas with lots of topography. Snow measurements and weather stations are only point observations that do not always represent the surrounding area, and satellite observations do not resolve small mountain watersheds well. We leverage the fact that the surface of the Earth is displaced by the weight of water, and that this deflection can be measured with GPS, to more accurately estimate water loading and unloading. We do this in snowpack-dominated areas of the northern Rockies and show that these methods complement the available tools.	[Knappe, E.; Bendick, R.; Martens, H. R.; Gardner, W.

Spin-Up of the Southern Hemisphere Super Gyre	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							EQUATORIAL CURRENT BIFURCATION; SST DIPOLE EVENTS; INDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN CIRCULATION; AGULHAS LEAKAGE; EXPENDABLE BATHYTHERMOGRAPH; SUBTROPICAL GYRE; TASMAN LEAKAGE	This study investigates the variability of the Southern Hemisphere super gyre (SHSG), using remotely sensed altimeter measurements, in situ Argo observations, and results from an ocean state estimate of the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean. Analyses of altimeter data show large trends of sea surface height, and their positive-negative contrast suggests a strengthening of subtropical gyres in all the three Southern Hemisphere oceans since 1993. Analyses of Argo data and the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean estimate indicate that these dynamic signals of southern subtropical gyres extend to at least 2,000m. The three southern subtropical gyres are interconnected through the Tasman and Agulhas leakages and vary consistently during the period 1993-2016. The Tasman and Agulhas leakages also show an increasing trend of inter-ocean water exchange with a typical increase of similar to 2 Sv (1 Sv=10(6)m(3)/s) per decade, indicative of a two-decade-long spin-up of the SHSG. The strengthening and poleward shift of westerly winds are associated with an increasing southern annular mode, which affect the midlatitude and high-latitude Southern Hemisphere oceans and contribute to the spin-up of the SHSG. Plain Language Summary The Southern Hemisphere super gyre (SHSG) is an interconnected circulation system of the southern subtropical gyres. It sweeps out of the Tasman Sea, transports water westward, and feeds the upper limb of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation through the Tasman and Agulhas leakages. The SHSG absorbs substantial quantities of atmospheric gases, such as oxygen and CO2, thus directly contributing to climate change. In this study, we analyze remotely sensed altimeter measurements, in situ observations, and outputs of an ocean general circulation model. The results reveal a two-decade-long spin-up of the SHSG. The inter-ocean exchange through the Tasman and Agulhas leakages shows an increasing trend during the period 1993-2016. This long-term trend may be attributed to changes in westerly winds associated with an increasing southern annular mode.

Southern Ocean Biogeochemical Float Deployment Strategy, With Example From the Greenwich Meridian Line (GO-SHIP A12)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							TOTAL GEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION; ANTARCTIC INTERMEDIATE WATER; GLOBAL OCEAN; SEA-ICE; PROFILING FLOATS; OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; MAUD-RISE; HEAT; CARBON	Biogeochemical Argo floats, profiling to 2,000-m depth, are being deployed throughout the Southern Ocean by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program (SOCCOM). The goal is 200 floats by 2020, to provide the first full set of annual cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, and optical properties across multiple oceanographic regimes. Building from no prior coverage to a sparse array, deployments are based on prior knowledge of water mass properties, mean frontal locations, mean circulation and eddy variability, winds, air-sea heat/freshwater/carbon exchange, prior Argo trajectories, and float simulations in the Southern Ocean State Estimate and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Twelve floats deployed from the 2014-2015 Polarstern cruise from South Africa to Antarctica are used as a test case to evaluate the deployment strategy adopted for SOCCOM's 20 deployment cruises and 126 floats to date. After several years, these floats continue to represent the deployment zones targeted in advance: (1) Weddell Gyre sea ice zone, observing the Antarctic Slope Front, and a decadally-rare polynya over Maud Rise; (2) Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) including the topographically steered Southern Zone chimney where upwelling carbon/nutrient-rich deep waters produce surprisingly large carbon dioxide outgassing; (3) Subantarctic and Subtropical zones between the ACC and Africa; and (4) Cape Basin. Argo floats and eddy-resolving HYCOM simulations were the best predictors of individual SOCCOM float pathways, with uncertainty after 2years of order 1,000km in the sea ice zone and more than double that in and north of the ACC. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, is a huge, very sparsely observed region. But we know from the decades of observations and from computer models that the Southern Ocean is a major player in the Earth's climate, taking up a significant fraction of the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and absorbing a large fraction of the extra heat that results from that extra carbon dioxide. The extra carbon dioxide is also acidifying the Southern Ocean waters. To observe these, we are expanding one of the major ocean-observing systems: Argo profiling floats that measure temperature and salinity to 2,000-m depth every 10days. SOCCOM has (1) added extra sensors that measure the ocean's pH, oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll, and particles; (2) developed algorithms to derive the rest of the carbon budget terms, and (3) vigorously expanded Argo into the enormous seasonal ice zone. We are deploying about 30 floats per year all around Antarctica. We describe our strategy for float deployments in 2014 in the large region between Africa and Antarctica, describing the circulation, water properties, and forcing of this region. We evaluate how well we met our goal of sampling each of the distinct oceanographic regimes.	[Talley, L. D.; Rosso, I.; Mazloff, M.

J	Sauer, K; Baumgartel, K; Sydora, R; Winterhalter, D				Sauer, Konrad; Baumgaertel, Klaus; Sydora, Richard; Winterhalter, Daniel			Parametric Decay of Ream-Generated Langmuir Waves and Three-wave Interaction in Plateau Plasmas: Implicatoins for Type III Radiation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							FINE-STRUCTURE; FREQUENCY; BURSTS; OSCILLATIONS; INSTABILITY; RELEVANCE; COLLAPSE	Inspired by the results of particle-in-cell simulations on beam-plasma interaction, we present a mechanism for the generation of radio waves in solar type III bursts which provides a closed chain of the conversion processes from beam-generated Langmuir waves into electromagnetic emission. The mechanism is characterized by two key steps. The first is a hitherto unknown parametric decay process in which the primary wave directly decays to low-k Langmuir waves (plasma oscillations) and ion acoustic waves. This decay becomes possible due to changes in the dispersion properties of longitudinal waves initiated by the presence of a beam or a plateau in the electron velocity distribution. A resonant three-wave interaction is established between the beam-induced Langmuir wave, the plasma oscillations, and the ion acoustic wave. Due to weak damping of the waves involved, this interaction persists after the beam has relaxed to a plateau and lasts as long as the latter exists. In the second step, low-k Langmuir waves in the range of "optical wavelengths" can linearly couple to obliquely propagating radio waves at the plasma frequency in a wave number region around the cross points where quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse modes approach each other. Our model does not need the persistence of the beam and the associated instability for radiation to be produced. Although the theory is local with respect to the plasma frequency, it may open a way to overcome Sturrock's (1964) dilemma of rapid beam relaxation on the one side and long-lived radiation on the other. The observed frequency variation is suggested to arise by "adiabatic" motion of the beam-created interaction region through the heliospheric plasma of decreasing electron density. Implications for the interpretation of in situ Langmuir waveforms and the diversity of their frequency spectra are discussed. Plain Language Summary The problem treated in our work belongs to one of the most investigated subjects of plasma physics, the interaction of a fast electron beam with a plasma. We focus on the generation of radio waves in this interaction and provide a closed chain of conversion processes from beam-generated Langmuir waves into electromagnetic emission. Key step is a hitherto unknown parametric decay process in which the primary wave directly decays into Langmuir waves of nearly zero wave number (Langmuir oscillations) and ion acoustic waves. This decay process becomes possible due to changes in the dispersion properties of the beam-plasma system induced by the beam itself and its subsequent relaxation to a plateau. The presence of Langmuir waves of "optical" wavelengths is the presupposition for mode coupling to radio waves. Our conclusions are based on 1-D particle simulations, solutions of the Zakharov equations, and analytical efforts. There are implications for the interpretation of so-called solar type III radio bursts. Sturrock (1964) pointed in this context to the discrepancy of rapid beam relaxation on the one side and long-lived radiation on the other. Our results may provide a way to overcome this dilemma.

Study of Terrestrial Glints Based on DSCOVR Observations	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							ORIENTED ICE CRYSTALS; SCATTERING; PARTICLES; EARTH	Small flashes of reflected light-called glints-are found in images taken by spacecraft observing the Earth, and occur due to specularly reflected solar radiation. These glints have been found over both ocean and land. Using Deep Space Climate Observatory observations, we show that glints over land are due to specular reflection off horizontally oriented ice platelets floating in the air, while glints over ocean have contributions from reflection off either platelets floating above the ocean or a relatively smooth ocean surface. We use a radiative transfer model to simulate different kinds of glints and to explore their properties. This technique of comparing observations of terrestrial glints with model simulations may provide new information relevant to atmospheric dynamics and the search for habitable exoplanets.

The result is an earthquake potential score that characterizes the current state of progress of a defined geographic region through its nominal earthquake "cycle." The count of small earthquakes since the last large earthquake is the natural time that has elapsed since the last large earthquake (Varotsos et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.021123). In addition to natural time, earthquake sequences can also be analyzed using Shannon information entropy ("information"), an idea that was pioneered by Shannon (1948, https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x). As a first step to add seismic information entropy into the nowcasting method, we incorporate magnitude information into the natural time counts by using event self-information. We find in this first application of seismic information entropy that the earthquake potential score values are similar to the values using only natural time. However, other characteristics of earthquake sequences, including the interevent time intervals, or the departure of higher magnitude events from the magnitude-frequency scaling line, may contain additional information.

This effort has been mostly restricted to the slow and painstaking manual digitalization of the calving front positions in thousands of satellite imagery products. Here, we have developed a machine learning toolkit to automatically detect glacier calving front margins in satellite imagery. The toolkit is based on semantic image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a modified U-Net architecture to isolate the calving fronts from satellite images after having been trained with a dataset of images and their corresponding manually-determined calving fronts. As a case study we train our neural network on a varied set of Landsat images with lowered resolutions from Jakobshavn, Sverdrup, and Kangerlussuaq glaciers, Greenland and test the results on images from Helheim glacier, Greenland to evaluate the performance of the approach. The neural network is able to identify the calving front in new images with a mean deviation of 96.3 m from the true fronts, equivalent to 1.97 pixels on average, while the corresponding error for manually-determined fronts on the same resolution images is 92.5 m (1.89 pixels). We find that the trained neural network significantly outperforms common edge detection techniques, and can be used to continuously map out calving-ice fronts with a variety of data products.

The focal plane arrays (FPAs) Noiie Equivalent Temperature Difference (NE Delta T), Quantum Efficiency (eta), Dark Current Density (J(D)), and Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) performance were measured at operating temperatures. High performance 640 x 512 array format MWIR High Operating Temperature (HOT) FPA has typical NE Delta T similar to 19 mK, J(D) similar to 6.2 x 10(-7) A/cm(2), and eta similar to 53% using 3-5 pm band pass filter at 115 K operating temperatures. Best performance 640 x 512 array format LWIR FPA has NE Delta T similar to 25 mK, J(D) similar to 2.5 x 10(-5) A/cm(2) and eta similar to 41% using 8-9.4 mu m band pass filter at 60 K operating temperatures. For MTF investigation, a novel direct one-to-one image approach of Line Spread Function (LSF) and Edge Spread Function (ESF) are patterned onto substrate-removed FPAs. The direct ISF and ESF image are produced by 1000 A degrees thick gold layer deposition. The direct image horizontal and vertical MTFs are compared with projected knife-edge ESF-derived MTFs and results indicate that direct image MTFs have higher values compared to projected knife-edge ESF-derived MTFs at a Nyquist frequency. However, direct image MIT requires no lens MTF correction. The only relevant requirement for the direct image MTF is for the deposited pattern and substrate to be extremely thinned in which the HOT-BIRD FPAs fulfilled for this investigation.

After achieving orbit at Saturn in 2004, Cassini collected science data throughout its four-year prime mission (2004-2008) and nine-year extended mission (2008-2017). The Cassini Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) is perhaps the spacecraft subsystem that must satisfy the most mission and science pointing requirements. The performance of the Cassini AACS design was superb from launch through end of mission. All key mission and science requirements were met with significant margins. Overviews of the Cassini attitude control system design and flight performance (in 1997-2017) are given in this paper. Processes taken by the attitude control operations team to guard against human errors are also outlined. Cassini flight experience and many lessons learned are equally applicable to the safe operations of other interplanetary missions.

The purpose of the project was to develop and mature aerodynamic decelerator technologies for landing large mass payloads on the surface of Mars. The technologies included an attached toroidal Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, a ballute, and supersonic parachutes. Two flight tests were conducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. Sufficient data were acquired to reconstruct the vehicle trajectory, main motor thrust, atmosphere, and aerodynamics for these two flight tests. This paper describes the instrumentation, analysis techniques, acquired data, and reconstruction results from these two flight tests. A technique for processing gimballed inertial measurement unit data is developed in which the inertial flight path of the instrument is reconstructed, which is then mapped back to the vehicle body frame as a postprocessing step.

Heterogeneous retreat and ice melt of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; GROUNDING LINE RETREAT; KOHLER GLACIERS; PINE ISLAND; SHELVES; SMITH	The glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, have undergone acceleration and grounding line retreat over the past few decades that may yield an irreversible mass loss. Using a constellation of satellites, we detect the evolution of ice velocity, ice thinning, and grounding line retreat of Thwaites Glacier from 1992 to 2017. The results reveal a complex pattern of retreat and icemelt, with sectors retreating at 0.8 km/year and floating icemelting at 200m/year, while others retreat at 0.3 km/year with icemelting 10 times slower. We interpret the results in terms of buoyancy/slope-driven seawater intrusion along preferential channels at tidal frequencies leading to more efficient melt in newly formed cavities. Such complexities in ice-ocean interaction are not currently represented in coupled ice sheet/ocean models.

Dynamics in the Phobos environment	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Phobos; Small body exploration; Astrodynamics; Surface motion	PERIODIC-ORBITS; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR	The dynamical environment on and about the Martian moon Phobos is explored. This planetary moon provides a unique dynamical environment in the solar system, being subject to extreme tidal forces and having a characteristically non-spherical shape. Further, it is not in a fully circular orbit, meaning that it has librations that arise from its eccentricity, contributing to a periodic forcing environment. Thus, to plan and implement missions in the vicinity of and on Phobos will require these considerations be taken into account. In this paper the latest published models of the Phobos shape and dynamics are used to characterize its dynamical environment in close proximity orbit about the body, for motion across its surface and for controlled hovering motion in its vicinity. It is found that surface motion is subject to a number of "speed limits" that can cause a moving vehicle to leave the surface and to possibly escape the moon and enter orbit about Mars. In terms of orbital stability, the existence of libration orbit families are characterized down to the surface using an exact potential, and the known stable QSO orbits are shown to be associated with families of stable quasi-periodic orbits.

The method leverages the unique mission dose rate profile to bound device performance and reduces qualification test time from 1 year to 80 days. In addition, a new testing approach that simulates the mission dose profile revealed interesting information about the nature of radiation-induced defects in these "rad-hard" bipolar process lines. Results show that unlike bipolar parts from older generations (very sensitive to enhanced low dose rate sensitivity), these new processes seem to be dominated by oxide traps (N-ot) and not interface traps (N-it). This appears to be consistent with the mitigation used by vendors for reducing hydrogen (H-2) contamination in their processing steps.

Multiscale Modeling of Total Ionizing Dose Effects in Commercial-off-the-Shelf Parts in Bipolar Technologies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	55th IEEE Nuclear and Space Radiation Effects Conference (NSREC)	JUL 16-20, 2018	Kona, HI	IEEE, IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, Radiat Effects Comm		Bipolar transistor; commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS); enhanced low-dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS); modeling; n-p-n; p-n-p; qualification; total ionizing dose (TID)	RATE SENSITIVITY ELDRS; RADIATION-INDUCED DEGRADATION; INTERFACE-TRAP FORMATION; INDUCED GAIN DEGRADATION; MOLECULAR-HYDROGEN; PASSIVATION LAYERS; LINEAR CIRCUITS; PHYSICAL MODEL; RATE RESPONSE; CHARGE	A multiscale modeling platform that supports the "virtual" qualification of commercial-off-the-shelf parts is presented. The multiscale approach is divided into two modules. The first module generates information related to the bipolar junction transistor gain degradation that is a function of fabrication process, operational, and environmental inputs. The second uses this information as inputs for radiation-enabled circuit simulations. The prototype platform described in this paper estimates the total ionizing dose and dose rate responses of linear bipolar integrated circuits for different families of components. The simulation and experimental results show good correlation and suggest this platform to be a complementary tool within the radiation-hardness assurance flow. The platform may reduce some of the costly reliance on testing for all systems.	[Privat, A.; Barnaby, H. J.; Tolleson, B.

We postprocess raw SSI images to obtain frames with only the radiation contribution. The camera settings (gain state, filter, and so on) are used to compute the intensity of the observed radiation hits. Simulating the response of the SSI instrument to mono-energetic electron environments, we find that the SSI is capable of detecting >= 10-MeV electrons (> 90% of < 10-MeV particles are stopped with 95% confidence). Using geometric factors computed for the SSI, we calculate the environment particle flux given a number of pixels with radiation hits. We compare the SSI results to measurements from the Galileo EPD, examining the electron fluxes from the EPD >11-MeV integral flux channel. We find agreement within 3 sigma of the EPD data for 43 out of 43 (100%) of the SSI images evaluated. 62% of fluxes are also within 1 sigma of the EPD data. This approach can be applied to other sets of imaging data (star trackers) in energetic electron environments, such as those found in geostationary Earth orbit.

The primary oceanographic objective is to characterize the ocean eddies at a spatial resolution of 15 km for 68% of the ocean surface. This resolution is derived from the ratio between the wavenumber spectrum of the conventional altimeter (projected to submesoscale) and the SWOT SSH errors. While the 15-km threshold is useful as a global approximation of the spatial scales resolved by SWOT (SWOT scale), it can be misleading for regional studies. Here we revisit the problem using a high-resolution (similar to 2-km horizontal grid spacing) tide-resolving global ocean simulation and map the SWOT scale as a function of location and season. The results show that the SWOT scale increases, in general, from about 15 km at low latitudes to similar to 30-45 km at mid-and high latitudes but with a large geographical dependence. A SWOT scale smaller than 30 km is expected in the high-latitude energetic regions. The SWOT scale varies seasonally as a result of the seasonality in both the noise and ocean signals. The seasonality also has a geographical dependence. Both eddies and internal gravity waves/tides contribute significantly to the SWOT scale variation. Our analysis provides model predictions for interpreting the anticipated observations from SWOT and guidance for the development of analysis methodologies.

J	Bekaert, DV; Gudipati, MS; Henderson, B; Marty, B				Bekaert, David V.; Gudipati, Murthy S.; Henderson, Bryana; Marty, Bernard			Coulomb explosion of multiply ionized xenon in water ice	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						xenon; comets; coulomb explosion; electron impact; multiple ionization	RARE-GAS CLUSTERS; NOBLE-GASES; CROSS-SECTIONS; IONIZATION; ATOMS; IONS; MULTIPHOTON; ARGON; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS	Laboratory investigations of noble gas trapping in amorphous water ice have been used to predict the noble gas composition of comets and infer on the origin of volatile elements within planetary bodies. However, the recent measurement of the noble gas composition of ice sublimating from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission calls for novel experiments regarding the mechanisms of noble gas trapping and evolution in cometary ice analogues. Here, we investigated the ionization dynamics of Xe atoms interacting with water ice using the recently developed Resonant TwoStep Laser Ablation Mass Spectrometry (2S-LAI-MS). Xenon-water mixed ice was ablated with an infrared beam set on the maximum absorption wavelength for water (lambda = 2948 nm) at which xenon atoms are kept neutral. Subsequent multiple ionization of xenon and oxygen resulted in periodic Coulomb explosions of Xen+ components (n is an element of [1;6]) and ionized water degradation products (OH+, H+, O+, O2+, O3+). Such explosions could only be detected when Xe and water were mixed together in ice, and not when separated in two overlaid layers. This paper discusses the potential mechanisms accounting for the generation of Coulomb explosions in these experiments and its relevance to cometary ice at closer distances to perihelion. We conclude that multiple ionization of xenon and oxygen in our experiment may be due to electron impact processes resembling cometary electron and ion bombardment, whereby energetic particles of hundreds of eV to a few keV are accelerated towards the comet's nucleus. Electron and ion bombardment could induce significant chemical modifications to, and potentially outgassing from, the cometary surface.

It is shown that at terahertz frequencies, conventional PSF measurement techniques are limited by the presence of strong scattering response of background objects, such as suspension threads, within the imaging field-of-view (FOV). Using acoustic levitation, it is possible to eliminate secondary objects within the FOV and achieve a pure PSF characterization of the radar. It is shown that the PSF patterns obtained using acoustic levitation exhibit high fidelity and are free from artifacts. We demonstrate this using a small water droplet suspended in air at the focus of the 340-GHz radar. The measured PSF characteristics of the radar are in excellent agreement with physical optics (PO) simulations and analytical results.

The lens antenna is based on the concept presented by Llombart et al. in 2011, a leaky-wave waveguide feed in order to achieve wide angle scanning and seamless integration with the receiver. The lens is translated from the origin of the waveguide producing the scanning of the beam over a 50 degrees field of view (FoV) (or about 6.25 beamwidths) with a maximum scanning loss of 1 dB. The lens movement is achieved with a piezoelectric motor that is integrated within the antenna and receiver block. A prototype was built and measured at 550 GHz achieving scanning beam angles close to 20 degrees with only 0.6 dB of loss. The scanning of the 50 degrees FoV, which corresponds to a lens displacement of approximately 2 mm, takes about 0.9 s achieving a scanning rate of 0.75 Hz of the FoV. The accuracy in continuous mode of the piezoactuator has been measured to be less than 28 mu m in the worse of cases for displacements of 2 mm, which corresponds to a beam steering of 0.76 degrees, much smaller than the antenna half-power beamvvidth of 8 degrees.

Yet, none of these theories has been implemented in two-dimensional (2D) (r-z) simulations and successfully predicted the behavior of the discharge and the erosion of a thruster over different operating conditions and geometries. We present results from numerical experiments with a 2D (r-z) axisymmetric hydrodynamics code that show the plasma solution is relatively insensitive to very large variations in the anomalous transport in some regions of the discharge channel and near-plume. Because the changes of the plasma properties in these regions can be too small or impossible to detect in the laboratory by conventional diagnostics, the verification of a transport model becomes very challenging. Hence, without more advanced diagnostics and improved numerical models, comparisons between plasma measurements and simulation results can lead to wide-ranging theories and scalings of the anomalous resistivity.

Automatic Detection and Tracking of Plumes from 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in Rosetta/OSIRIS Image Sequences	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual (67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko); methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing	OSIRIS	Solar system bodies such as comets and asteroids are known to eject material from their surface in the form of jets and plumes. Observations of these transient outbursts can offer insight into the inner workings and makeup of their originating body. However, the detection of and response to these events has thus far been manually controlled by ground operations, limiting the response time, due to the light time delay of ground communications. For distant bodies, the delay can exceed the duration of temporary events, making it impossible to respond with follow-up observations. To address this need, we developed a computer vision methodology for detecting plumes of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from imagery acquired by the OSIRIS scientific camera system. While methods exist for the automatic detection of plumes on spherical and near-convex solar system bodies, this is the first work that addresses the case of highly irregularly shaped bodies such as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our work is divided into two distinct components: an image processing pipeline that refines a model-based estimate of the nucleus body, and an iterative plume detection algorithm that finds regions of local intensity maxima and joins plume segments across successively higher altitudes. Finally, we validate this method by comparing automatically labeled images to those labeled by hand, and find no significant differences in variability. This technique has utility in both ground-based analysis of plume sequences as well as onboard applications, such as isolating short sequences of high activity for priority downloading or triggering follow-up observations with additional instruments.

It is surrounded by a prominent and complex debris disk that is likely stirred by one or several gas giant exoplanets. The discovery of the RV signature of a giant exoplanet was announced 15 yr ago, but has met with scrutiny due to possible confusion with stellar noise. We confirm the planet with a new compilation and analysis of precise RV data spanning 30 yr, and combine it with upper limits from our direct imaging search, the most sensitive ever performed. The deep images were taken in the Ms band (4.7 mu m) with the vortex coronagraph recently installed in W.M. Keck Observatory's infrared camera NIRC2, which opens a sensitive window for planet searches around nearby adolescent systems. The RV data and direct imaging upper limit maps were combined in an innovative joint Bayesian analysis, providing new constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the elusive planet. epsilon Eridani b has a mass of 0.78(-0.12)(+0.38) M-Jup and is orbiting epsilon Eridani at about 3.48 +/- 0.02 au with a period of 7.37 +/- 0.07 yr.

Discovery of delta Scuti Pulsations in the Young Hybrid Debris Disk Star HD 156623	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						open clusters and associations: individual (Upper Centaurus-Lupus, Sco-Cen); stars: early-type; stars: individual (HD 156623); stars: oscillations; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: delta Scuti	A-TYPE STARS; MAIN-SEQUENCE; BOLOMETRIC CORRECTIONS; ROTATIONAL VELOCITIES; EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE; MODEL ATMOSPHERES; TELESCOPE; PHOTOMETRY; CATALOG; COLORS	The bRing robotic observatory network was built to search for circumplanetary material within the transiting Hill sphere of the exoplanet beta Pic b across its bright host star beta Pic. During the bRing survey of beta Pic, it simultaneously monitored the brightnesses of thousands of bright stars in the southern sky (V similar or equal to 4-8, delta less than or similar to 30 degrees). In this work, we announce the discovery of delta Scuti pulsations in the A-type star HD 156623 using bRing data. HD 156623 is notable as it is a well-studied young star with a dusty and gas-rich debris disk, previously detected using ALMA. We present the observational results on the pulsation periods and amplitudes for HD 156623, discuss its evolutionary status, and provide further constraints on its nature and age. We find strong evidence of frequency regularity and grouping. We do not find evidence of frequency, amplitude, or phase modulation for any of the frequencies over the course of the observations. We show that HD 156623 is consistent with other hot and high-frequency pre-main sequence and early zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) delta Scutis as predicted by theoretical models and corresponding evolutionary tracks, although we observe that HD 156623 lies hotter than the theoretical blue edge of the classical instability strip. This, coupled with our characterization and Sco-Cen membership analyses, suggests that the star is most likely an outlying ZAMS member of the similar to 16 Myr Upper Centaurus-Lupus subgroup of the Sco-Cen association.

NuSTAR and Keck Observations of Heavily Obscured Quasars Selected by WISE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; X-RAY-SPECTRA; GALAXY MERGERS; SPACE DENSITY; LINE SPECTRA; HALO MASSES; 3C 273; LUMINOSITY; AGN	A primary aim of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission is to find and characterize heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Based on mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, we have selected a large population of luminous obscured AGNs (i.e., "obscured quasars"). Here we report NuSTAR observations of four WISE-selected heavily obscured quasars for which we have optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatory. Optical diagnostics confirm that all four targets are AGNs. With NuSTAR hard X-ray observations, three of the four objects are undetected, while the fourth has a marginal detection. We confirm that these objects have observed hard X-ray (10-40 keV) luminosities at or below similar to 10(43) erg s(-1). We compare X-ray and IR luminosities to obtain estimates of the hydrogen column densities (N-H) based on the suppression of the hard X-ray emission. We estimate N-H of these quasars to be at or larger than 10(25) cm(-2), confirming that WISE and optical selection can identify very heavily obscured quasars that may be missed in X-ray surveys, and they do not contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background. From the optical Balmer decrements, we found that our three extreme obscured targets lie in highly reddened host environments. This galactic extinction cannot adequately explain the more obscured AGNs, but it may imply a different scale of obscuration in the galaxy.

HAWC Sci Team	SOFIA Far-infrared Imaging Polarimetry of M82 and NGC 253: Exploring the Supergalactic Wind	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: starburst; instrumentation: polarimeters	MAGNETIC-FIELD GEOMETRY; STAR-FORMATION; COSMIC-RAY; POLARIZATION; EMISSION; RADIO; GALAXIES; NGC-253; NEBULA; ORIGIN	We present far-infrared polarimetry observations of M82 at 53 and 154 mu m and NGC 253 at 89 mu m, which were taken with High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+) in polarimetry mode on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. The polarization of M82 at 53 mu m clearly shows a magnetic field geometry perpendicular to the disk in the hot dust emission. For M82 the polarization at 154 mu m shows a combination of field geometry perpendicular to the disk in the nuclear region, but closer to parallel to the disk away from the nucleus. The fractional polarization at 53 mu m (154 mu m) ranges from 7% (3%) off nucleus to 0.5% (0.3%) near the nucleus. A simple interpretation of the observations of M82 invokes a massive polar outflow, dragging the field along, from a region similar to 700 pc in diameter that has entrained some of the gas and dust, creating a vertical field geometry seen mostly in the hotter (53 mu m) dust emission. This outflow sits within a larger disk with a more typical planar geometry that more strongly contributes to the cooler (154 mu m) dust emission. For NGC 253, the polarization at 89 mu m is dominated by a planar geometry in the tilted disk, with weak indication of a vertical geometry above and below the plane from the nucleus. The polarization observations of NGC 253 at 53 mu m were of a insufficient signal-to-noise ratio for a detailed analysis.

Ian; Castro, Jonathan M.; Davies, Ashley Gerard			The origin and evolution of breakouts in a cooling-limited rhyolite lava flow	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							CORDON-CAULLE; PAHOEHOE LAVA; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; VOLCANIC CENTER; GLASS MOUNTAIN; OBSIDIAN FLOW; EMPLACEMENT; ERUPTION; HISTORY; BASALT	Understanding lava flow processes is important for interpreting existing lavas and for hazard assessments. Although substantial progress has been made for basaltic lavas our understanding of silicic lava flows has seen limited recent advance. In particular, the formation of lava flow breakouts, which represent a characteristic process in cooling-limited basaltic lavas, but has not been described in established models of rhyolite emplacement. Using data from the 2011-2012 rhyolite eruption of Puyehue-CordOn Caulle, Chile, we develop the first conceptual framework to classify breakout types in silicic lavas, and to describe the processes involved in their progressive growth, inflation, and morphological change. By integrating multi-scale satellite, field, and textural data from Cordon Caulle, we interpret breakout formation to be driven by a combination of pressure increase (from local vesiculation in the lava flow core, as well as from continued supply via extended thermally preferential pathways) and a weakening of the surface crust through lateral spreading and fracturing. Small breakouts, potentially resulting more from local vesiculation than from continued magma supply, show a domed morphology, developing into petaloid as inflation increasingly fractures the surface crust. Continued growth and fracturing results in a rubbly morphology, with the most inflated breakouts developing into a cleft-split morphology, reminiscent of tumulus inflation structures seen in basalts. These distinct morphological classes result from the evolving relative contributions of continued breakout advance and inflation. The extended nature of some breakouts highlights the role of lava supply under a stationary crust, a process ubiquitous in inflating basalt lava flows that reflects the presence of thermally preferential pathways. Textural analyses of the Cordon Caulle breakouts also emphasize the importance of late-stage volatile exsolution and vesiculation within the lava flow. Although breakouts occur across the compositional spectrum of lava flows, the greater magma viscosity is likely to make late-stage vesiculation much more important for breakout development in silicic lavas than in basalts.

Strain patterns from Afar provide tests of current models of how segmented rifts grow in areas of incipient oceanic spreading. Here, we present a combined analysis of seismicity, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and GPS-derived strain rate maps to reveal that the plate-boundary linkage between the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifts of Afar is accommodated primarily by distributed extensional faulting. Large rotations about vertical axes predicted by bookshelf faulting models are not detected. Additionally, models of stress changes and seismicity induced by recent dikes provide poor fits to the observed time-space patterns of strike-slip earthquakes. Instead, we explain these features as resulting from rift-perpendicular shearing at the tips of spreading rifts where extension terminates against less stretched lithosphere. Our results demonstrate that distributed extension drives rift-perpendicular shearing, achieving plate-boundary linkage during incipient seafloor spreading.

Replication of the historic record of martian global dust storm occurrence in an atmospheric general circulation model	ICARUS			English	Article							INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARS; CYCLE; EARTH	The MarsWRF Mars general circulation model (GCM) with radiatively active dust and orbit-spin coupling reproduces the observational record of Mars years with and without global dust storms (GDS) with a success rate of 77%. Atmospheric conditions diagnostic to the occurrence or non-occurrence of GDS were successfully simulated in 17 of the 22 Mars years of the available historic record. Statistical significance at the 99% level is obtained in a comparison of success rates between an occurrence model with stochastic forcing and those of the GCM forced by orbit-spin coupling. These results provide proof of concept for the orbit-spin coupling hypothesis as a factor contributing to the observed interannual variability of the weather and climate of Mars.

A spectrophotometric study by means of Monte Carlo ray-tracing and Hapke's theory	ICARUS			English	Article						Saturn; Rings; Radiative transfer; Spectrophotometry	INFRARED MAPPING SPECTROMETER; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; SURFACE-COMPOSITION; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; FAR-ULTRAVIOLET; MU-M; PHASE; PHOTOMETRY; SIMULATIONS	This work is the second in a series of manuscripts devoted to the investigation of the spectrophotometric properties of Saturn's rings from Cassini-VIMS (Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) observations. The dataset used for this analysis is represented by ten radial spectrograms of the rings which have been derived in Filacchione et al. (2014) by radial mosaics produced by VIMS. Spectrograms report the measured radiance factor I/F of the main rings of Saturn as a function of both radial distance (from 73500 to 141375 km) and wavelength (0.35-5.1 mu m) for different observation geometries (phase angle ranging in the 2 degrees-132 degrees interval). We take advantage of a Monte Carlo ray-tracing routine (Ciarniello et al., 2014) to characterize the photometric behavior of the rings at each wavelength and derive the spectral Bond albedo of ring particles. This quantity is used to infer the composition of the regolith covering ring particles by applying Hapke's theory. Four different regions, characterized by different optical depths, and respectively located in the C ring, inner B ring, mid B ring and A ring, have been investigated. Results from photometric modeling indicate that, in the VIS-NIR spectral range, B ring particles are intrinsically brighter than A and C ring particles, with the latter having the lowest albedo, while the single particle phase function of the ring's particles is compatible with an Europa-like or Callisto-like formulation, depending on the investigated region. Spectral modeling of the inferred Bond albedo indicates that ring spectrum can be reproduced by water ice grains with inclusion of organic materials (tholin) as a UV absorber intimately mixed with variable amounts of other compounds in pure form (carbon, silicates) or embedded in water ice grains (nanophase hydrated iron oxides, carbon, silicates, crystalline hematite, metallic iron, troilite). The abundance of tholin decreases with radial distance from C ring (0.2-0.6%) to A ring (0.06%) for the selected regions. Its distribution is compatible with an intrinsic origin and is possibly related to the different plasma environment of the different ring regions. The identification of the other absorber(s) and its absolute volumetric abundance is uncertain, depending on the adopted grain size and mixing modality (intraparticle or intimate). However, assuming a common composition of the other absorber in the ring plane, we find that its abundance anti-correlates with the optical depth of the investigated regions, being maximum in the thinnest C ring and minimum in the thickest mid B ring. In the case of the C ring, an additional population of low-albedo grains is required to match the positive spectral slope of the continuum in the 0.55-2.2 pm interval, represented by an intraparticle mixture of water ice and a spectrum similar to troilite or metallic iron. The distribution of the darkening compounds is interpreted as the result of a contamination by exogenous material, which is more effective in the less dense regions of the rings because of their lower surface mass density of pure water ice.

J	Panning, MP; Kedar, S				Panning, Mark P.; Kedar, Sharon			Seismic response of the Mars Curiosity Rover: Implications for future planetary seismology	ICARUS			English	Article						Instrumentation; Geophysics; Interiors	NOISE; MISSION; SEISMOMETER; SURFACE	Seismic measurements are an important tool for exploration of planetary interiors, but may not be included in missions due to perceived complexity in placement of sensitive instruments on the surface. To help address this concern, we assess the fidelity of recordings of ground motion by an instrument placed on the deck of the engineering model of the Mars Science Laboratory compared with an identical instrument placed on the ground directly beneath. Comparison of the recordings reveals clear recordings of teleseismic earthquakes on both instruments. The transfer function between the instruments demonstrates the deck instrument is affected by resonance frequencies of the lander, and does not faithfully record ground motion at these frequencies or higher. In addition, additional decoherence is observed near 1 Hz during periods of strong airflow due to air conditioning cycling. However, excellent coherence and a transfer function near 1 can be observed in the important seismic band between 2 and 30 s at all times and extending up to the lander resonances during the night time when air conditioning was not running. This suggests a deck-mounted seismic instrument may be able to provide valuable science return without requiring additional deployment complexity.

Propene (propylene, C3H6) was first detected in 2013 with data from the Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument on Cassini. We present the first measured abundance profiles of propene on Titan from radiative transfer modeling, and compare our measurements to predictions derived from several photochemical models. Near the equator, propene is observed to have a peak abundance of 10 ppbv at a pressure of 0.2 mbar. Several photochemical models predict the amount at this pressure to be in the range 0.3-1 ppbv and also show a local minimum near 0.2 mbar which we do not see in our measurements. We also see that propene follows a different latitudinal trend than the other C-3 molecules. While propane and propyne concentrate near the winter pole, transported via a global convective cell, propene is most abundant above the equator. We retrieve vertical abundances profiles between 125 km and 375 km for these gases for latitude averages between 60 degrees S-20 degrees S, 20 degrees S-20 degrees N, and 20 degrees N-60 degrees N over two time periods, 2004 through 2009 representing Titan's atmosphere before the 2009 equinox, and 2012 through 2015 representing time after the equinox. Additionally, using newly corrected line data, we determined an updated upper limit for allene (propadiene, CH2CCH2, the isomer of propyne). We claim a 3-sigma upper limit mixing ratio of 2.5 x 10(-9) within 30 degrees of the equator. The measurements we present will further constrain photochemical models by refining reaction rates and the transport of these gases throughout Titan's atmosphere.

In order to measure the weak and narrow CO2 absorption band depths around 4.26 gm, we improved: (1) the calibration of VIMS spectra; (2) the calculation of geographic coordinates; and (3) the projection techniques. We averaged multiple observations of a given area to obtain a signal to noise ratio high enough to map the CO2 abundances. CO2 is reliably detected mostly in the South Polar Region. This region includes active faults (Tiger Stripes), the highest observed surface temperatures, and locations of active plume eruptions. The occurrence here of CO2 is consistent with an endogenic origin controlled by tectonics. Both pure CO2 ice and complexed CO2 are detected from the positions of absorption bands between 4.27 and 4.24 mu m. The highest concentrations of CO2 are between the main active faults of the South Polar Region, where the surface temperature is low. Pure CO2 ice deposits at the surface of Enceladus are best modeled by the formation of gas pockets below the icy crust and above the surface of the internal ocean. These pockets eventually release cold CO2 gas ( similar to 70 to similar to 119 K) at low-velocity (seeping) between the Tiger Stripes [Matson et al., 2018, Icarus, 302, 18 similar to 26]. CO2 clathrate hydrates may form in the ocean and may be subsequently released when a CO2 gas pocket blows out and erupts. Other mechanisms may contribute to reinforcing the anti-correlation of the CO2 distribution (of any type) with respect to the location of the Tiger Stripes, such as successive sublimation of CO2 and condensation on colder areas, and partial frost cover by H2O releases from plume eruptions.

VLA multi-wavelength microwave observations of Saturn's C and B rings	ICARUS			English	Article							INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; PARTICLE COMPOSITION; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SCATTERING; SYSTEM; WAVELENGTH; ANGLES; WAVES	We present multi-wavelength VLA observations in the microwave of Saturn's rings. The data were obtained over two observational windows and cover a range from the Q to S bands (0.7-13 cm). Key ring particle properties are determined in the C and B rings such as particle porosity and non-icy material fraction in order to compare them directly with previously derived results using the 2-cm Cassini RADAR radiometry data (Zhang et al., 2017a, b). We confirm that these new data are consistent with the particles in the C ring being quite porous with porosity values of roughly 75-90% depending on different scattering phase functions, as well as the presence of a "hot band" in the middle C ring which is associated with both an anomalously high non-icy material fraction and low opacity relative to the rest of the C ring. Furthermore, with our multi-wavelength study we find that the amount of intrinsic thermal emission is almost constant with wavelength, which is unexpected since particles tend to become more absorbing at higher frequencies. If we assume that the non-icy material in the rings is intramixed within the ring particles, this result suggests a corresponding decrease in the imaginary part of the non-icy material dielectric constant at higher frequencies, which is most noticeable in the middle C ring. We do not see evidence for such decrease in the B ring particles. If true, this supports the idea that the non-icy material in the middle C ring has a different origin, and that the larger particles in the middle C ring may be composed of a rocky core covered by a porous, icy mantle. If the non-icy materials in the middle C ring are embedded as large chunks, a core-mantle model for the ring particles there naturally explains this almost constant intrinsic thermal emission. Furthermore, because the VLA has more complete azimuthal angle coverage than the Cassini radiometry observations, we are able to investigate the ring brightness in more detail. In particular, we notice a flatter scattering profile than that predicted by using a pure Mie phase function at higher frequencies (Q and K bands; 0.7-1.3 cm) for azimuthal angles between vertical bar 40 vertical bar degrees and vertical bar 60 vertical bar degrees. We can match the observed scattering profile better by introducing a semi-empirical phase function for large particles to account for nonsphericity effects. Finally, the non-icy material fraction in the B ring is less than 1%, which is in agreement with that derived from Cassini observations. The frequency-dependence of the B ring thermal emission sets the lower limit of B ring particle porosity. We confirm that the B ring particles are likely over 80% porous, which at the same time explains the high opacity in the B ring as measured from density waves. Because we are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio, the optical depth of the middle B ring could be higher than the currently accepted values. However, we found that even if the middle B ring is six times more optically thick than the value measured from UVIS occultations, the surface mass density is still likely to be less than 300 g/cm(2,) while the exposure time to non-icy pollutants due to micrometeoroid bombardment is less than 200 Myr.

An initial assessment of the impact of postulated orbit-spin coupling on Mars dust storm variability in fully interactive dust simulations	ICARUS			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; SURFACE; CYCLE; VIKING; REPRESENTATION; EVOLUTION; TRANSPORT; CLIMATE	A weak coupling between the rotational and orbital angular momenta of Mars has been postulated to produce a 'coupling term acceleration' (CTA) that accelerates the wind field and is asynchronous with the seasonal cycle of solar forcing (Shirley, 2017). This paper presents the first GCM simulations of a fully interactive dust cycle with the CTA included, enabling storm sizes, onset times and locations to be predicted. The inclusion of the CTA greatly augments interannual variability in the occurrence and timing of GDS, with the nature of the storm season strongly linked to the phasing and amplitude of the orbit-spin coupling. This dramatically improves the model's skill at predicting GDS and non-GDS Mars Years (MY) compared to a GCM without CTA forcing. The model is clearly wrong in only 4 out of 22 well-observed storm seasons and is able to capture the general onset time of most observed storms as well as some onset locations. In years when the CTA forcing has large positive amplitudes around perihelion, GDS with onset near perihelion occur due to a net strengthening of the single-cell Hadley circulation at this time, while earlier (or later) GDS are likely produced by more localized constructive interference between the CTA and tidal/topographic flows at a time of peak forcing amplitudes. The latter may be more sensitive to errors in the assumed surface dust availability, which may explain why a late GDS observed in MY 10 is not predicted. Depletion of surface dust in source regions by GDS in prior years may have prevented a GDS from occurring in the real MY 17, when a large GDS is incorrectly predicted. Early GDS are observed but not predicted in two MYs (12 and 25) with large negative CTA forcing amplitudes around perihelion, which may be associated with a lack of water cycle coupling in these simulations. Other missing physical processes, imperfect dust parameterizations or parameter values, the assumption of unlimited surface dust availability, or the wrong CTA strength may account for other mismatches. A GDS is predicted close to perihelion in the current storm season, MY34 (2018), with a smaller GDS predicted later next Mars year, MY35 (2020). The CTA forcing in MY 34 is very similar to that of MY 21, in which a GDS is correctly predicted by the model.	[Newman, C. E.; Lee, C.; Richardson, M.

Earth's Energy Imbalance Measured From Space	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Accelerometer; earth's energy imbalance; global warming; low earth orbit satellites; remote sensing	SEA-LEVEL BUDGET; ELECTROSTATIC ACCELEROMETER; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; ATMOSPHERE RADIATION; OUTGOING RADIATION; AERODYNAMIC LIFT; OCEAN; DECAY; ORBIT	The direct measurement of earth's energy imbalance (EEI) is one of the greatest challenges in climate research. The global mean EEI represents the integrated value of global warming and is tightly linked to changes in hydrological cycle and the habitability of our planet. Current space-born radiometers measure the individual radiative components of the energy balance with unprecedented stability, but with calibration errors too large to determine the absolute magnitude of global mean EEI as the components' residual. Best estimates of the long-term EEI are currently derived from temporal changes in ocean heat content at similar to 0.7 Wm(-2). To monitor EEI directly from space, we propose an independent approach based on accelerometry that measures nongravitational forces, such as radiation pressure, acting on earth-orbiting spacecrafts. The concept of deriving EEI from radiation pressure has been considered in the past, and we provide analysis that shows today's capabilities are sufficiently accurate to answer the question: At what rate is our planet warming? To measure global mean EEI to within at least +/- 0.3 Wm(-2) requires spacecraft(s) of near-spherical shape and well-characterized surface properties to reduce confounding effects. The proposed concept may provide the basis for a data record of global and zonal mean EEI on annual and potentially monthly timescales. It is not meant to replace the existing concepts designed to measure energy balance components or ocean heat storage, but to complement these by providing an independent estimate of EEI for comparison and to anchor data products and climate models that lack energy balance closure.

High-precision measurements of krypton and xenon isotopes with a new static-mode quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							NOBLE-GASES; PHASE-Q; U-PB; ATMOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; RELAX; MARS; XE	Measuring the abundance and isotopic composition of noble gases in planetary atmospheres can answer fundamental questions in cosmochemistry and comparative planetology. However, noble gases are rare elements, a feature making their measurement challenging even on Earth. Furthermore, in space applications, power consumption, volume and mass constraints on spacecraft instrument accommodations require the development of compact innovative instruments able to meet the engineering requirements of the mission while still meeting the science requirements. Here we demonstrate the ability of the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QITMS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech, Pasadena) to measure low quantities of heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) in static operating mode and in the absence of a buffer gas such as helium. The sensitivity reaches 10(13) cps Torr(-1) (about 10(11) cps Pa-1) of gas (Kr or Xe). The instrument is able to measure gas in static mode for extended periods of time (up to 48 h) enabling the acquisition of thousands of isotope ratios per measurement. Errors on isotope ratios follow predictions of the counting statistics and the instrument provides reproducible results over several days of measurements. For example, 1.7 x 10(-10) Torr (2.3 x 10(-8) Pa) of Kr measured continuously for 7 hours yielded a 0.6 parts per thousand precision on the Kr-86/Kr-84 ratio. Measurements of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples reproduce values from the literature. A compact instrument based upon the QITMS design would have a sensitivity high enough to reach the precision on isotope ratios (e.g. better than 1% for Xe-129,Xe-131-136/Xe-130 ratios) necessary for a scientific payload measuring noble gases collected in the Venus atmosphere.

New Horizons Geology Geophys	Washboard and fluted terrains on Pluto as evidence for ancient glaciation	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SPUTNIK PLANITIA; BLADED TERRAIN; SURFACE; CHARON; REORIENTATION; TOPOGRAPHY	Distinctive landscapes termed 'washboard' and 'fluted' terrains(1,2), which border the N-2 ice plains of Sputnik Planitia along its northwest margin, are among the most enigmatic landforms yet seen on Pluto. These terrains consist of parallel to sub-parallel ridges that display a remarkably consistent east-northeast-west-southwest orientation-a configuration that does not readily point to a simple analogous terrestrial or planetary process or landform. Here, we report on mapping and analysis of their morphometry and distribution as a means to determine their origin. Based on their occurrence in generally low-elevation, low-relief settings adjacent to Sputnik Planitia that coincide with a major tectonic system, and through comparison with fields of sublimation pits seen in southern Sputnik Planitia, we conclude that washboard and fluted terrains represent crustal debris that were buoyant in pitted glacial N-2 ice that formerly covered this area, and which were deposited after the N-2 ice receded via sublimation. Crater surface age estimates indicate that this N-2 ice glaciation formed and disappeared early in Pluto's history, soon after formation of the Sputnik Planitia basin. These terrains constitute an entirely new category of glacial landform.	[White, Oliver L.; McKinnon, William B.; Beyer, Ross A.; Ore, Cristina M.

Results of a systematic search for outburst events in 1.4 million galaxies	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: general; galaxies: active; galaxies: photometry; supernovae: general	OBSERVATORY SUPERNOVA SEARCH; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; TIDAL DISRUPTION; BLACK-HOLES; EMISSION; RATES; STAR; POPULATION	We present an analysis of 9 yr of Catalina Surveys optical photometry for 1.4 million spectroscopically confirmed SDSS galaxies. We find 717 outburst events that were not reported by ongoing transient surveys. These events have time-scales ranging from weeks to years. More than two-thirds of these new events are found in star-forming galaxies, while such galaxies only constitute similar to 20 per cent of our sample. Based on the properties of the hosts and events, we find that almost all of the new events are likely to be associated with regular supernovae. However, a small number of long time-scale events are found among the galaxies containing AGNs. These events have similar properties to those recently found in the analyses of light curves of large samples of AGNs. Given the lack of such events among more than a million passive galaxies in the sample, we suggest that the long outbursts are associated with supermassive black holes or their environments.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: weak lensing mass calibration of redMaPPer galaxy clusters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations	COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; GIANTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; VARIANCE; PROFILES; IMPACT; MODEL; CODE; BIAS	We constrain the mass-richness scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clusters identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data using weak gravitational lensing. We split clusters into 4 x 3 bins of richness lambda and redshift z for lambda >= 20 and 0.2 <= z <= 0.65 and measure the mean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modelling the scaling relation as M-200m|lambda, M-0(lambda/40)(F)((1 + /1.35)(G), we constrain the normalization of the scaling relation at the 5.0 per cent level, finding M-0 = [3.081 +/- 0.075(stat) +/- 0.133(sys)] center dot 10(14) M-aS (TM) at lambda = 40 and = 0.35. The recovered richness scaling index is F = 1.356 +/- 0.051 (stat) +/- 0.008 (sys) and the redshift scaling index G = -0.30 +/- 0.30 (stat) +/- 0.06 (sys). These are the tightest measurements of the normalization and richness scaling index made to date from a weak lensing experiment. We use a semi-analytic covariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weak lensing profiles. Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematic error: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentring, cluster member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modelling of the halo-mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection effects. We discuss prospects for reducing our systematic error budget, which dominates the uncertainty on M-0. Our result is in excellent agreement with, but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in the literature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey as a tool for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST.

Correlation function	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	SURVEY COSMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; GALAXY REDSHIFT SURVEY; POWER-SPECTRUM; PERTURBATION-THEORY; ICE-COLA; ACCURATE; SPACE; PEAK; GENERATION	This paper is the first in a set that analyses the covariance matrices of clustering statistics obtained from several approximate methods for gravitational structure formation. We focus here on the covariance matrices of anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories: predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field deterministically (ICE-COLA, PEAK PATCH, and PINOCCHIO), methods that require a calibration with N-body simulations (PATCHY and HALOGEN), and simpler recipes based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations (lognormal and Gaussian density fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover the mean parameter values inferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results within 5 per cent for our lower mass threshold and 10 per cent for our higher mass threshold. Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to 20 per cent depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with no single method clearly outperforming the others.

Characteristics of organic matter on Ceres from VIR/Dawn high spatial resolution spectra	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						astrochemistry; techniques: imaging spectroscopy; minor planet: Ceres	AMINO-ACIDS; AMMONIATED PHYLLOSILICATES; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; SOLID BITUMENS; EVOLUTION; SURFACE; ORIGIN; MURCHISON; HYDROCARBONS	Ceres is the largest object in the main belt and is a wet body with a complex geological and chemical history. Its surface is composed of opaque materials, phyllosilicates, ammoniated-bearing minerals, carbonates, water ice, and salts. Recently, aliphatic organics, whose origin is still uncertain, have also been detected on the Ceres surface by the imaging spectrometer Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) on board Dawn. Here, using VIR spectra, acquired with a high spatial resolution (< 100 m), we have analysed the organic-rich areas, their spectral characteristics, and the associated mineralogy. The new VIR spectra in the 3.2-3.6 mu m spectral range have been compared to organic standard compounds measured in the laboratory, to investigate more deeply the nature of the organic matter on Ceres. The mineralogy appears quite complex, and the organic matter is often associated with a larger amount of ammoniated phases and carbonates. The detailed spectral analysis, as well as the laboratory comparison, reveal the presence of a band at 2.99-3 mu m, likely associated with organic or inorganic NH-compounds (amine or salts), and the organic matter may be characterized by a rather low abundance of oxygen atoms. Spectral models of the organic material indicate that hundreds of meters-size areas can be very rich in aliphatic organics, with an estimated organic amount larger than the quantity normally found in CC meteorites. The mineralogical context and the retrieved amounts suggest that the aliphatic organic is likely a Ceres' endogenous product, and we formulate a hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the organic matter inside Ceres.

Dark Energy Survey Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: galaxy sample for BAO measurement	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						large-scale structure of Universe; cosmology: observations	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; POWER-SPECTRUM; DEEP SURVEY; SCALE; COVARIANCE; MODEL; I.	We define and characterize a sample of 1.3million galaxies extracted from the first year of Dark Energy Survey data, optimized to measure baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the presence of significant redshift uncertainties. The sample is dominated by luminous red galaxies located at redshifts z greater than or similar to 0.6. We define the exact selection using colour and magnitude cuts that balance the need of high number densities and small photometric redshift uncertainties, using the corresponding forecasted BAO distance error as a figure-of-merit in the process. The typical photo z uncertainty varies from 2.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent (in units of 1+z) from z = 0.6 to 1, with number densities from 200 to 130 galaxies per deg(2) in tomographic bins of width Delta z = 0.1. Next, we summarize the validation of the photometric redshift estimation. We characterize and mitigate observational systematics including stellar contamination and show that the clustering on large scales is robust in front of those contaminants. We show that the clustering signal in the autocorrelations and cross-correlations is generally consistent with theoretical models, which serve as an additional test of the redshift distributions.

Image simulations for gravitational lensing with SKYLENS	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; galaxies: clusters: general; dark energy; dark matter	GALAXIES; PARAMETERS; CAMERA; STARS	We present the latest version of the ray-tracing simulation code SKYLENS, which can be used to develop image simulations that reproduce strong lensing observations by any mass distribution with a high level of realism. Improvements of the code with respect to previous versions include the implementation of the multilens plane formalism, the use of denoised source galaxies from the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, and the simulation of substructures in lensed arcs and images, based on a morphological analysis of bright nearby galaxies. SKYLENS can simulate observations with virtually any telescope. We present examples of space- and ground-based observations of a galaxy cluster through the Wide Field Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Near-Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide Field Imager of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the Hyper Suprime Camera of the Subaru telescope, and the Visible Imaging Channel of the Euclid space mission.

Goldstone Radar Observations of Horseshoe-orbiting Near-Earth Asteroid 2013 BS45, a Potential Mission Target	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual (2013 B545); techniques: radar astronomy	SURFACE; COMPANION; REVISION; REGOLITH; BOULDERS; TOUTATIS; SHAPE; SIZE	We report radar observations of near-Earth asteroid 2013 B545 obtained during the 2013 apparition. This object is in a resonant, Earth-like orbit, and it is a backup target for NASA's NEA Scout mission. 2013 B545 belongs to the Arjuna orbital domain, which currently has similar to 20 discovered representatives. These objects tend to be small and difficult to characterize, and 2013 B545 is only the third Aijuna object observed with radar to date. We observed 2013 B545 on three days at Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) between 2013 February 10 and 13. The closest approach occurred on February 12 at a distance of 0.0126 au. We obtained relatively weak echo power spectra and ranging data at resolutions up to 0.125 mu s (18.75 m px(-1)). The Doppler broadening of the echo power spectra strongly suggests an upper bound on the rotation period of 1.9 minutes. The radar data, in combination with an assumption that the asteroid's radar albedo is no higher than that of metallic NEA 1986 DA, constrain the equivalent diameter to 15 m <= D <= 38 m. The circular polarization ratio is 0.21 +/- 0.06, which implies a near-surface that is relatively smooth on decimeter spatial scales. We bounded the OC radar albedo to eta(OC) >= 0.09 and the optical albedo remains relatively unconstrained at 0.05 <= pv <= 0.35. The Yarkovsky acceleration has not been detected but, due to the object's rapid rotation, would be dominated by a seasonal component whose direction and magnitude depends on the currently unknown pole orientation and thermal inertia.

Ground-based Spectroscopy of the Exoplanet XO-2b Using a Systematic Wavelength Calibration	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; methods: analytical; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; planets and satellites: individual (XO-2b); techniques: spectroscopic	ATMOSPHERIC SURVEY DETECTION; HOT-JUPITER; TRANSMISSION SPECTRA; ATOMIC DATA; HD 189733B; SODIUM; NA; ASTROPHYSICS; ABSORPTION; SCATTERING	Exoplanets orbiting close to their host star are expected to support a large ionosphere, which extends to larger pressures than witnessed in our solar system. These ionospheres can be investigated with ground-based transit observations of the optical signatures of alkali metals, which are the source of the ions. However, most ground- based transit spectra do not systematically resolve the wings of the features and continuum, as needed to constrain the alkali abundances. Here we present new observations and analyses of optical transit spectra that cover the Na doublet in the atmosphere of the exoplanet XO-2b. To assess the consistency of our results, observations were obtained from two separate platforms: Gemini/GMOS and Mayall/KOSMOS. To mitigate the systematic errors, we chose XO-2, because it has a binary companion of the same brightness and stellar type, which provides an ideal reference star to model Earth's atmospheric effects. We find that interpretation of the data is highly sensitive to time-varying translations along the detector, which change according to wavelength and differ between the target and reference star. It was necessary to employ a time-dependent cross-correlation to align our wavelength bins and correct for atmospheric differential refraction. This approach allows us to resolve the wings of the Na line across five wavelength bins at a resolution of similar to 1.6 nm and limit the abundance of Na. We obtain consistent results from each telescope with an Na amplitude of 521 +/- 161 and 403 +/- 186 ppm for GMOS and KOSMOS, respectively. The results are analyzed with a radiative transfer model that includes the effects of ionization. The data are consistent with a clear atmosphere between similar to 1 and 100 mbar that establishes a lower limit on Na at 0.4(-0.3)(+2) ppm ([Na/H] = -0.64(-0.6)(+0.78)), consistent with solar. However, we cannot rule out the presence of clouds at similar to 10 mbar that allow for higher Na abundances, which would be consistent with the stellar metallicity measured for the host star ([Na/H] = 0.485 +/- 0.043)	[Pearson, Kyle A.; Griffith, Caitlin A.; Koskinen, Tommi T.] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, 1629 East Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Pearson, Kyle A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Francisco St, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Zellem, Robert T.; Roudier, Gael M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA	Pearson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, 1629 East Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Pearson, KA (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Francisco St, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.

Yet, the associated changes in ice flow that lead to mass redistribution and modify the glacier sensitivity to climate are poorly constrained. Here we present observations of changes in ice flow for all glaciers in High Mountain Asia over the period 2000-2017, based on one million pairs of optical satellite images. Trend analysis reveals that in 9 of the 11 surveyed regions, glaciers show sustained slowdown concomitant with ice thinning. In contrast, the stable or thickening glaciers of the Karakoram and West Kunlun regions experience slightly accelerated glacier flow. Up to 94% of the variability in velocity change between regions can be explained by changes in gravitational driving stress, which in turn is largely controlled by changes in ice thickness. We conclude that, despite the complexities of individual glacier behaviour, decadal and regional changes in ice flow are largely insensitive to changes in conditions at the bed of the glacier and can be well estimated from ice thickness change and slope alone.

Their structural attributes vary considerably across spatial scales, yielding large uncertainties in regional and global estimates of carbon stocks. Here, we present a global analysis of mangrove canopy height gradients and aboveground carbon stocks based on remotely sensed measurements and field data. Our study highlights that precipitation, temperature and cyclone frequency explain 74% of the global trends in maximum canopy height, with other geophysical factors influencing the observed variability at local and regional scales. We find the tallest mangrove forests in Gabon, equatorial Africa, where stands attain 62.8 m. The total global mangrove carbon stock (above- and belowground biomass, and soil) is estimated at 5.03 Pg, with a quarter of this value stored in Indonesia. Our analysis implies sensitivity of mangrove structure to climate change, and offers a baseline to monitor national and regional trends in mangrove carbon stocks.

Emulation of environmental models using polynomial chaos expansion	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Model emulation; Surrogate modeling; Polynomial chaos expansion; Sensitivity analysis	PARTIAL-DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; STOCHASTIC COLLOCATION METHOD; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; REGRESSION METAMODEL; DATA ASSIMILATION; PART I; SIMULATION; UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMICS	This paper investigates the applicability of model emulation to speed up simulation time of CPU intensive environmental models. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) emulators are constructed for three case studies of increasing complexity. The level of emulator training and the order of polynomial necessary to sufficiently build accurate emulators for each model are investigated. Although the PCE emulators shown here do not approximate well the outputs of parameter rich models (80 + parameters), results demonstrate that the emulators mimic closely outputs of relatively simple, low dimensional, simulation models (15 parameters or less). Furthermore, the PCE emulators are tested with applications such as Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Results illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of using classical PCE emulators for treating computational limitation of complex environmental models.

Extreme C-13-depletions and organic sulfur content argue for S-fueled anaerobic methane oxidation in 2.72 Ga old stromatolites	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Early life; SIMS; Carbon isotopes; Organic matter; Stromatolites; Sulfurization; Tumbiana formation; Methanotrophy	CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION; MICROBIAL SULFATE REDUCTION; AEROBIC NITROGEN-CYCLE; FORTESCUE GROUP; PILBARA-CRATON; ACETOCLASTIC METHANOGENESIS; OXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS; NITRATE REDUCTION; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA	The extreme C-13-depletions recorded in Neoarchean organic matter (OM) have commonly been interpreted as markers of methanotrophy. This methane oxidation metabolism could have been performed using oxidants such as dioxygen, sulfate, nitrite/nitrate, and/or Fe3+- and Mn4+- minerals. Acetogenesis using acetyl-CoA metabolism may produce similar C-13-depletions. We investigated delta C-13 and S/C values of OM in 2.72 Ga old lacustrine stromatolites of the Tumbiana Formation (Australia) using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), coupled with X-ray spectroscopy. Type-A OM is embedded in quartz and/or chlorite. We show that mixtures of chlorite bias negatively the delta C-13(org) of associated OM measured by SIMS, likely through recombination of hydrogen from chlorite with carbon from OM during analysis. Type-A OM, associated with quartz or interleaved with chlorites (but remote enough to avoid H-recombination), displays delta C-13(org) between -56.1 and -50.6% VPDB (mean: 53.5%, SD +/- 1.8%). The intimate association of Type-A OM with Fe-rich chlorite and its main occurrence in pyritic layers coupled with C-13-depletions is most parsimoniously interpreted as anaerobic methanotrophy using Fe3+- minerals and/or oxidized S. Type-B OM comprises <2-mu m organic globules embedded in calcite. A mass balance correction using the delta C-13 values measured on Type-B globules mixed with calcite and those measured on pure calcite yielded corrected delta C-13*(org) values for the globules ranging between -65.2 and -52.5% (mean -58.8%, SD +/- 3.6%). In a context where Fe and S reduction could outcompete acetogenesis for a fraction of any available H-2, these extremely low delta C-13(org) values are difficult to explain with chemoautotrophic acetogenesis. Atomic S/C ratios in Type-B globules reach up to 0.042, i.e. up to tenfold the values (0.003-0.004) in Type A-OM. These organic S concentrations, combined with the extremely low delta C-13*(org) values, support anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfur oxidation. Finally, Type-C OM, interpreted as migrated pyrobitumen nodules, displays delta C-13(org) of -48 to -39.1%. The most extreme low-delta C-13(org) values of the Precambrian are thus best interpreted as the result of lacustrine methanotrophy fueled by oxidized S and/or Fe species, which likely derived from oxygenic and/or anoxygenic photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, followed by methanogenesis and methanotrophy may have been important in lakes at a time of supercontinent growth and eruption of large subaerial igneous provinces. In this context, anaerobic methanotrophy could have played a part in regulating atmospheric methane. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design and performance evaluation of LTP enhancements for lossy space channels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						delay-/disruption-tolerant networking; interplanetary networking; Licklider Transmission Protocol; performance evaluation; space communications	TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL LTP; TOLERANT NETWORKING; DTN	This paper deals with the performance of Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) in space environment, focusing on the impact of segment losses and the design of possible improvements. The in-depth analysis of retransmission mechanisms carried out in the paper shows that, while LTP already achieves delivery time performance very close to the theoretical optimum in ideal conditions (no losses) and when losses affect data segments, a substantial improvement is still possible concerning signaling segments, whose loss can result in a significant increase of the LTP block delivery time. To this end, 2 simple enhancements, the Closing State and the proactive retransmission of signaling segments, are proposed and evaluated in the paper. Both enhancements have been added as optional features to the original Interplanetary Overlay Network LTP implementation (ION 3.5.0), in order to evaluate their effectiveness on a GNU/Linux testbed running the full protocol stack. Results presented in the paper confirm the validity of the proposed enhancements, as they significantly reduce the average delivery time in the presence of high losses and provide the additional advantage, even when losses are relatively low, of largely reducing the difference between average and worst cases.

Importantly, the RV technique provides information about the exoplanet mass, which is unavailable with the complementary technique of transit photometry. However, RV detection of an Earth-like planet in the 'habitable zone'(1) requires extreme spectroscopic precision that is only possible using a laser frequency comb (LFC)(2). Conventional LFCs require complex filtering steps to be compatible with astronomical spectro-graphs, but a new chip-based microresonator device, the Kerr soliton microcomb(3-8), is an ideal match for astronomical spectrograph resolution and can eliminate these filtering steps. Here, we demonstrate an atomic/molecular line-referenced soliton microcomb for calibration of astronomical spectro-graphs. These devices can ultimately provide LFC systems that would occupy only a few cubic centimetres(9,10), thereby greatly expanding implementation of these technologies into remote and mobile environments beyond the research lab.

A custom-built wide-field camera provides a 47 deg(2) field of view and 8 s readout time, yielding more than an order of magnitude improvement in survey speed relative to its predecessor survey, the Palomar Transient Factory. We describe the design and implementation of the camera and observing system. The ZTF data system at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center provides near-real-time reduction to identify moving and varying objects. We outline the analysis pipelines, data products, and associated archive. Finally, we present on-sky performance analysis and first scientific results from commissioning and the early survey. ZTF's public alert stream will serve as a useful precursor for that of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.	[Bellm, Eric C.; Bolin, Bryce; Connolly, Andrew; Eadie, Gwendolyn; Golkhou, V.

The Zwicky Transient Facility: Data Processing, Products, and Archive	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						astronomical databases: miscellaneous; catalogs; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	PHOTOMETRY	The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new robotic time-domain survey currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern visible sky at rates of similar to 3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g similar to 20.8 and r similar to 20.6 mag (AB, 5 sigma in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines, alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and analyzing the products. The real-time pipeline employs a novel image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point-source transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures are also extracted and vetted. We present some preliminary results of the calibration performance delivered by the real-time pipeline. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per science image with respect to Gaia DR1 is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is the RMS per-axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N >= 10 and hence corresponds to the typical astrometric uncertainty down to this limit. The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes varies between 8 and 25 millimag. The high end of these ranges corresponds to an airmass approaching similar to 2-the limit of the public survey. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2%. The products support a broad range of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae; rare flux transients; variable stars; eclipsing binaries; variability from active galactic nuclei;counterparts to gravitational wave sources; a more complete census of Type Ia supernovae; and solar-system objects.

Today, islands within the Delta have subsided to the point where most lie below mean sea level. Long-term sustainability of the Delta requires reversal of subsidence, but spatially comprehensive maps of subsidence have not been available to inform and monitor remediation. Reported here is the first spatially dense map of recent subsidence rates across the Delta, based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry and constrained by GNSS observations. The analysis uses a temporally dense and spatially overlapping set of data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) sensor in 2009-2015. On average, the Delta is subsiding by 9.2 +/- 4.4 mm/yr with high variability even at the sub-island scale, including peak subsidence of 160 +/- 4.4 mm/yr occurring just inland of the levee of the westernmost island and average subsidence of 11 mm/yr along the planned path of water conveyance tunnels through the Delta. The results are compared to local sea level rise (SLR), measured at a tidal gauge in San Francisco Bay, to show that subsidence is currently the dominant contributor to local relative sea level rise (RSLR) by nearly a factor of five. Based on recently measured and modeled acceleration of SLR, subsidence in the Delta is likely to dominate RSLR until the middle of the 21th century.	[Bekaert, David P.

J	Aumann, HH; Behrangi, A; Wang, Y				Aumann, Hartmut H.; Behrangi, Ali; Wang, Yuan			Increased Frequency of Extreme Tropical Deep Convection: AIRS Observations and Climate Model Predictions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate sensitivity; severe storms; AIRS; climate models	SYSTEM MODEL; CLOUD; RESOLUTION; RAINFALL	Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data from the tropical oceans (30 degrees N to 30 degrees S) are used to derive the probability of the process resulting in deep convective clouds (DCCs) as function of the sea surface temperature (SST). For DCC at or below the tropopause the onset temperature of this process shifts at the same rate as the increase in the mean SST. For tropopause overshooting DCC, which are associated with extreme rain events, the shift of the onset temperature is slower, causing their frequency to increase by about 21%/K of warming of the oceans. This sensitivity is not inconsistent with the sensitivity of the increase of extreme deep convective rain in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 model for a warmer SST. The mean of the 36 fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models predicts a 2.7 K warmer tropical SST by the end of this century, resulting in a 60% increases in the frequency of tropopause overshooting DCC. Plain Language Summary We use 15 years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations of the tropical oceans to derive the probability of the deep convective cloud (DCC) process as a function of the sea surface temperature. Based on this, the frequency of extreme (tropopause overshooting) DCCs will increase about 21% per 1 K of warming of the tropical oceans. Tropopause overshooting DCC are correlated with extreme rain rates. We evaluated the expected increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 model in a warmer tropical ocean. The increase of extreme rain rates in the model is consistent with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder-derived increase in frequency of extreme DCC. The mean of the fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models predicts a 2.7 K increase in the surface temperature of the tropical oceans by the end of this century. This means that the frequency of extreme DCC in the tropical oceans could increase by about 60%.

We demonstrate that a non-periodic cut pattern can cause a sheet to buckle into three-dimensional shapes, such as domes or patterns of wrinkles, when pulled at specific boundary points. These global buckling modes are observed in experiments and rationalized by an in-plane kinematic analysis that highlights the role of the geometric frustration arising from non-periodicity. The study focuses on elastic sheets, and is later extended to elastic-plastic materials to achieve shape retention. Our work illustrates a scalable route towards the fabrication of three-dimensional objects with nonzero Gaussian curvature from initially-flat sheets.

From Point to Area: Worldwide Assessment of the Representativeness of Monthly Surface Solar Radiation Records	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						surface solar radiation; representativeness; near-global assessment; decorrelation length; spatial sampling error; spatial sampling bias	SATELLITE-BASED RETRIEVAL; SHORTWAVE RADIATION; ENERGY-BALANCE; VALIDATION; IRRADIANCE; FLUXES; VARIABILITY; NETWORK; EUROPE; TRENDS	The representativeness of surface solar radiation (SSR) point observations is an important issue when using them in combination with gridded data. We conduct a comprehensive near-global (50 degrees Sto55 degrees N) analysis on the representativeness of SSR point observations on the monthly mean time scale. Thereto, we apply the existing concepts of decorrelation lengths (), spatial sampling biases (), and spatial sampling errors (epsilon) to three high-resolution gridded monthly mean SSR data sets (CLARA, SARAH-P, and SARAH-E) provided by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring. While quantifies the area for which a point observation is representative, and epsilon are uncertainty estimates with respect to the 1-degree reference grid (G). For this grid we find a near-global average (G)=3.4 degrees, (G)=1.4W/m(2), and epsilon(G)=7.6W/m(2) with substantial regional differences. Disregarding tropical, mountainous, and some coastal regions, monthly SSR point observations can largely be considered representative of a 1-degree grid. Since epsilon is an uncorrectable error the total uncertainty when combining point with 1-degree gridded data is roughly 40% higher than the uncertainty of station-based SSR measurements alone if a rigorous bias correction is applied. Cloud cover and terrain data can at maximum explain 50% of the patterns of the representativeness metrics. We apply our methodology to the stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. Overall, this study shows that representativeness is strongly dependent on local conditions and that all three metrics (, , and epsilon) must be considered for a comprehensive assessment of representativeness. Plain Language Summary Station-based observations are the most robust way to measure the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface (surface solar radiation [SSR]). These measurements are point observations yet are often used in combination with satellite or model data (e.g., for validation or for derivation of other quantities). The latter have a typical spatial extent up to a few hundred kilometers. Thus, it is important that the point observations are representative of this large area. In this paper, we show that the representativeness of SSR point observations varies regionally and is strongly dependent on local conditions. We find that some regions are problematic in terms of representativeness. However, in most regions SSR point observations can be considered representative for a 1-degree grid. We quantified additional uncertainties, which have to be taken into account when combining point and gridded data.

To realistically resolve the 3-D development of a spill on the ocean surface and in the water column, recently published parameterizations for the vertical mixing of oil spills are implemented in the open-source trajectory framework OpenDrift (https://doi org/10.5281/zenodo.1300358, last access: 7 April 2018). The parameterizations include the wave entrainment of oil, two alternative formulations for the droplet size spectra, and turbulent mixing. The performance of the integrated oil spill model is evaluated by comparing model simulations with airborne observations of an oil slick. The results show that an accurate description of a chain of physical processes, in particular vertical mixing and oil weathering, is needed to represent the horizontal spreading of the oil spill. Using ensembles of simulations of hypothetic oil spills, the general drift behavior of an oil spill during the first 10 days after initial spillage is evaluated in relation to how vertical processes control the horizontal transport. Transport of oil between the surface slick and the water column is identified as a crucial component affecting the horizontal transport of oil spills. The vertical processes are shown to control differences in the drift of various types of oil and in various weather conditions.

Gaia 17bpi: An FU Ori-type Outburst	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: activity; stars: general; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: general; stars: winds, outflows	ERUPTIVE VARIABLE PROTOSTARS; GALACTIC PLANE; INFRARED SURVEY; TELESCOPE; STARS	We report on the source Gaia 17bpi and identify it as a new, ongoing FU Ori-type outburst, associated with a young stellar object. The optical light curve from Gaia exhibited a 3.5 mag rise with the source appearing to plateau in mid-/late 2018. Mid-infrared observations from NEOWISE also show a >3 mag rise that occurred in two stages, with the second one coincident with the optical brightening, and the first one preceding the optical brightening by similar to 1.5 yr. We model the outburst as having started between October and December of 2014. This wavelength-dependent aspect of young star accretion-driven outbursts has never been documented before. Both the mid-infrared and the optical colors of the object become bluer as the outburst proceeds. Optical spectroscopic characteristics in the outburst phase include: a GK-type absorption spectrum, strong wind/outflow in, e.g., Mgb, NaD, H alpha, K I, O I, and Ca II profiles, and detection of Li I 6707 angstrom. The infrared spectrum in the outburst phase is similar to that of an M-type spectrum, notably exhibiting prominent H2O and (CO)-C-12 (2-0) bandhead absorption in the K band, and likely He I wind in the Y band. The new FU Ori source Gaia 17bpi is associated with a little-studied dark cloud in the galactic plane, located at a distance of 1.27 kpc.

For AGNs off the Galactic plane, it has been possible to use existing X-ray archival data to improve source localizations, identify optical counterparts, and classify the AGNs with optical spectroscopy. However, near the Galactic plane, better X-ray positions are necessary to achieve optical or near-IR identifications due to the higher levels of source crowding. Thus, we have used observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to obtain the best possible X-ray positions. With eight observations, we have obtained coverage for 19 NuSTAR serendips within 12 degrees of the plane. One or two Chandra sources are detected within the error circle of 15 of the serendips, and we report on these sources and search for optical counterparts. For one source (NuSTAR J202421+3350.9), we obtained a new optical spectrum and detected the presence of hydrogen emission lines. The source is Galactic, and we argue that it is likely a cataclysmic variable. For the other sources, the Chandra positions will enable future classifications in order to place limits on faint Galactic populations, including high-mass X-ray binaries and magnetars.

The Distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei in Galaxy Clusters at z similar to 1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; infrared: galaxies; radio continuum: galaxies	EFFICIENT PHOTOMETRIC SELECTION; X-RAY; HOST GALAXIES; EVOLUTION; RADIO; QUASARS; SKY; STELLAR; CONSTRAINTS; FRACTION	We present an analysis of the radial distribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in 2300 galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Survey (MaDCoWS). MaDCoWS provides the largest coverage of the extragalactic sky for a cluster sample at z similar to 1. We use literature catalogs of AGNs selected via optical, midinfrared (MIR), and radio data, and by optical-to-MIR (OIR) color. Stacking the radial distribution of AGNs within the 6' of the centers of MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, we find a distinct overdensity of AGNs within 1' of the galaxy cluster center for AGNs of all selection methods. The fraction of red galaxies that host AGNs as a function of clustercentric distance is, however, dependent on the AGN selection. The fraction of red galaxies in cluster environments that host AGNs selected by optical signatures or blue OIR color is at a deficit compared to the field, whereas MIR-selected and red OIR color AGNs are enhanced in the centers of clusters when compared to field levels. The radio-selected AGN fraction is more than 2.5 times that of the field, implying that the centers of clusters are conducive to the triggering of radio emission in AGNs. We do not find a statistically significant change in the AGN fraction as a function of cluster richness. We also investigate the correlation of central radio activity with other AGNs in galaxy clusters. Clusters with radio activity have more central AGNs than do radio-inactive clusters, implying that central cluster radio activity and AGN triggering may be linked.

We find that [C II] and the SFR surface density are well correlated in the central, spiral arm, and inter-arm regions. The correlation is in good agreement with that found for a larger sample of nearby galaxies at kpc scales. We find that the SFR, and [C II] and TIR luminosities in M51, are dominated by the extended emission in M51's disk. The companion galaxy M51b, however, shows a deficit of [C II] emission compared with the TIR emission and SFR surface density, with [C II] emission detected only in the SW part of this galaxy. The [C II] deficit is associated with an enhanced dust temperature in this galaxy. We interpret the faint [C II] emission in M51b to be a result of suppressed star formation in this galaxy, while the bright mid-and far-infrared emission, which drive the TIR and SFR values, are powered by other mechanisms. A similar but less-pronounced effect is seen at the location of the black hole in M51's center. The observed [C II] deficit in M51b suggests that this galaxy is a valuable laboratory to study the origin of the apparent [C II] deficit observed in ultra-luminous galaxies.

Data from this satellite are being exploited to improve forecasting of extreme weather events and delivery of disaster response. International core validation sites (CVSs) have been contributing in situ soil moisture data to validate and calibrate SMAP soil moisture products. Overall the soil moisture retrieval errors have exceeded SMAP's mission requirement (errors below 0.04 m(3) m(-3)), with the exception of some sites of annual cropland as present at the Carman (Canada) CVS. In 2016, a SMAP validation experiment was conducted at the Canadian site in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB) in an attempt to understand the differences between the SMAP soil moisture retrievals and the permanent in situ network observations. The research presented here analyzed the performance of this network in representing soil moisture within a SMAP pixel and tested five upscaling approaches. Comparisons between the permanent network and SMAPVEX16-MB measurements (from temporary stations and field measures) confirmed agreement among these three sources of soil moisture measures. The SMAP soil moisture values were compared with in situ soil moisture upscaled from the four tested approaches as well as soil moisture estimated by the NOAH Land Surface Model (LSM). There were similar discrepancies when analyzing all methods (RMSE 0.072-0.074 m(3) m(-3) for the four upscaling methods; 0.076 m(3) m(-3) for the LSM approach), yielding no reduction in the soil moisture RMSE for this site. The SMAP team will continue to investigate other factors that may be contributing to errors above 0.04 m(3) m(-3) at these annually cropped CVSs.	[Bhuiyan, Hassan A. K.

J	Mahjoub, A; Hodyss, R				Mahjoub, Ahmed; Hodyss, Robert			Thermal Reaction in Cometary and Pre-cometary Ices: Formation of Thiocarbamate in OCS-CH3NH2 Mixed Ices	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrobiology; astrochemistry; comets: general; methods: laboratory: solid state	CORRELATED MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; SOLID-STATE; ACID; CARBAMATE; SULFUR; IRRADIATION; CH3NHCOOH	Cometary ices are rich sources of organic molecules relevant to prebiotic chemistry and may have played a key role in the delivery of the building blocks of life to Earth. Comets endure thermal processing of their surfaces during their orbits around the Sun. Furthermore, icy grain precursors of cometary materials may have experienced heating in the solar nebula. Despite the important role that this thermal processing could play in the chemistry of ices, little effort has been devoted to understanding the purely thermal reactivity involving electronically stable molecules. Both methylamine (CH3NH2) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) have been detected in the cometary coma of comets, particularly in 67P-Churyumov-Geramenisko (67P) visited by the Rosetta spacecraft. We present here the first laboratory study addressing the reactivity induced by thermal processing of methylamine and OCS mixed ice. Mimicking a realistic scenario within which the surface of the comet is thermally processed as a result of its path close to the Sun, we demonstrate that the methylthiocarbamate anion in salt with methylammonium, [CH3NHOCS](-) [CH3NH3](+), and thiocarbamic acid dimer are formed by nucleophilic addition of OCS on methylamine. This study shows that a thermally driven reaction chemically analogous to the one proposed as a condensing pathway of amino acids in the early Earth may take place in cometary ice. The formed thiocarbamate is a known intermediate in the formation of peptides. Furthermore, the consumption of OCS by this reaction with methylamine may account for the missing sulfur in dense clouds and protostars.

It can be used to measure a variety of atmospheric constituents at very high temporal and spatial resolutions. While the number of lidars continues to increase worldwide, there is generally a dependency on an operator, particularly for high-powered lidar systems. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has recently developed a fully autonomous, mobile lidar system called AMOLITE (Autonomous Mobile Ozone Lidar Instrument for Tropospheric Experiments) to simultaneously measure the vertical profile of tropospheric ozone, aerosol and water vapor (night-time only) from near the ground to altitudes reaching 10 to 15 km. This current system uses a dual-laser, dual-lidar design housed in a single climate-controlled trailer. Ozone profiles are measured by the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique using a single 1 m Raman cell filled with CO2. The DIAL wavelengths of 287 and 299 nm are generated as the second and third Stokes lines resulting from stimulated Raman scattering of the cell pumped using the fourth harmonic of a Nd: YAG laser (266 nm). The aerosol lidar transmits three wavelengths simultaneously (355, 532 and 1064 nm) employing a detector designed to measure the three backscatter channels, two nitrogen Raman channels (387 and 607 nm) and one cross-polarization channel at 355 nm. In addition, we added a water vapor channel arising from the Raman-shifted 355 nm output (407 nm) to provide nighttime water vapor profiles. AMOLITE participated in a validation experiment alongside four other ozone DIAL systems before being deployed to the ECCC Oski-otin ground site in the Alberta oil sands region in November 2016. Ozone was found to increase throughout the troposphere by as much as a factor of 2 from stratospheric intrusions. The dry stratospheric air within the intrusion was measured to be less than 0.2 g kg(-1). A biomass burning event that impacted the region over an 8-day period produced lidar ratios of 35 to 65 sr at 355 nm and 40 to 100 sr at 532. Over the same period the Angstrom exponent decreased from 1.56 +/- 0.2 to 1.35 +/- 0.2 in the 2-4 km smoke region.

Reevaluating growing season length controls on net ecosystem production in evergreen conifer forests	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BLACK SPRUCE FOREST; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOLOGY; TEMPERATE; EXCHANGE; CYCLE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; VARIABILITY	Growing season length (GSL) is a key unifying concept in ecology that can be estimated from eddy covariance-derived estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP). Previous studies disagree on how increasing GSLs may affect NEP in evergreen coniferous forests, potentially due to the variety of methods used to quantify GSL from NEP. We calculated GSL and GSL-NEP regressions at eleven evergreen conifer sites across a broad climatic gradient in western North America using three common approaches: (1) variable length (3-7 days) regressions of day of year versus NEP, (2) a smoothed threshold approach, and (3) the carbon uptake period, followed by a new approach of a method-averaged ensemble. The GSL and the GSL-NEP relationship differed among methods, resulting in linear relationships with variable sign, slope, and statistical significance. For all combinations of sites and methods, the GSL explained between 6% and 82% of NEP with p-values ranging from 0.45 to < 0.01. These results demonstrate the variability among GSL methods and the importance of selecting an appropriate method to accurately project the ecosystem carbon cycling response to longer growing seasons in the future. To encourage this approach in future studies, we outline a series of best practices for GSL method selection depending on research goals and the annual NEP dynamics of the study site(s). These results contribute to understanding growing season dynamics at ecosystem and continental scales and underscore the potential for methodological variability to influence forecasts of the evergreen conifer forest response to climate variability.

K.; Kovetz, Ely D.; Cutler, Curt; Berti, Emanuele			Expanding the LISA Horizon from the Ground	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							BLACK-HOLE MERGERS; GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; ECCENTRIC SOURCES; PARAMETERS	The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational-wave (GW) observatory will be limited in its ability to detect mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) in the stellar-mass range. A future ground-based detector network, meanwhile, will achieve by the LISA launch date a sensitivity that ensures complete detection of all mergers within a volume > O(10) Gpc(3). We propose a method to use the information from the ground to revisit the LISA data in search for subthreshold events. By discarding spurious triggers that do not overlap with the ground-based catalogue, we show that the signal-to-noise threshold rho(LISA) employed in LISA can be significantly lowered, greatly boosting the detection rate. The efficiency of this method depends predominantly on the rate of false-alarm increase when the threshold is lowered and on the uncertainty in the parameter estimation for the LISA events. As an example, we demonstrate that while all current LIGO BBH-merger detections would have evaded detection by LISA when employing a standard rho(LISA) = 8 threshold, this method will allow us to easily (possibly) detect an event similar to GW150914 (GW170814) in LISA. Overall, we estimate that the total rate of stellar-mass BBH mergers detected by LISA can be boosted by a factor similar to 4 (greater than or similar to 8) under conservative (optimistic) assumptions. This will enable new tests using multiband GW observations, significantly aided by the greatly increased lever arm in frequency.	[Wong, Kaze W.

Ceres' opposition effect observed by the Dawn framing camera	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: Ceres; radiative transfer	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; DISK-RESOLVED PHOTOMETRY; IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION; ASTEROID 21 LUTETIA; COHERENT BACKSCATTER; S-TYPE; SURFACE; LIGHT; POLARIZATION; VARIEGATION	Context. The surface reflectance of planetary regoliths may increase dramatically towards zero phase angle, a phenomenon known as the opposition effect (OE). Two physical processes that are thought to be the dominant contributors to the brightness surge are shadow hiding (SH) and coherent backscatter (CB). The occurrence of shadow hiding in planetary regoliths is self-evident, but it has proved difficult to unambiguously demonstrate CB from remote sensing observations. One prediction of CB theory is the wavelength dependence of the OE angular width. Aims. The Dawn spacecraft observed the OE on the surface of dwarf planet Ceres. We aim to characterize the OE over the resolved surface, including the bright Cerealia Facula, and to find evidence for SH and/or CB. It is presently not clear if the latter can contribute substantially to the OE for surfaces as dark as that of Ceres. Methods. We analyze images of the Dawn framing camera by means of photometric modeling of the phase curve. Results. We find that the OE of most of the investigated surface has very similar characteristics, with an enhancement factor of 1.4 and a full width at half maximum of 3 degrees ("broad OE"). A notable exception are the fresh ejecta of the Azacca crater, which display a very narrow brightness enhancement that is restricted to phase angles <0.5 degrees ("narrow OE"); suggestively, this is in the range in which CB is thought to dominate. We do not find a wavelength dependence for the width of the broad OE, and lack the data to investigate the dependence for the narrow OE. The prediction of a wavelength-dependent CB width is rather ambiguous, and we suggest that dedicated modeling of the Dawn observations with a physically based theory is necessary to better understand the Ceres OE. The zero-phase observations allow us to determine Ceres' visible geometric albedo as p(V) = 0.094 +/- 0.005. A comparison with other asteroids suggests that Ceres' broad OE is typical for an asteroid of its spectral type, with characteristics that are primarily linked to surface albedo. Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that CB may occur on the dark surface of Ceres in a highly localized fashion. While the results are inconclusive, they provide a piece to the puzzle that is the OE of planetary surfaces.

J	Juarez, MD; Padulles, R; Turk, FJ; Cardellach, E				Juarez, Manuel de la Torre; Padulles, Ramon; Joseph Turk, F.; Cardellach, Estel			Signatures of Heavy Precipitation on the Thermodynamics of Clouds Seen From Satellite: Changes Observed in Temperature Lapse Rates and Missed by Weather Analyses	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						Precipitation; Radio Occultation; Cloud thermodynamics; COSMIC; Refractivity; Lapse rates	GNSS RADIO-OCCULTATION; WATER-VAPOR; GPS RO; REFRACTIVITY; MISSION; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; CONVECTION; PROFILES; TRMM	Analyses of the thermodynamics of precipitating clouds are mostly based on localized in situ campaigns or, more globally, weather analyses and reanalyses. This work presents a comparison of weather analyses to satellite observations and a radiometeorological method that shows how precipitating layers inside clouds coincide with weather analyses underestimates of the amount of water vapor. The thermodynamic information from inside precipitating clouds is extracted using observed radio occultation (RO) refractivity profiles without requiring weather analysis input, thus reducing analysis-induced biases. The radiometeorological method is described by first identifying the differences between adiabatically dry, mixing-ratio conserving, and saturated pseudoadiabatic refractivity profiles. These reference profiles are then compared to observed RO refractivity profiles within precipitating and nonprecipitating clouds to infer changes in their height-dependent thermodynamic states and in stability to convection. Precipitation is found to start below layers close to pseudoadiabatic and precipitation layers coincide with changes into conditional stability against convection. A statistical comparison between observed profiles and the gradients predicted for a saturated pseudoadiabatic profile is made and finds that on the global average, precipitation separates clouds from the Clausius-Clapeyron law and profiles are close to a saturated pseudoadiabat. The results (a) help constrain the physical processes associated to precipitation inside clouds and (b) validate the potential of graphical RO techniques to analyze observations without ancillary temperature data from weather analyses. Plain Language Summary Predicting how precipitation responds to changes in atmospheric thermal profiles remains a challenge identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Solving this challenge requires comparing models with the observed thermodynamics of precipitating clouds. Only radio occultation (RO) can constraint globally the thermodynamics inside clouds with high vertical resolution. Infrared and microwave can measure the thermodynamics outside and only partially clouds, and radar instruments that measure inside clouds do not provide thermodynamic information.This paper develops a method to use RO for distinguishing the thermodynamics inside precipitating versus nonprecipitating clouds. The identification of rain is made using coincidences of RO soundings with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and CloudSat observations. Using the method, we show that globally, (1) the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast ERA Interim reanalysis and the Global Forecast System weather analysis have a global bias in precipitating clouds caused by misrepresentation of the thermodynamics inside clouds; (2) the nature of the bias is associated to a misrepresentation of the lapse rates by the analyses; (3) there are changes in stability to moist convection associated to the height where precipitation originates, and (4) the transition from midtropospheric lapse rates to boundary layer shows more frequent sharp inversions in nonprecipitating than in precipitating scenes.

Here we introduce a novel technique for weighing large ensemble model simulations that uses information of key observables. The approach is robust to input errors and yields calibrated means and error estimates of a glacier's mass balance. We apply the technique to Jakobshavn Isbrae, using a model that includes a dynamic calving law, and closely reproduce the observed behavior from 1985 to 2018 by forcing the model with ocean temperatures only. Our calibrated projection suggests that the glacier will continue to retreat and contribute about 5.1 mm to eustatic sea level rise by 2100 under present-day climatic forcing. Our analysis shows that the glacier's future evolution will strongly depend on the ambient oceanic setting. Plain Language Summary Projections of future sea level rise are important planning information for coastal communities and ecosystems. Large uncertainties in model parameterizations and input data sets make the projections of the contributions of outlet glaciers and ice sheets challenging. Jakobshavn Isbrae in West Greenland is the world's fastest glacier, which retreated for more than 20 km and contributed alone more than 0.1 mm per year to sea level rise after its floating ice tongue broke up at the turn of this millennium. We use a novel technique to calibrate model simulations of Jakobshavn Isbrae using a record of observations in order to (a) understand the causes triggering its recent retreat and (b) produce weighted estimates of the glacier's future contribution to sea level rise. Our analysis shows that the glacier behavior is largely controlled by the oceanic thermal forcing and that its future evolution will strongly depend on the sustained intrusion of warm waters in its fjord. We project that the glacier will contribute an average of 5.1 mm to global sea level rise until 2100 under present-day climatic forcing.

J	Bowman, KW; Cressie, N; Qu, X; Hall, A				Bowman, Kevin W.; Cressie, Noel; Qu, Xin; Hall, Alex			A Hierarchical Statistical Framework for Emergent Constraints: Application to Snow-Albedo Feedback	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; SENSITIVITY; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL; ENSEMBLES; SPREAD; FUTURE; CYCLE; ERA	Emergent constraints use relationships between future and current climate states to constrain projections of climate response. Here we introduce a statistical, hierarchical emergent constraint (HEC) framework in order to link future and current climates with observations. Under Gaussian assumptions, the mean and variance of the future state are shown analytically to be a function of the signal-to-noise ratio between current climate uncertainty and observation error and the correlation between future and current climate states. We apply the HEC to the climate change, snow-albedo feedback, which is related to the seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere. We obtain a snow-albedo feedback prediction interval of (-1.25,-0.58)%/K. The critical dependence on signal-to-noise ratio and correlation shows that neglecting these terms can lead to bias and underestimated uncertainty in constrained projections. The flexibility of using HEC under general assumptions throughout the Earth system is discussed. Plain Language Summary Reducing the uncertainty in climate projections has been one of the signature challenges in Earth science because simulated future climate states cannot be directly falsified. We propose a hierarchical statistical framework that formally relates projections of future climate to present-day climate and observations. We show that the future-climate estimate is driven by the correlation between future and present climate variability and the signal-to-noise ratio obtained from observations and present climate. This framework is applied to a future northern hemispheric climate projection that is influenced by the snow-albedo feedback, which is an amplification of temperature due to reduced snow extent as a consequence of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We show that the climate change snow-albedo temperature sensitivity ranges from (-1.25,-0.58)%/K. The flexibility of this approach can be applied more broadly to constrain climate projections across the Earth system.

SMAP soil moisture improves global evapotranspiration	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Evapotranspiration; Soil moisture; Hydrology; Evaporation; Transpiration; SMAP; MODIS	ROOTING DEPTH; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; MICROWAVE RADIOMETER; LAND EVAPORATION; HEAT-FLUX; WATER; SCALE; CARBON; DROUGHT	Accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understand water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth system. Satellite-driven ET models provide global estimates, but many of the ET algorithms have been designed independently of soil moisture observations. As water for ET is sourced from the soil, incorporating soil moisture into global remote sensing algorithms of ET should, in theory, improve performance, especially in water-limited regions. This paper presents an update to the widely-used Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET algorithm to incorporate spatially explicit daily surface soil moisture control on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration. The updated algorithm is evaluated using 14 AmeriFlux eddy covariance towers co-located with COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) soil moisture observations. The new PT-JPL(SM) model shows reduced errors and increased explanation of variance, with the greatest improvements in water-limited regions. Soil moisture incorporation into soil evaporation improves ET estimates by reducing bias and RMSE by 29.9% and 22.7% respectively, while soil moisture incorporation into transpiration improves ET estimates by reducing bias by 30.2%, RMSE by 16.9%. We apply the algorithm globally using soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP). These new global estimates of ET show reduced error at finer spatial resolutions and provide a rich dataset to evaluate land surface and climate models, vegetation response to changes in water availability and environmental conditions, and anthropogenic perturbations to the water cycle.

Ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 using airborne remote sensing at Mammoth Mountain, California	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; DIFFUSE EMISSION; MAGMATIC CO2; FLUX; SOIL; ATMOSPHERE; VOLCANO; MODEL; CA; RADIOCARBON	We present an exploratory study examining the use of airborne remote-sensing observations to detect ecological responses to elevated CO2 emissions from active volcanic systems. To evaluate these ecosystem responses, existing spectroscopic, thermal, and lidar data acquired over forest ecosystems on Mammoth Mountain volcano, California, were exploited, along with in situ measurements of persistent volcanic soil CO2 fluxes. The elevated CO2 response was used to statistically model ecosystem structure, composition, and function, evaluated via data products including biomass, plant foliar traits and vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration (ET). Using regression ensemble models, we found that soil CO2 flux was a significant predictor for ecological variables, including canopy greenness (normalized vegetation difference index, NDVI), canopy nitrogen, ET, and biomass. With increasing CO2, we found a decrease in ET and an increase in canopy nitrogen, both consistent with theory, suggesting more water-and nutrient-use-efficient canopies. However, we also observed a decrease in NDVI with increasing CO2 (a mean NDVI of 0.27 at 200 g m(-2) d(-1) CO2 reduced to a mean NDVI of 0.10 at 800 g m(-2) d(-1) CO2). This is inconsistent with theory though consistent with increased efficiency of fewer leaves. We found a decrease in above-ground biomass with increasing CO2, also inconsistent with theory, but we did also find a decrease in biomass variance, pointing to a long-term homogenization of structure with elevated CO2. Additionally, the relationships between ecological variables changed with elevated CO2, suggesting a shift in coupling/decoupling among ecosystem structure, composition, and function synergies. For example, ET and biomass were significantly correlated for areas without elevated CO2 flux but decoupled with elevated CO2 flux. This study demonstrates that (a) volcanic systems show great potential as a means to study the properties of ecosystems and their responses to elevated CO2 emissions and (b) these ecosystem responses are measurable using a suite of airborne remotely sensed data.

Hubble PanCET: an extended upper atmosphere of neutral hydrogen around the warm Neptune GJ 3470b	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						techniques: spectroscopic; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual: GJ 3470b; planet-star interactions; ultraviolet: stars	RAYLEIGH-SCATTERING; ESCAPING ATMOSPHERE; HOT; PLANET; SPECTROSCOPY; EXOPLANETS; PRESSURE; DYNAMICS; AERONOMY; CRITERIA	GJ 3470b is a warm Neptune transiting an M-dwarf star at the edge of the evaporation desert. It offers the possibility of investigating how low-mass, close-in exoplanets evolve under the irradiation from their host stars. We observed three transits of GJ 3470b in the Lyman-alpha line with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part of the Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury (PanCET) program. Absorption signatures are detected with similar properties in all three independent epochs, with absorption depths of 35 +/- 7% in the blue wing of the line, and 23 +/- 5% in the red wing. The repeatability of these signatures, their phasing with the planet transit, and the radial velocity of the absorbing gas allow us to conclude that there is an extended upper atmosphere of neutral hydrogen around GJ 3470b. We determine from our observations the stellar radiation pressure and XUV irradiation from GJ 3470 and use them to perform numerical simulations of the upper atmosphere of GJ 3470b with the EVaporating Exoplanets (EVE) code. The unusual redshifted signature can be explained by the damping wings of dense layers of neutral hydrogen that extend beyond the Roche lobe and are elongated in the direction of the planet motion. This structure could correspond to a shocked layer of planetary material formed by the collision of the expanding thermosphere with the wind of the star. The blueshifted signature is well explained by neutral hydrogen atoms escaping at rates of about 10(10) g s(-1) that are blown away from the star by its strong radiation pressure and are quickly photoionized, resulting in a smaller exosphere than that of the warm Neptune GJ 436b. The stronger escape from GJ 3470b, however, may have led to the loss of about 4-35% of its current mass over its similar to 2 Gyr lifetime.

J	Zhou, Y; Kim, H; Guan, B				Zhou, Yang; Kim, Hyemi; Guan, Bin			Life Cycle of Atmospheric Rivers: Identification and Climatological Characteristics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							NORTH PACIFIC; INLAND PENETRATION; WEST-COAST; PART I; MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION; TRANSPORT; LANDFALL; CYCLONES; AMERICA	An atmospheric river (AR) event is a strong poleward moisture transport that is composed of a series of spatiotemporally connected instantaneous AR objects. A new object-based tracking algorithm is developed in this study, which aims to identify an AR event and investigate its life cycle from origin to termination. The algorithm identifies duration, intensity, propagation speed and direction, and the traveled distance throughout the life cycle of the AR event. The tracking algorithm is applied to 6-hourly column-integrated water vapor flux from November to March during the period of 1979-2017, with a focus on the North Pacific. Most North Pacific AR events originate in the subtropics over the Northwest Pacific and terminate at higher latitudes over the Northeast Pacific including western North America. On average, long AR events that last more than 72 hrs travel 7 times longer in distance and have stronger intensity than short AR events that last less than 24 hrs. Finally, a new accumulated AR intensity index is developed, which summarizes the overall impact of AR events over a given domain during a certain period by incorporating number, lifetime, and intensities of AR events. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are " rivers" in the sky that transport water vapor from the tropics to higher latitudes. ARs play an important role in water resources because they transport as much water as the largest rivers on the ground and can often induce extreme precipitation when making landfall. A technique is developed to numerically detect and track ARs as they propagate in time and space. Based on this technique, we study the climatological characteristics of the life cycle (i. e., from appearance to disappearance) of winter ARs over the North Pacific. Most of the ARs originate at about 25 degrees N over the Northwest Pacific and terminate between 50 degrees N and 60 degrees N over the Northeast Pacific. We also found that longer-lived ARs can travel 7 seven times longer distances compared to shorter-lived ARs. Finally, an index is developed to represent the overall activity of ARs of a given time period.

Improved retrievals of carbon dioxide from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 with the version 8 ACOS algorithm	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; ABSORPTION-COEFFICIENTS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; MOLE FRACTION; COLUMN CO2; X-CO2 DATA; PART II; GOSAT; VALIDATION	Since September 2014, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite has been taking measurements of reflected solar spectra and using them to infer atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This work provides details of the OCO-2 retrieval algorithm, versions 7 and 8, used to derive the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of atmospheric CO2 (X-CO2) for the roughly 100 000 cloud-free measurements recorded by OCO-2 each day. The algorithm is based on the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) algorithm which has been applied to observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) since 2009, with modifications necessary for OCO-2. Because high accuracy, better than 0.25 %, is required in order to accurately infer carbon sources and sinks from X-CO2, significant errors and regional-scale biases in the measurements must be minimized. We discuss efforts to filter out poor-quality measurements, and correct the remaining good-quality measurements to minimize regional-scale biases. Updates to the radiance calibration and retrieval forward model in version 8 have improved many aspects of the retrieved data products. The version 8 data appear to have reduced regional-scale biases overall, and demonstrate a clear improvement over the version 7 data. In particular, error variance with respect to TCCON was reduced by 20% over land and 40% over ocean between versions 7 and 8, and nadir and glint observations over land are now more consistent. While this paper documents the significant improvements in the ACOS algorithm, it will continue to evolve and improve as the CO2 data record continues to expand.

J	Yu, HJ; Rignot, E; Seroussi, H; Morlighem, M				Yu, Hongju; Rignot, Eric; Seroussi, Helene; Morlighem, Mathieu			Retreat of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, over the next 100 years using various ice flow models, ice shelf melt scenarios and basal friction laws	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; GROUNDING-LINE MIGRATION; PINE ISLAND GLACIER; KOHLER GLACIERS; SHEET MODELS; LEVEL RISE; GREENLAND; INSTABILITY; SENSITIVITY; WIDESPREAD	Thwaites Glacier (TG), West Antarctica, has experienced rapid, potentially irreversible grounding line retreat and mass loss in response to enhanced ice shelf melting. Results from recent numerical models suggest a large spread in the evolution of the glacier in the coming decades to a century. It is therefore important to investigate how different approximations of the ice stress balance, parameterizations of basal friction and ice shelf melt parameterizations may affect projections. Here, we simulate the evolution of TG using ice sheet models of varying levels of complexity, different basal friction laws and ice shelf melt to quantify their effect on the projections. We find that the grounding line retreat and its sensitivity to ice shelf melt are enhanced when a full-Stokes model is used, a Budd friction is used and ice shelf melt is applied on partially floating elements. Initial conditions also impact the model results. Yet, all simulations suggest a rapid, sustained retreat of the glacier along the same preferred pathway. The fastest retreat rate occurs on the eastern side of the glacier, and the slowest retreat occurs across a subglacial ridge on the western side. All the simulations indicate that TG will undergo an accelerated retreat once the glacier retreats past the western subglacial ridge. Combining all the simulations, we find that the uncertainty of the projections is small in the first 30 years, with a cumulative contribution to sea level rise of 5 mm, similar to the current rate. After 30 years, the contribution to sea level depends on the model configurations, with differences up to 300% over the next 100 years, ranging from 14 to 42 mm.

Comprehensive Analysis of HD 105, A Young Solar System Analog	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; planetary systems; stars: individual (HD 105)	PARSEC EVOLUTIONARY TRACKS; A-TYPE STARS; DEBRIS DISKS; STELLAR EVOLUTION; MASSIVE STARS; LEGACY SURVEY; DUST; DISCS; SUBMILLIMETER; MODELS	HD 105 is a nearby, pre-main-sequence GO star hosting a moderately bright debris disk (L-dust /L-star similar to 2.6 x 10(-4) ). The star and its surroundings might therefore be considered an analog of the young solar system. We refine the stellar parameters based on an improved Gaia parallax distance and identify it as a pre-main-sequence star with an age of 50 +/- 16 Myr. The circumstellar disk was marginally resolved by Herschel/PACS imaging at far-infrared wavelengths. Here, we present an archival ALMA observation at 1.3 mm, revealing the extent and orientation of the disk. We also present Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/NICMOS and VLT/SPHERE near-infrared images, where we recover the disk in scattered light at the >= 5 sigma level. This was achieved by employing a novel annular averaging technique and is the first time this has been achieved for a disk in scattered light. Simultaneous modeling of the available photometry, disk architecture, and detection in scattered light allow better determination of the disk's architecture, and dust grain minimum size, composition, and albedo. We measure the dust albedo to lie between 0.19 and 0.06, the lower value being consistent with Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt objects.	[Marshall, J.

Sources of relatively rare, high-energy (> 10 MeV nucleon(-1)) He-3-rich SEPs remain unexplored. Here we present two of the most intense He-3-rich (He-3/He-4 > 1) SEP events of the current solar cycle 24 measured on the Advanced Composition Explorer at energy > 10 MeV nucleon(-1). Although He-3 shows high intensities, Z > 2 ions are below the detection threshold. The events are accompanied by type-III radio bursts, but no type-II emission as typically seen for suprathermal He-3-rich SEPs. The corresponding solar sources were analyzed using high-resolution, extreme-ultraviolet imaging and photospheric magnetic field observations on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We find the sources of these events associated with jets originating at the boundary of large sunspots with complex beta gamma delta magnetic configuration. Thus, details of the underlying photospheric field apparently are important to produce He-3 to high energies in the examined events.

To address this question, we observed the G9.62+0.19 complex in 850 mu m continuum with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2 polarimeter. An ordered magnetic field has been discovered in its youngest clump, the G9.62 clump. The magnetic field strength is determined to be similar to 1 mG. Magnetic field plays a larger role than turbulence in supporting the clump. However, the G9.62 clump is still unstable against gravitational collapse even if thermal, turbulent, and magnetic field support are taken into account together. The magnetic field segments in the outskirts of the G9.62 clump seem to point toward the clump center, resembling a dragged-in morphology, indicating that the clump is likely undergoing magnetically regulated global collapse. However, the magnetic field in its central region is aligned with the shells of the photodissociation regions and is approximately parallel to the ionization (or shock) front, indicating that the magnetic field therein is likely compressed by the expanding H II regions that formed in the same complex.

Annual mean CO2 growth rates have been determined from satellite retrievals of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2, i.e. XCO2, for the years 2003 to 2016. The XCO2 growth rates agree with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) growth rates from CO2 surface observations within the uncertainty of the satellite-derived growth rates (mean difference +/- standard deviation: 0.0 +/- 0.3 ppm year(-1); R: 0.82). This new and independent data set confirms record-large growth rates of around 3 ppm year(-1) in 2015 and 2016, which are attributed to the 2015-2016 El Nino. Based on a comparison of the satellite-derived growth rates with human CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, we estimate by how much the impact of ENSO dominates the impact of fossil-fuel-burning-related emissions in explaining the variance of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Our analysis shows that the ENSO impact on CO2 growth rate variations dominates that of human emissions throughout the period 2003-2016 but in particular during the period 2010-2016 due to strong La Nina and El Nino events. Using the derived growth rates and their uncertainties, we estimate the probability that the impact of ENSO on the variability is larger than the impact of human emissions to be 63 % for the time period 2003-2016. If the time period is restricted to 2010-2016, this probability increases to 94%.

J.; van Tol, Johan			Physical nature of electrically detected magnetic resonance through spin dependent trap assisted tunneling in insulators	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							RECOMBINATION; FILMS	We show that electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR), through spin dependent trap assisted tunneling (SDTT) in amorphous SiC, exhibits approximately equal amplitudes at very high (8.5 T) and very low (0.013 T) magnetic fields at room temperature. This result strongly supports an SDTT/EDMR model in which spins at two nearby sites involved in a tunneling event are coupled for a finite time in circumstances somewhat analogous to spin pair coupling in the spin dependent recombination/EDMR model of Kaplan, Solomon, and Mott (KSM) [Kaplan, Solomon, and Mott, J. Phys. Lett. 39, 51 (1978)]. Since a comparable near zero magnetic field change in resistance is also observed in these samples, our results support the idea that this magnetoresistance response is also the result of a KSM-like mechanism involving SDTT. Additionally, we observe a large enhancement in SDTT/EDMR at high field (8.5 T) for temperatures below 50 K, which suggests the potential utility of SDTT in spin based quantum computation and other spintronic applications.

At present, such batteries are limited to operation at high temperatures because suitable fluoride ion-conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride ion-conducting electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper-lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF3) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorination and defluorination reactions in a fluoride ion electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature. Fluoride ion-mediated electrochemistry offers a pathway toward developing capacities beyond that of lithium ion technology.

(3200) Phaethon: Bulk density from Yarkovsky drift detection	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: (3200) Phaethon; methods: numerical; methods: observational; astrometry; celestial mechanics	ASTEROID LIGHTCURVE INVERSION; OPTIMIZATION METHODS; METEOROIDS; PHOTOMETRY; SIZE	Context. The recent close approach of the near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon offered a rare opportunity to obtain high-quality observational data of various types. Aims. We used the newly obtained optical light curves to improve the spin and shape model of Phaethon and to determine its surface physical properties derived by thermophysical modeling. We also used the available astrometric observations of Phaethon, including those obtained by the Arecibo radar and the Gaia spacecraft, to constrain the secular drift of the orbital semimajor axis. This constraint allowed us to estimate the bulk density by assuming that the drift is dominated by the Yarkovsky effect. Methods. We used the convex inversion model to derive the spin orientation and 3D shape model of Phaethon, and a detailed numerical approach for an accurate analysis of the Yarkovsky effect. Results. We obtained a unique solution for Phaethon's pole orientation at (318 degrees, -47 degrees) ecliptic longitude and latitude (both with an uncertainty of 5 degrees), and confirm the previously reported thermophysical properties (D = 5.1 +/- 0.2 km, Gamma = 600 +/- 200J m(-2) S-0.5K-1). Phaethon has a top-like shape with possible north-south asymmetry. The characteristic size of the regolith grains is 1-2 cm. The orbit analysis reveals a secular drift of the semimajor axis of -(6.9 +/- 1.9) x 10(-4) au Myr(-1) . With the derived volume-equivalent size of 5.1 km, the bulk density is 1.67 +/- 0.47 g cm(-3) . If the size is slightly larger similar to 5.7-5.8 km, as suggested by radar data, the bulk density would decrease to 1.48 +/- 0.42 g cm(-3) . We further investigated the suggestion that Phaethon may be in a cluster with asteroids (155140) 2005 UD and (225416) 1999 YC that was formed by rotational fission of a critically spinning parent body. Conclusions. Phaethon's bulk density is consistent with typical values for large (>100 km) C-complex asteroids and supports its association with asteroid (2) Pallas, as first suggested by dynamical modeling. These findings render a cometary origin unlikely for Phaethon.

Boundary-layer water vapor profiling using differential absorption radar	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							LIDAR; CLOUD	Remote sensing of water vapor in the presence of clouds and precipitation constitutes an important observational gap in the global observing system. We present ground-based measurements using a new radar instrument operating near the 183 GHz H2O line for profiling water vapor inside of planetary-boundary-layer clouds, and develop an error model and inversion algorithm for the profile retrieval. The measurement technique exploits the strong frequency dependence of the radar beam attenuation, or differential absorption, on the low-frequency flank of the water line in conjunction with the radar's ranging capability to acquire range-resolved humidity information. By comparing the measured differential absorption coefficient with a millimeter-wave propagation model, we retrieve humidity profiles with 200 m resolution and typical statistical uncertainty of 0.6 gm(-3) out to around 2 km. This value for humidity uncertainty corresponds to measurements in the high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) limit, and is specific to the frequency band used. The measured spectral variation of the differential absorption coefficient shows good agreement with the model, supporting both the measurement method assumptions and the measurement error model. By performing the retrieval analysis on statistically independent data sets corresponding to the same observed scene, we demonstrate the reproducibility of the measurement. An important trade-off inherent to the measurement method between retrieved humidity precision and profile resolution is discussed.

J	Frederikse, T; Gerkema, T				Frederikse, Thomas; Gerkema, Theo			Multi-decadal variability in seasonal mean sea level along the North Sea coast	OCEAN SCIENCE			English	Article							ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; CLIMATE; TRENDS	Seasonal deviations from annual-mean sea level in the North Sea region show a large low-frequency component with substantial variability at decadal and multi-decadal timescales. In this study, we quantify low-frequency variability in seasonal deviations from annual-mean sea level and look for drivers of this variability. The amplitude, as well as the temporal evolution of this multi-decadal variability shows substantial variations over the North Sea region, and this spatial pattern is similar to the well-known pattern of the influence of winds and pressure changes on sea level at higher frequencies. The largest low-frequency signals are found in the German Bight and along the Norwegian coast. We find that the variability is much stronger in winter and autumn than in other seasons and that this winter and autumn variability is predominantly driven by wind and sea-level pressure anomalies which are related to large-scale atmospheric patterns. For the spring and summer seasons, this atmospheric forcing explains a smaller fraction of the observed variability. Large-scale atmospheric patterns have been derived from a principal component analysis of sea-level pressure. The first principal component of sea-level pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean, which is linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), explains the largest fraction of winter-mean variability for most stations, while for some stations, the variability consists of a combination of multiple principal components. The low-frequency variability in season-mean sea level can manifest itself as trends in short records of seasonal sea level. For multiple stations around the North Sea, running-mean 40-year trends for autumn and winter sea level often exceed the long-term trends in annual mean sea level, while for spring and summer, the seasonal trends have a similar order of magnitude as the annual-mean trends. Removing the variability explained by atmospheric variability vastly reduces the seasonal trends, especially in winter and autumn.

Floor-Fractured Craters on Ceres and Implications for Interior Processes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Ceres; floor-fractured craters; cryomagmatism; solid-state flow	SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; RELAXATION	Several of the impact craters on Ceres have sets of fractures on their floors. These fractures appear similar to those found within a class of lunar craters referred to as floor-fractured craters (FFCs). We have cataloged the Ceres FFCs according to the classification scheme designed for the Moon. An analysis of the depth to diameter ratio for Ceres craters shows that, like lunar FFCs, the Ceres FFCs are anomalously shallow. Large (>50km) Ceres FFCs are most consistent with Class 1 lunar FFCs, while smaller craters on Ceres are more consistent with Class 4 lunar FFCs. This suggests that Ceres FFCs may similarly be undergoing fracturing due to the intrusion of a low-density material below the craters. While on the Moon (and Mars) the intrusive material is hypothesized to be silicate magma, cryomagmatic intrusions are more likely responsible for the formation of the Ceres FFCs. However, new models suggest that at least some of the FFC fractures may have formed due to the solid-state flow of a low-viscosity and low-density material into the crater wall. Plain Language Summary Several of the impact craters on the asteroid Ceres have sets of fractures on their floors. It is unclear what could have caused these fractures to form. The only known mechanism for fracturing the floor of impact craters involves volcanism, which is only known to occur on planets like Earth and Mars, not on asteroids like Ceres. This paper explores ways in which the crater floor fractures on Ceres could have formed.

Geology of Ceres' North Pole quadrangle with Dawn FC imaging data	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Geological processes; Impact processes	MASS MOVEMENT; CRATERS; VESTA; CHRONOLOGY; AGES; ICE	The Dawn Framing Camera repeatedly imaged Ceres' North Pole quadrangle (Ac-1 Asari, latitudes >66 degrees N) at a resolution of similar to 35 m/pixel through a panchromatic filter, enabling the derivation of a digital terrain model (DTM) and an ortho-rectified mosaic. Using this dataset, a photo-geologic map and stratigraphy, complemented with absolute model ages of impact craters, were produced. We identified the following key surface features: an ancient 4.5 km high isolated dome with a non-impact origin; recent lobate materials on crater interiors possibly formed as high-speed flows of collapsed rim material; and recent bright areas in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs), which we interpret as ice accumulation mostly by infall of exogenic material. Crater morphologies and dimensions do not differ from those in other quadrangles, suggesting the widespread influence of a rheologically weak target during the crater formation process. There is a paucity of lobate materials associated with impact cratering, in contrast to previous identifications with lower spatial resolution imagery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the use of satellite data has generally required that a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution is made, i.e., one could obtain low spatial resolution data regularly, or high spatial resolution occasionally. As a consequence, this spatiotemporal trade-off has tended to limit the impact of remote sensing for precision agricultural applications. With the recent emergence of constellations of small CubeSat-based satellite systems, these constraints are rapidly being removed, such that daily 3 m resolution optical data are now a reality for earth observation. Such advances provide an opportunity to develop new earth system monitoring and assessment tools. In this manuscript we evaluate the capacity of CubeSats to advance the estimation of ET via application of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) retrieval model. To take advantage of the high-spatiotemporal resolution afforded by these systems, we have integrated a CubeSat derived leaf area index as a forcing variable into PT-JPL, as well as modified key biophysical model parameters. We evaluate model performance over an irrigated farmland in Saudi Arabia using observations from an eddy covariance tower. Crop water use retrievals were also compared against measured irrigation from an in-line flow meter installed within a center-pivot system. To leverage the high spatial resolution of the CubeSat imagery, PT-JPL retrievals were integrated over the source area of the eddy covariance footprint, to allow an equivalent intercomparison. Apart from offering new precision agricultural insights into farm operations and management, the 3 m resolution ET retrievals were shown to explain 86% of the observed variability and provide a relative RMSE of 32.9% for irrigated maize, comparable to previously reported satellite-based retrievals. An observed underestimation was diagnosed as a possible misrepresentation of the local surface moisture status, highlighting the challenge of high-resolution modeling applications for precision agriculture and informing future research directions.

Based on three years (2007, 2015, 2016) of summertime (May September) observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), collocated instantaneous albedos for overcast ocean and snow/ice scenes were compared within the Arctic. For samples where both instruments classified the scene as overcast, the relative root-mean-square (RMS) difference between the sample albedos grew as the solar zenith angle (SZA) increased. The RMS differences that were purely due to differential Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) anisotropic corrections (sigma(ADM)) were estimated to be less than 4% for overcast ocean and overcast snow/ice when the SZA <= 70 degrees. The significant agreement between the CERES and MISR strongly increased our confidence in using the instruments overcast cloud albedos in Arctic studies. Nevertheless, there was less agreement in the cloud albedos for larger solar zenith angles, where the RMS differences of sigma(ADM) reached 13.5% for overcast ocean scenes when the SZA > 80 degrees. Additionally, inconsistencies between the CERES and MISR scene identifications were examined, resulting in an overall recommendation for improvements to the MISR snow/ice mask and a rework of the MISR Albedo Cloud Designation (ACD) field by incorporating known strengths of the standard MISR cloud masks.

We analyzed new multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, gravity, and magnetic data with 100% multibeam bathymetric data over the active transform valley and adjacent spreading segments as part of the Passive Imaging of the Lithosphere Asthenosphere Boundary (PI-LAB) Experiment. Analyses of these data sets allow us to determine the history and mode of crustal formation and the tectonic evolution of the transform system and adjacent ridges over the past 20Myr. We model the total field magnetic anomaly to determine the age of the crust along the northern ridge segment to better establish the timing of the variations in the seafloor fabric and the tectonic-magmatic history of the region. Within the active transform fault zone, we observe four distinct positive flower structures with several en echelon fault scarps visible in the backscatter data. We find up to -10mGal residual Mantle Bouguer Anomaly in the region of the largest positive flower structure within the transform zone suggesting crustal thickening relative to the crustal thinning typically observed in fracture zones in the Atlantic. The extensional/compressional features observed in the Chain Transform are less pronounced than those observed further north in the Vema, St. Paul, and Romanche and may be due to local ridge segment adjustments.

Identification and Extraction of Seasonal Geodetic Signals Due to Surface Load Variations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						seasonal signals; surface load variations; independent component analysis; solid Earth deformation; continental hydrology	WATER STORAGE; CONTINENTAL WATER; DEFORMATION; GPS; EARTH; DISPLACEMENTS; GRAVITY; STRAIN; GRACE	Deformation of the Earth's surface associated with redistributions of continental water mass explains, to first order, the seasonal signals observed in geodetic position time series. Discriminating these seasonal signals from other sources of deformation in geodetic measurements is essential to isolate tectonic signals and to monitor spatio-temporal variations in continental water storage. We propose a new methodology to identify and extract these seasonal signals. The approach uses a variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (vbICA) to extract the seasonal signals and a gravity-based deformation model to identify which of these signals are caused by surface loading. We test the procedure on two study areas, the Arabian Peninsula and the Nepal Himalaya, and find that the technique successfully extracts the seasonal signals with one or two independent components, depending on whether the load is stationary or moving. The approach is robust to spatial heterogeneities inherent to geodetic measurements and can help extract systematic errors in geodetic products (e.g., draconitic errors). We also discuss how to handle the degree-1 deformation field present in the geodetic data set but not captured by the gravity-based model.

J	Maurer, J; Johnson, K; Segall, P				Maurer, Jeremy; Johnson, Kaj; Segall, Paul			Bounding the Moment Deficit Rate on Crustal Faults Using Geodetic Data: Application to Southern California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						moment deficit rate; Southern California; earthquake hazard	SAN-ANDREAS; SLIP RATES; DEFORMATION; DISPLACEMENT; EARTHQUAKES; INVERSION; AFTERSLIP; PARKFIELD; STRAIN	The interseismic moment deficit rate (MDR) constrains the potential for future moment release in earthquakes. Published estimates of the geodetic MDR in Southern California vary by a factor of 3 depending on the type of forward model, method of estimation, and data quality. It is our aim to determine to what degree these discrepancies may be explained by quantifying the uncertainty for a given class of forward models, accounting for data errors and limited model resolution. We apply a new method, the Constrained Optimization Bounding Estimator, to bound the MDR in Southern California using geodetic data and an elastic plate-block model. Total MDR ranges from 1.3 to 2.0 x 10(19)N m/yr, equivalent to one M(W)8.17-8.31 over 160years, higher than the observed seismic moment since 1850. This observation, together with published estimates of off-fault moment rate, could imply that significant permanent (inelastic) deformation is taking place in Southern California or that future earthquakes will make up the difference. Uncertainty in MDR from Constrained Optimization Bounding Estimator using a single model is comparable to the range of published MDR estimates using elastic block models but about a factor of 8 smaller than the range of all published models. Thus, the choice of forward model dominates theuncertainty in MDR for Southern California. While additional data would be helpful for constraining the MDR, as much or more effort is needed to quantify the prediction errors associated with a given model and to develop observations that narrow the possible range of forward models under consideration. Plain Language Summary We all know that Southern California is seismically active, but how many large earthquakes are possible in the upcoming decades, and where will they occur? The answer to these questions is obviously critical for preparing for future earthquakes, but to get the answers, we need to know the buildup of moment deficit (a measure of earthquake potential) over time. There are different ways to estimate the moment deficit, but many published estimates do not agree, and it is hard to determine whether the differences are important or arise due to data limitations. That is where we come in. We developed a method to measure the uncertainty due to limited data and compared that to the differences between models. We show that there are big differences between models, but most are consistent with one fact: there is more moment deficit accruing then has been released in the last 160years. However, we do not know if this means one additional very large earthquake, several moderate-sized events, or strain accommodated through distributed aseismic processes. Improved and more consistent models of the Earth's crust is an important future step needed to accurately answer this question.

It therefore provides an excellent opportunity to combine geophysical and petrological data, to place detailed constraints on the architecture and dynamics of subvolcanic systems in the western archipelago. We present new geodetic models that show that pre-eruptive inflation at Wolf was caused by magma accumulation in a shallow flat-topped reservoir at 1.1km, whereas edifice-scale deformation during the eruption was related to a deflationary source at 6.1-8.8km. Petrological observations suggest that the erupted material was derived from both a subvolcanic mush and a liquid-rich magma body. Using a combination of olivine-plagioclase-augite-melt (OPAM) and clinopyroxene-melt barometry, we show that the majority of magma equilibration, crystallization, and mush entrainment occurred at a depth equal to or greater than the deep geodetic source, with little petrological evidence of material sourced from shallower levels. Hence, our multidisciplinary study does not support a fully transcrustal magmatic system beneath Wolf volcano before the 2015 eruption but instead indicates two discrete storage regions, with a small magma lens at shallow levels and the major zone of magma storage in the lower crust, from which most of the erupted material was sourced. A predominance of lower crustal magma storage has previously been thought typical of subvolcanic systems in the eastern Galapagos Archipelago, but our new data suggest that this may also occur beneath the more active volcanoes of the western archipelago.

Here we use terrestrial carbon cycle observations to characterize the importance of fire regime gradients in the spatial distribution of ecosystem functional properties such as carbon allocation, fluxes, and turnover times in the tropics. A Bayesian model-data fusion approach is applied to an ecosystem carbon model to derive the posterior distribution of corresponding parameters for the tropics from 2000 to 2015. We perform the model-data fusion procedure twice, that is, with and without imposing fire. Gradient of differences in model parameters and ecosystem properties in response to fire emerge between these experiments. For example, mean annual burned fraction correlates with an increase in carbon use efficiency and reductions in carbon turnover times. Further, our analyses reveal an increased allocation to more fire-resistant tissues in the most frequently burned regions. As fire modules are increasingly implemented in global terrestrial ecosystem models, we recommend that model development includes a representation of the impact of fire on ecosystem properties as they may lead to large differences under climate change projections.

It is found that the waves are coherent in all local time sectors with the wave coherency occurring in approximately three- to five-wave cycle packets. The plasmaspheric hiss in the dawn and local noon time sector are found to be substorm (AE*) and storm (SYM-H*) dependent. The local noon sector is also solar wind pressure dependent. It is suggested that coherent chorus monochromatic subelements enter the plasmasphere (as previously suggested by ray tracing models) to explain these plasmaspheric hiss features. The presence of intense, coherent plasmaspheric hiss in the local dusk and local midnight time sectors is surprising and more difficult to explain. For the dusk sector waves, either local in situ plasmaspheric wave generation or propagation from the dayside plasmasphere is possible. There is little evidence to support substorm generation of the midnight sector plasmaspheric hiss found in this study. One possible explanation is propagation from the local noon sector. The combination of high wave intensity and coherency at all local times strengthens the suggestion that the electron slot is formed during substorm intervals instead of during geomagnetic quiet (by incoherent waves). Plasmaspheric hiss is found to propagate at all angles relative to the ambient magnetic field, theta(kB). Circular, elliptical, and linear polarized plasmaspheric hiss have been detected. No obvious, strong relationship between the wave polarization and theta(kB) was found. This information of hiss properties should be useful in modeling wave-particle interactions within the plasmasphere.

The key to understanding the engines that produce these jets and the jet-shaping mechanisms lies in the study of objects in transition between the AGB and PN phases. I discuss the results of our recent studies with high-angular-resolution (with ALMA and HST) and at high-energies (with GALEX, XMM-Newton and Chandra) of several such objects, which reveal new details of close binary interactions and high-speed outflows. These include two PPNe (the Boomerang Nebula and IRAS 16342-3814), and the late carbon star, V Hya. The Boomerang Nebula is notable for a massive, high-speed outflow that has cooled below the microwave background temperature, making it the coldest object in the Universe. IRAS 16342-3814 is the prime example of the class of water-fountain pre-planetary nebulae or PPNe (very young PPNe with high-velocity H2O masers) and shows the signature of a precessing jet. V Hya ejects high-speed bullets every 8.5 years associated with the periastron passage of a companion in an eccentric orbit. I discuss our work on AGB stars with strongly-variable high-energy (FUV, X-ray) emission, suggesting that these objects are in the early stages of binary interactions that result in the formation of accretion disks and jets.

Spatial and Temporal Variability of Root-Zone Soil Moisture Acquired From Hydrologic Modeling and AirMOSS P-Band Radar	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)	JUN 27-29, 2017	VITO Remote Sensing, Bruges, BELGIUM	IEEE, IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc	VITO Remote Sensing	Hydrologic modeling; radar remote sensing and spatial scaling; soil moisture	ASSIMILATION; PREDICTION	The accurate estimation of grid-scale fluxes of water, energy, and carbon requires consideration of subgrid spatial variability in root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). The NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) mission represents the first systematic attempt to repeatedly map high-resolution RZSM fields using airborne remote sensing across a range of biomes. Here, we compare 3-arc-sec (similar to 100 m) spatial resolution AirMOSS RZSM retrievals from P-band radar acquisitions over nine separate North American study sites with analogous RZSM estimates generated by the Flux-Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (Flux-PIHM). The two products demonstrate comparable levels of accuracy when evaluated against ground-based soil moisture products and a significant level of temporal cross correlation. However, relative to the AirMOSS RZSM retrievals, Flux-PIHM RZSM estimates generally demonstrate much lower levels of spatial and temporal variability, and the spatial patterns captured by both products are poorly correlated. Nevertheless, based on a discussion of likely error sources affecting both products, it is argued that the spatial analysis of AirMOSS and Flux-PIHM RZSM fields provides meaningful upper and lower bounds on the potential range of RZSM spatial variability encountered across a range of natural biomes.

Event-Response Ellipses: A Method to Quantify and Compare the Role of Dynamic Storage at the Catchment Scale in Snowmelt-Dominated Systems	WATER			English	Article						storage; snowmelt; dynamic storage	HIGH-ELEVATION CATCHMENTS; COLORADO FRONT RANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIERRA-NEVADA; WATER-RESOURCES; TRANSIT-TIME; RUNOFF; HYDROLOGY; PRECIPITATION; SNOWPACK	A method for quantifying the role of dynamic storage as a physical buffer between snowmelt and streamflow at the catchment scale is introduced in this paper. The method describes a quantitative relation between hydrologic events (e.g., snowmelt) and responses (e.g., streamflow) by generating event-response ellipses that can be used to (a) characterize and compare catchment-scale dynamic storage processes, and (b) assess the closure of the water balance. Event-response ellipses allow for the role of dynamic, short-term storage to be quantified and compared between seasons and between catchments. This method is presented as an idealization of the system: a time series of a snowmelt event as a portion of a sinusoidal wave function. The event function is then related to a response function, which is the original event function modified mathematically through phase and magnitude shifts to represent the streamflow response. The direct relation of these two functions creates an event-response ellipse with measurable characteristics (e.g., eccentricity, angle). The ellipse characteristics integrate the timing and magnitude difference between the hydrologic event and response to quantify physical buffering through dynamic storage. Next, method is applied to eleven snowmelt seasons in two well-instrumented headwater snowmelt-dominated catchments with known differences in storage capacities. Results show the time-period average daily values produce different event-response ellipse characteristics for the two catchments. Event-response ellipses were also generated for individual snowmelt seasons; however, these annual applications of the method show more scatter relative to the time period averaged values. The event-response ellipse method provides a method to compare and evaluate the connectivity between snowmelt and streamflow as well as assumptions of water balance.

The effective management of these basins to adequately maintain their functionality over mid-to-long term requires a suitable monitoring network. Here, we explored the use of a temporal satellite analysis to closely evaluate the efficiency of the ARB in terms of infiltration capacity, depending on hydraulic conditions of the topsoil transitioning from unclogged to clogged conditions in the ARB. COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were integrated with ground data and numerical modeling to advance the capability for monitoring low water levels and flooded areas within the ARB. The understanding of biofilm development and effects was achieved by identifying anomalous drawdown phases, by constraining ponding boundary conditions in the numerical model, and by estimating subsequent infiltration rate changes under progressive clogging. With appropriate meteorological conditions (consecutive rainfall events separated by few dry days), the biofilm could develop rapidly and cover large surfaces (e.g., 22 ha) in about two months. During this process, the hydraulic conductivity of the basin surface could decrease by more than three orders of magnitude, completely altering the relationship with the local groundwater regime. Quantitative estimation of the evolution of the infiltration rate provides crucial insights about the overall recharge behavior of ARBs to make reliable economical plans in both the design and monitoring phase.

J	Katz, I; Chaplin, VH; Ortega, AL				Katz, Ira; Chaplin, Vernon H.; Ortega, Alejandro Lopez			Particle-in-cell simulations of Hall thruster acceleration and near plume regions	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							MODEL	The results of 1-D azimuthal, and 2-D z-theta, particle-in-cell simulations of Hall thruster acceleration and near plume regions are reported. The 1-D simulations show that fast moving electron waves drive coherent, large amplitude, ion acoustic waves. The ion waves become azimuthally coherent too quickly for ion sound to be the cause; the coherence comes from early electron waves. 2-D simulations with only fast moving, main beam, ions result in ion acoustic wave amplitudes much lower than those in the 1-D calculations. The addition of a small amount of ionization in the domain, at a rate consistent with Hall thruster parameters, causes the potential profile to divide into two distinct regions.

J	Song, J; Kim, D; Chung, J; Kim, Y				Song, Juyoung; Kim, Dukjin; Chung, Jungkyo; Kim, Youngcheol			Evaluation of Recent Magma Activity of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galapagos Using SAR Remote Sensing	KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			Korean	Article						Sierra Negra; Volcano; Sentinel-1; PS-InSAR; Mogi model	DEFORMATION; ERUPTION	Detection of subtle ground deformation of volcanoes plays an important role in evaluating the risk and possibility of volcanic eruptions. Ground-fixed observation equipment is difficult to maintain and cost-inefficient. In contrast, satellite remote sensing can regularly monitor at low cost. In this paper, following the study of Chadwick et al. (2006), which applied the interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique to the Sierra Negra volcano, Galapagos. In order to investigate the deformation of the volcano before 2005 eruption, the recent activities of this volcano were analyzed using Sentinel-1, the latest SAR satellite. We obtained the descending mode Sentinel-1A SAR data from January 2017 to January 2018, applied the Persistent Scatter InSAR, and estimated the depth and expansion quantity of magma in recent years through the Mogi model. As a result, it was confirmed that the activity pattern of volcano prior to the eruption in June 2018 was similar to the pattern before the eruption in 2005 and was successful in estimating the depth and expansion amount. The results of this study suggest that satellite SAR can characterize the activity patterns of volcano and can be possibly used for early monitoring of volcanic eruption.

DES Collaboration	Star-galaxy classification in the Dark Energy Survey Y1 data set	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Methods: data analysis; Methods: statistical; Techniques: photometric	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; STELLAR LOCUS; CATALOG; SDSS; CALIBRATION; SEPARATION; SELECTION; COSMOS; VISTA	We perform a comparison of different approaches to star-galaxy classification using the broadband photometric data from Year 1 of the Dark Energy Survey. This is done by performing a wide range of tests with and without external 'truth' information, which can be ported to other similar data sets. We make a broad evaluation of the performance of the classifiers in two science cases with DES data that are most affected by this systematic effect: large-scale structure and Milky Way studies. In general, even though the default morphological classifiers used for DES Y1 cosmology studies are sufficient to maintain a low level of systematic contamination from stellar misclassification, contamination can be reduced to the O(1 per cent) level by using multi-epoch and infrared information from external data sets. For Milky Way studies, the stellar sample can be augmented by similar to 20 per cent for a given flux limit.

Studying the Solar system with the International Pulsar Timing Array	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						pulsars: general; methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; ephemerides	GRAVITY-FIELD; MILLISECOND PULSARS; ROTATION PERIOD; DARK-MATTER; SPIN NOISE; PRECISION; EPHEMERIS; MODEL; MASS; DISPERSION	Pulsar-timing analyses are sensitive to errors in the Solar-system ephemerides (SSEs) that timing models utilize to estimate the location of the Solar-system barycentre, the quasi-inertial reference frame to which all recorded pulse times-of-arrival are referred. Any error in the SSE will affect all pulsars, therefore pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are a suitable tool to search for such errors and impose independent constraints on relevant physical parameters. We employ the first data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array to constrain the masses of the planet-moons systems and to search for possible unmodelled objects (UMOs) in the Solar system. We employ 10 SSEs from two independent research groups, derive and compare mass constraints of planetary systems, and derive the first PTA mass constraints on asteroid-belt objects. Constraints on planetary-system masses have been improved by factors of up to 20 from the previous relevant study using the same assumptions, with the mass of the Jovian system measured at 9.5479189(3) x 10(-4) M-circle dot. The mass of the dwarf planet Ceres is measured at 4.7(4) x 10(-10) M-circle dot. We also present the first sensitivity curves using real data that place generic limits on the masses of UMOs, which can also be used as upper limits on the mass of putative exotic objects. For example, upper limits on dark-matter clumps are comparable to published limits using independent methods. While the constraints on planetary masses derived with all employed SSEs are consistent, we note and discuss differences in the associated timing residuals and UMO sensitivity curves.	[Caballero, R.

They are detected in several astrophysical environments and in particular towards protostars. Using data of the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 obtained with the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope, we constrained the origin of these two molecules in the envelope of the source. The line shape comparison and the results of a radiative transfer analysis both indicate that the emission of CH3CN arises from a warmer and inner region of the envelope than the CH3CCH emission, We compare the observational results with the predictions of a gas-grain chemical model. Our model predicts a peak abundance of CH3CCH in the gas-phase in the outer part of the envelope, at around 2000 au from the central star, which is relatively close to the emission size derived from the observations. The predicted CH3CN abundance only rises at the radius where the grain mantle ices evaporate, with an abundance similar to the one derived from the observations.

Our knowledge of their composition relies mainly on thermodynamic modeling and assumptions based on Cassini Radar and VIMS (Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) data. Several thermodynamic models have been used to calculate the composition of these lakes, and their results on even the major lake components (methane, ethane, propane, and nitrogen) exhibit large discrepancies. Recent Cassini radar observations revealed an echo from the lake's bottom. A low loss factor of attenuation is needed within the lakes to interpret these observations, and it has been suggested that the lakes are dominated by methane. Cassini VIMS data obtained on the North Pole lakes at three-year intervals showed no detectable surface level change, which is consistent with ethane being their primary constituent. This additional discrepancy between thermodynamic models and Cassini data strongly shows the need for experimental measurements under realistic Titan conditions in order to better constrain the thermodynamic models. We designed and built a cryogenic experimental platform allowing the simulation of Titan's lakes. This facility, named Titan Lakes Simulation System (TiLSS), produces liquid hydrocarbons in equilibrium with a gas phase mimicking Titan's atmosphere. Samples of the condensed liquid are injected directly into a gas chromatograph allowing the direct measurement of its chemical components and their abundances. To test the overall operation of the system, a gas mixture of methane and ethane was condensed under 1.5 bar of nitrogen and analyzed. Results from this proof of concept test are in good agreement with experimental studies previously published. Published by AIP Publishing.

Prospects for the characterisation of exo-zodiacal dust with the VLTI	EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Interferometry; Circumstellar matter; Exo-zodiacal dust; Planetary systems		Exo-zodiacal dust, exozodi for short, is warm (approximate to 300 K) or hot (up to approximate to 2000 K) dust found in the inner regions of planetary systems around main sequence stars. In analogy to our own zodiacal dust, it may be located in or near the habitable zone or closer in, down to the dust sublimation distance. The study of the properties, distribution, and evolution of exozodis can inform about the architecture and dynamics of the innermost regions of planetary systems, close to their habitable zones. On the other hand, the presence of large amounts of exo-zodiacal dust may be an obstacle for future space missions aiming to image Earth-like exoplanets. The dust can be the most luminous component of extrasolar planetary systems, but predominantly emits in the near- to mid-infrared where it is outshone by the host star. Interferometry provides a unique method of separating the dusty from the stellar emission. We discuss the prospects of exozodi observations with the next generation VLTI instruments and summarize critical instrument specifications.

As of today, the VLTI routinely achieves contrasts of a few 10(-3) in the near-infrared with PIONIER (H band) and GRAVITY (K band). Nulling interferometers in the northern hemisphere and non-redundant aperture masking experiments have, however, demonstrated that contrasts of at least a few 10(-4) are within reach using specific beam combination and data acquisition techniques. In this paper, we explore the possibility to reach similar or higher contrasts on the VLTI. After reviewing the state-of-the-art in high-contrast infrared interferometry, we discuss key features that made the success of other high-contrast interferometric instruments (e.g., integrated optics, nulling, closure phase, and statistical data reduction) and address possible avenues to improve the contrast of the VLTI by at least one order of magnitude. In particular, we discuss the possibility to use integrated optics, proven in the near-infrared, in the thermal near-infrared (L and M bands, 3-5 m), a sweet spot to image and characterize young extra-solar planetary systems. Finally, we address the science cases of a high-contrast VLTI imaging instrument and focus particularly on exoplanet science (young exoplanets, planet formation, and exozodiacal disks), stellar physics (fundamental parameters and multiplicity), and extragalactic astrophysics (active galactic nuclei and fundamental constants). Synergies and scientific preparation for other potential future instruments such as the Planet Formation Imager are also briefly discussed. This project is called Hi-5 for High-contrast Interferometry up to 5 m.	[Defrere, D.; Absil, O.; Boulet, T.; de Xivry, G.

PFI will be sensitive to warm dust emission using mid-infrared capabilities made possible by precise fringe tracking in the near-infrared. An L/M band combiner will be especially sensitive to thermal emission from young exoplanets (and their disks) with a high spectral resolution mode to probe the kinematics of CO and H2O gas. In this paper, we give an overview of the main science goals of PFI, define a baseline PFI architecture that can achieve those goals, point at remaining technical challenges, and suggest activities today that will help make the Planet Formation Imager facility a reality.

Space-based infrared interferometry to study exoplanetary atmospheres	EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Space interferometer; Infrared astronomy; Darwin; TPF-I; Exoplanet; Habitability; Bio-signatures	NULLING INTERFEROMETER; SEARCH; TELESCOPE; BIOSIGNATURES; SPECTROSCOPY; ARCHITECTURE; PERFORMANCE; CONTRAST; PLANETS; LIFE	The quest for other habitable worlds and the search for life among them are major goals of modern astronomy. One way to make progress towards these goals is to obtain high-quality spectra of a large number of exoplanets over a broad range of wavelengths. While concepts currently investigated in the United States are focused on visible/NIR wavelengths, where the planets are probed in reflected light, a compelling alternative to characterize planetary atmospheres is the mid-infrared waveband (5-20 m). Indeed, mid-infrared observations provide key information on the presence of an atmosphere, the surface conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, habitability), and the atmospheric composition in important species such as H2O, CO2, O-3, CH4, and N2O. This information is essential to investigate the potential habitability of exoplanets and to make progress towards the search for life in the Universe. Obtaining high-quality mid-infrared spectra of exoplanets from the ground is however extremely challenging due to the overwhelming brightness and turbulence of the Earth's atmosphere. In this paper, we present a concept of space-based mid-infrared interferometer that can tackle this observing challenge and discuss the main technological developments required to launch such a sophisticated instrument.

HAWC+, the Far-Infrared Camera and Polarimeter for SOFIA	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Instrumentation; polarimeters; camera; far-infrared; detectors; stars; formation; dust	POLARIZATION	High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+) is the facility far-infrared imager and polarimeter for SOFIA, NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. It is designed to cover the portion of the infrared spectrum that is completely inaccessible to ground-based observatories and which is essential for studies of astronomical sources with temperatures between tens and hundreds of degrees Kelvin. Its ability to make polarimetric measurements of aligned dust grains provides a unique new capability for studying interstellar magnetic fields. HAWC+ began commissioning flights in April 2016 and was accepted as a facility instrument in early 2018. In this paper, we describe the instrument, its operational procedures, and its performance on the observatory.

We use two different liquid water observation products from CloudSat and MODIS, for CLWP and their combined product for LWC with a method to remove the contribution from precipitating and convective core hydrometeors so that more meaningful model-observation comparisons can be made. Considering the CloudSat's limitations of CLWC retrievals due to contamination from the precipitation and from radar clutter near the surface, an estimate CLWC is synergistically constructed using MODIS CLWP and CloudSat CLWC. The model-observation comparison shows that most of the CMIP3/CMIP5 annual mean CLWP values are overestimated by factors of 2 - 10 compared to observations globally. There are a number of CMIP5 models, including CSIRO, MPI, and the UCLA GCM that perform well compared to the other models. For the vertical structure of CLWC, significant systematic biases are found with many models biased significantly high above the mid-troposphere. In the tropics, systematic high biases occur at all levels above 700 hPa. Based on the Taylor diagram, the ensemble performance of CMIP5 CLWP simulation shows little or no improvement relative to CMIP3.

Geologic mapping of the Ac-2 Coniraya quadrangle of Ceres from NASA's Dawn mission: Implications for a heterogeneously composed crust	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Cratering; Geological processes	SOLAR-SYSTEM; VESTA; SURFACE; ORIGIN; CHRONOLOGY	Since its arrival at Ceres, Dawn's Framing Camera has been imaging the dwarf planet at different altitudes, using 8 different filters. Based on these images, global clear filter mosaics, digital terrain models, and global color mosaics were produced. These datasets are basis for the derived photo-geologic map of the Ac-2 Coniraya quadrangle, located between 0 degrees and 90 degrees eastern longitude and between 20 degrees and 40 degrees northern latitude. Crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) measurements have been applied to derive the stratigraphic history of the identified geologic units in the Ac-2 Coniraya quadrangle. Based on these investigations, we found that the Ac-2 Coniraya quadrangle shows evidence for a long geologic history lasting over 3.5 Ga. Most of the identified geologic units are related to impact cratering at different periods of time. While the oldest unit identified in the Ac-2 Coniraya quadrangle, the cratered terrain, shows an absolute model age (AMA) of 3.3-3.5 Ga, the youngest units, including fresh impact craters and lobate flows, show AMAs of < 100 Ma. The large number of different sized impact craters excavated a variety of materials with different colors and albedo, indicative of a heterogeneous crustal composition, including water or volatiles. Pits identified at lkapati crater's smooth deposits might further indicate the presence of volatiles in the subsurface. Furthermore, our mapping of the Ac-2 Coniraya quadrangle shows that possible H2O ice in the crust is heterogeneously distributed, as lobate flows, bright spots, and pits are only found at certain locations, related to relatively fresh impact craters.

Ceres' Ezinu quadrangle: a heavily cratered region with evidence for localized subsurface water ice and the context of Occator crater	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids, surfaces; Geological processes; Ices; Impact processes	GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SURFACE-COMPOSITION; EMPLACEMENT; FEATURES; FOSSAE; VESTA	Dawn is the first spacecraft to visit and orbit Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt and the only dwarf planet in the inner Solar System. The Dawn science team undertook a systematic geologic mapping campaign of Ceres' entire surface. Here we present our contribution to this mapping campaign, a geologic map and geologic history of the Ezinu quadrangle, located in the northern mid latitudes from 21-66 degrees N and 180-270 degrees E. From our map, we reconstruct the geologic history of Ezinu quadrangle, which is dominated by impact cratering. Large impact craters that formed a few hundreds to tens of millions of years ago, such as Datan, Messor, Ninsar and Occator, are surrounded by ejecta and contain the products of mass wasting (hummocky crater floor material and talus material) and crater-wall collapse (terrace material). Two of these large impact craters are the sources of lobate flows, which we interpret as melt flows emplaced after the ballistically deposited ejecta. Morphological evidence suggests these lobate flows are rich in water-ice-bearing material that was excavated during the formation of the impact craters. There are only a few localized occurrences of lobate flows, suggesting that the water-ice-bearing source materials have restricted extents and/or are deeply buried within Ceres' subsurface. The quadrangle also contains a variety of linear features: secondary crater chains are formed by the impact of locally and globally sourced material and pit chains and grooves are formed by the collapse of surficial materials into sub-surface fractures. The Ezinu quadrangle contains the northern portion of Occator crater, which is the host crater of prominent bright regions called faculae. Our geologic analysis therefore also provides context for the future investigation of Occator and its intriguing faculae. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Scully, Jennifer E.

The Ac-5 (Fejokoo) quadrangle of Ceres: Geologic map and geomorphological evidence for ground ice mediated surface processes	ICARUS			English	Article						Ceres; Dawn; Dwarf planet; Geologic map; Ground ice	IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION; DAWN; DIFFERENTIATION; EVOLUTION; MOVEMENT; DEPOSITS; FEATURES; DEBRIS; CREEP; VESTA	NASA's Dawn spacecraft arrived at Ceres on March 6, 2015, and has been studying the dwarf planet through a series of successively lower orbits. Throughout these mission phases Dawn obtained photographic, mineralogical, elemental abundance, and gravity data. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt with a mean diameter of similar to 940 km. The Dawn Science Team conducted a geologic mapping campaign for Ceres similar to the one that was implemented on the asteroid Vesta (Dawn's previous target), including production of a Survey- and High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO)-based global map, and a series of 15 Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO)-based quadrangle maps. In this paper we present the LAMO-based geologic map of the Ac-5 Fejokoo Quadrangle (21-66 degrees N and 270-360 degrees E) and discuss its implications. The Ac-5 quadrangle is primarily composed of ancient cratered terrain punctuated with several moderately fresh impact craters of geologic interest, six large tholi that are possibly cryovolcanic in origin, and an abundance of flows that well represent the full spectrum of mass wasting features observed on Ceres. The Fejokoo quadrangle hosts the majority of Oxo crater, the site of the first spectroscopic detection of H2O ice on the surface of Ceres. The H2O detection is closely related to two distinctive morphological units interpreted as possible high water ice content landslides. These observations and interpretations are consistent with ground ice mediated surface processes on Ceres. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Hughson, Kynan H. G.; Russell, C.

The unique geomorphology and structural geology of the Haulani crater of dwarf planet Ceres as revealed by geological mapping of equatorial quadrangle Ac-6 Haulani	ICARUS			English	Article							ORIGIN; VESTA	The dwarf planet Ceres has been explored by NASA's Dawn spacecraft with the goal of characterizing its geology, mineralogy, topography, shape, and internal structure. One outcome of this exploration is the production of geologic maps, meant to unveil the geologic history of Ceres. In this paper, we present the geologic map of the Ac-6 Haulani quadrangle (Lat. 22 degrees S-22 degrees N, Long. 0 degrees-72 degrees E) based on Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) (similar to 35 m/pixel) data supplemented with color and spectral data, as well as a digital terrain model from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) (similar to 135 m/pixel, vertical accuracy of about 10 m). The 34 km diameter Haulani crater is one of the youngest features on Ceres and the most prominent one in the quadrangle. Haulani was formed on a topographical transition in north-south direction and shows a complex morphology with a variety of lobate flows and tectonic features. Multiple cracks and depressions around the crater indicate the failure of subsurface material. These were likely formed by the subsidence of material due to the instability of the subsurface. The mapping of Ac-6 Haulani suggests that Ceres is built up of layers with different material properties. We propose that Ceres has a solid crust and a variable ice-rich subsurface consistent with previous and recent models of Ceres' interior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The geology of the Kerwan quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres: Investigating Ceres' oldest, largest impact basin	ICARUS			English	Article								We conducted a geologic mapping investigation of Dawn spacecraft data to determine the geologic history of the Kerwan impact basin region of dwarf planet Ceres, which is mostly located in the Ac-7 Kerwan Quadrangle. Geological mapping was applied to Dawn Framing Camera images from the Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO, 35 m/pixel) and supplemented by digital terrain models and color images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO, 135 m/pixel), as well as preliminary Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) and gravity data. The 284-km diameter Kerwan impact basin is the oldest unequivocal impact crater on Ceres, and has a highly discontinuous, polygonal, degraded rim and contains a 'smooth' unit that both fills the basin floor and surrounds the degraded rim to the west, south, and east. Although there are some subtle topographic features in the Kerwan basin that could be interpreted as flow boundaries, there is no indisputable evidence of cryovolcanic features in or around the basin (however if such features existed they could be buried). Nevertheless, all data point to impact-induced melting of a cerean crust enriched in a volatile, likely water ice, to produce the Kerwan smooth material. Subsequent geologic activity in this region includes emplacement of impact craters such as Dantu, which produced a variety of colorful deposits, and rayed craters such as Rao and Cacaguat. Based on the crater size-frequency distribution absolute model ages of the Kerwan smooth material in and around the basin, marking a minimum age for the Kerwan basin, our mapping defines this as the oldest boundary within the cerean geologic timescale, separating the Pre-Kerwanan and Kerwanan Periods at > 1.3 Ga (Lunar-derived chronology model) or > 230-850 Ma (Asteroid-derived chronology model, depending on strength of target material).

The geology of the Nawish quadrangle of Ceres: The rim of an ancient basin	ICARUS			English	Article						NASA/Dawn; Ceres; Geology; Geologic mapping; GIS	SURFACE; CRATERS; BRIGHT	Herein we present the geology of the Nawish quadrangle, located in the equatorial region of dwarf planet Ceres, named after one of the most prominent craters of the area. Geologic mapping was based on the image mosaics and digital terrain models derived from Dawn Framing Camera data. Interpretation of geologic units was supported by supplemental data, such as the multi spectral color images from the Framing Camera, and the spectral parameters derived from the Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) data, as well as Dawn gravity data. There is not a primary feature that dominates the geology of Nawish quadrangle, but rather several terrains overlap, and their relations explain the geology of the area. Crater size frequency distributions show that Nawish quadrangle is dominated by two distinct time domains. The central and eastern part of the quadrangle is topographically elevated, which we define as cratered highlands, and contains the older domain. The western lowlands show two younger domains related to impact craters Kerwan and Dantu, including the Kerwan smooth material and Dantu ejecta. This variation of elevation within the Nawish quadrangle is more than the half of the global topographic altitude variation on Ceres. Analysis and comparison of the topography of the Nawish quadrangle with surrounding ones shows that this quadrangle is dominated by the topography of the rim sector of a large, > 800 km ancient impact basin, most likely the putative Vendimia Planitia. The Nawish quadrangle thus represents a sector of Ceres which has not undergone large-scale, post-Kerwan, intermediate age-events, but rather represents a place on Ceres where a well-preserved relict of old cerean crust can be studied, together with ejecta from more recent impact events.

The geology of the occator quadrangle of dwarf planet Ceres: Floor-fractured craters and other geomorphic evidence of cryomagmatism	ICARUS			English	Article							DOME CRATERS; CENTRAL PIT; SURFACE; GANYMEDE	The Dawn Science Team is conducting a geological mapping campaign at Ceres during the nominal mission, including iterative mapping using data obtained during each orbital phase. We are using geological mapping as a method to identify the geologic processes that have modified the surface of dwarf planet Ceres. We here present the geology of the Ac-9 Occator quadrangle, located between 22 degrees S-22 degrees N and 216-288 degrees E. The Ac-9 map area is within the topographically high region named Hanami Planum. Features of note within the profile include impact craters Occator, Azacca, Lociyo, Nepen and Kirnis. Four of these craters have fractured, shallow floors, morphometrically comparable to floor-fractured craters (FFCs) on the Moon. Similar to models for the formation of the lunar FFCs, we suggest that these Ceres FFCs are a result of cryomagmatic uplift under the crater floors. A set of regional linear structures called the Samhain Catenae do not have any obvious relationship to impact craters. Many of the catenae are comprised of smaller structures that have linked together, suggestive of en echelon fractures. It has been suggested that these fractures formed due to the uplift of Hanami Planum due to cryromagmatic plumes. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Buczkowski, D.

Geologic mapping of the Ac-11 Sintana quadrangle: Assessing diverse crater morphologies	ICARUS			English	Article							SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; CERES; VESTA	A geologic map at a scale of 1:1,000,000 of the Ac-11 Sintana quadrangle (21-66 degrees S and 0-90 degrees E) from the dwarf planet Ceres and based on data from NASA's Dawn spacecraft, was produced as part of a geologic mapping campaign in order to investigate the surface structure, stratigraphy, composition and surface modifying processes. The Sintana quadrangle is geologically dominated by cratered terrain with morphologically distinct crater types. The most prominent craters, Sintana, Hamori, Jarimba, Tupo, Annona and Darzamat, have complex structures including smooth crater material covering their floors, collapsed crater walls forming terraces, and central ridges. Multiple gravity-driven blocky mass wasting features indicate post-impact crater modification and are indicative of an ice-rich subsurface, in which there is no topographic or structural evidence of endogenic activity visible in the quadrangle. Absolute age estimates suggest that the entire surface in the quadrangle was resurfaced similar to 1.1 Ga ago, possibly by Kerwan-related impact-induced melting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Geologic mapping of the Urvara and Yalode Quadrangles of Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article							BASIN EJECTA; VESTA; DAWN; WATER; DEPOSITS	We conducted geologic mapping of the Urvara (Ac-13) and Yalode (Ac-14) Quadrangles (21-66 degrees S, 180-360 degrees E) of the dwarf planet Ceres utilizing morphologic, topographic, and compositional information acquired by NASA's Dawn mission. The geologic characteristics of the two large impact basins Urvara (170 km diameter) and Yalode (260 km diameter) and their surroundings were investigated using Dawn Framing Camera datasets, including Survey (415 m/pixel), HAMO (140 m/pixel), and LAMO (35 m/pixel) images and mosaics, color and color ratio images, and DTMs derived from stereo-photogrammetry. Geologic mapping demonstrates that impact cratering has dominated the geologic history of the Urvara and Yalode Quadrangles, with early cratered terrain formation followed by formation of the large basins and widespread emplacement of basin-related smooth material. Impact craters display a wide range of preservation states from nearly completely buried/degraded forms to more recent pristine craters with terraced inner walls and lobate ejecta deposits. Cross-cutting relationships and morphologic signatures show that the Urvara impact followed the Yalode impact, consistent with ages derived from crater size-frequency distributions (580 +/- 40 Ma for Yalode and 550 +/- 50 Ma for Urvara). Observed differences in basin materials and rim morphology suggest heterogeneities in the substrate excavated by impact. Smooth deposits that cover large areas of the quadrangles, including the basin floors, rims, and exterior zones, are interpreted to be dominated by Urvara ejecta but Yalode ejecta and localized ice-rich flow material may be minor components. Geologic mapping results and simulations of ejecta emplacement suggest that Urvara and Yalode ejecta deposits extend for large distances (more than two crater diameters from the basin centers) and may serve as important stratigraphic markers for the geologic record of Ceres.

Dawn mission's search for satellites of Ceres: Intact protoplanets don't have satellites	ICARUS			English	Article						Dwarf planet Ceres; Asteroids; Satellites of asteroids; Asteroid Ceres	GIANT IMPACT ORIGIN; ASTEROIDS; DISCOVERY; VESTA; FAMILY	Upon its approach to orbit the dwarf planet Ceres in early 2015, optical navigation and dedicated satellite search images were acquired with the Dawn mission's framing camera 2. A team of searchers individually processed and examined the images for evidence of objects moving with Ceres. Completeness of search with respect to the space searched was calculated as a function of distance to Ceres and found to be complete down to 15 Ceres radii (Ceres' mean radius is 470 km). Upper limits of detectable magnitude were determined for each observed set of images and an upper limit in size was calculated assuming for the putative objects, Ceres' geometric albedo of 0.11. Nothing was found associated with Ceres down to a radius of 12 m for the most sensitive search, and down to a radius of 323 m for the least sensitive search circumstances. Examination of the physical properties of the 41 largest and most massive main belt asteroids suggests that large asteroids without satellites are intact and their interiors have internal strength. This is consistent with results from the Dawn mission at both Vesta and Ceres. Ceres' volatile-rich composition also is a likely contributor to both the absence of satellites at Ceres and of Ceres meteorites at Earth. These results suggest that collisional disruption creating rubble pile structure is a necessary condition for formation of satellites around main belt asteroids. Published by Elsevier Inc.

State-of-the-art tools to evaluate mobility of ground vehicles do not address this need due to their not accounting for UGV technologies and the associated latencies. Although the trade-off between latency and performance has been thoroughly studied in the telerobotics literature and the results may qualitatively shed light onto the UGV domain, as well, a quantitative generalization is not possible due to the differences in context. Recognizing this gap, this paper presents a functional relationship between mobility and latency in high-speed, teleoperated UGVs under the context of path following. Specifically, data from human-in-the-loop simulations performed in this paper are combined with data from prior studies to span three vehicle types, three courses, and teleoperation latencies ranging from 0 s to 1 s. This combination yields for the first time a diverse data set for the context of path following in high speed, teleoperated UGVs. Based on this data set, empirical relationships are derived to quantify the trade-off between latency versus average speed and lane keeping error. These relationships can be used to establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of autonomy-enabled UGV systems. (C) 2018 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We detect kappa And b at a high signal-to-noise ratio and extract high-precision spectrophotometry using a new forward-modeling algorithm for (A-)LOCI complementary to KLIP-FM developed by Pueyo et al. kappa And b's spectrum best resembles that of a low-gravity LO-L1 dwarf (L0-L1 gamma). Its spectrum and luminosity are very well matched by 2MASS J0141-4633 and several other 12.5-15 M-J free-floating members of the 40 Myr old Tuc-Hor Association, consistent with a system age derived from recent interferometric results for the primary, a companion mass at/near the deuterium-burning limit (13(-2)(+12) M-J), and a companion-to-primary mass ratio characteristic of other directly imaged planets (q similar to 0.0051(-0.001)(+0.005)). We did not unambiguously identify additional, more closely orbiting companions brighter and more massive than kappa And b down to p similar to 0.'' 3 (15 au). SCExAO/CHARIS and complementary Keck/NIRC2 astrometric points reveal clockwise orbital motion. Modeling points toward a likely eccentric orbit: a subset of acceptable orbits include those that are aligned with the star's rotation axis. However, kappa And b's semimajor axis is plausibly larger than 55 au and in a region where disk instability could form massive companions. Deeper high-contrast imaging of kappa And and low-resolution spectroscopy from extreme adaptive optics systems such as SCExAO/CHARIS and higher-resolution spectroscopy from Keck/OSIRIS or, later, IRIS on the Thirty Meter Telescope could help to clarify kappa And b's chemistry and whether its spectrum provides an insight into its formation environment.

This is in part due to a paucity of known young planets and the uncertainties in age-dating for most exoplanet host stars. Exoplanets with well-constrained ages, particularly those which are young, are useful as benchmarks for studies aiming to constrain the evolutionary timescales relevant for planets. Such timescales may concern orbital migration, gravitational contraction, or atmospheric photoevaporation, among other mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of an adolescent transiting sub-Neptune from K2 photometry of the low-mass star EPIC 247267267. From multiple age indicators, we estimate the age of the star to be 120 Myr, with a 68% confidence interval of 100-760 Myr. The size of EPIC 247267267 b (R-P= 2.8 +/- 0.1 R-circle plus) combined with its youth make it an intriguing case study for photoevaporation models, which predict enhanced atmospheric mass loss during early evolutionary stages.

An Optical Transmission Spectrum for the Ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b Measured with the Hubble Space Telescope	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets	NEPTUNE-MASS EXOPLANET; HD 189733B; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; THERMAL STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERIC HAZE; GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; TRANSIT; WATER; ABSORPTION	We present an atmospheric transmission spectrum for the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, measured using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Across the 0.47-1 mu m wavelength range, the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to-and in some spectroscopic channels exceeding-that previously measured at near-infrared wavelengths (1.15-1.65 mu m). Wavelength-dependent variations in the opacity rule out a gray cloud deck at a confidence level of 3.7 sigma and may instead be explained by VO spectral bands. We find a cloud-free model assuming chemical equilibrium for a temperature of 1500 K and a metal enrichment of 10-30x solar matches these data well. Using a free-chemistry retrieval analysis, we estimate a VO abundance of -6.6(-0.3)(+0.2) dex. We find no evidence for TiO and place a 3 sigma upper limit of -7.9 dex on its abundance, suggesting TiO may have condensed from the gas phase at the day-night limb. The opacity rises steeply at the shortest wavelengths, increasing by approximately five pressure scale heights from 0.47 to 0.3 mu m in wavelength. If this feature is caused by Rayleigh scattering due to uniformly distributed aerosols, it would imply an unphysically high temperature of 6810 +/- 1530 K. One alternative explanation for the short-wavelength rise is absorption due to SH (mercapto radical), which has been predicted as an important product of non-equilibrium chemistry in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Irrespective of the identity of the NUV absorber, it likely captures a significant amount of incident stellar radiation at low pressures, thus playing a significant role in the overall energy budget, thermal structure, and circulation of the atmosphere.

Many of these K2 targets show two distinct periods, and for the lowest-mass stars in these clusters, virtually all of these systems with two periods are photometric binaries. The most likely explanation is that we are detecting the rotation periods for both components of these binaries. We explore the evolution of the rotation rate in both components of photometric binaries relative to one another and to nonphotometric binary stars. In Upper Sco and the Pleiades, these low-mass binary stars have periods that are much shorter on average and much closer to each other than would be true if drawn at random from the M dwarf single stars. In Upper Sco, this difference correlates strongly with the presence or absence of infrared excesses due to primordial circumstellar disks-the single-star population includes many stars with disks, and their rotation periods are distinctively longer on average than their binary star cousins of the same mass. By Praesepe age, the significance of the difference in rotation rate between the single and binary low-mass M dwarf stars is much less, suggesting that angular momentum loss from winds for fully convective zero-age main-sequence stars erases memory of the rotation rate dichotomy for binary and single very low mass stars at later ages.

We observed 98 stars with spectral types from B to M. Cool planets emit a larger share of their flux in L' compared to shorter wavelengths, affording LEECH an advantage in detecting low-mass, old, and cold-start giant planets. We emphasize proximity over youth in our target selection, probing physical separations smaller than other direct imaging surveys. For FGK stars, LEECH outperforms many previous studies, placing tighter constraints on the hot-start planet occurrence frequency interior to similar to 20 au. For less luminous, cold-start planets, LEECH provides the best constraints on giant-planet frequency interior to similar to 20 au around FGK stars. Direct imaging survey results depend sensitively on both the choice of evolutionary model (e.g., hot- or cold-start) and assumptions (explicit or implicit) about the shape of the underlying planet distribution, in particular its radial extent. Artificially low limits on the planet occurrence frequency can be derived when the shape of the planet distribution is assumed to extend to very large separations, well beyond typical protoplanetary dust-disk radii (less than or similar to 50 au), and when hot-start models are used exclusively. We place a conservative upper limit on the planet occurrence frequency using coldstart models and planetary population distributions that do not extend beyond typical protoplanetary dust-disk radii. We find that less than or similar to 90% of FGK systems can host a 7-10 M-Jup planet from 5 to 50 au. This limit leaves open the possibility that planets in this range are common.

Here we report on observations of `Oumuamua made with the Spitzer Space Telescope on 2017 November 21-22 (UT). We integrated for 30.2 hr at 4.5 mu m (IRAC channel 2). We did not detect the object and place an upper limit on the flux of 0.3 mu Jy (3a). This implies an effective spherical diameter less than [98, 140, 440] m and albedo greater than [0.2, 0.1, 0.01] under the assumption of low, middle, or high thermal beaming parameter eta, respectively. With an aspect ratio for 'Oumuamua of 6:1, these results correspond to dimensions of [240:40, 341:57, 1080:180] m, respectively. We place upper limits on the amount of dust, CO, and CO2 coming from this object that are lower than previous results; we are unable to constrain the production of other gas species. Both our size and outgassing limits are important because 'Oumuamua's trajectory shows non-gravitational accelerations that are sensitive to size and mass and presumably caused by gas emission. We suggest that 'Oumuamua may have experienced low-level postperihelion volatile emission that produced a fresh, bright, icy mantle. This model is consistent with the expected eta value and implied high-albedo value for this solution, but, given our strict limits on CO and CO2, requires another gas species-probably H2O-to explain the observed non-gravitational acceleration. Our results extend the mystery of 'Oumuamua's origin and evolution.

The NANOGrav 11-year Data Set: Pulse Profile Variability	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: general; pulsars: general; pulsars: individual (J1643-1224, J1713+0747, B1937+21, J2145-0750); stars: neutron	RADIO ASTRONOMICAL POLARIMETRY; INTERSTELLAR SCINTILLATION; TIMING OBSERVATIONS; PRECISION; EMISSION; PRECESSION; DISPERSION; STABILITY; EVENT	Access to 50 years of data has led to the discovery of pulsar emission and rotation variability on timescales of months and years. Most of this long-term variability has been seen in long-period pulsars, with relatively little focus on recycled millisecond pulsars. We have analyzed a 38-pulsar subset of the 45 millisecond pulsars in the NANOGrav 11-year data set, in order to review their pulse profile stability. The most variability, on any timescale, is seen in PSRs J1713+0747, B1937+21, and J2145-0750. The strongest evidence for long-timescale pulse profile changes is seen in PSRs B1937+21 and J1643-1224. We have focused our analyses on these four pulsars in an attempt to elucidate the causes of their profile variability. Effects of scintillation seem to be responsible for the profile modifications of PSR J2145-0750. We see evidence that imperfect polarization calibration contributes to the profile variability of PSRs J1713+0747 and B1937+21, along with radio frequency interference around 2 GHz, but find that propagation effects also have an influence. The changes seen in PSR J1643-1224 have been reported previously, yet elude explanation beyond their astrophysical nature. Regardless of cause, unmodeled pulse profile changes are detrimental to the accuracy of pulsar timing and must be incorporated into the timing models where possible.	[Brook, P. R.; McLaughlin, M.

Observations and models are converging on the idea that ionization-driven chemistry depletes carbon monoxide in T-Tauri disks. Yet the extent of CO depletion depends on the incident flux of ionizing radiation, and some T-Tauri stars may have winds strong enough to shield their disks from cosmic rays. There is also a range of X-ray luminosities possible for a given stellar mass. Here we use a suite of chemical models, each with a different incident X-ray or cosmic-ray flux, to assess whether CO depletion is a typical outcome for T-Tauri disks. We find that CO dissociation in the outer disk is a robust result for realistic ionization rates, with abundance reductions between 70% and 99.99% over 2 Myr of evolution. Furthermore, after the initial dissociation epoch, the inner disk shows some recovery of the CO abundance from CO2 dissociation. In highly ionized disks, CO recovery in the inner disk combined with depletion in the outer disk creates a centrally peaked CO abundance distribution. The emitting area in rare CO isotopologues may be an indirect ionization indicator: in a cluster of disks with similar ages, those with the most compact CO isotopologue emission see the highest ionization rates.

DES Collaboration; NOAO Data Lab	The Dark Energy Survey: Data Release 1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						astronomical databases: miscellaneous; catalogs; cosmology: observations; surveys; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	ANGULAR MASKS; SKY SURVEY; REPRESENTATIONS; SEXTRACTOR; CATALOG	We describe the first public data release of the Dark Energy Survey, DES DR1, consisting of reduced single-epoch images, co-added images, co-added source catalogs, and associated products and services assembled over the first 3 yr of DES science operations. DES DR1 is based on optical/near-infrared imaging from 345 distinct nights (2013 August to 2016 February) by the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4 m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory in Chile. We release data from the DES wide-area survey covering similar to 5000 deg(2) of the southern Galactic cap in five broad photometric bands, grizY. DES DR1 has a median delivered point-spread function of g = 1.12, r = 0.96, i = 0.88, z = 0.84, and Y = 0.'' 90 FWHM, a photometric precision of <1% in all bands, and an astrometric precision of 151 mas. The median co-added catalog depth for a 1.'' 95 diameter aperture at signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 10 is g = 24.33, r = 24.08, i = 23.44, z = 22.69, and Y = 21.44 mag. DES DR1 includes nearly 400 million distinct astronomical objects detected in similar to 10,000 co-add tiles of size 0.534 deg(2) produced from similar to 39,000 individual exposures. Benchmark galaxy and stellar samples contain similar to 310 million and similar to 80 million objects, respectively, following a basic object quality selection. These data are accessible through a range of interfaces, including query web clients, image cutout servers, jupyter notebooks, and an interactive co-add image visualization tool. DES DR1 constitutes the largest photometric data set to date at the achieved depth and photometric precision.	[Abbott, T. M. C.; Smith, R. C.; Vivas, A. K.; Walker, A.

J	Levulis, SJ; DeLucia, PR; Kim, SY				Levulis, Samuel J.; DeLucia, Patricia R.; Kim, So Young			Effects of Touch, Voice, and Multimodal Input, and Task Load on Multiple-UAV Monitoring Performance During Simulated Manned-Unmanned Teaming in a Military Helicopter	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article						supervisory control; uninhabited aerial vehicles; touchscreens; speech user interfaces; multimodal displays	SUPERVISORY CONTROL; ROBOTS	Objective: We evaluated three interface input methods for a simulated manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) supervisory control system designed for Air Mission Commanders (AMCs) in Black Hawk helicopters. Background: A key component of the U.S. Army's vision for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is to integrate UAVs into manned missions, called MUM-T (Department of Defense, 2010). One application of MUM-T is to provide the AMC of a team of Black Hawk helicopters control of multiple UAVs, offering advanced reconnaissance and real-time intelligence of flight routes and landing zones. Method: Participants supervised a (simulated) team of two helicopters and three UAVs while traveling toward a landing zone to deploy ground troops. Participants classified aerial photographs collected by UAVs, monitored instrument warnings, and responded to radio communications. We manipulated interface input modality (touch, voice, multimodal) and task load (number of photographs). Results: Compared with voice, touch and multimodal control resulted in better performance on all tasks and resulted in lower subjective workload and greater subjective situation awareness, ps < .05. Participants with higher spatial ability classified more aerial photographs (r = .75) and exhibited shorter response times to instrument warnings (r = -.58) than participants with lower spatial ability. Conclusion: Touchscreen and multimodal control were superior to voice control in a supervisory control task that involved monitoring visual displays and communicating on radio channels. Application: Although voice control is often considered a more natural and less physically demanding input method, caution is needed when designing visual displays for users sharing common communication channels.

A set of near-field measurements at a frequency of 100 GHz of a 30 cm diameter spherical antenna with 30 cm radius of curvature confirm improvement in illumination efficiency from 20.2% for the feed at the paraxial focus of the spherical primary to 42.4% with the feed position optimized as described by [M. Alonso-DelPino, P. Goldsmith, C. El-maleh, T. Reck, and G. Chattopadhyay, "Efficiency optimization of spherical reflectors by feed position adjustments," IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, vol. 16, pp. 2865-2868, 2017] to 53.1% with the present TPX corrective lens. Further improvement should be possible by antireflection treatment of the lens surfaces, and by using both lens surfaces to optimize the amplitude in addition to the phase distribution of the antenna illumination. This technique offers advantages for antenna systems used for communication and for a variety of remote sensing applications.

J	Qamar, A; Jafari, M; Rais-Zadeh, M				Qamar, Afzaal; Jafari, Mohsen; Rais-Zadeh, Mina			Solidly Mounted Anti-Symmetric Lamb-Wave Delay Lines as an Alternate to SAW Devices	IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS			English	Article						AlN; SAW devices; super high frequency	PIEZOELECTRIC THIN-FILMS; HIGH-FREQUENCY; RESONATORS; TRANSDUCERS; ORIENTATION; AIN	This letter reports the first results on a new generation of anti-symmetric lamb-wave devices using a simple solidly mounted platform of AlN/Mo/Si and operating at very-high-to-super-high frequency range. AlN/Mo/Si-based solidly mounted resonators (SMRs) with sub-micrometer interdigitated transducers were fabricated using the electron beam lithography and liftoff process. Plasma etching was used to etch vias in ground pads to get access to the bottom electrode for grounding. By comparing the floating, grounded, and no bottom electrode device performances, it has been observed that the presented SMR design with grounded bottom electrode results in enhancement of the coupling efficiency by 500% compared with conventional SAW devices. In addition, these devices are more mechanically robust and can be monolithically integrated with a CMOS platform without requiring complex packaging processes compared with conventional released lamb-wave resonators.

The antenna must be primarily composed of metal to ensure survivability in the harsh environment of the Europan icy moon (i.e., very low temperature and high radiation). The antenna must also have a low profile to meet drastic volume constraints and have efficiencies higher than 80% at both the uplink and downlink X-band deep space frequency bands. This antenna is a key component for this potential mission as it enables direct-to-earth links rather than relaying signals via a nearby spacecraft. The proposed HGA consists of 16 subarrays fed by waveguides. An 8 x 8 subarray was fabricated to prove the antenna concept. A gain of 24.1 and 25.3 dBic was demonstrated at both frequency bands for the subarray. This translates into an aperture efficiency of 83% and 80% at uplink and downlink bands, respectively.

J	Brancato, V; Hajnsek, I				Brancato, Virginia; Hajnsek, Irena			Separating the Influence of Vegetation Changes in Polarimetric Differential SAR Interferometry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR); electromagnetic (EM) model; interferometry; polarimetry; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; wet biomass	SOIL-MOISTURE; RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; MODEL; BACKSCATTER; INVERSION; IMPACT; GROWTH	Soil moisture and wet biomass changes between two noninstantaneous SAR observations markedly affect the displacement estimates obtainable with Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR). The separation, the modeling of these influences besides their uncoupling from the displacement signal, and the atmospheric disturbances are still unsolved issues for several repeat-pass interferometric applications. This paper focuses on the separation of vegetation changes from the other phase contributions affecting repeat-pass measurements over vegetated areas. These phase terms mainly relate to changes in soil moisture, atmospheric delays, and surface deformation. The separation is achieved with a first-order scattering solution decomposing the observed HH and VV DInSAR phases in the sum of several phase terms. The latter mainly consider the changes in soil surface scattering and in the two-way propagation through a vertically oriented vegetation canopy. No assumption is made on the spatiotemporal evolution of the displacement and atmosphere. The overall approach is tested on a L-band data set acquired over an agricultural area. Upon calibration, the model allows for estimating changes in wet biomass based on the nonzero HH-VV DInSAR phase difference observed over several birefringent agricultural fields. The obtained biomass estimates provide then a correction for the effect of vegetation changes on the observed HH and VV DInSAR phases. Deprived of the vegetation contribution, the remainder phase terms can be more easily explored for further analyses, e.g., the estimation of soil moisture changes and/or surface movements in vertically oriented vegetated areas.

However, models predicting sea level rise due to ice melt lack critical information regarding processes at the base of ice sheets. Although radio echo sounders are powerful tools that are currently used to constrain subglacial conditions, existing ice-penetrating radar systems are too resource-intensive in terms of cost, power, and logistics for multiyear deployment at a large scale. To address this, we present passive radio sounding as a low-resource approach for observing ice sheets across a range of spatial and temporal scales. While passive radar has been used for target tracking and military purposes, it has never been used for the sounding of ice sheets. Some recent work has proposed using passive radio sounding of Europa's icy shell using Jupiter's decametric radiation. We expand on this idea by evaluating and discussing challenges and opportunities for developing a passive radio sounder using the Sun as an illuminator of opportunity for echo detection. Here, our prototype instrument sits on the side of a cliff and measures the Sun's direct and reflected path off the ocean surface. We then use an autocorrelation-based method to extract the amplitude and delay of the reflection. This serves as the first in situ demonstration of an autocorrelation-based passive sounder using a compact astronomical white noise signal.

The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), an organized envelope of tropical convection, is recognized as one of the leading sources of subseasonal predictability. This review synthesizes the latest progress regarding the MJO predictability and prediction. During the past decade, the MJO prediction skill in dynamical prediction systems has exceeded the skill of empirical predictions. Such improvement has been mainly attributed to more observations and computer resources, advances in theoretical understanding, and improved numerical models aided in part by multinational efforts through field campaigns and multimodel experiments. The state-of-the-art dynamical forecasts have shown MJO prediction skill up to 5 weeks. Prediction skill can be extended by improving the ensemble generation approach tailored for MJO prediction and by averaging multiensembles or multimodels. MJO prediction skill can be influenced by the tropical mean state and low-frequency climate mode variations, as well as by the extratropical circulation. MJO prediction skill is proven to be sensitive to model physics, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and quality of initial conditions, while the impact of the model resolution seems to be marginal. Remaining challenges and recommendations on new research avenues to fully realize the predictability of the MJO are discussed.

Hafnium Films and Magnetic Shielding for TIME, A mm-Wavelength Spectrometer Array	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Spectrometers; Bolometers; Transition-edge sensors; Hafnium; Magnetic shielding		TIME is a mm-wavelength grating spectrometer array that will map fluctuations of the 157.7-mm emission line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]) during the epoch of reionization (redshift z similar to 5-9). Sixty transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers populate the output arc of each of the 32 spectrometers, for a total of 1920 detectors. Each bolometer consists of gold absorber on a similar to 3 x 3 mm silicon nitride micro-mesh suspended near the corners by 1 x 1 x 500 mu m silicon nitride legs targeting a photon-noise-dominated NEP similar to 1 x 10-(17) W/root Hz. Hafnium films are explored as a lower-T-c alternative to Ti (500 mK) for TIME TESs, allowing thicker support legs for improved yield. Hf T-c is shown to vary between 250 and 450 mK when varying the resident Ar pressure during deposition. Magnetic shielding designs and simulations are presented for the TIME first-stage SQUIDs. Total axial field suppression is predicted to be 5 x 10(7).	[Hunacek, J.; Bock, J.; Bradford, C.

Development of Aluminum LEKIDs for Balloon-Borne Far-IR Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Kinetic inductance detector; Aluminum; Far-infrared spectroscopy; Balloon		We are developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) designed to achieve background-limited sensitivity for far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy on a stratospheric balloon. The spectroscopic terahertz airborne receiver for farinfrared exploration will study the evolution of dusty galaxies with observations of the [CII] 158 mu m and other atomic fine-structure transitions at z = 0.5-1.5, both through direct observations of individual luminous infrared galaxies, and in blind surveys using the technique of line intensity mapping. The spectrometer will require large format (similar to 1800 detectors) arrays of dual-polarization sensitive detectors with NEPs of 1 x 10(-17) WHz(-1/2). The low-volume LEKIDs are fabricated with a single layer of aluminum (20-nm-thick) deposited on a crystalline silicon wafer, with resonance frequencies of 100-250 MHz. The inductor is a single meander with a linewidth of 0.4 mu m, patterned in a grid to absorb optical power in both polarizations. The meander is coupled to a circular waveguide, fed by a conical feedhorn. Initial testing of a small array prototype has demonstrated good yield and a median NEP of 4 x 10(-18) WHz(-1/2).

Low-Temperature Noise Performance of SuperSpec and Other Developments on the Path to Deployment	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						SuperSpec; Kinetic inductance detector; NEP; TiN; Spectrometer; ROACH-2		SuperSpec is a compact on-chip spectrometer operating at mm and sub-mm wavelengths which will enable the construction of sensitive multibeam spectrometers. SuperSpec employs a filter bank architecture, consisting of lithographically patterned niobium superconducting microstrip mm-wave resonators. The power admitted by each resonator is detected by a titanium nitride lumped-element kinetic inductance detector (KID) with resonant frequency from 100 to 200 MHz. We present a characterization of the detector noise performance down to 10 mK measured in a dark setting. We report a device NEP of 2.7 x 10(-18) WHz(-1/2) at 210 mK, which is below the expected photon noise level at high-altitude ground-based observatories. The NEP decreases to a constant value of approximately 7.0 x 10(-19) WHz(-1/2) below 130 mK. The white noise is well modeled by thermal generation-recombination noise (GR noise) down to 130 mK and a noise floor at low temperatures. Moreover, the addition of low-pass coaxial filters further reduces the noise floor to achieve an NEP of 5.7 x 10(-19) WHz(-1/2) below 100 mK. We discuss a photolithographic technique to adjust KID resonances that results in an f(0) designed versus measured scatter of 1.7 x 10(-5), which will allow a significant reduction in resonators lost to clashes in full-scale designs. Finally, we present a demonstration of a new ROACH-2-based readout system operating below 500 MHz and show preliminary data indicating the suitability of this system for future highly multiplexed KID arrays.

The LiteBIRD Satellite Mission: Sub-Kelvin Instrument	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic microwave background; Satellite; Inflation; Polarization; B-mode		Inflation is the leading theory of the first instant of the universe. Inflation, which postulates that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion an instant after its birth, provides convincing explanation for cosmological observations. Recent advancements in detector technology have opened opportunities to explore primordial gravitational waves generated by the inflation through B-mode (divergent-free) polarization pattern embedded in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies. If detected, these signals would provide strong evidence for inflation, point to the correct model for inflation, and open a window to physics at ultra-high energies. LiteBIRD is a satellite mission with a goal of detecting degree-and-larger-angular-scale B-mode polarization. LiteBIRD will observe at the second Lagrange point with a 400 mm diameter telescope and 2622 detectors. It will survey the entire sky with 15 frequency bands from 40 to 400 GHz to measure and subtract foregrounds. The US LiteBIRD team is proposing to deliver sub-Kelvin instruments that include detectors and readout electronics. A lenslet-coupled sinuous antenna array will cover low-frequency bands (40-235 GHz) with four frequency arrangements of trichroic pixels. An orthomode-transducer-coupled corrugated horn array will cover high-frequency bands (280-402 GHz) with three types of single frequency detectors. The detectors will be made with transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers cooled to a 100 milli-Kelvin base temperature by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. The TES bolometers will be read out using digital frequency multiplexing with Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifiers. Up to 78 bolometers will be multiplexed with a single SQUID amplifier. We report on the sub-Kelvin instrument design and ongoing developments for the LiteBIRD mission.

These FPUs are vital to SPIDER's primary science goal of detecting or placing an upper limit on the amplitude of the primordial gravitational wave signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by constraining the B-mode contamination in the CMB from Galactic dust emission. Each 280 GHz focal plane contains a 16 x 16 grid of corrugated silicon feedhorns coupled to an array of aluminum-manganese transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers fabricated on 150 mm diameter substrates. In total, the three 280 GHz FPUs contain 1530 polarization-sensitive bolometers (765 spatial pixels) optimized for the low loading environment in flight and read out by time-division SQUID multiplexing. In this paper, we describe the mechanical, thermal, and magnetic shielding architecture of the focal planes and present cryogenic measurements which characterize yield and the uniformity of several bolometer parameters. The assembled FPUs have high yields, with one array as high as 95% including defects from wiring and readout. We demonstrate high uniformity in device parameters, finding the median saturation power for each TES array to be similar to 3 pW at 300 mK with a less than 6% variation across each array at 1 sigma. These focal planes will be deployed alongside the 95 and 150 GHz telescopes in the SPIDER-2 instrument, slated to fly from McMurdo Station in Antarctica in December 2018.	[Bergman, A. S.; Benton, S.

SPIDER: CMB Polarimetry from the Edge of Space	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic microwave background; Inflation; Bolometers; Transition-edge sensors; Polarimetry	BICEP	SPIDER is a balloon-borne instrument designed to map the polarization of the millimeter-wave sky at large angular scales. Spider targets the B-mode signature of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), with a focus on mapping a large sky area with high fidelity at multiple frequencies. SPIDER's first long-duration balloon (LDB) flight in January 2015 deployed a total of 2400 antenna-coupled transition-edge sensors (TESs) at 90 GHz and 150 GHz. In this work we review the design and in-flight performance of the SPIDER instrument, with a particular focus on the measured performance of the detectors and instrument in a space-like loading and radiation environment. SPIDER's second flight in December 2018 will incorporate payload upgrades and new receivers to map the sky at 285 GHz, providing valuable information for cleaning polarized dust emission from CMB maps.

Development of a Massive, Highly Multiplexible, Phonon-Mediated Particle Detector Using Kinetic Inductance Detectors	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID); Athermal phonon; Position reconstruction; Rare-event search		We present a status update on the development of a phonon-mediated particle detector using kinetic inductance detector (KID). The design is intended for O(1) kg substrate, using O(10(2)) KIDs on a single readout line, to image the athermal phonon distribution at < 1 mm position resolution and O(10) eV energy resolution. The design specification is set by the need to improve position reconstruction fidelity while maintaining low energy threshold for future rare-event searches such as for low-mass dark matter. We report on the design, which shows negligible crosstalk and > 95% inductor current uniformity, using the coplanar waveguide feedline, ground shield, and a new class of KIDs with symmetric coplanar stripline (sCPS) inductor. The multiplexing is designed upon the frequency-geometry relation we develop for the sCPS KIDs. We introduce the fabrications of the Nb RF assessment prototypes and the high phonon collection efficiency Al-Nb devices. We achieve less than or similar to 0.07% frequency displacement on a 80-KID RF assessment prototype, and the result indicates that we may place more than 180 resonances in our 0.4GHz readout band with minimal frequency misordering. The coupling quality factors are similar to 10(5) as designed. Finally, we update our work in progress in fabricating the O(102) KID, bi-material, O(1) kg detectors, and the expected position and energy resolutions.

DES Collaboration	A catalogue of structural and morphological measurements for DES Y1	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; surveys; Galaxy evolution; Galaxy structure; galaxies: general	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES; DARK ENERGY SURVEY; STAR-FORMATION; HIGH-REDSHIFT; SECULAR EVOLUTION; DISTANT GALAXIES; MASSIVE GALAXIES; COLD STREAMS; EQUAL-MASS	We present a structural and morphological catalogue for 45 million objects selected from the first year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Single Sersic fits and non-parametric measurements are produced for g, r, and i filters. The parameters from the best-fitting Sersic model (total magnitude, half-light radius, Sersic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are measured with GALFIT; the non-parametric coefficients (concentration, asymmetry, dumpiness, Gini, M20) are provided using the Zurich Estimator of Structural Types (ZEST+). To study the statistical uncertainties, we consider a sample of state-of-the-art image simulations with a realistic distribution in the input parameter space and then process and analyse them as we do with real data: this enables us to quantify the observational biases due to PSF blurring and magnitude effects and correct the measurements as a function of magnitude, galaxy size, Sersic index (concentration for the analysis of the non-parametric measurements) and ellipticity. We present the largest structural catalogue to date: we find that accurate and complete measurements for all the structural parameters are typically obtained for galaxies with SEXTRACTOR MAG_AUTO_I <= 21. Indeed, the parameters in the filters i and r can be overall well recovered up to MAG_AUTO <= 21.5, corresponding to a fitting completeness of similar to 90 per cent below this threshold, for a total of 25 million galaxies. The combination of parametric and non-parametric structural measurements makes this catalogue an important instrument to explore and understand how galaxies form and evolve. The catalogue described in this paper will be publicly released alongside the DES collaboration Y1 cosmology data products at the following URL: https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: calibration of redMaGiC redshift distributions in DES and SDSS from cross-correlations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						surveys; galaxies: distances and redshifts; large-scale structure of Universe	OSCILLATION SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; DATA RELEASE; GALAXIES; EVOLUTION; CFHTLENS	We present calibrations of the redshift distributions of redMaGiC galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR8 data. These results determine the priors of the redshift distribution of redMaGiC galaxies, which were used for galaxy clustering measurements and as lenses for galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements in DES Y1 cosmological analyses. We empirically determine the bias in redMaGiC photometric redshift estimates using angular cross-correlations with Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxies. For DES, we calibrate a single-parameter redshift bias in three photometric redshift bins: z is an element of [0.15, 0.3], [0.3,0.45], and [0.45,0.6]. Our best-fit results in each bin give photometric redshift biases of vertical bar Delta z vertical bar < 0.01. To further test the redMaGiC algorithm, we apply our calibration procedure to SDSS redMaGiC galaxies, where the statistical precision of the cross-correlation measurement is much higher due to a greater overlap with BOSS galaxies. For SDSS, we also find best-fit results of vertical bar Delta z vertical bar < 0.01. We compare our results to other analyses of redMaGiC photometric redshifts.

Parallaxes of Southern Extremely Cool objects III: 118 L and T dwarfs	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						parallaxes; proper motions; brown dwarfs; stars: low-mass	ALL-SKY SURVEY; H-ALPHA EMISSION; FIELD L-DWARFS; LOW-MASS STARS; BROWN DWARF; ULTRACOOL DWARFS; PROPER MOTION; SPECTROSCOPIC CLASSIFICATION; INFRARED PHOTOMETRY; SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD	We present new results from the Parallaxes of Southern Extremely Cool dwarfs program to measure parallaxes, proper motions and multiepoch photometry of L and early T dwarfs. The observations were made on 108 nights over the course of 8 yr using the Wide Field Imager on the ESO 2.2m telescope. We present 118 new parallaxes of L and T dwarfs of which 52 have no published values and 24 of the 66 published values are preliminary estimates from this program. The parallax precision varies from 1.0 to 15.5 mas with a median of 3.8 mas. We find evidence for two objects with long term photometric variation and 24 new moving group candidates. We cross-match our sample to published photometric catalogues and find standard magnitudes in up to 16 pass-bands from which we build spectral energy distributions and H-R diagrams. This allows us to confirm the theoretically anticipated minimum in radius between stars and brown dwarfs across the hydrogen burning minimum mass. We find the minimum occurs between L2 and L6 and verify the predicted steep dependence of radius in the hydrogen burning regime and the gentle rise into the degenerate brown dwarf regime. We find a relatively young age of similar to 2 Gyr from the kinematics of our sample.	[Smart, R. L.; Bucciarelli, B.; Crosta, M. T.; Lattanzi, M.

Shallow Cumulus in WRF Parameterizations Evaluated against LASSO Large-Eddy Simulations	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article						Cloud parameterizations; Cumulus clouds; Mesoscale models; Numerical weather prediction; forecasting; Parameterization; Single column models	EMITTED RADIANCE INTERFEROMETER; CONVECTIVE BOUNDARY-LAYER; DATA ASSIMILATION; VERTICAL VELOCITY; PART I; MODEL; FLUX; REPRESENTATION; SCHEME; DISSIMILARITY	Representation of shallow cumulus is a challenge for mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. These cloud fields have important effects on temperature, solar irradiance, convective initiation, and pollutant transport, among other processes. Recent improvements to physics schemes available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model aim to improve representation of shallow cumulus, in particular over land. The DOE LES ARM Symbiotic Simulation and Observation Workflow (LASSO) project provides several cases that we use here to test the new physics improvements. The LASSO cases use multiple large-scale forcings to drive large-eddy simulations (LES), and the LES output is easily compared to output from WRF single-column simulations driven with the same initial conditions and forcings. The new Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN) eddy diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) boundary layer and shallow cloud scheme produces clouds with timing, liquid water path (LWP), and cloud fraction that agree well with LES over a wide range of those variables. Here we examine those variables and test the scheme's sensitivity to perturbations of a few key parameters. We also discuss the challenges and uncertainties of single-column tests. The older, simpler total energy mass-flux (TEMF) scheme is included for comparison, and its tuning is improved. This is the first published use of the LASSO cases for parameterization development, and the first published study to use such a large number of cases with varying cloud amount. This is also the first study to use a more precise combined infrared and microwave retrieval of LWP to evaluate modeled clouds.

The recent greening of global lands suggests an increasing trend of terrestrial vegetation growth, but whether or not the peak growth has been globally enhanced still remains unclear. Here, we use two global datasets of gross primary productivity (GPP) and a satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to characterize recent changes in annual peak vegetation growth (that is, GPP(max) and NDVImax). We demonstrate that the peak in the growth of global vegetation has been linearly increasing during the past three decades. About 65% of the NDVImax variation is evenly explained by expanding croplands (21%), rising CO2 (22%) and intensifying nitrogen deposition (22%). The contribution of expanding croplands to the peak growth trend is substantiated by measurements from eddy-flux towers, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and a global database of plant traits, all of which demonstrate that croplands have a higher photosynthetic capacity than other vegetation types. The large contribution of CO2 is also supported by a meta-analysis of 466 manipulative experiments and 15 terrestrial biosphere models. Furthermore, we show that the contribution of GPP(max) to the change in annual GPP is less in the tropics than in other regions. These multiple lines of evidence reveal an increasing trend in the peak growth of global vegetation. The findings highlight the important roles of agricultural intensification and atmospheric changes in reshaping the seasonality of global vegetation growth.

O-2 solubility in Martian near-surface environments and implications for aerobic life	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							OXYGEN SOLUBILITY; HEAT-CAPACITIES; MARS; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; WATER; EVOLUTION; ATMOSPHERE; MANGANESE; SULFUR	Due to the scarcity of O-2 in the modern Martian atmosphere, Mars has been assumed to be incapable of producing environments with sufficiently large concentrations of O-2 to support aerobic respiration. Here, we present a thermodynamic framework for the solubility of O-2 in brines under Martian near-surface conditions. We find that modern Mars can support liquid environments with dissolved O-2 values ranging from -2.5 x10(-6) mol m(-3) to 2 mol m(-3) across the planet, with particularly high concentrations in polar regions because of lower temperatures at higher latitudes promoting O-2 entry into brines. General circulation model simulations show that O-2 concentrations in near-surface environments vary both spatially and with time-the latter associated with secular changes in obliquity, or axial tilt. Even at the limits of the uncertainties, our findings suggest that there can be near-surface environments on Mars with sufficient O-2 available for aerobic microbes to breathe. Our findings may help to explain the formation of highly oxidized phases in Martian rocks observed with Mars rovers, and imply that opportunities for aerobic life may exist on modern Mars and on other planetary bodies with sources of O-2 independent of photosynthesis.

Given limited precipitation but high potential evaporation, their water storage is vulnerable to subtle flux perturbations, which are exacerbated by global warming and human activities. Increasing regional evidence suggests a probably recent net decline in endorheic water storage, but this remains unquantified at a global scale. By integrating satellite observations and hydrological modelling, we reveal that during 2002-2016 the global endorheic system experienced a widespread water loss of about 106.3 Gt yr(-1), attributed to comparable losses in surface water, soil moisture and groundwater. This decadal decline, disparate from water storage fluctuations in exorheic basins, appears less sensitive to El Nino-Southern Oscillation-driven climate variability, which implies a possible response to longer-term climate conditions and human water management. In the mass-conserved hydrosphere, such an endorheic water loss not only exacerbates local water stress, but also imposes excess water on exorheic basins, leading to a potential sea level rise that matches the contribution of nearly half of the land glacier retreat (excluding Greenland and Antarctica). Given these dual ramifications, we suggest the necessity for long-term monitoring of water storage variation in the global endorheic system and the inclusion of its net contribution to future sea level budgeting.

A conundrum for climate studies is the discrepancy between surface fluxes that minimize model-data differences for an atmosphere-only model vs surface fluxes that minimize model-data differences for an ocean model. As a first step towards a consistent coupled ocean-atmosphere data-assimilation (DA) system, we compare surface net heat flux from a state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis, the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), to net heat flux from a state-of-the-art ocean state estimate, the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Version 4 (ECCO-v4). The possible impacts of the MERRA-2 and ECCO-v4 air-sea net heat flux difference in a coupled DA system were assessed using a set of experiments designed to imitate different "flavors" of a coupled DA system in an ocean-only setup. This was done by forcing the ECCO-v4 underlying ocean model - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) - with different sets of MERRA-2 fields and utilizing different forcing methods. By doing so we were able to turn off different air-sea feedbacks which, in a coupled DA setup, are partially muted by the constraining observations. The set of experiments, therefore, represents a range of active feedbacks in different "flavors" of coupled data-assimilation systems. For the period 1992-2011, MERRA-2 net heat flux has a global mean difference of - 4.9 Wm(-2) relative to ECCO-v4. When MERRA-2 surface fields are used to force MITgcm, imbalances in the energy and the hydrological cycles of MERRA-2, which are directly related to the fact that MERRA-2 was created without an interactive ocean, propagate to the ocean. The experiment in which MITgcm is forced with MERRA-2 fluxes (MERRA-2-flux experiment) results in a 2.5 degrees C global mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cooling, a 1m reduction in global mean sea level, and other drastic changes in the large scale ocean circulation relative to those resulting when the MITgcm is forced with the optimized ECCO-v4 net heat flux (the ECCO-v4 experiment itself). When MITgcm is forced with MERRA-2 state variables (MERRA-2-state experiment), the SST is somewhat restored to the observed SST, but the errors are shifted to the water cycle, resulting in a global mean sea level increase of 2.7 m. To further explore the pros and cons of these two approaches, we introduce a new intermediate forcing method in which the ocean is forced with turbulent fluxes but has a long wave feedback. This method, unlike MERRA-2 state, preserves the MERRA-2 water and salinity cycles, and it reduces the SST error compared to the MERRA-2-flux experiment, but the SST is not as good as that in the MERRA-2-state experiment. Our results have implications for ocean-model forcing recipes and clearly reveal the undesirable consequences of limiting the feedbacks in either these types of experiments or in coupled DA.

Statistical analysis and performance evaluation of optical array receivers for deep-space optical communications under random tracking errors	PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION			English	Article							TELESCOPE ARRAY; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; POINTING ERROR; LINK; DESIGN; EARTH; CHANNELS	Telescope array receiver is a viable architecture for Earth-based reception in a deep-space optical communication system. In this paper, effects of random tracking errors on the performance of optical array receivers for an inter-planetary deep-space optical communications link between Earth and Mars is investigated. The paper has two major parts. In the first part, statistical analysis and mathematical modeling of the impact of tracking errors on general direct-detection optical communication receivers is presented. The analytical results show that tracking errors could severely degrade the performance of optical receivers; hence, these need to be compensated, especially in a deep-space link. In the second part, design and analysis of a closed-loop tracking subsystem for telescope array receivers operating in a deep-space link is presented. An end-to-end simulation platform for communication between Earth and Mars is implemented that incorporates direct-detection array receivers and the proposed tracking subsystems to alleviate the effects of random tracking errors. Extreme channel conditions, i.e., maximum distance, strong background noise and turbulence conditions are modeled to evaluate the performance bounds. Simulations results depict that in worst-case channel conditions, the proposed architecture mitigates the impact of tracking errors to be within reasonable limits. Comparison of achievable data rates show that in the presence of random tracking errors, replacement of a large telescope (10m diameter) with an array of relatively smaller-sized telescopes (i.e., 100, 1m telescopes) results in acceptable performance loss (i.e., <13%). Hence, performance degradation due to tracking errors does not pose a major limitation in employing array architecture in deep-space communication. The presented analysis further strengthens the viability of array architecture compared to a monolithic, large telescope for deep-space communications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Regional unit definition for the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on the SHAP7 model	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Rosetta; 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; Nucleus; Morphology		The previously defined regions on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churytunov-Gerasimenko have been mapped back onto the 3D SHAP7 model of the nucleus (Preusker et al., 2017). The resulting regional definition is therefore self consistent with boundaries that are well defined in 3 dimensions. The facets belonging to each region are provided as supplementary material. The shape model has then been used to assess inhomogeneity of nucleus surface morphology within individual regions. Several regions show diverse morphology. We propose sub-division of these regions into clearly identifiable units (sub-regions) and a comprehensive table is provided. The surface areas of each sub-region have been computed and statistics based on grouping of unit types are provided. The roughness of each region is also provided in a quantitative manner using a technique derived from computer graphics applications. The quantitative method supports the sub-region definition by showing that differences between sub-regions can be numerically justified.

Dyes irradiated in aqueous solution or as lyophilized powders were evaluated for absorbance and emission spectra, quantum yield, and where appropriate, ability to label cells or nucleic acids. Although some dyes showed significant increase or decrease in quantum yield with the dose, their spectra and cell-labeling properties remained essentially unchanged after irradiation in powder form. Irradiation in aqueous solution led to significantly greater changes, including a large blue shift in the DNA intercalator propidium iodide. These results suggest that many fluorescent probes are appropriate for use in astrobiological missions to Europa, but that SYTO9 and propidium iodide should be used with caution or not mixed with each other, as is commonly done in "Live/Dead" labeling applications.

High-resolution MAHLI images permit detailed morphological and spatial analysis of these features. Millimetre-scale lenticular features occur in massive to well-laminated mudstone and are interpreted as pseudomorphs after gypsum. The distribution and orientation of lenticular features indicate deposition at or near the sediment-water or sediment-air interface, and the lenticular form suggests crystallization in the presence of organic constituents. Original crystals were likely poikilotopic (i.e., incorporating elements of the matrix), and the original mineralogy was lost during later diagenetic fluid flow. Evidence for lenticular gypsum imaged in Gale Crater, along with earlier observations of potential early diagenetic evaporite precipitation made by the Opportunity rover, indicate that deposition of evaporitic sulfate minerals may have been widespread on early Mars.

Mission engineering constraints on elevation and latitude were used to identify candidate landing sites that addressed the scientific objectives of the mission. However, for the first time these constraints did not have a major influence on the viability of candidate sites and, with the new entry, descent, and landing capabilities included in the baseline mission, the vast majority of sites were evaluated and down-selected on the basis of science merit. More than 30 candidate sites with likely acceptable surface and atmospheric conditions were considered at a series of open workshops in the years leading up to the launch. During that period, iteration between engineering constraints and the evolving relative science potential of candidate sites led to the identification of three final candidate sites: Jezero crater (184386 degrees N, 77.5031 degrees E), northeast (NE) Syrtis (17.8899 degrees N,77.1599 degrees E) and Columbia Hills (14.5478 degrees S, 175.6255 degrees E). The final landing site will be selected by NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate. This paper serves as a record of landing site selection activities related primarily to science, an inventory of the number and variety of sites proposed, and a summary of the science potential of the highest-ranking sites.

These important targets for future missions may have recently been Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), which are thought to be chemically and physically primitive remnants of the early solar system. While the Kuiper Belt spans distances of 30-50 AU, making direct observations difficult, Centaurs' proximity to the Earth and Sun make them more accessible targets for robotic missions. Thus, we outline a mission concept designed to reconnoiter 10199 Chariklo, the largest Centaur and smallest ringed body yet discovered. Named for a legendary Centaur tamer, the conceptual Camilla mission is designed to fit under the cost cap of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) New Frontiers program, leveraging a conservative payload to support a foundational scientific investigation to these primitive bodies. Specifically, the single flyby encounter utilizes a combined high-resolution camera/VIS-IR mapping spectrometer, a sub-mm point spectrometer, and a UV mapping spectrometer. In addition, the mission concept utilizes a kinetic impactor, which would provide the first opportunity to sample the composition of potentially primitive subsurface material beyond Saturn, thus providing key insights into solar system origins. Such a flyby of the Chariklo system would provide a linchpin in the understanding of small body composition, evolution, and transport of materials in the solar system.

Modelling the Tucana III stream - a close passage with the LMC	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Galaxy: evolution; Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: dwarf	LARGE-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; SAGITTARIUS DWARF GALAXY; DARK-MATTER HALOES; TIDAL STREAMS; ROTATION CURVE; STELLAR STREAM; PROPER MOTION; GALACTIC BAR; PALOMAR 5; MILKY	We present results of the first dynamical stream fits to the recently discovered Tucana III stream. These fits assume a fixed Milky Way potential and give proper motion predictions, which can be tested with the upcoming Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). These fits reveal that Tucana III is on an eccentric orbit around the Milky Way and, more interestingly, that Tucana III passed within 15 kpc of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) approximately 75 Myr ago. Given this close passage, we fit the Tucana III stream in the combined presence of the Milky Way and the LMC. We find that the predicted proper motions depend on the assumed mass of the LMC and that the LMC can induce a substantial proper motion perpendicular to the stream track. A detection of this misalignment will directly probe the extent of the LMC's influence on our Galaxy, and has implications for nearly all methods which attempt to constraint the Milky Way potential. Such a measurement will be possible with the upcoming Gaia DR2, allowing for a measurement of the LMC's mass.

These simulations include HSC observing conditions and galaxy images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), with fully realistic galaxy morphologies and the impact of nearby galaxies included. We find that the inclusion of nearby galaxies in the images is critical to reproducing the observed distributions of galaxy sizes and magnitudes, due to the non-negligible fraction of unrecognized blends in ground-based data, even with the excellent typical seeing of the HSC survey (0.58 arcsec in the i band). Using these simulations, we detect and remove the impact of selection biases due to the correlation of weights and the quantities used to define the sample (S/N and apparent size) with the lensing shear. We quantify and remove galaxy property-dependent multiplicative and additive shear biases that are intrinsic to our shear estimation method, including an similar to 10 per cent-level multiplicative bias due to the impact of nearby galaxies and unrecognized blends. Finally, we check the sensitivity of our shear calibration estimates to other cuts made on the simulated samples, and find that the changes in shear calibration are well within the requirements for HSC weak lensing analysis. Overall, the simulations suggest that the weak lensing multiplicative biases in the first-year HSC shear catalogue are controlled at the 1 per cent level.

DES Collaboration	Dynamical Analysis of Three Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects with Similar Orbits	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Kuiper belt objects: individual (2016 QV89, 2016 QU89, 2013 UH15)	EL61 COLLISIONAL FAMILY; PLANET; EVOLUTION; SYSTEM	This paper reports the discovery and orbital characterization of two extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs), 2016 QV(89) and 2016 QU(89) , which have orbits that appear similar to that of a previously known object, 2013 UH15. All three ETNOs have semimajor axes a approximate to 172 au and eccentricities e approximate to 0.77. The angular elements (i, w, Omega) vary by 6 degrees, 15 degrees, and 49 degrees, respectively, between the three objects. The two new objects add to the small number of TNOs currently known to have semimajor axes between 150 and 250 au, and they serve as an interesting dynamical laboratory to study the outer realm of our solar system. Using a large ensemble of numerical integrations, we find that the orbits are expected to reside in close proximity in the (a, e) phase plane for roughly 100 Myr before diffusing to more separated values. We find that an explanation for the orbital configuration of the bodies as a collision product is disfavored. We then explore other scenarios that could influence their orbits. With aphelion distances over 300 au, the orbits of these ETNOs extend far beyond the classical Kuiper Belt and an order of magnitude beyond Neptune. As a result, their orbital dynamics can be affected by the proposed new solar system member, referred to as Planet Nine in this work. With perihelion distances of 35-40 au, these orbits are also influenced by resonant interactions with Neptune. A full assessment of any possible new solar system planets must thus take into account this emerging class of TNOs.	[Khain, T.; Adams, F. C.; Gerdes, D. W.; Hamilton, S.

We present a detailed analysis of the system using K2 and ground-based photometry, radial velocities, Doppler tomography, and adaptive optics imaging. From our global models, we infer that the host star is a rapidly rotating (nu sin I-* = 74.92 km s(-1)) F dwarf with T-eff = 6202 K, R-* = 1.586 R-circle dot and M-* = 1.317 M-circle dot. EPIC 246851721 b has a radius of 1.051 +/- 0.044 R-J, and a mass of 3.0(-1.2)(+1.1) M-J. Doppler tomography reveals an aligned spin-orbit geometry, with a projected obliquity of -1.degrees 47(-0.86)(+0.87), making EPIC 246851721 the fourth hottest star to host a Jovian planet with P > 5 days and a known obliquity. Using quasi-periodic signatures in its light curve that appear to be spot modulations, we estimate the star's rotation period, and thereby infer the true obliquity of the system to be 3.degrees 7(-1.8)(+3.7). We argue that this near-zero obliquity is likely to be primordial rather than a result of tidal damping. The host star also has a bound stellar companion, a 0.4 M-circle dot M dwarf at a projected separation of 2100 au, but the companion is likely incapable of emplacing EPIC 246851721 b in its current orbit via high-eccentricity Kozai-Lidov migration.

InAs/InAsSb Type-II Superlattice Mid-Wavelength Infrared Focal Plane Array With Significantly Higher Operating Temperature Than InSb	IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Infrared detector; photodetector; type-II superlattice; InAs/InAsSb; heterostructure; unipolar barrier; nBn; focal plane array		We report focal plane array (FPA) results on a mid-wavelength InAs/InAsSb type-II strained layer superlattice (T2SLS) unipolar barrier infrared detector with a cutoff wavelength of 5.4 mu m. For 300 K background in the 3-5-mu m band, f/2 aperture, an FPA operating at 150 K exhibits a mean noise equivalent differential temperature (NEDT) of 18.5 mK, and an NEDT operability of 99.7%. The NE Delta T distribution has a width of 8 mK, with no noticeable distribution tail, indicating excellent uniformity. The mean noise-equivalent irradiance is 9.1 x 10(11) photons/sec-cm(2). The mean quantum efficiency is 49.1% without antireflection coating, and the mean specific detectivity (D*) is 2.53 x 10(11) cm-Hz(1/2)/W. Benefitting from an absorber material with a much longer Shockley-Read-Hall minority carrier lifetime, and a device architecture that suppresses generation-recombination and surface-leakage dark current, the InAs/InAsSb T2SLS barrier infrared detector FPA has demonstrated a significantly higher operating temperature than the mid-wavelength infrared market-leading InSb.

Coupling of Precipitation and Cloud Structures in Oceanic Extratropical Cyclones to Large-Scale Moisture Flux Convergence	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Clouds; Cold fronts; Convection; Convergence; divergence; Extratropical cyclones; Moisture; moisture budget	WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC; WATER-VAPOR; CLIMATE; MODIS; WARM; CIRCULATION; REANALYSIS; EVOLUTION; BUDGET; COVER	Precipitation (from TMPA) and cloud structures (from MODIS) in extratropical cyclones (ETCs) are modulated by phases of large-scale moisture flux convergence (from MERRA-2) in the sectors of ETCs, which are studied in a new coordinate system with directions of both surface warm fronts (WFs) and surface cold fronts (CFs) fixed. The phase of moisture flux convergence is described by moisture dynamical convergence Q(cnvg) and moisture advection Q(advt). Precipitation and occurrence frequencies of deep convective clouds are sensitive to changes in Q(cnvg), while moisture tendency is sensitive to changes in Q(advt). Increasing Q(cnvg) and Q(advt) during the advance of the WF is associated with increasing occurrences of both deep convective and high-level stratiform clouds. A rapid decrease in Q(advt) with a relatively steady Q(cnvg) during the advance of the CF is associated with high-level cloud distribution weighting toward deep convective clouds. Behind the CF (cold sector or area with polar air intrusion), the moisture flux is divergent with abundant low- and midlevel clouds. From deepening to decaying stages, the pre-WF and WF sectors experience high-level clouds shifting to more convective and less stratiform because of decreasing Q(advt) with relatively steady Q(cnvg), and the CF experiences shifting from high-level to midlevel clouds. Sectors of moisture flux divergence are less influenced by cyclone evolution. Surface evaporation is the largest in the cold sector and the CF during the deepening stage. Deepening cyclones are more efficient in poleward transport of water vapor.

The physically consistent methodologies are developed to obtain a time-dependent reference ensemble without cold pools and to apply interactive surface heat fluxes without modeling of surface energy and water budgets. Three different simulation ensembles are contrasted. The reference ensemble, in the spirit of one-dimensional single-column models, eliminates cold pools by horizontally homogenizing negative buoyancy production due to rain evaporation. The additional ensembles complement the reference cold-pool-free ensemble by including cold pools and by applying either interactive or prescribed surface fluxes. Contrasting these ensembles suggests possible improvements of convection parameterization in large-scale models of weather and climate. Without cold pools, the reference ensemble preserves key features of buoyancy-driven cellular convection associated with a field of convective plumes, as assumed in a typical convection parameterization. With cold pools, a significant enhancement of surface heat and moisture fluxes and about an hour delay of their daily maximum is simulated. Cold pools enhance near-surface temperature and moisture standard deviations as well as maxima of the near-surface updraft velocity. They also lead to the reduction of cloud lateral entrainment, deeper vertical development of the cloud layer, and a few-times-larger accumulated surface precipitation. Interactive surface fluxes provide a damping mechanism that noticeably suppresses all these effects. Perhaps surprisingly, cold pools do not significantly change the cloud-base convective mass flux that approximately follows the evolution of surface heat fluxes.

The multiple merger assembly of a hyperluminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6	SCIENCE			English	Article							STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; MOLECULAR GAS; STAR-FORMATION; RADIO BUBBLES; GALAXIES; RESOLUTION; MODELS; FIELD	Galaxy mergers and gas accretion from the cosmic web drove the growth of galaxies and their central black holes at early epochs. We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56-052634.9 (W2246-0526), a dust-obscured quasar at redshift 4.6, 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246-0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction. The detection of tidal dusty bridges shows that W2246-0526 is accreting its neighbors, suggesting that merger activity may be a dominant mechanism through which the most luminous galaxies simultaneously obscure and feed their central supermassive black holes.

Indirect Influence of Humidity on Atmospheric Spectra Near 4 mu m	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						atmospheric spectra; 4 mu m region; influence of humidity; N-2 collision-induced absorption; CO2 line wings; surface temperature retrievals	COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; SOLAR OCCULTATION; ACE-FTS; CONTINUUM ABSORPTION; VERTICAL PROFILES; CO2; RETRIEVAL; IASI	We give the first demonstration that humidity has indirect effects on atmospheric spectra near 4 mu m, through the influence of collisions with H2O on both the collision-induced band of N-2 and the wings of the CO2 lines. This is shown by comparing computed and measured values of atmospheric transmissions and outgoing radiances. The usual assumption that collisions with H2O and dry air have equal effect on the N-2 and CO2 absorptions leads to significantly underestimated absorptions for humid atmospheres. This bias is considerably reduced when the influences of H2O on the N-2 and CO2 contributions to the spectra are taken into account using proper spectroscopic models. This opens perspectives of increased accuracy near mu m where the atmosphere is relatively transparent, for astronomical observations of outer objects from ground as well as for retrievals of the Earth land/sea surface temperatures from radiances recorded from space. Plain Language Summary We demonstrate that the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere enhances the absorption contributions of nitrogen and carbon dioxide near mu m. Properly taking this indirect influence into account largely improves the agreement between measured and calculated spectra. This opens the route for an improved use of this wavelength region in retrievals of land and sea surface temperatures from space-borne recordings of the outgoing radiation.

Bar Code Events in the Juno-UVS Data: Signature similar to 10MeV Electron Microbursts at Jupiter	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; Juno; aurora; relativistic electrons; radiation; Juno-UVS	POLAR-REGIONS; IMPULSIVE BURSTS; MAGNETOSPHERE; EMISSIONS; PARTICLES	One of the most intriguing discoveries of Juno is the quasi-systematic detection of upgoing electrons above the auroral regions. Here we discuss a by-product of the most energetic component of this population: a contamination resembling bar codes in the Juno-UVS images. This pattern is likely caused by bursts of similar to 10MeV electrons penetrating the instrument. These events are mostly detected when Juno's magnetic footprint is located poleward of the main emission relative to the magnetic pole. The signal is not periodic, but the bursts are typically 0.1-1s apart. They are essentially detected when Juno-UVS is oriented toward Jupiter, indicating that the signal is due to upgoing electrons. The event detections occur between 1 and 7 Jovian radii above the 1-bar level, suggesting that the electron acceleration takes place close to Jupiter and is thus both strong and brief. Plain Language Summary Someone's noise is always someone else's signal. Here we use the Juno-UVS ultraviolet spectrograph on board the Juno spacecraft as a particle detector rather than a photon collector. We analyze artifacts looking like a bar code in ultraviolet images of Jupiter's aurora to investigate a very specific kind of radiation above the poles. These bar code events are caused by very sporadic bursts of relativistic electrons arising from the aurora itself, rather than the radiation belts. This indicates the existence of a very efficient mechanism accelerating electrons upward right above Jupiter's atmosphere.

Challenges in the Search for Perchlorate and Other Hydrated Minerals With 2.1-mu m Absorptions on Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE; REFLECTANCE; PHYLLOSILICATES; SALTS; CRISM	A previously unidentified artifact has been found in Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars targeted I/F data. It exists in a small fraction (<0.05%) of pixels within 90% of images investigated and occurs in regions of high spectral/spatial variance. This artifact mimics real mineral absorptions in width and depth and occurs most often at 1.9 and 2.1 mu m, thus interfering in the search for some mineral phases, including alunite, kieserite, serpentine, and perchlorate. A filtering step in the data processing pipeline, between radiance and I/F versions of the data, convolves narrow artifacts (spikes) with real atmospheric absorptions in these wavelength regions to create spurious absorption-like features. The majority of previous orbital detections of alunite, kieserite, and serpentine we investigated can be confirmed using radiance and raw data, but few to none of the perchlorate detections reported in published literature remain robust over the 1.0- to 2.65-mu m wavelength range. Plain Language Summary Many minerals can be identified with remote sensing data by their characteristic absorptions in visible-shortwave infrared data. This type of data has allowed geological interpretation of much of Mars' surface, using satellite-based observation. We have discovered an issue with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars instrument's data processing pipeline. In similar to<0.05% of pixels in almost all images, noise in the data is smoothed in such a way that it mimics real mineral absorptions, falsely making it look as though certain minerals are present on Mars' surface. The vast majority of previously identified minerals are still confirmed after accounting for the artifact, but some to all perchlorate detections and a few serpentine detections were not confirmed, suggesting that the artifact created false detections. This means concentrated regions of perchlorate may not occur on Mars and so may not be available to generate possibly habitable salty liquid water at very cold temperatures.	[Leask, E.

The Thermal State and Interior Structure of Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; interior dynamics; thermal evolution; interior structure; InSight	CRYSTALLIZED MAGMA OCEAN; MARTIAN MANTLE; THERMOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION; DEGREE-1 CONVECTION; MAGNETIC-FIELD; CRUSTAL; CONSTRAINTS; THARSIS; GRAVITY; ORIGIN	The present-day thermal state, interior structure, composition, and rheology of Mars can be constrained by comparing the results of thermal history calculations with geophysical, petrological, and geological observations. Using the largest-to-date set of 3-D thermal evolution models, we find that a limited set of models can satisfy all available constraints simultaneously. These models require a core radius strictly larger than 1,800km, a crust with an average thickness between 48.8 and 87.1km containing more than half of the planet's bulk abundance of heat producing elements, and a dry mantle rheology. A strong pressure dependence of the viscosity leads to the formation of prominent mantle plumes producing melt underneath Tharsis up to the present time. Heat flow and core size estimates derived from the InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission will increase the set of constraining data and help to confine the range of admissible models. Plain Language Summary We constrain the thermal state and interior structure of Mars by combining a large number of observations with thermal evolution models. Models that match the available observations require a core radius larger that half the planetary radius and a crust thicker than 48.8km but thinner than 87.1km on average. All best-fit models suggest that more than half of the planet's bulk abundance of heat producing elements is located in the crust. Mantle plumes may still be active today in the interior of Mars and produce partial melt underneath the Tharsis volcanic province. Our results have important implications for the thermal evolution of Mars. Future data from the InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission can be used to validate our models and further improve our understanding of the thermal evolution of Mars.

Sediment Characterization at the Equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge From P-to-S Teleseismic Phase Conversions Recorded on the PI-LAB Experiment	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						PI-LAB; sediments; equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge	MARINE-SEDIMENTS; VELOCITY; UPLIFT; WAVES; RATES; PLATE; MODEL	Accurate marine sediment characteristics, for example, thickness and seismic velocity, are important for constraining sedimentation rates with implications for climate variations and for seismic imaging of deeper structures using ocean bottom seismic deployments. We analyze P-to-S seismic phase conversions from the sediment-crust boundary recorded by the Passive Imaging of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (PI-LAB) experiment to infer the sediment thickness across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge covering 0- to 80-Myr-old seafloor. We find P(d)s-P delay times of 0.04-0.37s, or 5- to 82-m thickness. Sediment thickness increases with age. Thickness agrees with global estimates for young (<15-20Myr) seafloor but is thinner on older lithosphere. Our result may represent a lower limit on sediment thickness, given that several of our stations are on topographic highs. The sedimentation rate decrease observed from 5 to 1.2 mm/kyr at similar to 10 Myr suggests a recent increase in productivity related to climate change, eolian dust fluxes, and/or biogenic marine activity. Plain Language Summary Studies on marine sediment production rate provide historical information on the past climates and sedimentation processes. Unfortunately, such data from the seafloor is sporadic across the oceans, limited to localized drilled sites and seismic profiles. Here we analyze the sediment characteristics along the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ocean, starting from age 0 at the ridge to sediments 80 million years old. We use newly acquired seismic data from the recent state-of-the-art Passive Imaging of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary experiment. Thirty-nine seismometers were put at the ocean bottom down to about 5,000m below sea level and left recording seismic data for one year between 2016 and 2017. Conversion of seismic phases from the boundary between the crust and the sediment were analyzed to determine the sediment seismic velocity and thickness below each station. It was found that the thickness increases with age at a slower rate than previously thought and that an abrupt increase in the sedimentation rate occurred in the last 10 million years, from 1.2 to 5mm per thousand years. The recent increase in productivity may be due to factors such as changes in climate, changes in the eolian dust fluxes from Africa to the Atlantic, and/or changes in biogenic marine activity.

Future Nuisance Flooding in Norfolk, VA, From Astronomical Tides and Annual to Decadal Internal Climate Variability	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						nuisance flooding; sea level rise; internal climate variability	US EAST-COAST; SEA-LEVEL RISE; UNITED-STATES; GULF-STREAM; TRENDS; OSCILLATION; EXTREME; IMPACT	Increasing sea level rise will lead to more instances of nuisance flooding along the Virginia coastline in the coming decades, causing road closures and deteriorating infrastructure. These minor flood events can be caused by astronomical tides alone, in addition to internal climate variability on annual to decadal timescales. An assessment of nuisance flooding from these two effects is presented up until the year 2050 for Norfolk, Virginia. The analysis of water levels indicates that nuisance flooding from tides alone in conjunction with a medium-high sea level scenario will result in flooding beginning in 2030 with frequency increasing thereafter. The addition of climate variability, by use of an empirical mode decomposition, leads to a substantial increase of flooding relative to the tides-alone analysis and shows flood events beginning as soon as 2020. High tides in the future will produce nuisance flooding without the need of other drivers such as coastal storms. Plain Language Summary As sea level continues to rise, coastal cities are going to start to see increases in nuisance flooding. This minor flooding is generally caused by tides and wind events, leading to inundation that over time deteriorates roads and infrastructure. Nuisance flooding in Norfolk, Virginia, has increased 325% since 1960 and is becoming more prominent. By combining sea level estimates, tidal estimates, and natural internal climate variability contributions to sea level rise, we have determined how nuisance flooding will increase in the future for Norfolk up until the year 2050. Our analyses show that this flooding will continue to increase in frequency with time, with a potential for well over 200 flood events in the year 2049.	[Burgos, A.

Keck Array Collaboration; BICEP2 Collaboration	Constraints on Primordial Gravitational Waves Using Planck, WMAP, and New BICEP2/Keck Observations through the 2015 Season	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							GRAVITY-WAVES; MICROWAVE; POLARIZATION	We present results from an analysis of all data taken by the BICEP2/Keck CMB polarization experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season. This includes the first Keck Array observations at 220 GHz and additional observations at 95 and 150 GHz. The Q and U maps reach depths of 5.2, 2.9, and 26 mu K-CMB arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively, over an effective area of approximate to 400 square degrees. The 220 GHz maps achieve a signal to noise on polarized dust emission approximately equal to that of Planck at 353 GHz. We take auto and cross spectra between these maps and publicly available WMAP and Planck maps at frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz. We evaluate the joint likelihood of the spectra versus a multicomponent model of lensed-Lambda CDM + r + dust + synchrotron thorn noise. The foreground model has seven parameters, and we impose priors on some of these using external information from Planck and WMAP derived from larger regions of sky. The model is shown to be an adequate description of the data at the current noise levels. The likelihood analysis yields the constraint r(0.05) < 0.07 at 95% confidence, which tightens to r(0.05) < 0.06 in conjunction with Planck temperature measurements and other data. The lensing signal is detected at 8.8 sigma significance. Running a maximum likelihood search on simulations we obtain unbiased results and find that sigma(r) = 0.020. These are the strongest constraints to date on primordial gravitational waves.	[Ade, P. A. R.; Sudiwala, R.

Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis.ResultsMolecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247(T) and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains.ConclusionGiven the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with >79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.

Accurate ab initio determination of ballistic electron emission spectroscopy: Application to Au/Ge	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							LATERAL RESOLUTION; ELASTIC-SCATTERING; MICROSCOPY; INTERFACE; TRANSPORT	Ab initio nonequilibrium Keldysh formalism based on an N-order renormalization technique is used to compute I (V) ballistic electron emission microscopy characteristics at the Au/Ge(001) interface. Such a formalism quantitatively reproduces precise experimental measurements under ultrahigh vacuum and low- temperature conditions. At T = 0 K, the ballistic current follows the law (V - V-SB)(2.1), V(SB )being the Schottky barrier. At T > 0 K, temperature effects become significant near the onset and must be taken into account to identify an accurate value for V-SB from a best-fit procedure. We find two values for V-SB, 0.67 and 0.75 eV, which we associate with two different atomic registries at the interface.

Modeling the Radio Background from the First Black Holes at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the 21 cm Absorption Amplitude	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark ages; reionization; first stars	X-RAY-SPECTRA; DARK-MATTER HALOES; STAR-FORMATION; 21-CM SIGNAL; INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM; FUNDAMENTAL PLANE; LYMAN CONTINUUM; DIRECT COLLAPSE; POWER SPECTRUM; MASS FUNCTION	We estimate the 21 cm radio background from accretion onto the first intermediate-mass black holes between z approximate to 30 and z approximate to 16. Combining potentially optimistic, but plausible, scenarios for black hole formation and growth with empirical correlations between luminosity and radio emission observed in low-redshift active galactic nuclei, we find that a model of black holes forming in molecular cooling halos is able to produce a 21 cm background that exceeds the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at z approximate to 17, though models involving larger halo masses are not entirely excluded. Such a background could explain the surprisingly large amplitude of the 21 cm absorption feature recently reported by the EDGES collaboration. Such black holes would also produce significant X-ray emission and contribute to the 0.5-2 keV soft X-ray background at the level of approximate to 10(-13)-10(-12) erg s(-1) cm(-2) deg(-2) , consistent with existing constraints. In order to avoid heating the intergalactic medium (IGM) over the EDGES trough, these black holes would need to be obscured by hydrogen column depths of N-H similar to 5 x 10(23) CM-2 . Such black holes would avoid violating constraints on the CMB optical depth from Planck if their UV photon escape fractions were below f(esc) less than or similar to 0.1, which would be a natural result of N-H similar to 5 x 10(23) CM-2 being imposed by an unheated IGM.

Super-Eddington Accretion in the WISE-selected Extremely Luminous Infrared Galaxy W2246-0526	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						infrared: galaxies; galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (WISEA J224607.56-052634.9); galaxies: nuclei; quasars: emission lines; quasars: supermassive black holes	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLE MASSES; SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMILAR-TO 2; EMISSION-LINE; HIGH-REDSHIFT; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; TYPE-1 QUASARS; MG II; ULTRAVIOLET	We use optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to observe rest-UV emission lines and estimate the black hole mass of WISEA J224607.56-052634.9 (W2246-0526) at z = 4.601, the most luminous hot, dust-obscured galaxy yet discovered by WISE. From the broad component of the Mg II 2799 A emission line, we measure a black hole mass of log(M-BH/M-circle dot)= 9.6 +/- 0.4. The broad C IV 1549 A line is asymmetric and significantly blueshifted. The derived M-BH from the blueshift-corrected broad C IV line width agrees with the Mg II result. From direct measurement using a well-sampled SED, the bolometric luminosity is 3.6 x 10(14) L-circle dot. The corresponding Eddington ratio for W2246-0526 is lambda(Edd) = L-AGN/L-Edd = 2.8. This high Eddington ratio may reach the level where the luminosity is saturating due to photon trapping in the accretion flow and may be insensitive to the mass accretion rate. In this case, the MBH growth rate in W2246-0526. would exceed the apparent accretion rate derived from the observed luminosity.

Constraining the period of the ringed secondary companion to the young star J1407 with photographic plates	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability; planets and satellites: rings; telescopes	TELESCOPE; ACCRETION; CATALOG; KELT	Context. The 16 Myr old star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent a series of complex eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the transit of a giant Hill sphere filling debris ring system around a secondary companion, J1407b. No other eclipses have since been detected, although other measurements have constrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding another eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the system, the geometry of the proposed ring system and enable planning of further observations to characterize the material within these putative rings. Aims. We carry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of J1407 with the aim of constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods. We present photometry from archival photographic plates from the Harvard DASCH survey, and Bamberg and Sonneberg Observatories, in order to place additional constraints on the orbital period of J1407b by searching for other dimming and eclipse events. Using a visual inspection of all 387 plates and a period-folding algorithm we performed a search for other eclipses in these data sets. Results. We find no other deep eclipses in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent time-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions. We rule out a large fraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 yr. These limits are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere filling ring system surrounding a brown dwarf companion in a bound elliptical orbit about J1407. Issues with the stability of any rings combined with the lack of detection of another eclipse, suggests that J1407b may not be bound to J1407.	[Mentel, R. T.; Kenworthy, M.

Such variability signals are typically small and require an accurate calibration algorithm, tailored to the survey, in order to be detected. This paper presents the methods developed to calibrate the raw photometry of the MASCARA and bRing stations and characterizes the performance of the methods and instruments. Methods. For the primary calibration, a modified version of the coarse decorrelation algorithm is used, which corrects for the extinction due to the earth's atmosphere, the camera transmission, and intrapixel variations. Residual trends are removed from the light curves of individual stars using empirical secondary calibration methods. In order to optimize these methods, as well as characterize the performance of the instruments, transit signals were injected in the data. Results. After optimal calibration an RMS scatter of 10 mmag at m(v) similar to 7.5 is achieved in the light curves. By injecting transit signals with periods between one and five days in the MASCARA data obtained by the La Palma station over the course of one year, we demonstrate that MASCARA La Palma is able to recover 84.0, 60.5 and 20.7% of signals with depths of 2, 1 and 0.5%, respectively, with a strong dependency on the observed declination, recovering 65.4% of all transit signals at delta > 0 degrees versus 35.8% at delta < 0 degrees. Using the full three years of data obtained by MASCARA La Palma to date, similar recovery rates are extended to periods up to ten days. We derive a preliminary occurrence rate for hot Jupiters around A-stars of >0.4%, knowing that many hot Jupiters are still overlooked. In the era of TESS, MASCARA and bRing will provide an interesting synergy for finding long-period (>13.5 days) transiting gas-giant planets around the brightest stars.	[Talens, G. J. J.; Deul, E.

A Palomar/TripleSpec near-infrared spectrum of W1925 confirms a photometric L7 spectral type previously estimated by Scholz & Bell, and its infrared colors and absolute magnitudes are consistent with a single object of this type. We constructed a spectral energy distribution using the Gaia parallax, literature photometry, and near-infrared spectrum and find a luminosity log(L-bol/L-circle dot) = - 4.443 +/- 0.008. Applying evolutionary models, we infer that W1925 is likely a 53 +/- 18M(Jup) brown dwarf with T-eff = 1404 +/- 71 K and log g = 5.1 +/- 0.4 dex (cgs). While W1925 was detected in both the 2MASS and WISE infrared sky surveys, it was not detected in photographic plate sky surveys. Its combination of extreme optical-infrared colors, high proper motion, and location near the crowded Galactic plane (b = - 4 degrees.2) likely contributed to its having evaded detection in pre-Gaia surveys.

DM Tau's disk is thought to possess a dust-free inner cavity inside a few au, from the absence of near-infrared excess on its spectral energy distribution (SED). Previous submillimeter observations were, however, unable to detect the cavity; instead, a dust ring similar to 20 au in radius was seen. The excellent angular resolution achieved in the new ALMA observations, 43 x 31 mas, allows discovery of a 4 au radius inner dust ring, confirming previous SED modeling results. This inner ring is symmetric in continuum emission, but asymmetric in( 12)CO emission. The known (outer) dust ring at similar to 20 au is recovered and shows azimuthal asymmetry with a strong-weak side contrast of similar to 1.3. The gap between these two rings is depleted by a factor of similar to 40 in dust emission relative to the outer ring. An extended outer dust disk is revealed, separated from the outer ring by another gap. The location of the inner ring is comparable to that of the main asteroid belt in the solar system. As a disk with a "proto-asteroid belt," the DM Tau system offers valuable clues to disk evolution and planet formation in the terrestrial-planet-forming region.

The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on global photosynthesis using satellite remote sensing	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						ENSO; gross primary productivity; solar-induced fluorescence	TERRESTRIAL CARBON-CYCLE; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; USE EFFICIENCY MODELS; LAND CO2 SINK; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TROPICAL TEMPERATURE; SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; FOREST; PRODUCTIVITY; FLUORESCENCE	The El Nino-Southern Oscillation exerts a large influence on global climate regimes and on the global carbon cycle. Although El Nino is known to be associated with a reduction of the global total land carbon sink, results based on prognostic models or measurements disagree over the relative contribution of photosynthesis to the reduced sink. Here, we provide an independent remote sensing-based analysis on the impact of the 2015-2016 El Nino on global photosynthesis using six global satellite-based photosynthesis products and a global solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) dataset. An ensemble of satellite-based photosynthesis products showed a negative anomaly of -0.7 +/- 1.2 PgC in 2015, but a slight positive anomaly of 0.05 +/- 0.89 PgC in 2016, which when combined with observations of the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that the reduction of the land residual sink was likely dominated by photosynthesis in 2015 but by respiration in 2016. The six satellite-based products unanimously identified a major photosynthesis reduction of -1.1 +/- 0.52 PgC from savannahs in 2015 and 2016, followed by a highly uncertain reduction of -0.22 +/- 0.98 PgC from rainforests. Vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere enhanced photosynthesis before and after the peak El Nino, especially in grasslands (0.33 +/- 0.13 PgC). The patterns of satellite-based photosynthesis ensemble mean were corroborated by SIF, except in rainforests and South America, where the anomalies of satellite-based photosynthesis products also diverged the most. We found the inter-model variation of photosynthesis estimates was strongly related to the discrepancy between moisture forcings for models. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple photosynthesis proxies when assessing responses to climatic anomalies. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Nino on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'.

Southern California megacity CO2, CH4, and CO flux estimates using ground- and space-based remote sensing and a Lagrangian model	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							LOS-ANGELES MEGACITY; TOP-DOWN ESTIMATE; METHANE EMISSIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; UNITED-STATES; SURFACE FLUX; CLARS-FTS; BASIN; INVENTORY; GOSAT	We estimate the overall CO2, CH4, and CO flux from the South Coast Air Basin using an inversion that couples Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations, with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC). Using TCCON data we estimate the direct net CO2 flux from the SoCAB to be 104 +/- 26 TgCO(2) yr(-1) for the study period of July 2013-August 2016. We obtain a slightly higher estimate of 120 +/- 30 TgCO(2) yr(-1) using OCO-2 data. These CO2 emission estimates are on the low end of previous work. Our net CH4 (360 +/- 90 GgCH(4) yr(-1)) flux estimate is in agreement with central values from previous top-down studies going back to 2010 (342-440 GgCH(4) yr(-1)). CO emissions are estimated at 487 +/- 122 GgCOyr(-1), much lower than previous top-down estimates (1440 GgCOyr(-1)). Given the decreasing emissions of CO, this finding is not unexpected. We perform sensitivity tests to estimate how much errors in the prior, errors in the covariance, different inversion schemes, or a coarser dynamical model influence the emission estimates. Overall, the uncertainty is estimated to be 25 %, with the largest contribution from the dynamical model. Lessons learned here may help in future inversions of satellite data over urban areas.

The Bagnold dunes were investigated by Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover during its second winter in Gale crater on Mars. The effect of Bagnold dune slopes on the local microclimate air temperature, potential temperature, near-surface lapse rate, and how they change the variability of short-lived air temperature fluctuations is described. The oscillations with periods under 24 min are characterized using Fourier analysis. Comparing the sols during the Bagnold dunes exploration to a typical southern winter sol, we characterize the changes in temperature oscillations near the east facing High dune, the west facing Namib dune, as well as in the area between the dunes. Each of the regions had distinct signatures, with the west and east orientation of the dunes affecting the data. Plain Language Summary This manuscript describes the first in situ measurement of the observed effect of terrain slopes on the near-surface air temperatures of another planet: (a) Air temperatures fluctuated due to convective activity and downslope topographic flows. (b) Both phenomena caused oscillations with different frequencies. (c) The proximity to dunes slopes changed the times of transition from stable to convective atmosphere depending on the orientation of the slopes. The proximity to a steep west face of Namib dune induced rapid oscillations during the evening downslope flow.

Tony			A Recent Shift Toward an El Nino-Like Ocean State in the Tropic Pacific and the Resumption of Ocean Warming	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCE; SURFACE; TEMPERATURE; CIRCULATION; TRENDS	Since approximately 2011, the tropical Pacific has been sharply shifting toward an opposite phase to that observed in the previous decade. This shift has coincided with a recent resumption of global warming after a hiatus in the 2000s. Based on a model-data analysis using an ensemble empirical mode decomposition, we identified a distinct low-frequency mode of the sea level in the tropical Pacific and showed its connection to global ocean warming and the suppression of global warming during the early 2000s, as well as the resumption of warming during recent years. Hindcast and model experiments conducted to illustrate the physical mechanism linking the decadal mode to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation-related trade winds, which regulate the strength of the Equatorial Undercurrent and the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean, revealed an El Nino-like state for the last several years. Plain Language Summary In contrast to previous decade, since roughly 2011, sea level in the western tropical Pacific has declined, while sea level in the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific has increased. This study focuses on a decadal shift in the tropical Pacific Ocean toward a low-frequency El Nino-like state, which coincides with a recent resumption of global warming after a hiatus in the 2000s. Here we identify whether the recent shift is a short-term change associated with ENSO or longer-term change and examine how the decadal shift in the Pacific is linked to the recent acceleration of global ocean warming. The model-data analysis allows us to gain insight into the evolution of sea level and ocean circulation in the Pacific Ocean on decadal time scale, as well as the accuracy and reliability of observed decadal fluctuation. The decadal mode presented here could lead to a better understanding of how sea level and ocean circulation respond to the Pacific climate variability.

We numerically simulate this coupled system for two application cases: active seismic experiments (ASEs) and passive seismic experiments. A recent ASE (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2018GL077481) observed the infrasonic signals produced by a seismic hammer. To measure the sensitivity of observations to seismic parameters, we attempt to reproduce the results from this experiment at short range by considering a realistic unconsolidated subsurface and an idealized rock-solid subsurface. At long range, we investigate the influence of the source by using two focal mechanisms. We found surface waves generate an infrasonic plane head wave in the ASE case of the rock-solid material. For the passive seismic experiments, the amplitude of atmospheric infrasound generated by seismic surface waves is investigated in detail. Despite some limitations, the simulations suggest that balloon measurement of seismically induced infrasound might help to constrain ground properties. Plain Language Summary During an earthquake, the ground shakes the air above. We performed simulations of some seismic events and of the propagation of their consequences in the atmosphere. We found that observing the displacement of the air close to a seismic event can give information about the properties of the soil. This perspective is particularly interesting for planetary investigation. For example, it is impossible to study Venus' interior with ground instruments because of the harsh conditions at its surface. Our work is one of the steps toward proving that the study of Venus' (or any other solid planet) internal structure may be possible with airborne instruments.

The Great Slave Lake PyroCb of 5 August 2014: Observations, Simulations, Comparisons With Regular Convection, and Impact on UTLS Water Vapor	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							BIOMASS SMOKE INJECTION; LOWER STRATOSPHERE; PART II; CLOUDS; FIRE; MODEL; MICROPHYSICS; PYROCUMULUS; TRANSPORT; MOISTURE	This study analyzes a pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) that formed near Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada on 5 August 2014 using multiple satellite-and ground-based data sets, meteorological reanalysis, and a cloud-resolving model. Passive and active polar-orbiting instruments and geostationary imagery detail the intense updraft column during the several hours-long convective stage and capture the entire pyroCb life cycle. CloudSat radar reflectivity profiles and local soundings show the pyroCb cloud base was >= 1 km above the lifting condensation level. Comparisons with profiles through meteorological convection in the same region reaffirm previous evidence for delayed droplet growth within pyroconvective updrafts. The pyroCb penetrated the tropopause, reaching at least 14 km (theta similar or equal to 380 K), and the detrained cirrus/smoke plume was tracked over the following 2 weeks using lagrangian trajectories, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and Microwave Limb Sounder. Microwave Limb Sounder ice water content and water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) observations in the aging plume show ice sublimation occurred in the stratosphere, producing individual WVMR anomalies up to + 5 ppmv and plume-averaged anomalies up to + 2 ppmv. Reanalysis indicates the pyroCb formed in favorable convective conditions, but we show the fire itself triggered convection because meteorological triggers were not colocated during initiation. Cloud-resolving model simulations confirm this result when controlled for surface fluxes, initial thermodynamics, and aerosol loading. Sensitivity tests show surface heat flux is dominant in determining overall pyroCb intensity, but aerosols and moisture inflow can effect small changes in updraft velocity, anvil ice concentration, and detrained WVMR.

What drives 20th century polar motion?	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Earth rotation; polar motion; glacial isostatic adjustment; surface mass transport; mantle convection	ICE-AGE EARTH; SEA-LEVEL; PLEISTOCENE DEGLACIATION; MANTLE VISCOSITY; MASS CHANGE; ROTATION; WANDER; MODEL; SUBDUCTION; CONSISTENT	Astrometric and geodetic measurements show that the mean position of Earth's spin axis drifted through the solid crust toward Labrador, Canada at an average speed of 10.5 +/- 0.9 cm/yr during the 20th century. Understanding the origins of this secular polar motion (SPM) has significance for modeling the global climate, as it provides a link to ice mass balance and sea-level rise. A perplexing issue, however, is that while glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models satisfactorily explain the direction of SPM, the associated prediction of the amplitude is insufficient. Our Bayesian GIA analysis, with constraints from relative sea-level and vertical land motion data, reveals that this process only accounts for 33 +/- 18% of the observed SPM amplitude. This shortfall motivates a more broadly scoped reassessment of SPM drivers. To address this, we assemble a complete reconstruction of Earth's surface mass transport derived from recent advancements in modeling the global 20th century cryospheric, hydrologic, oceanic, and seismogenic mass exchange. The summed signals, nonetheless, cannot fully reconcile the observed SPM, even when considering the error statistics of each driver. We investigate an additional excitation source: changes in Earth's inertia tensor caused by mantle convection. Sophisticated models have recently been advanced in tectonic plate reconstructions, in conjunction with geoid and seismic tomographic models. Here we use these models to compute new estimates of SPM. While the convection-driven SPM has considerable uncertainty, the average direction of 283 recent models aligns with the residual SPM (within 2.7 +/- 14.8 degrees), significantly reducing the gap between observation and prediction. We assert that one key mechanism for driving 20th century SPM is long-term mass movement due to mantle convection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Loss of the Martian atmosphere to space: Present-day loss rates determined from MAVEN observations and integrated loss through time	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Atmosphere; Solar wind; Mars atmosphere; Mars climate; Magnetospheres	MARS UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; CHAOTIC OBLIQUITY; OXYGEN ESCAPE; PICKUP IONS; HOT OXYGEN; HYDROGEN; WATER; EVOLUTION; VARIABILITY; ELECTRODYNAMICS	Observations of the Mars upper atmosphere made from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft have been used to determine the loss rates of gas from the upper atmosphere to space for a complete Mars year (16 Nov 2014 - 3 Oct 2016). Loss rates for H and O are sufficient to remove similar to 2-3 kg/s to space. By itself, this loss would be significant over the history of the planet. In addition, loss rates would have been greater early in history due to the enhanced solar EUV and more-active Sun. Integrated loss, based on current processes whose escape rates in the past are adjusted according to expected solar evolution, would have been as much as 0.8 bar CO2 or 23 m global equivalent layer of H2O; these losses are likely to be lower limits due to the nature of the extrapolation of loss rates to the earliest times. Combined with the lack of surface or subsurface reservoirs for CO2 that could hold remnants of an early, thick atmosphere, these results suggest that loss of gas to space has been the dominant process responsible for changing the climate of Mars from an early, warmer environment to the cold, dry one that we see today.

Martian magmatism from plume metasomatized mantle	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MIDOCEAN RIDGE BASALT; MAUNA-KEA VOLCANO; HAWAIIAN HOT-SPOT; ISOTOPIC SYSTEMATICS; DIFFERENTIATION HISTORY; REJUVENATED VOLCANISM; DEPLETED MANTLE; RB-SR; SM-ND; MARS	Direct analysis of the composition of Mars is possible through delivery of meteorites to Earth. Martian meteorites include similar to 165 to 2400 Ma shergottites, originating from depleted to enriched mantle sources, and similar to 1340 Ma nakhlites and chassignites, formed by low degree partial melting of a depleted mantle source. To date, no unified model has been proposed to explain the petrogenesis of these distinct rock types, despite their importance for understanding the formation and evolution of Mars. Here we report a coherent geochemical dataset for shergottites, nakhlites and chassignites revealing fundamental differences in sources. Shergottites have lower Nb/Y at a given Zr/Y than nakhlites or chassignites, a relationship nearly identical to terrestrial Hawaiian main shield and rejuvenated volcanism. Nakhlite and chassignite compositions are consistent with melting of hydrated and meta-somatized depleted mantle lithosphere, whereas shergottite melts originate from deep mantle sources. Generation of martian magmas can be explained by temporally distinct melting episodes within and below dynamically supported and variably metasomatized lithosphere, by long-lived, static mantle plumes.

Natural satellite systems present a large variety of orbital configurations in the solar system. While some are clearly the result of known processes, others still have largely unexplained eccentricity and inclination values. Iapetus, the furthest of Saturn's main satellites, has a still unexplained 3% orbital eccentricity and its orbital plane is tilted with respect to its local Laplace plane (8 degrees of free inclination). On the other hand, astrometric measurements of saturnian moons have revealed high tidal migration rates, corresponding to a quality factor Q of Saturn of around 1600 for the mid-sized icy moons. Aims. We show how a past crossing of the 5:1 mean motion resonance between Titan and Iapetus may be a plausible scenario to explain Iapetus' orbit. Methods. We have carried out numerical simulations of the resonance crossing using an N-body code as well as using averaged equations of motion. A large span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started on its local Laplace plane (15 degrees with respect to the equatorial plane) with a circular orbit. Results. The resonance crossing can trigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus. The outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate (or equivalently on Q) . For a quality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the resonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality factor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with post-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations capable of reaching 11 degrees. Usually high inclinations come with high eccentricities but some simulations (less than 1%) show elements compatible with Iapetus' current orbit Conclusions. In the context of high tidal energy dissipation in Saturn, a quality factor between 100 and 2000 at the frequency of Titan would bring Titan and Iapetus into a 5:1 resonance, which would perturb Iapetus' eccentricity and inclination to values observed today. Such rapid tidal migration would have avoided Iapetus' ejection around 40-800 million years ago.

Morphological mapping of Ganymede: Investigating the role of strike-slip tectonics in the evolution of terrain types	ICARUS			English	Article						Ganymede; Tectonics; Satellites; surfaces	ICY GALILEAN SATELLITES; GROOVED TERRAIN; DARK TERRAIN; EXTENSIONAL INSTABILITY; TENDENCY ANALYSIS; CARBONERAS FAULT; CRATERING RATES; IMPACT FEATURES; WATER-ICE; EUROPA	The heavily fractured surface of Ganymede displays many morphologically distinctive regions of inferred distributed shear and strike-slip faulting that may be important to the structural development of its surface. To better understand the role of strike-slip tectonism in shaping this complex icy surface, we perform detailed mapping at nine sites using Galileo and Voyager imagery, noting key examples of strike-slip morphologies where present. These four morphological indicators are: en echelon structures, strike-slip duplexes, laterally offset preexisting features, and possible strained craters. We map sites of both light, grooved terrain (Nun Sulci, Dardanus Sulcus, Tiamat Sulcus, Uruk Sulcus, and Arbela Sulcus), and terrains that are transitional from dark to light terrains (Nippur and Philus Sulci, Byblus Sulcus, Anshar Sulcus, and the Transitional Terrain of Northern Marius Regio). At least one, if not more, of the four strike-slip morphological indicators are observed at every site, suggesting strike-slip tectonism is indeed important to Ganymede's evolutionary history. Byblus Sulcus is the only mapped site where the presence of strike-slip indicators is limited to only a few en echelon structures; every other mapped site displays examples of at least two types, with Arbela Sulcus containing candidate examples of all four. In addition, quantification of morphological characteristics suggests related rotation between sites, as evidenced by the predominant NW/SE trend of mapped features within the light terrain present in five different sites (Nun, Tiamat, Uruk, Nippur/Philus, Byblus, and Anshar Sulcus). Moreover, incorporation of strike-slip tectonism with pre-existing observations of extensional behavior provides an improved, synoptic representation of Ganymede's tectonic history.

Laser-induced fluorescence measurements of acceleration zone scaling in the 12.5 kW HERMeS Hall thruster	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ION-TRANSPORT; PLASMA; VELOCITY; DISCHARGE	We present laser-induced fluorescence measurements of acceleration zone scaling with discharge voltage (V-d), magnetic field strength (B), and facility background pressure (P-BG) in NASA's 12.5kW Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding. At fixed discharge current, the plasma potential profiles at discharge voltages from 300 to 600 V approximately overlapped in the region with plasma potential less than 300 V; ion acceleration began further upstream at higher V-d because the region with a steep potential gradient was broader. The radial divergence of mean ion velocity vectors in the outer half of the channel and near plume increased with decreasing V-d. At fixed V-d, the acceleration zone was located further upstream at higher B and at higher P-BG. Bimodal ion velocity distribution functions (IVDFs) were measured along the channel centerline in the acceleration zone at high discharge voltages; this effect was attributed to time-averaging over movement of the acceleration zone during large-amplitude discharge current oscillations. At lower discharge voltages, the broadening of the IVDFs in the near plume could not be fully explained by ionization within the acceleration region. These results have implications for understanding front pole erosion, which can be an important wear mechanism over the long lifetimes of magnetically shielded thrusters, and they provide baseline data for validating first principles models of cross-field electron transport.

ST7 Team; LISA Pathfinder Collaboration	Experimental results from the ST7 mission on LISA Pathfinder	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								The Space Technology 7 Disturbance Reduction System (ST7-DRS) is a NASA technology demonstration payload that operated from January 2016 through July 2017 on the European Space Agency's (ESA) LISA Pathfinder spacecraft. The joint goal of the NASA and ESA missions was to validate key technologies for a future space-based gravitational wave observatory targeting the source-rich millihertz band. The two primary components of ST7-DRS are a micropropulsion system based on colloidal micro-Newton thrusters (CMNTs) and a control system that simultaneously controls the attitude and position of the spacecraft and the two free-flying test masses (TMs). This paper presents our main experimental results and summarizes the overall performance of the CMNTs and control laws. We find the CMNT performance to be consistent with preflight predictions, with a measured system thrust noise on the order of 100 nN/ root Hz in the 1 mHz <= f <= 30 mHz band. The control system maintained the TM-spacecraft separation with an RMS error of less than 2 nm and a noise spectral density of less than 3 nm/ root Hz in the same band. Thruster calibration measurements yield thrust values consistent with the performance model and ground-based thrust-stand measurements, to within a few percent. We also report a differential acceleration noise between the two test masses with a spectral density of roughly 3 fm/s(2)/ root Hz in the 1 mHz <= f <= 30 mHz band, slightly less than twice as large as the best performance reported with the baseline LISA Pathfinder configuration and below the current requirements for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission.

Wave-optical treatment of the shadow cast by a large gravitating sphere	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PLANE ELECTROMAGNETIC-WAVE; DIFFRACTION; SCATTERING; MOMENTS	We study the shadow cast by a large gravitating sphere, similar to our Sun. For this, we consider the gravitational field produced by a static mass monopole within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We study the propagation of a monochromatic electromagnetic wave in the vicinity of a large, opaque, gravitating sphere. To treat the opaque nature of the body and its physical size, we implement fully absorbing boundary conditions and develop a wave-optical treatment of the shadow formed by this object. Based on this approach, we demonstrate that the structure of the shadow is determined by the Schwarzschild radius of the body and its physical size. The shadow's boundary has the shape of a concave rotational hyperboloid bent inward due to the refractive properties of the curved spacetime. We show that there is no light in the shadow. However, even in the presence of gravity and related gravitational bending of photon trajectories there is the bright spot of Arago that is formed behind a perfectly spherical obscuration.

Culture-based analyses, targeted gene-based amplicon sequencing (bacteriome, mycobiome, and resistome), and shotgun metagenomics approaches have previously been performed on ISS environmental sample sets using whole genome amplification (WGA). However, this is the first study reporting on the metagenomes sampled from ISS environmental surfaces without the use of WGA. Metagenome sequences generated from eight defined ISS environmental locations in three consecutive flights were analyzed to assess the succession and persistence of microbial communities, their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, and virulence properties. Metagenomic sequences were produced from the samples treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to measure intact microorganisms.ResultsThe intact microbial communities detected in Flight 1 and Flight 2 samples were significantly more similar to each other than to Flight 3 samples. Among 318 microbial species detected, 46 species constituting 18 genera were common in all flight samples. Risk group or biosafety level 2 microorganisms that persisted among all three flights were Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia frederiksenii, and Aspergillus lentulus. Even though Rhodotorula and Pantoea dominated the ISS microbiome, Pantoea exhibited succession and persistence. K. pneumoniae persisted in one location (US Node 1) of all three flights and might have spread to six out of the eight locations sampled on Flight 3. The AMR signatures associated with -lactam, cationic antimicrobial peptide, and vancomycin were detected. Prominent virulence factors were cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance and multidrug-resistance efflux pumps.ConclusionsThere was an increase in AMR and virulence gene factors detected over the period sampled, and metagenome sequences of human pathogens persisted over time. Comparative analysis of the microbial compositions of ISS with Earth analogs revealed that the ISS environmental surfaces were different in microbial composition. Metagenomics coupled with PMA treatment would help future space missions to estimate problematic risk group microbial pathogens. Cataloging AMR/virulence characteristics, succession, accumulation, and persistence of microorganisms would facilitate the development of suitable countermeasures to reduce their presence in the closed built environment.

Estimating snow depth over Arctic sea ice from calibrated dual-frequency radar freeboards	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							OPERATION ICEBRIDGE; AIRBORNE LASER; ALTIMETER MEASUREMENTS; THICKNESS RETRIEVAL; ENVISAT RADAR; FRAM STRAIT; CRYOSAT-2; WINTER; COVER; VARIABILITY	Snow depth on sea ice remains one of the largest uncertainties in sea ice thickness retrievals from satellite altimetry. Here we outline an approach for deriving snow depth that can be applied to any coincident freeboard measurements after calibration with independent observations of snow and ice freeboard. Freeboard estimates from CryoSat-2 (Ku band) and AltiKa (Ka band) are calibrated against data from NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) to align AltiKa with the snow surface and CryoSat-2 with the ice-snow interface. Snow depth is found as the difference between the two calibrated freeboards, with a correction added for the slower speed of light propagation through snow. We perform an initial evaluation of our derived snow depth product against OIB snow depth data by excluding successive years of OIB data from the analysis. We find a root-mean-square deviation of 7.7, 5.3, 5.9, and 6.7 cm between our snow thickness product and OIB data from the springs of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively. We further demonstrate the applicability of the method to ICESat and Envisat, offering promising potential for the application to CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2, which launched in September 2018.

Planck Collaboration	Planck intermediate results LIV. The Planck multi-frequency catalogue of non-thermal sources	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						catalogs; cosmology: observations; radio continuum: general; submillimeter: general	COEVAL OBSERVATIONS PROJECT; EXTRAGALACTIC POINT SOURCES; LARGE-SAMPLE; RADIO; POLARIZATION; VARIABILITY; SPECTRUM; FILTERS; RAY	This paper presents the Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal (i.e. synchrotron-dominated) Sources (PCNT) observed between 30 and 857 GHz by the ESA Planck mission. This catalogue was constructed by selecting objects detected in the full mission all-sky temperature maps at 30 and 143 GHz, with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 3 in at least one of the two channels after filtering with a particular Mexican hat wavelet. As a result, 29 400 source candidates were selected. Then, a multi-frequency analysis was performed using the Matrix Filters methodology at the position of these objects, and flux densities and errors were calculated for all of them in the nine Planck channels. This catalogue was built using a different methodology than the one adopted for the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS) and the Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS2), although the initial detection was done with the same pipeline that was used to produce them. The present catalogue is the first unbiased, full-sky catalogue of synchrotron-dominated sources published at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths and constitutes a powerful database for statistical studies of non-thermal extragalactic sources, whose emission is dominated by the central active galactic nucleus. Together with the full multi-frequency catalogue, we also define the Bright Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal Sources (PCNTb), where only those objects with a S/N > 4 at both 30 and 143 GHz were selected. In this catalogue 1146 compact sources are detected outside the adopted Planck GAL070 mask; thus, these sources constitute a highly reliable sample of extragalactic radio sources. We also flag the high-significance subsample (PCNThs), a subset of 151 sources that are detected with S/N > 4 in all nine Planck channels, 75 of which are found outside the Planck mask adopted here. The remaining 76 sources inside the Galactic mask are very likely Galactic objects.

Validation of the TOLNet lidars: the Southern California Ozone Observation Project (SCOOP)	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL-ABSORPTION LIDAR; PROPOSED STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS; CROSS-SECTIONS; TEMPERATURE ALGORITHMS; VERTICAL RESOLUTION; UV SPECTROSCOPY; UNCERTAINTY; PROFILES; SYSTEM; NETWORK	The North America-based Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) was recently established to provide high spatiotemporal vertical profiles of ozone, to better understand physical processes driving tropospheric ozone variability and to validate the tropospheric ozone measurements of upcoming spaceborne missions such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution (TEMPO). The network currently comprises six tropospheric ozone lidars, four of which are mobile instruments deploying to the field a few times per year, based on campaign and science needs. In August 2016, all four mobile TOLNet lidars were brought to the fixed TOLNet site of JPL Table Mountain Facility for the 1-week-long Southern California Ozone Observation Project (SCOOP). This intercomparison campaign, which included 400 h of lidar measurements and 18 ozonesonde launches, allowed for the unprecedented simultaneous validation of five of the six TOLNet lidars. For measurements between 3 and 10 km a.s.1., a mean difference of 0.7 ppbv (1.7 %), with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.6 ppbv or 2.4 %, was found between the lidars and ozonesondes, which is well within the combined uncertainties of the two measurement techniques. The few minor differences identified were typically associated with the known limitations of the lidars at the profile altitude extremes (i.e., first 1 km above ground and at the instruments' highest retrievable altitude). As part of a large homogenization and quality control effort within the network, many aspects of the TOLNet in-house data processing algorithms were also standardized and validated. This thorough validation of both the measurements and retrievals builds confidence as to the high quality and reliability of the TOLNet ozone lidar profiles for many years to come, making TOLNet a valuable ground-based reference network for tropospheric ozone profiling.

Exploration of Antarctic Ice Sheet 100-year contribution to sea level rise and associated model uncertainties using the ISSM framework	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							GROUNDING LINE RETREAT; SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; PINE ISLAND GLACIER; WEST ANTARCTICA; NORTHEAST GREENLAND; BASAL CONDITIONS; BED TOPOGRAPHY; SHELF; FLOW; SENSITIVITY	Estimating the future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is critical for improving future sea level rise (SLR) projections. Numerical ice sheet models are invaluable tools for bounding Antarctic vulnerability; yet, few continental-scale projections of century-scale AIS SLR contribution exist, and those that do vary by up to an order of magnitude. This is partly because model projections of future sea level are inherently uncertain and depend largely on the model's boundary conditions and climate forcing, which themselves are unknown due to the uncertainty in the projections of future anthropogenic emissions and subsequent climate response. Here, we aim to improve the understanding of how uncertainties in model forcing and boundary conditions affect ice sheet model simulations. With use of sampling techniques embedded within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) framework, we assess how uncertainties in snow accumulation, ocean-induced melting, ice viscosity, basal friction, bedrock elevation, and the presence of ice shelves impact continental-scale 100-year model simulations of AIS future sea level contribution. Overall, we find that AIS sea level contribution is strongly affected by grounding line retreat, which is driven by the magnitude of ice shelf basal melt rates and by variations in bedrock topography. In addition, we find that over 1.2 m of AIS global mean sea level contribution over the next century is achievable, but not likely, as it is tenable only in response to unrealistically large melt rates and continental ice shelf collapse. Regionally, we find that under our most extreme 100-year warming experiment generalized for the entire ice sheet, the Amundsen Sea sector is the most significant source of model uncertainty (1032 mm 6 sigma spread) and the region with the largest potential for future sea level contribution (297 mm) In contrast, under a more plausible forcing informed regionally by literature and model sensitivity studies, the Ronne basin has a greater potential for local increases in ice shelf basal melt rates. As a result, under this more likely realization, where warm waters reach the continental shelf under the Ronne ice shelf, it is the Ronne basin, particularly the Evans and Rutford ice streams, that are the greatest contributors to potential SLR (161 mm) and to simulation uncertainty (420 mm 6 sigma spread).

Thanks to the very long duration of the event, with a time scale t(E) similar to 130 days, the microlens parallax is measured precisely despite its low value of pi(E) similar to 0.06. Analysis of the well-resolved caustic crossings during the source star's entrance and exit of the caustic yields an angular Einstein radius of theta(E) similar to 0.6 mas. The measured pi(E) and theta(E) indicate that the lens is a binary composed of two stars with masses similar to 1.0 M-circle dot and similar to 0.15 M-circle dot, and is located at a distance of similar to 6 kpc. From the color and brightness of the lens estimated from its determined mass and distance, it is expected that similar to 2/3 of the I-band blended flux comes from the lens. Therefore, the event is a rare case of a bright lens event for which high-resolution follow-up observations can confirm its nature.

Kent			Efficient Spectroscopy of Exoplanets at Small Angular Separations with Vortex Fiber Nulling	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: high angular resolution; techniques: spectroscopic	PHOTOCHEMISTRY; SPIN	Instrumentation designed to characterize potentially habitable planets may combine adaptive optics and high-resolution spectroscopy techniques to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to spectral signs of life. Detecting the weak signal from a planet containing biomarkers will require exquisite control of the optical wavefront to maximize the planet signal and significantly reduce unwanted starlight. We present an optical technique, known as vortex fiber nulling (VFN), that allows polychromatic light from faint planets at extremely small separations from their host stars (less than or similar to lambda/D) to be efficiently routed to a diffraction-limited spectrograph via a single-mode optical fiber, while light from the star is prevented from entering the spectrograph. VFN takes advantage of the spatial selectivity of a single-mode fiber to isolate the light from close-in companions in a small field of view around the star. We provide theoretical performance predictions of a conceptual design and show that VFN may be utilized to characterize planets detected by radial velocity (RV) instruments in the infrared without knowledge of the azimuthal orientation of their orbits. Using a spectral template-matching technique, we calculate an integration time of similar to 400, similar to 100, and similar to 30 hr for Ross 128 b with Keck, the Thirty Meter Telescope, and the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Infrared Surveyor, respectively.

The NuSTAR Extragalactic Surveys: Unveiling Rare, Buried AGNs and Detecting the Contributors to the Peak of the Cosmic X-Ray Background	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: Seyfert	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; POINT-SOURCE CATALOG; NUMBER COUNTS; DEEP SURVEY; SWIFT-BAT; CHANDRA; FIELD; EVOLUTION; GALAXIES; POPULATION	We report on the results of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detection by NuSTAR performed in three extragalactic survey fields (COSMic Evolutionary Survey field (COSMOS), Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), and Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS)) in three hard bands, namely H1 (8-16 keV), H2 (16-24 keV), and VH (35-55 keV). The aggregated area of the surveys is similar to 2.7 deg(2). While a large number of sources is detected in the H1 band (72 at the 97% level of reliability), the H2 band directly probing close to the peak of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) returns four significant detections, and two tentative (although not significant) detections are found in the VH-band. All of the sources detected above 16 keV are also detected at lower energies. We compute the integral number counts for sources in such bands, which show broad consistency with population-synthesis models of the CXB. We furthermore identify two Compton-thick AGNs, one in the COSMOS field, associated with a hard and faint Chandra source, and one in the UDS field, never detected in the X-ray band before. Both sources are at the same redshift z similar to 1.25, which shifts their Compton-hump into the H1 band, and were previously missed in the usually employed NuSTAR bands, confirming the potential for using the H1 band to discover obscured AGNs at z > 1 in deep surveys.

A Long Hard-X-Ray Look at the Dual Active Galactic Nuclei of M51 with NuSTAR	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (M51); galaxies: nuclei; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: galaxies	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; COMPTON-THICK AGN; NGC 7793 P13; NEARBY GALAXIES; NEUTRON-STAR; BOLOMETRIC LUMINOSITIES; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SPECTRAL MODEL	We present a broadband X-ray spectral analysis of the M51 system, including the dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and several off-nuclear point sources. Using a deep observation by NuSTAR, new high-resolution coverage of M51b by Chandra, and the latest X-ray torus models, we measure the intrinsic X-ray luminosities of the AGNs in these galaxies. The AGN of M51a is found to be Compton-thick, and both AGNs have very low accretion rates (lambda(Edd) < 10(-4)). The latter is surprising considering that the galaxies of M51 are in the process of merging, which is generally predicted to enhance nuclear activity. We find that the covering factor of the obscuring material in M51a is 0.26 +/- 0.03, consistent with the local AGN obscured fraction at L-X similar to 10(40) erg s(-1). The substantial obscuring column does not support theories that the torus, presumed responsible for the obscuration, disappears at these low accretion luminosities. However, the obscuration may have resulted from the gas infall driven by the merger rather than the accretion process. We report on several extranuclear sources with L-X > 10(39) erg s(-1) and find that a spectral turnover is present below 10 keV in most such sources, in line with recent results on ultraluminous X-ray sources.

(16) Psyche: A mesosiderite-like asteroid?	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: general; minor planets, asteroids: individual: (16) Psyche; methods: observational; techniques: high angular resolution	MAIN-BELT ASTEROIDS; ADAPTIVE-OPTICS; LIGHTCURVE OBSERVATIONS; PHOTOMETRIC GEODESY; IMAGES; MASS; DENSITY; MODELS; SPECTROSCOPY; INVERSION	Context. Asteroid (16) Psyche is the target of the NASA Psyche mission. It is considered one of the few main-belt bodies that could be an exposed proto-planetary metallic core and that would thus be related to iron meteorites. Such an association is however challenged by both its near- and mid-infrared spectral properties and the reported estimates of its density. Aims. Here, we aim to refine the density of (16) Psyche to set further constraints on its bulk composition and determine its potential meteoritic analog. Methods. We observed (16) Psyche with ESO VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our large program (ID 199.C-0074). We used the high angular resolution of these observations to refine Psyche's three-dimensional (3D) shape model and subsequently its density when combined with the most recent mass estimates. In addition, we searched for potential companions around the asteroid. Results. We derived a bulk density of 3.99 +/- 0.26 g cm(-3) for Psyche. While such density is incompatible at the 3-sigma level with any iron meteorites (similar to 7.8 g cm(-3)), it appears fully consistent with that of stony-iron meteorites such as mesosiderites (density similar to 4.25 g cm(-3)). In addition, we found no satellite in our images and set an upper limit on the diameter of any non-detected satellite of 1460 +/- 200 m at 150 km from Psyche (0.2% x R-Hill, the Hill radius) and 800 +/- 200 m at 2000 km (3% x R-Hill). Conclusions. Considering that the visible and near-infrared spectral properties of mesosiderites are similar to those of Psyche, there is merit to a long-published initial hypothesis that Psyche could be a plausible candidate parent body for mesosiderites.

Reassessing evidence of life in 3,700-million-year-old rocks of Greenland	NATURE			English	Article							STROMATOLITE REEF; PILBARA CRATON; CARBON; EARTH; GEOCHEMISTRY; BELT; OLD	The Palaeoarchean supracrustal belts in Greenland contain Earth's oldest rocks and are a prime target in the search for the earliest evidence of life on Earth. However, metamorphism has largely obliterated original rock textures and compositions, posing a challenge to the preservation of biological signatures. A recent study of 3,700-million-year-old rocks of the Isua supracrustal belt in Greenland described a rare zone in which low deformation and a closed metamorphic system allowed preservation of primary sedimentary features, including putative conical and domical stromatolites' (laminated accretionary structures formed by microbially mediated sedimentation). The morphology, layering, mineralogy, chemistry and geological context of the structures were attributed to the formation of microbial mats in a shallow marine environment by 3,700 million years ago, at the start of Earth's rock record. Here we report new research that shows a non-biological, post-depositional origin for the structures. Three-dimensional analysis of the morphology and orientation of the structures within the context of host rock fabrics, combined with texture-specific analyses of major and trace element chemistry, show that the 'stromatolites' are more plausibly interpreted as part of an assemblage of deformation structures formed in carbonate-altered metasediments long after burial. The investigation of the structures of the Isua supracrustal belt serves as a cautionary tale in the search for signs of past life on Mars, highlighting the importance of three-dimensional, integrated analysis of morphology, rock fabrics and geochemistry at appropriate scales.

J	Bi, L; Xu, F; Gouesbet, G				Bi, Lei; Xu, Feng; Gouesbet, Gerard			Depolarization of nearly spherical particles: The Debye series approach	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							UNDERSTANDING LIGHT-SCATTERING; T-MATRIX METHOD; COATED SPHERE; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES; MIE SCATTERING; GAUSSIAN-BEAM; PLANE-WAVE; DIFFRACTION; RAINBOW	Backscattering depolarization of nonspherical particles plays a critical role in active Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) retrievals of cloud or aerosol parameters, as well as in particle characterization techniques. However, the interpretation of backscattering light from particles is a challenging research subject. This paper addresses the depolarization of nearly spherical particles by using the Debye series approach. Specifically, the T matrix is represented as an infinite sum of terms; the terms in the expansion are correspondingly associated with diffraction and reflection (p = 0), and multiple transmissions (p > 0) from the particle to the medium as waves undergo internal reflections. We found that the enhanced depolarization for optically soft particles stems from multiple transmissions. However, this is mostly from the transmission after one internal reflection (p = 2), when the refractive index is larger than 1.3. Moreover, the interference among multiple transmissions was found to play an essential role in suppressing the depolarization ratio as the refractive index approaches unity. These findings have implications in interpreting the backscattering optical properties of atmospheric aerosols and hydrosols in water.

The global abundance of OH has been monitored for the past decades using atmospheric methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) as a proxy. This method is becoming ineffective as atmospheric CH3CCl3 concentrations decline. Here we propose that satellite observations of atmospheric methane in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) can provide an alternative method for monitoring global OH concentrations. The premise is that the atmospheric signature of the methane sink from oxidation by OH is distinct from that of methane emissions. We evaluate this method in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) framework using synthetic SWIR and TIR satellite observations representative of the TROPOMI and CrIS instruments, respectively. The synthetic observations are interpreted with a Bayesian inverse analysis, optimizing both gridded methane emissions and global OH concentrations. The optimization is done analytically to provide complete error accounting, including error correlations between posterior emissions and OH concentrations. The potential bias caused by prior errors in the 3-D seasonal OH distribution is examined using OH fields from 12 different models in the ACCMIP archive. We find that the satellite observations of methane have the potential to constrain the global tropospheric OH concentration with a precision better than 1% and an accuracy of about 3% for SWIR and 7% for TIR. The inversion can successfully separate the effects of perturbations to methane emissions and to OH concentrations. Interhemispheric differences in OH concentrations can also be successfully retrieved. Error estimates may be overoptimistic because we assume in this OSSE that errors are strictly random and have no systematic component. The availability of TROPOMI and CrIS data will soon provide an opportunity to test the method with actual observations.

Regional Climate Model Evaluation System powered by Apache Open Climate Workbench v1.3.0: an enabling tool for facilitating regional climate studies	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							CMIP5; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; TEMPERATURE; CORDEX; CLOUD	The Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) is an enabling tool of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to support the United States National Climate Assessment. As a comprehensive system for evaluating climate models on regional and continental scales using observational datasets from a variety of sources, RCMES is designed to yield information on the performance of climate models and guide their improvement. Here, we present a user-oriented document describing the latest version of RCMES, its development process, and future plans for improvements. The main objective of RCMES is to facilitate the climate model evaluation process at regional scales. RCMES provides a framework for performing systematic evaluations of climate simulations, such as those from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), using in situ observations, as well as satellite and reanalysis data products. The main components of RCMES are (1) a database of observations widely used for climate model evaluation, (2) various data loaders to import climate models and observations on local file systems and Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) nodes, (3) a versatile processor to subset and regrid the loaded datasets, (4) performance metrics designed to assess and quantify model skill, (5) plotting routines to visualize the performance metrics, (6) a toolkit for statistically downscaling climate model simulations, and (7) two installation packages to maximize convenience of users without Python skills. RCMES website is maintained up to date with a brief explanation of these components. Although there are other open-source software (OSS) toolkits that facilitate analysis and evaluation of climate models, there is a need for climate scientists to participate in the development and customization of OSS to study regional climate change. To establish infrastructure and to ensure software sustainability, development of RCMES is an open, publicly accessible process enabled by leveraging the Apache Software Foundation's OSS library, Apache Open Climate Workbench (OCW). The OCW software that powers RCMES includes a Python OSS library for common climate model evaluation tasks as well as a set of user-friendly interfaces for quickly configuring a model evaluation task. OCW also allows users to build their own climate data analysis tools, such as the statistical downscaling toolkit provided as a part of RCMES.

Plausible Home Stars of the Interstellar Object 'Oumuamua Found in Gaia DR2	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: individual ('Oumuamua); methods: statistical; solar neighborhood; stars: kinematics and dynamics; surveys	OORT CLOUD; SPECTROSCOPY; HIPPARCOS	The first detected interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, which passed within 0.25 au of the Sun on 2017 September 9, was presumably ejected from a stellar system. We use its newly determined non-Keplerian trajectory together with the reconstructed Galactic orbits of 7 million stars from Gaia DR2 to identify past close encounters. Such an "encounter" could reveal the home system from which 'Oumuamua was ejected. The closest encounter, at 0.60 pc (0.53-0.67 pc, 90% confidence interval), was with the M2.5 dwarf HIP 3757 at a relative velocity of 24.7 km s(-1), 1Myr ago. A more distant encounter (1.6 pc) but with a lower encounter (ejection) velocity of 10.7 km s(-1) was with the G5 dwarf HD 292249, 3.8 Myr ago. Two more stars have encounter distances and velocities intermediate to these. The encounter parameters are similar across six different non-gravitational trajectories for 'Oumuamua. The ejection of 'Oumuamua by scattering from a giant planet in one of the systems is plausible, but requires a rather unlikely configuration to achieve the high velocities found. A binary star system is more likely to produce the observed velocities. None of the four home candidates have published exoplanets or are known to be binaries. Given that the 7 million stars in Gaia DR2 with 6D phase space information is just a small fraction of all stars for which we can eventually reconstruct orbits, it is a priori unlikely that our current search would find 'Oumuamua's home star system. As 'Oumuamua is expected to pass within 1 pc of about 20 stars and brown dwarfs every Myr, the plausibility of a home system also depends on an appropriate (low) encounter velocity.

Vega is an ideal target for high-contrast imaging because it is bright, nearby, and young with a face-on two-belt debris disk that may be shaped by unseen planets. We obtained J- and H-band data on Vega with the coronagraphic integral-field spectrograph Project 1640 (P1640) at Palomar Observatory. Two nights of data were obtained in 2016, in poor seeing conditions, and two additional nights in more favorable conditions in 2017. In total, we obtained 5.5 hours of integration time on Vega in moderate to good seeing conditions (< 1 ''.5). We did not detect any low-mass companions in this system. Our data present the most sensitive contrast limits around Vega at very small separations (2-15 au) thus far, allowing us to place new constraints on the companions that may be sculpting the Vega system. In addition to new constraints, as the deepest data obtained with P1640, these observations form the final legacy of the now decommissioned instrument.

The Global Distribution of Active Ionian Volcanoes and Implications for Tidal Heating Models	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: fundamental parameters; planets and satellites: surfaces; techniques: imaging spectroscopy	SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; GALILEO NIMS; HOT-SPOTS; IO; HORIZONS; IMAGER; FLOW	Tidal heating is the major source of heat in the outer solar system. Because of its strong tidal interaction with Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites, Io is incredibly volcanically active. We use the directly measured volcanic activity level of Io's volcanoes as a proxy for surface heat flow and compare it to tidal heating model predictions. Volcanic activity is a better proxy for heat flow than simply the locations of volcanic constructs. We determine the volcanic activity level using three data sets: the Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer (PPR), Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), and New Horizons LEISA. We also present a systematic reanalysis of the Galileo NIMS observations to determine the 3.5 mu m brightness of 51 active volcanoes. We find that potential differences in volcanic style between high and low latitudes make high-latitude observations unreliable for distinguishing between tidal heating models. Observations of Io's polar areas, such as those by Juno, are necessary to unambiguously understand Io's heat flow. However, all three of the data sets examined show a relative dearth of volcanic brightness near 180W (anti-Jovian point) and the equator, and the only data set with good observations of the sub-Jovian point (LEISA) also shows a lack of volcanic brightness in that region. These observations are more consistent with the mantle-heating model than the asthenospheric-heating model. Furthermore, all three of the data sets are consistent with fourfold symmetry in longitude and peak heat flow at mid-latitudes, which best matches with the combined heating case of Tackley et al.

It is generally believed that the role of excess-Mg is to compensate the single Mg vacancy to realize n-type carrier conduction. In contrary to this belief, the present work indicates that the role of excess-Mg is to compensate the electronic charge of defect complex (Vm8(2) + Ma-. The Mg solubility in alpha-Mg3Sb2 is quite small when only considering a single defect, but it enlarged up to x = 0.011 with the defect complex (V-Mg(2) + Mg-1)(1-), which is more reasonable as supported by experiments. Under Mg-poor conditions, Vmg(02- and Vmg(2)2- are the dominant defects, and their concentrations can reach (1.05-1.18) X 1019 cm(-3) at 1200 K. Under Mg-rich conditions, (V-mg(2) + Mg-1)(1-) is found to be the dominant reason for strong p-type behavior, and their concentrations can reach as high as 3.5 X 10(2) cm(-3), which shifts the Fermi level closer to the valence band maximum. The predicted carrier concentrations in the range 1017-10(20) cm(-3) are in the same range found experimentally for pure p-type a-Mg3Sb2.

The IPWG provides a focal point and forum for the international scientific community to address the issues and challenges of satellite-based quantitative precipitation retrievals, and for the operational agencies to access and make use of precipitation products. Through partnerships and biennial meetings, the group supports the exchange of information on techniques for retrieving and measuring precipitation and for enhancing the impact of space-borne precipitation retrievals in numerical weather and hydrometeorological prediction and climate studies. The group furthers the refinement of current estimation techniques and the development of new methodologies for improved global precipitation measurements, together with the validation of the derived precipitation products with ground-based precipitation measurements. The IPWG identifies critical issues, provides recommendations to the CGMS and supports upcoming precipitation-oriented missions. Training activities on precipitation retrieval from space are also part of the IPWG mandate in cooperation with WMO and other bodies.

Evaluation of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation for microwave scattering by rimed snowflakes	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						aggregation; discrete dipole approximation; radar; Rayleigh-Gans approximation; riming; snowflakes	SNOWFALL MICROPHYSICS; RADAR BACKSCATTERING; LIGHT-SCATTERING; FREQUENCY; AGGREGATE; SIGNATURES; PARTICLES	We have evaluated the applicability of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation (RGA) and self-similar Rayleigh-Gans approximation (SSRGA) for microwave scattering by rimed snowflakes. This study extends previous findings that showed that, for unrimed snowflakes, the RGA is in good agreement with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which we used as a reference method. When riming is introduced, the RGA-derived scattering properties of individual snowflakes deviate significantly - up to 20-25 dB for the backscattering cross-section in the W band - from the corresponding DDA results. In contrast, the average scattering properties given by RGA are in good agreement with DDA for all but the most heavily rimed snowflakes: the mean bias in the backscattering cross-section rarely exceeds 1 dB for light and moderate riming. We also found that an adjustment that accounts for the non-spherical shapes of ice crystals can help eliminate the small constant bias found in RGA in earlier studies. The SSRGA approximates the RGA results with good accuracy at all degrees of riming, indicating that it, too, can be used with up to moderately rimed snowflakes.

In this study, we compared the skill of using various atmospheric variables and their combinations as predictors in accurately identifying surface precipitation phase, determined uncertainties associated with commonly used fixed temperature thresholds, and explored the sensitivity of hydrologic model output to uncertainty in precipitation phase using two case-studies. The results suggest that among all single predictors, wet-bulb temperature yields the highest skill score for determining precipitation phase and can reduce uncertainties due to regional differences, especially compared to the commonly used near-surface air temperature. However, addition of good-quality near-surface wind speed measurement to dew-point temperature and pressure showed slightly higher skill than wet-bulb temperature. We showed that the scale mismatch between temperature from stations and gridded products can cause large uncertainties in determining precipitation phase, especially in regions with rugged topography. Such uncertainties need to be considered when the relationships developed based on station data are applied to remote-sensing observations and model-generated data to separate rain from snowfall. The sensitivity of hydrologic model outputs to uncertainty in precipitation phase delineation was also assessed over two major basins in California by modifying default near-surface temperatures used in the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. It was found that regional and scaling uncertainties in determining temperature thresholds can largely influence the accuracy of simulated downstream runoff and snow water equivalent (SWE) (e.g. up to 40% change in SWE for 2 degrees C shift in temperature threshold). Therefore, to reduce simulation uncertainties, it is important to improve rain-snow partitioning methods, consider regional variabilities in determining temperature thresholds, and perform the analysis at the highest possible resolutions to mitigate scale-related uncertainties.

Joseph; Haddad, Ziad S.; Kirstetter, Pierre-Emmanuel; You, Yalei; Ringerud, Sarah			An observationally based method for stratifying a priori passive microwave observations in a Bayesian-based precipitation retrieval framework	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						emissivity; inverse techniques; land; microwave; precipitation; radar; radiometry	LAND-SURFACE EMISSIVITIES; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; RAIN-RATE; UNCERTAINTY; VALIDATION; SNOW	Estimation of precipitation from space-based passive microwave (PMW) radiometric brightness temperature (TB) observations that adapts to the wide variety of Earth surface background and environmental conditions is a long-standing issue. Since these conditions are generally unknown from the TB observations, PMW-based precipitation estimation techniques commonly utilize independent ancillary data sources, such as interpolated prognostic variables from numerical weather prediction forecast models, and discrete surface emissivity classifications. In some situations, the selection of these variables may restrain the algorithm performance under particular surface and atmospheric conditions. The objective of this article is to examine the emissivity principal component (EPC) analysis as a common stratification method for indexing, searching and weighting candidate precipitation profiles from a priori databases, adaptable for Bayesian-based precipitation estimation algorithms applied to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) or other PMW sensors, to minimize dependence upon ancillary data sources. The EPC has been previously shown to track the joint variability between the 10-89 GHz surface emissivity, total column precipitable water vapour (TPW) and surface temperature (T-s) conditions directly from the TB observations, and identify global locations of similar conditions. A parallel GMI precipitation retrieval was carried out where the identical a priori database was indexed by TPW, T-s and a surface emissivity class index. An independent validation of each precipitation retrieval scheme was carried out using GMI pixel-matched Multi-Radar Multi-Source (MRMS) ground radar data over the continental USA and surrounding ocean waters. While the EPC-based estimates demonstrated similar performance to the TPW-based estimates over ocean backgrounds, a markedly improved detection, and reduction in bias, was found for moderate and higher (>5 mm/hr) rainfall rates over other backgrounds, especially vegetated surfaces and coastlines.

Polarimetric RO (PRO) measurements have been proposed as a method to characterize heavy rain in GNSS RO, by measuring the polarimetric differential phase delay induced by large size hydrometeors. Previous studies have shown that the PRO polarimetric phase shift is sensitive to the path-integrated rain rate under intense precipitation scenarios, but there is no current method to invert PRO measurements into quantitative estimates of the path-averaged rain rate. In this manuscript, a probabilistic inversion approach to the GNSS PRO observables is proposed, where the GPM precipitation products are used for the construction of an a priori look-up table (LUT) database. The performance of the LUTs is assessed for use in the inversion of satellite-based GNSS PRO observations, based on synthetically generated PRO data of actual events, which correspond to co-locations between GNSS RO profiles and the TRMM observations. The synthetic data include end-to-end propagation effects of the polarimetric observables and a simple separation algorithm to isolate the hydrometeor component of the observation. The assessment results in agreement better than +/- 1 mm/hr between the reference LUT and the actual rain statistics of the synthetic data, proving the suitability of the GPM-based probabilistic inversion tool. These findings indicate that the GNSS PRO products are capable of extending the current GNSS RO ones by associating indications of rain-rate probabilities at different altitudes, at approximate to 250 m vertical resolution and under intense precipitation scenarios with the standard vertical thermodynamic profiles.

J	Wen, YX; Behrangi, A; Chen, HN; Lambrigtsen, B				Wen, Yixin; Behrangi, Ali; Chen, Haonan; Lambrigtsen, Bjorn			How well were the early 2017 California Atmospheric River precipitation events captured by satellite products and ground-based radars?	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Atmospheric River; extreme events; ground weather radar; QPE; remote sensing; satellite; water resources	NORTH PACIFIC-OCEAN; PASSIVE MICROWAVE; RAINFALL; CALJET; PROJECT; SYSTEM; CMORPH; LAND	In January and February of 2017, California experienced multiple heavy storms that caused serious destruction of facilities and economic loss, although it also helped to reduce water storage deficit due to prolonged drought in previous years. These extreme precipitation events were mainly associated with Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) and brought about 174 km(3) of water to California according to ground observations. This article evaluates the performance of six commonly used satellite-based precipitation products (IMERG, 3B42RT, PERSIANN, CCS, CMORPH and GSMaP), as well as ground-based radar products (Radar-only and Radar-lgc) in capturing the ARs precipitation rate and distribution. It is found that precipitation maps from all products present heavy precipitation in January and February, with more consistent observations over ocean than land. Though large uncertainties exist in quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) over land, the ensemble mean of different remote-sensing precipitation products over California is consistent with gauge measurements. Among the six satellite-based products, IMERG correlates the best with gauge observations both in the detection and quantification of precipitation, but it is not the best product in terms of root-mean-square error or bias. Compared to satellite products, ground weather radar shows better precipitation detectability and estimation skill. However, neither radar nor satellite QPE products have good performances in quantifying the peak precipitation intensity during the extreme events, suggesting that further advancement in quantification of extremely intense precipitation associated with ARs in the western United States is needed.

J	Mazzoni, A; Heggy, E; Scabbia, G				Mazzoni, Annamaria; Heggy, Essem; Scabbia, Giovanni			Forecasting water budget deficits and groundwater depletion in the main fossil aquifer systems in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Arid environments; Water deficit; Groundwater budget; Climate change; Water and food security; Projections	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIDDLE-EAST; GRACE; VARIABILITY; RESOURCES; STORAGE; AVAILABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; COUNTRIES; BALANCE	We develop a water budget model that quantifies and forecasts water deficits and groundwater depletion of the main exploitable fresh fossil aquifer systems in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula under different climatic and socio-economic scenarios from 2016 until 2050. Our results suggest that in the upcoming few decades, under the most plausible climatic and socio-economic scenario (SSP2-AVG), within North Africa, only Egypt and Libya will experience severe water deficits with respectively similar to 45% and similar to 90% of their current water budget in 2050. For the Arabian Peninsula, all countries will undergo water deficits, ranging from similar to 20% for Saudi Arabia to almost double the supply for Yemen (similar to 190%). Under these alarming deficits, resulting from severe anthropogenic discharges, the majority of the small to mid-size exploitable fossil aquifer systems in the Arabian Peninsula could reach full depletion by 2050 and the total depletion of groundwater resources in all aquifer systems could be reached in similar to 60-90 years. Over the same time span, North African fossil aquifers will lose 1-15% of their exploitable fresh water volume and may reach total depletion in similar to 200-350 years with the projected increased extraction rates. We find that the major cause of the water budget deficit and groundwater depletion in the MENA area are anthropogenic drivers rather than climatic ones. Finally, we conclude that if current hydrologic, climatic and socio-economic trends continue, the nations with the lowest gross domestic product per capita, like Egypt, Yemen and Libya, will undergo the highest water deficit per capita, leading to a significant rise in food prices, potentially resulting in more socio-economic instabilities over the next three decades.

Blind Signal Separation Methods for InSAR: The Potential to Automatically Detect and Monitor Signals of Volcanic Deformation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						InSAR; ICA; independent component analysis; volcano monitoring; machine learning; Sentinel-1	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FMRI DATA; ERUPTION; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS; SYSTEM; ERROR; MODEL; FLANK	There are some 1,500 volcanoes with the potential to erupt, but most are not instrumentally monitored. However, routine acquisition by the Sentinel-1 satellites now fulfils the requirements needed for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to progress from a retrospective analysis tool to one used for near-real-time monitoring globally. However, global monitoring produces vast quantities of data, and consequently, an automatic detection algorithm is therefore required that is able to identify signs of new deformation, or changes in rate, in a time series of interferograms. On the basis that much of the signal contained in a time series of interferograms can be considered as a linear mixture of several latent sources, we explore the use of blind source separation methods to address this issue. We consider principal component analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) which have previously been applied to InSAR data and nonnegative matrix factorization which has not. Our systematic analysis of the three methods shows ICA to be best suited for most applications with InSAR data. However, care must be taken in the dimension reduction step of ICA not to remove important smaller magnitude signals. We apply ICA to the 2015 Wolf Volcano eruption (Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador) and automatically isolate three signals, which are broadly similar to those manually identified in other studies. Finally, we develop a prototype detection algorithm based on ICA to identify the onset of the eruption. Plain Language Summary Through monitoring volcanoes, we can detect signs that they may be likely to erupt in the future, yet many of the world's volcanoes remain unmonitored. However, the latest generation of RADAR satellites produces regular measurements of ground displacement around the majority of the world's volcanoes, and these measurements can be used to detect signs of unrest at many previously unmonitored volcanoes. As the volume of data produced in this undertaking is vast, an automatic detection algorithm is required to detect these signals of interest. In this work, we present methods to separate signals indicative of volcanic unrest from other nuisance signals and to then monitor the geophysically important signals to detect if a volcano has entered a period of unrest.

The Origins Space Telescope (OST) is one of the four missions selected to be studied by NASA for the 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal survey. HERO is designed to observe the trail of water from the interstellar medium (ISM) to disks around protostars. In Concept 1, HERO provides continuous frequency coverage from 468 to 2700 GHz in fi e bands and a sixth band to cover 4700 GHz. Most bands include 2 x 64 pixels providing at least an order of magnitude higher mapping speeds than available with today's instruments. Receiver sensitivities are expected to be close to the quantum limit. HERO Concept 2, highly constrained by cost and denoted Little-HERO, includes four bands with continuous coverage from 486 to 2700 GHz and with focal plane arrays having only 2 x 9 pixels per band. Both of these THz receiver concepts will be described and the designs will be motivated by the science drivers, the space craft constraints and the latest technological developments. The HERO design builds on the highly successful Herschel/Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared, on Stratospheric Observatory for Far-Infrared Astronomy/upGREAT and many other heterodyne receivers, but surpasses these in terms of frequency coverage, array size and sensitivity, thanks to the latest technical advances. HERO can be considered an example of a new generation of heterodyne focal plane arrays for future space missions.

They have, however, different impacts on the ocean energy budget, which explains the need to partition motions into BMs and IGWs. One way is to exploit the synergy of using different satellite observations, the only observations with global coverage, and a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution. But we need first to characterize and understand their signatures on the different surface oceanic fields. This study addresses this issue by using an ocean global numerical simulation with high-resolution (1/48 degrees). Our methodology is based on the analysis of the 12,000 frequency-wave number spectra to discriminate these two classes of motions in the surface kinetic energy, sea surface height, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, relative vorticity, and divergence fields and for two seasons. Results reveal a complex picture worldwide of the partition of motions between IGWs and BMs in the different surface fields, depending on the season, the hemisphere, and low and high eddy kinetic energy regions. But they also highlight some generic properties on the impact of these two classes of motions on the different fields. This points to the synergy of using present and future satellite observations to assess the ocean kinetic energy on a global scale. The 12,000 frequency-wave number spectra represent a World Ocean Atlas of the surface ocean dynamics not fully exploited in the present study. We hope the use of this World Ocean Atlas by other studies will lead to extend much these results. Plain Language Summary Motivation of partitioning surface oceanic motions with scales <100km into two classes, balanced motions (BMs) and internal gravity waves (IGWs), is that they are known to have different impacts on the ocean kinetic budget although they share the same range of spatial and temporal scales. Satellite observations are the only ones with a global coverage to capture oceanic surface motions. Our motivation of exploiting the synergy of using all these observations is that these two classes of motions can have different signatures on each of these observations. The results reveal a complex picture worldwide of the partition of motions between IGWs and BMs in the different surface fields, depending on the season, the hemisphere, and low and high eddy kinetic energy regions. But they also highlight some generic properties on the impact of these two classes of motions on the different fields. This emphasizes the strong synergy of using present and future satellite observations to diagnose this partition on a global scale. The results can be of interest for Earth Science community because of their consequences on the ocean kinetic energy budget, the physical-biological interactions, and the air-sea interactions.

J	Delman, AS; Lee, T; Qiu, B				Delman, Andrew S.; Lee, Tong; Qiu, Bo			Interannual to Multidecadal Forcing of Mesoscale Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Subtropical Southern Indian Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						mesoscale; eddies; interannual; decadal; variability; Indian Ocean	SHALLOW OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; SEA-LEVEL TRENDS; LEEUWIN CURRENT; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; VARIABILITY; EDDIES; WESTERN; OSCILLATION; MECHANISMS; BOUNDARY	A region of elevated mesoscale eddy activity spans the subtropical southern Indian Ocean (SSIO) between Madagascar and Australia. The interannual and decadal changes in eddy activity in the SSIO eddy band, as represented by the variability of eddy kinetic energy (EKE), have implications for the large-scale circulation, mixed-layer budgets, and biological activity. An analysis of nearly two and a half decades of sea level anomaly (SLA) data from merged satellite altimetry shows that, in the southeast Indian Ocean east of 90 degrees E, the variations of EKE and SLA are positively correlated on interannual and decadal time scales. Moreover, EKE exhibits a multidecadal increasing linear trend that corresponds to an increasing trend of SLA in the region. The EKE-SLA covariability in the southeast Indian Ocean does not appear to be associated with a preference for anticyclonic over cyclonic eddy activity; rather, it can be attributed to the common remote forcing from the tropical Pacific associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In the west central SSIO, wind stress curl just south of the eddy band forces potential vorticity anomalies that affect conditions for instability in the west central SSIO; potential density and potential vorticity gradient anomalies also suggest a remote forcing mechanism originating in the region southwest of Australia. The interannual to multidecadal variability of EKE in the SSIO and its relationship with large-scale SLA has implications for mixed-layer dynamics and biogeochemistry and provides a basis for assessment of model simulations of eddy activity in the region. Plain Language Summary Eddiesrotating storm systems in the oceanthat are formed in the parts of the ocean between the tropics and poleward regions are very important for moving heat, salt, and other substances dissolved in the ocean between the tropics and the poles. An area in the southern Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Australia has particularly high levels of eddy activity, and the energy of the eddies changes substantially over the course of years and decades. To understand why these changes occur, satellite data were used that measure the height of the ocean surface and therefore tell us about the ocean circulation and its variability. This study found that levels of eddy activity near Australia are largely determined by the climate phenomena of La Nina and El Nino. In the central part of the southern Indian Ocean, closer to Madagascar, eddy energy levels are influenced by wind variations locally and ocean conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean. These factors that influence eddy activity in the southern Indian Ocean can help us make better predictions of eddy energy in the region; this will tell us more about how heat, salt, and nutrients are transported between the tropics and the waters near Antarctica.

Variability of Martian Turbopause Altitudes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; turbopause; homopause; NGIMS; wave damping; lower thermosphere	GRAVITY-WAVE; UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; MARS; TEMPERATURE; TURBULENCE; FRACTIONATION; THERMOSPHERE; STABILITY; EVOLUTION	The turbopause and homopause represent the transition from strong turbulence and mixing in the middle atmosphere to a molecular-diffusion-dominated region in the upper atmosphere. We use neutral densities measured by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer on the Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft from February 2015 to October 2016 to investigate the temperature structure and fluctuations of the Martian upper atmosphere. We compare those with temperature measurements of the lower atmosphere from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder. At the lowest Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN altitudes we often observe a statically stable region where waves propagate freely. In contrast, regions from about 20km up to at least 70km are reduced in stability where waves are expected to dissipate readily due to breaking/saturation. We derive homopause altitudes from Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer N-2 and Ar densities and find that it varies between 60 and 140km. From the standard deviations in monthly averaged temperature profiles, we determine the wave turbopause altitude where applicable and find that these altitudes agree with the homopause altitudes. We show that the homopause variability is driven by order of magnitude changes in CO2 densities, which drastically affect the altitude at which the eddy diffusion is equal to the molecular diffusion. These variations are observed as a function of local time, latitude, and season. That the turbopause/homopause does not track a fixed density level means that the eddy diffusion coefficient at the turbopause can vary significantly, suggesting differences in the dominant breaking waves and tidal modes. Plain Language Summary The gases that make up a planet's atmosphere are mixed together efficiently near the surface. But in the uppermost part of the atmosphere, gases separate by massheavier ones are held closer to the planet, while lighter ones are more abundant higher up. Because turbulence is responsible for the mixing in the atmosphere, the altitude where this transition occurs is called the turbopause. That turbulence is thought to be generated by atmospheric waves that lose energy (somewhat like ocean waves breaking at shore). In this work, we use measurements of the upper atmosphere from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission and of the lower atmosphere from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to study the turbopause region during a full Mars year. Similar to Earth's atmosphere, we find that below the turbopause wave breaking is strong (which produces turbulence), but above waves can move freely. We also show that the turbopause varies significantly depending on the season and location on the planet. At Mars, gases can escape from the top of the atmosphere, so the relative amounts of escape of different gases depends on the turbopause. Understanding this altitude and why it varies is important for interpreting how the atmosphere evolved.

Characterization of Mesoscale Waves in the Jupiter NEB by Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper on board Juno	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; waves	NORTH EQUATORIAL BELT; SMALL-SCALE WAVES; COMET SHOEMAKER-LEVY-9; JOVIAN ATMOSPHERE; GRAVITY-WAVES; VOYAGER; PROBE; SPECTROMETER; TROPOSPHERE	In 2017, the Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM), on board the NASA-ASI Juno mission, observed a wide longitude region (50 degrees W-80 degrees E in System III) that was perturbed by a wave pattern centered at 15 degrees N in the Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB). We analyzed JIRAM data acquired on 2017 July 10 using the M-channel and on 2017 February 2 with the spectrometer. The two observations occurred at different times and at slightly different latitudes. The waves appear as clouds blocking the deeper thermal emission. The wave crests are oriented north-south, and the typical wave packet contains 10 crests and 10 troughs. We used Fourier analysis to rigorously determine the wavenumbers associated with the observed patterns at a confidence level of 90%. Wavelet analysis was also used to constrain the spatial localization of the largest energies involved in the process and determine the wavelengths carrying the major contribution. We found wavelengths ranging from 1400 to 1900 km, and generally decreasing toward the west. Where possible, we also computed a vertical location of the cloud pressure levels from the inversion of the spectral radiances measured by the JIRAM spectrometer. The waves were detected at pressure levels consistent with the NH3 as well as NH4SH clouds. Phase velocities could not be determined with sufficient confidence to discriminate whether the alternating crests and troughs are a propagating wave or a manifestation of a fluid dynamical instability.

The KELT images have a pixel scale of similar to 23 '' pixel(-1)-very similar to that of NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)-as well as a large point-spread function, and the KELT reduction pipeline uses a weighted photometric aperture with radius 3'. At this angular scale, multiple stars are typically blended in the photometric apertures. In order to identify false positives and confirm transiting exoplanets, we have assembled a follow-up network (KELT-FUN) to conduct imaging with spatial resolution, cadence, and photometric precision higher than the KELT telescopes, as well as spectroscopic observations of the candidate host stars. The KELT-FUN team has followed-up over 1600 planet candidates since 2011, resulting in more than 20 planet discoveries. Excluding similar to 450 false alarms of non-astrophysical origin (i.e., instrumental noise or systematics), we present an all-sky catalog of the 1128 bright stars (6 < V < 13) that show transit-like features in the KELT light curves, but which were subsequently determined to be astrophysical false positives (FPs) after photometric and/or spectroscopic follow-up observations. The KELT-FUN team continues to pursue KELT and other planet candidates and will eventually follow up certain classes of TESS candidates. The KELT FP catalog will help minimize the duplication of follow-up observations by current and future transit surveys such as TESS.

Models of Rosetta/OSIRIS 67P Dust Coma Phase Function	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: numerical; minor planets,asteroids: individual (67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko)	LIGHT-SCATTERING; COMETARY DUST; AGGREGATE PARTICLES; RADIATIVE TORQUES; GRAIN ALIGNMENT; POLARIZATION; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO	The phase function of the dust coma of comet 67P has been determined from Rosetta/OSIRIS images. This function shows a deep minimum at phase angles near 100 degrees, and a strong backscattering enhancement. These two properties cannot be reproduced by regular models of cometary dust, most of them based on wavelength-sized and randomly oriented aggregate particles. We show, however, that an ensemble of oriented elongated particles of a wide variety of aspect ratios, with radii r greater than or similar to 10 mu m, and whose long axes are perpendicular to the direction of the solar radiation, are capable of reproducing the observed phase function.

Recent studies of the distribution of these planets have revealed a gap in the population near 1.5-2.0 R-circle plus, informally dividing these planets into "super-Earths" and "sub-Neptunes." The origin of this division is difficult to investigate directly because the majority of planets found by Kepler orbit distant, dim stars and are not amenable to radial velocity follow-up or transit spectroscopy, making bulk density and atmospheric measurements difficult. Here, we present the discovery and validation of a newly found 2.03(-0.07)(+0.80) R-circle plus planet in direct proximity to the radius gap, orbiting the bright (J= 8.32 mag), nearby (D = 44.5 pc) high proper motion K3.5V star Wolf 503 (EPIC 212779563). We determine the possibility of a companion star and false positive detection to be extremely low using both archival images and high-contrast adaptive optics images from the Palomar observatory. The brightness of the host star makes Wolf 503b a prime target for prompt radial velocity follow-up, and with the small stellar radius (0.690 +/- 0.025R(circle dot)), it is also an excellent target for HST transit spectroscopy and detailed atmospheric characterization with JWST. With its measured radius near the gap in the planet radius and occurrence rate distribution, Wolf 503b offers a key opportunity to better understand the origin of this radius gap as well as the nature of the intriguing populations of "super-Earths" and "sub-Neptunes" as a whole.

This is the first detector to successfully use a Fresnel lens based optical system and multi-anode photomultipliers (64 channels per tube, 2304 channels encompassing a 10.6 degrees x 10.6 degrees field of view) for detection of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). The telescope is located in front of one of the fluorescence detectors of the TA experiment. Since its installation in 2013, the detector has observed several ultra-high energy cosmic ray events and, in addition, meteors. The limiting magnitude of 5.5 on summed frames (similar to 3 ms) has been established. Measurements of the UV night sky emission in different conditions and moon phases and positions have been completed.

An examination of extratropical cyclone response to changes in baroclinicity and temperature in an idealized environment	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							LATENT-HEAT RELEASE; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION; MIDLATITUDE WEATHER; DIABATIC PROCESSES; MESOSCALE MODEL; WARMER CLIMATE; CYCLOGENESIS; PRECIPITATION; DYNAMICS	The dynamics and precipitation in extratropical cyclones (ETCs) are known to be sensitive to changes in the cyclone environment, with increases in bulk water vapor and baroclinicity both leading to increases in storm strength and precipitation. Studies that demonstrate this sensitivity have commonly varied either the cyclone moisture or baroclinicity, but seldom both. In a changing climate, in which the near-surface equator to pole temperature gradient may weaken while the bulk water vapor content of the atmosphere increases, it is important to understand the relative response of ETC strength and precipitation to changes in both factors simultaneously. In this study, idealized simulations of ETC development are conducted in a moist environment using a model with a full suite of moist physics parameterizations. The bulk temperature (and water vapor content) and baroclinicity are systematically varied one at a time, then simultaneously, and the effect of these variations on the storm strength and precipitation is assessed. ETC intensity exhibits the well-documented response to changes in baroclinicity, with stronger ETCs forming in higher baroclinicity environments. However, increasing water vapor content produces non-monotonic changes in storm strength, in which storm intensity first increases with increasing environmental water vapor, then decreases above a threshold value. Examination of the storm geographic extent indicates cyclone size also decreases above a threshold value of bulk environmental temperature (and water vapor). Decrease in storm size is concomitant with an increase in the convective fraction of precipitation and a shift in the vertical distribution of latent heating. The results indicate the existence of at least two regimes for ETC development, each of which exhibit significantly different distributions of PV due to differences in timing and location of convective heating.

J	Noell, AC; Fisher, AM; Fors-Francis, K; Sherrit, S				Noell, Aaron C.; Fisher, Anita M.; Fors-Francis, Kisa; Sherrit, Stewart			Subcritical water extraction of amino acids from Mars analog soils	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						Amino acids; Extraction; Mars; Soils; Subcritical water	REACTION-KINETICS; ORGANIC-MATTER; CAPILLARY-ELECTROPHORESIS; MARTIAN SOIL; GALE CRATER; DECOMPOSITION; SEARCH; PERCHLORATE; HYDROLYSIS; MOLECULES	For decades, the Martian regolith has stymied robotic mission efforts to catalog the organic molecules present. Perchlorate salts, found widely throughout Mars, are the main culprit as they breakdown and react with organics liberated from the regolith during pyrolysis, the primary extraction technique attempted to date on Mars. This work further develops subcritical water extraction (SCWE) as a technique for extraction of amino acids on future missions. The effect of SCWE temperature (185, 200, and 215 degrees C) and duration of extraction (10-120 min) on the total amount and distribution of amino acids recovered was explored for three Mars analog soils (JSC Mars-1A simulant, an Atacama desert soil, and an Antarctic Dry Valleys soil) and bovine serum albumin (as a control solution of known amino acid content). Total amounts of amino acids extracted increased with both time and temperature; however, the distribution shifted notably due to the destruction of the amino acids with charged or polar side chains at the higher temperatures. The pure bovine serum albumin solution and JSC Mars 1A also showed lower yields than the Atacama and Antarctic extractions suggesting that SCWE may be less effective at hydrolyzing large or aggregated proteins. Changing solvent from water to a dilute (10 mM) HCl solution allowed total extraction efficiencies comparable to the higher temperature/time combinations while using the lowest temperature/time (185 degrees C/20 min). The dilute HCl extractions also did not lead to the shift in amino acid distribution observed at the higher temperatures. Additionally, adding sodium perchlorate salt to the extraction did not interfere with recoveries. Native magnetite in the JSC Mars-1A may have been responsible for destruction of glycine, as evidenced by its uncharacteristic decrease as the temperature/time of extraction increased. This work shows that SCWE can extract high yields of native amino acids out of Mars analog soils with minimal disruption of the distribution of those amino acids, even in the presence of a perchlorate salt.

Stability of reagents used for chiral amino acid analysis during spaceflight missions in high-radiation environments	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						Amino acids; Biosignatures; Europa; Life detection; Radiation	LIFE-DETECTION EXPERIMENTS; SPACE RADIATION; ICE SHELL; EUROPA; OCEAN; ELECTROPHORESIS; COMMUNITIES; CONSTRAINTS; INSTRUMENT; ENERGY	The search for biosignatures on spaceflight missions requires in situ instrumentation capable of highly selective and sensitive organic analyses. To this end, CE-LIF is a uniquely promising technique, capable of determining the type, abundance, and chirality of amino acids present in environmental samples at nanomolar concentrations. However, this type of assay requires several reagents that have not yet been used on spaceflight missions. A key concern, particularly for future missions to Europa, is the survivability of these critical components for CE separation and LIF detection under high levels of radiation. Here we present an investigation of the chemical stability of the reagents and associated fused silica capillary after a total ionizing dose of 300 krad, exceeding the predicted total ionizing dose for the potential Europa Lander Mission payload by two-fold. Neither the fused silica capillary nor the fluorescent dye (5-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) showed significant change in performance following irradiation. Following the irradiation of the pre-mixed background electrolyte, both migration time and resolution were affected. However, when the reagents (sodium tetraborate, sodium taurocholate, and gamma-cyclodextrin) and the acetonitrile solution were irradiated separately and mixed afterwards, there was no change in the separation performance.

Analysis of inorganic cations and amino acids in high salinity samples by capillary electrophoresis and conductivity detection: Implications for in-situ exploration of ocean worlds	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						Biosignatures; Complex samples; Extraterrestrial exploration	ORGANIC-SOLVENTS; ZONE-ELECTROPHORESIS; ALKALINE-EARTH; SEPARATION; INSTRUMENTATION; CHROMATOGRAPHY; AMMONIUM; SEARCH; ANIONS; MARS	With growing interest in exploring ocean worlds, such as Europa and Enceladus, there is a fundamental need to develop liquid-based analytical techniques capable of handling high salinity samples while performing both bulk and trace species measurements. In this context, CE with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-(CD)-D-4) has tremendous potential. One of its advantages is that this combination allows the detection of a wide number of charged species (both organic and inorganic) without the need of derivatization. Amino acids are an example of organic targets that are powerful biosignatures in the search for life beyond Earth. Simultaneous information on the inorganic cations in a sample helps with assessing the habitability of an extraterrestrial environment, as well as providing sample context for any measurements of trace amino acids. In this work, we present a series of flight-compatible methods capable of simultaneously measuring inorganic cations and amino acids in samples of varying salinity by CE-(CD)-D-4. Regardless of the sample total salinity, 5.0 M acetic acid was selected as the optimum BGE. The methods were evaluated by analyzing natural samples of low and high salinity from Hot Creek Gorge, Mono Lake, and Santa Monica beach. Prospects for mission implementation are also discussed.

Meteorites are interesting samples to study microbe-mineral interaction focused on space exploration. The chemolithotropic bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans has been used as model to understand the iron and sulfur oxidation. In this work, capillary electrophoresis with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection and UV detection was used to monitor bacterial growth in a meteorite simulant by measuring the conversion of Fe2+ into Fe+3. The effect of Co2+ and Ni2+ (metals also found in meteorites) on the bacterial growth was also evaluated. The presented method allowed the analyses of all metals in a single run (less than 8 min). The background electrolyte was composted of 10 mmol/L alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid/Histidine. For comparison purpose, the samples were also analyzed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The Fe2+ conversion into Fe3+ by A. ferrooxidans was observed up to 36 h with the growth rate constant of 0.19/h and 0.21/h in Tuovinen and Kelly (T&K) and in meteorite simulant media, respectively. The developed method presents favorable prospect to monitor the growth of other chemolithotropic microorganisms for biotechnology applications.

Molecular signatures	INFRARED-EMISSION-SPECTRUM; EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; SPACE-BASED PHOTOMETRY; SUPER-EARTH; STELLAR ACTIVITY; TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM; BROWN DWARF; TRANSITING EXOPLANETS; JUPITER EXOPLANETS; VALIDATED PLANETS	Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of masses, sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large gas giants grazing the surface of their host star. However, the essential nature of these exoplanets remains largely mysterious: there is no known, discernible pattern linking the presence, size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its parent star. We have little idea whether the chemistry of a planet is linked to its formation environment, or whether the type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of the planet's birth, and evolution. ARIEL was conceived to observe a large number (1000) of transiting planets for statistical understanding, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and Earth-size planets around a range of host star types using transit spectroscopy in the 1.25-7.8m spectral range and multiple narrow-band photometry in the optical. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials compared to their colder Solar System siblings. Said warm and hot atmospheres are expected to be more representative of the planetary bulk composition. Observations of these warm/hot exoplanets, and in particular of their elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si), will allow the understanding of the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the nebular phase and the following few million years. ARIEL will thus provide a representative picture of the chemical nature of the exoplanets and relate this directly to the type and chemical environment of the host star. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated survey mission for combined-light spectroscopy, capable of observing a large and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. Transit, eclipse and phase-curve spectroscopy methods, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allow us to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of 10-100 part per million (ppm) relative to the star and, given the bright nature of targets, also allows more sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to give a deeper insight into the nature of the atmosphere. These types of observations require a stable payload and satellite platform with broad, instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect many molecular species, probe the thermal structure, identify clouds and monitor the stellar activity. The wavelength range proposed covers all the expected major atmospheric gases from e.g. H2O, CO2, CH4 NH3, HCN, H2S through to the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and condensed species. Simulations of ARIEL performance in conducting exoplanet surveys have been performed - using conservative estimates of mission performance and a full model of all significant noise sources in the measurement - using a list of potential ARIEL targets that incorporates the latest available exoplanet statistics. The conclusion at the end of the Phase A study, is that ARIEL - in line with the stated mission objectives - will be able to observe about 1000 exoplanets depending on the details of the adopted survey strategy, thus confirming the feasibility of the main science objectives.

A space-based decametric wavelength radio telescope concept	EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Radio astronomy; Interferometer; Space exploration; Active galactic nuclei; Networked constellation; Cubesat	DISCRETE SOURCES; NORTHERN SKY; ASTRONOMY; INTERFEROMETER; DIRECTIONS; RADIATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM	This paper reports a design study for a space-based decametric wavelength telescope. While not a new concept, this design study focused on many of the operational aspects that would be required for an actual mission. This design optimized the number of spacecraft to insure good visibility of approx. 80% of the radio galaxies- the primary science target for the mission. A 5,000 km lunar orbit was selected to guarantee minimal gravitational perturbations from Earth and lower radio interference. Optimal schemes for data downlink, spacecraft ranging, and power consumption were identified. An optimal mission duration of 1 year was chosen based on science goals, payload complexity, and other factors. Finally, preliminary simulations showing image reconstruction were conducted to confirm viability of the mission. This work is intended to show the viability and science benefits of conducting multi-spacecraft networked radio astronomy missions in the next few years.

Modeling marine pelagic fish species spatiotemporal distributions utilizing a maximum entropy approach	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus); Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus); butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus); fishery-dependent data; marine pelagic fish; maximum entropy (MaxEnt); satellite remote sensing data	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ATLANTIC; HABITAT; NORTH; PREDICTION; MAINE; GULF; TRANSFERABILITY; PRODUCTIVITY; STABILITY	Understanding how ocean conditions influence fish distributions is critical for elucidating the role of climate in ecosystem change and forecasting how fish may be distributed in the future. Traditional species distribution models are often applied to scientific-survey data, which include species presence-absence information, to predict distributions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are promising tools as they can be applied to presence-only data (e.g., data collected from fishermen targeting a specific species or from observers in citizen-science programs). We used MaxEnt models to relate occurrence records of three marine pelagic fish (Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, and butterfish) in fishery-dependent data to environmental conditions (sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration from satellite remote sensing, bathymetry, and climate indices), and evaluated model performance by both cross-validation and validation using fishery-independent data. We developed monthly habitat suitability maps for these fish in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf area, and assessed the relative influence of environmental factors on their distributions. Across months, their suitable habitat areas varied with each species exhibiting inshore-offshore and north-south movements in response to changing environmental conditions. Overall, SST and chlorophyll-a concentration had the greatest influence on the distributions of these fish, with bathymetry having moderate influence and climate indices having little influence. Our application of MaxEnt models enabled us to integrate presence-only data and high resolution environmental data from satellite remote sensing to describe spatiotemporal distributions of marine pelagic fish. These models were used to hindcast species occurrence in relation to historical environmental conditions to evaluate their predictive performance, and have the potential to provide nowcasts in relation to current conditions or forecasts of species future distributions.

However, despite rapid development of metrics to characterize the forest canopy from remotely sensed data, a gap remains between aerial and field inventories. To close this gap, we propose a new pan-tropical model to predict plot-level forest structure properties and biomass from only the largest trees. Location Time period Pan-tropical. Early 21st century. Major taxa studied Methods Woody plants. Using a dataset of 867 plots distributed among 118 sites across the tropics, we tested the prediction of the quadratic mean diameter, basal area, Lorey's height, community wood density and aboveground biomass (AGB) from the ith largest trees. Results Main conclusions Measuring the largest trees in tropical forests enables unbiased predictions of plot- and site-level forest structure. The 20 largest trees per hectare predicted quadratic mean diameter, basal area, Lorey's height, community wood density and AGB with 12, 16, 4, 4 and 17.7% of relative error, respectively. Most of the remaining error in biomass prediction is driven by differences in the proportion of total biomass held in medium-sized trees (50-70 cm diameter at breast height), which shows some continental dependency, with American tropical forests presenting the highest proportion of total biomass in these intermediate-diameter classes relative to other continents. Our approach provides new information on tropical forest structure and can be used to generate accurate field estimates of tropical forest carbon stocks to support the calibration and validation of current and forthcoming space missions. It will reduce the cost of field inventories and contribute to scientific understanding of tropical forest ecosystems and response to climate change.

Three-Dimensionally Printed, Shaped, Engineered Material Inhomogeneous Lens Antennas for Next-Generation Spaceborne Weather Radar Systems	IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS			English	Article						Antenna; geometrical optics (GO); inhomogeneous; particle swarm optimization (PSO); three-dimensionally (3-D) printed lens		In this letter, three-dimensionally (3-D) printed shaped inhomogeneous dielectric lens antennas are synthesized using a novel approach based on geometrical optics (GO) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. The GO method is used to trace rays to the aperture following the amplitude, phase, and polarization along curved space trajectories through inhomogeneous media to evaluate potential designs. These designs are specified by power series polynomials describing the surface topology and permittivity functions filling the volume of the shaped lens. The optimum design is obtained by integrating the GO analysis engine with the PSO into an optimization loop. The complex designed materials that result can be printed using new 3-D printers. New techniques are developed to print structures using fused deposition modeling (FDM), which contain complex overhanging features. Measured and simulated results are provided for all 3-D printed synthesized inhomogeneous lenses.

Using GRACE to Estitmate Snowfall Accumulation and Assess Gauge Undercatch Corrections in High Latitudes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENTS; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ERRORS	Ten years of terrestrial water storage anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were used to estimate high-latitude snowfall accumulation using a mass balance approach. The estimates were used to assess two common gauge-undercatch correction factors (CFs): the Legates climatology (CF-L) utilized in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Fuchs dynamic correction model (CF-F) used in the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monitoring product. The two CFs can be different by more than 50%. CF-L tended to exceed CF-F over northern Asia and Eurasia, while the opposite was observed over North America. Estimates of snowfall from GPCP, GPCC-L (GPCC corrected by CF-L), and GPCC-F (GPCC corrected by CF-F) were 62%, 64%, and 46% more than GPCC over northern Asia and Eurasia. The GRACE-based estimate (49% more than GPCC) was the closest to GPCC-F. We found that as near-surface air temperature decreased, the products increasingly underestimated the GRACE-based snowfall accumulation. Overall, GRACE showed that CFs are effective in improving GPCC estimates. Furthermore, our case studies and overall statistics suggest that CF-F is likely more effective than CF-L in most of the high-latitude regions studied here. GPCP showed generally better skill than GPCC-L, which might be related to the use of satellite data or additional quality controls on gauge inputs to GPCP. This study suggests that GPCP can be improved if it employs CF-L instead of CF-F to correct for gauge undercatch. However, this implementation requires further studies, region-specific analysis, and operational considerations.

Development of Thermal Kinetic Inductance Detectors Suitable for X-ray Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD)	JUL 17-21, 2017	Kurume, JAPAN			Thermal mode; Thermal kinetic inductance detectors; TKID; Microwave kinetic inductance detectors; MKIDs; Super-conductive microresonators; Superconducting film; Thin film; Micromachining; X-ray spectroscopy	MICRORESONATORS	We report on the development of thermal kinetic inductance detectors (TKIDs) suitable to perform X-ray spectroscopy measurements. The aim is to implement MKIDs sensors working in thermal quasi-equilibrium mode to detect X-ray photons as pure calorimeters. The thermal mode is a variation on the MKID classical way of operation that has generated interest in recent years. TKIDs can offer the MKIDs inherent multiplexibility in the frequency domain, a high spatial resolution comparable with CCDs, and an energy resolution theoretically limited only by thermodynamic fluctuations across the thermal weak links. Microresonators are built in Ti/TiN multilayer technology with the inductive part thermally coupled with a metal absorber on a suspended SiN membrane, to avoid escape of phonons from the film to the substrate. The mid-term goal is to optimize the single-pixel design in terms of superconducting critical temperatures, internal quality factors, kinetic inductance and spectral energy resolution. The final goal is to realize a demonstrator array for a next generation thousand pixels X-ray spectrometer. In this contribution, the status of the project after one year of developments is reported, with detailed reference to the microresonators design and simulations and to the fabrication process.

These two pairs of "in-band" and nearby "reference" radiances are combined into differential optical absorption spectroscopic (DOAS) ratios for both A- and B-bands, from which one can derive, in principle, both cloud top height (CTH) and cloud geometric thickness (CGT). However, Davis et al. show that under most circumstances, there is much redundancy between the two DOAS ratios and, in practice, only CTH can be reliably and accurately retrieved. Here, we derive a simplified analytical 1D RT model for the DOAS ratios to gain physical insights as well as quantify both the CTH retrieval bias from neglecting in-cloud absorption and the impact of measurement error on CTH and CGT retrievals. Using this alternative approach, we again show that only CTH can be inferred reliably when unavoidable measurement error is factored in. Finally, our new theoretical developments are related to a recently uncovered invariance property of the mean path cumulated by light in arbitrarily-shaped optical media of arbitrary opacity with arbitrary scattering properties, as long as it is conservative.

J	Nguyen, T; Cahoy, K; Marinan, A				Tam Nguyen; Cahoy, Kerri; Marinan, Anne			Attitude Determination for Small Satellites with Infrared Earth Horizon Sensors	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites	AUG 04-08, 2014	Logan, UT	AIAA, USU				Infrared Earth horizon sensors are capable of providing attitude knowledge for satellites in low Earth orbit by using thermopile measurements of the Earth's infrared emission to locate the Earth's horizon. Because some small satellites, such as CubeSats, have limited resources, a framework was developed that improves the attitude determination performance of an Earth horizon sensing system consisting of inexpensive thermopiles in static dual-mount configurations by leveraging mission geometry properties and improving sensor models. This paper presents an analytical approach to generate an estimate of the nadir vector in the satellite's body frame from Earth horizon sensor measurements. On-orbit telemetry data from the Microsized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS) during limb-crossing events were used to assess our model of sensor readings in response to Earth horizon detection. To quantify the expected attitude estimation performance of our method, a detailed simulation of a low-Earth-orbiting satellite was developed with Earth horizon sensors in similar configurations to the MicroMAS sensor system. Our attitude determination method returns an error of 0.16 degrees on average (root-mean-square error of 0.18 degrees) in nadir estimation under a periodic low-frequency attitude disturbance of 4 degrees. A sensitivity analysis was conducted, which takes mounting uncertainty and position error into account, resulting in an additional attitude error of 0.3 degrees for a mounting offset of 0.2 degrees and up to 0.13 degrees error for a 10-km position knowledge error.

But, usually, collecting in situ data is restricted in these areas because of their remote locations, vast area and dynamic conditions. Remote sensing provides a cost effective tool to investigate hydrological patterns and the seasonal trend of changes in wetlands. In this paper, Land-use/land-cover change during water inundation period of Hamun wetland was investigated in order to determine change trend during this period. Hamun wetland is an unsustainable ecosystem, and monitoring this wetland is essential for conservation goals. This trend is critical for decision makers in order to plan the conservational scheme in all unsustainable ecosystems. To reach this objective, the land-use/land-cover maps during inundation period of Hamun were produced using Landsat 8 time series images. The results of accuracy assessment showed the classification of water and vegetation have the highest accuracy (94% and 93%, respectively). And the accuracy of plants in the water classes was the lowest (water-veg=89.9%, veg-water 1=88.8%, veg-water 2=87.6%). This means the higher misclassification is in determining the vegetation in the water. Then, the changes in the land-cover classes in relation to wetland inundation were investigated. Results of land-use/land-cover change illustrate the regions that were suitable for water birds but lost their suitability when the wetland dried out. These areas are crucial for water bird's conservation. Satellite data determined these areas with acceptable accuracy.

Geographic and temporal variations in turbulent heat loss from lakes: A global analysis across 45 lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							SURFACE-ENERGY FLUXES; OBSERVATORY NETWORK GLEON; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; CENTRAL-EUROPEAN LAKE; GAS TRANSFER VELOCITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE PROFILES; WATER-TEMPERATURE; THERMAL-STABILITY; DIEL VARIABILITY	Heat fluxes at the lake surface play an integral part in determining the energy budget and thermal structure in lakes, including regulating how lakes respond to climate change. We explore patterns in turbulent heat fluxes, which vary across temporal and spatial scales, using in situ high-frequency monitoring data from 45 globally distributed lakes. Our analysis demonstrates that some of the lakes studied follow a marked seasonal cycle in their turbulent surface fluxes and that turbulent heat loss is highest in larger lakes and those situated at low latitude. The Bowen ratio, which is the ratio of mean sensible to mean latent heat fluxes, is smaller at low latitudes and, in turn, the relative contribution of evaporative to total turbulent heat loss increases toward the tropics. Latent heat transfer ranged from similar to 60% to > 90% of total turbulent heat loss in the examined lakes. The Bowen ratio ranged from 0.04 to 0.69 and correlated significantly with latitude. The relative contributions to total turbulent heat loss therefore differ among lakes, and these contributions are influenced greatly by lake location. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of lakes in the climate system, effects on the lake water balance, and temperature-dependent processes in lakes.	[Woolway, R.

DES Collaboration	Rapidly evolving transients in the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general	SHOCK BREAKOUT; IA SUPERNOVAE; EXPLOSIONS; EMISSION; KILONOVA; NOVAE; RATES; FIELD; WIND	We present the results of a search for rapidly evolving transients in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme. These events are characterized by fast light-curve evolution (rise to peak in less than or similar to 10 d and exponential decline in less than or similar to 30 d after peak). We discovered 72 events, including 37 transients with a spectroscopic redshift from host galaxy spectral features. The 37 events increase the total number of rapid optical transients by more than a factor of two. They are found at a wide range of redshifts (0.05 < z < 1.56) and peak brightnesses (-15.75 > M-g > -22.25). The multiband photometry is well fit by a blackbody up to few weeks after peak. The events appear to be hot (T approximate to 10 000-30 000 K) and large (R approximate to 10(14) -2 x 10(15) cm) at peak, and generally expand and cool in time, though some events show evidence for a receding photosphere with roughly constant temperature. Spectra taken around peak are dominated by a blue featureless continuum consistent with hot, optically thick ejecta. We compare our events with a previously suggested physical scenario involving shock breakout in an optically thick wind surrounding a core-collapse supernova, we conclude that current models for such a scenario might need an additional power source to describe the exponential decline. We find that these transients tend to favour star-forming host galaxies, which could be consistent with a core-collapse origin. However, more detailed modelling of the light curves is necessary to determine their physical origin.

The STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) 2016 follow-up campaign - I. Overview and classification of candidates selected by two techniques	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: statistical; catalogues	GRAVITATIONALLY LENSED QUASARS; SKY-SURVEY; MATTER SUBSTRUCTURE; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; TIME DELAYS; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; HE 0435-1223; ACS SURVEY; DISCOVERY; GALAXIES	The primary goals of the STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) collaboration are to measure the dark energy equation of state parameter and the free streaming length of dark matter. To this aim, STRIDES is discovering strongly lensed quasars in the imaging data of the Dark Energy Survey and following them up to measure time delays, high resolution imaging, and spectroscopy sufficient to construct accurate lens models. In this paper, we first present forecasts for STRIDES. Then, we describe the STRIDES classification scheme, and give an overview of the Fall 2016 follow-up campaign. We continue by detailing the results of two selection methods, the outlier selection technique and a morphological algorithm, and presenting lens models of a system that could possibly be a lensed quasar in an unusual configuration. We conclude with the summary statistics of the Fall 2016 campaign. Including searches presented in companion papers (Anguita et al.; Ostrovski et al.), STRIDES followed up 117 targets identifying 7 new strongly lensed systems, and 7 nearly identical quasars, which could be confirmed as lenses by the detection of the lens galaxy. 76 candidates were rejected and 27 remain otherwise inconclusive, for a success rate in the range of 6-35 per cent. This rate is comparable to that of previous searches like SDSS Quasar Lens Search even though the parent data set of STRIDES is purely photometric and our selection of candidates cannot rely on spectroscopic information.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: weak lensing shape catalogues	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; catalogues; surveys; cosmology: observations	COSMIC SHEAR; SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; NOISE BIAS; SKY SURVEY; CALIBRATION; CONSTRAINTS; SEXTRACTOR; GALAXIES; CAMERA	We present two galaxy shape catalogues from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data set, covering 1500 deg(2) with a median redshift of 0.59. The catalogues cover two main fields: Stripe 82, and an area overlapping the South Pole Telescope survey region. We describe our data analysis process and in particular our shape measurement using two independent shear measurement pipelines, METACALIBRATION and IM3SHAPE. The METACALIBRATION catalogue uses a Gaussian model with an innovative internal calibration scheme, and was applied to riz bands, yielding 34.8M objects. The IM3SHAPE catalogue uses amaximum-likelihood bulge/disc model calibrated using simulations, and was applied to r-band data, yielding 21.9M objects. Both catalogues pass a suite of null tests that demonstrate their fitness for use in weak lensing science. We estimate the 1 sigma uncertainties in multiplicative shear calibration to be 0.013 and 0.025 for the METACALIBRATION and IM3SHAPE catalogues, respectively.

DES Collaboration	BAO from angular clustering: optimization and mitigation of theoretical systematics	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRUM COVARIANCE-MATRIX; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; MICROWAVE BACKGROUND ANISOTROPIES; REDSHIFT-SPACE DISTORTIONS; MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; COSMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; DARK-MATTER; SCALE	We study the methodology and potential theoretical systematics of measuring baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) using the angular correlation functions in tomographic bins. We calibrate and optimize the pipeline for the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data set using 1800 mocks. We compare the BAO fitting results obtained with three estimators: the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), Profile Likelihood, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The fit results from the MLE arc the least biased and their derived la error bar are closest to the Gaussian distribution value after removing the extreme mocks with non-detected BAO signal. We show that incorrect assumptions in constructing the template, such as mismatches from the cosmology of the mocks or the underlying photo-z errors, can lead to BAO angular shifts. We find that MLE is the method that best traces this systematic biases, allowing to recover the true angular distance values. In a real survey analysis, it may happen that the final data sample properties are slightly different from those of the mock catalogue. We show that the effect on the mock covariance due to the sample differences can be corrected with the help of the Gaussian covariance matrix or more effectively using the eigenmode expansion of the mock covariance. In the eigenmode expansion, the eigenmodes are provided by some proxy covariance matrix. The eigenmode expansion is significantly less susceptible to statistical fluctuations relative to the direct measurements of the covariance matrix because of the number of free parameters is substantially reduced.

Dark Energy Survey South Pole Tele	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: A Precise H-0 Estimate from DES Y1, BAO, and D/H Data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmological parameters; cosmology: observations; distance scale	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; GALAXIES; SAMPLE	We combine Dark Energy Survey Year 1 clustering and weak lensing data with baryon acoustic oscillations and Big Bang nucleosynthesis experiments to constrain the Hubble constant. Assuming a flat Lambda CDM model with minimal neutrino mass (Sigma m(v), = 0.06 eV), we find H-0 = 67.4(-1.2)(+1.1) km s(-1) Mpc(-1) (68 per cent CL). This result is completely independent of Hubble constant measurements based on the distance ladder, cosmic microwave background anisotropies (both temperature and polarization), and strong lensing constraints. There are now five data sets that: (a) have no shared observational systematics; and (b) each constrains the Hubble constant with fractional uncertainty at the few-per cent level. We compare these five independent estimates, and find that, as a set, the differences between them are significant at the 2.5 sigma level (chi(2)/dof = 24/11, probability to exceed = 1.1 per cent). Having set the threshold for consistency at 30 sigma we combine all five data sets to arrive at H-0 = 69.3(-0.6)(+0.4) km s(-1) Mpc(-1).	[Abbott, T. M. C.; Smith, R. C.; Walker, A.

The CIRs, formed in the interface region between low- and high-speed solar wind streams with speeds of similar to 320-400 km s(-1) and similar to 580-640 km s(-1), respectively, are characterized by relative increases in solar wind proton density by factors of similar to 13-29, in proton temperature by similar to 7-29, and in magnetic field by similar to 1-4 with respect to the pre-CIR values. The CIR boundaries are well defined with interplanetary discontinuities. Out of 10 discontinuities, four are determined to be forward waves and five are reverse waves, propagating at similar to 5-92 per cent of the magnetosonic speed at angles of similar to 20 degrees-87 degrees relative to ambient magnetic field. Only one is identified to be a quasi-parallel forward shock with magnetosonic Mach number of similar to 1.48 and shock normal angle of similar to 41 degrees. The cometary ionosphere response was monitored by Rosetta from cometocentric distances of similar to 4-30 km. A quiet time plasma density map was developed by considering dependences on cometary latitude, longitude, and cometocentric distance of Rosetta observations before and after each of the CIR intervals. The CIRs lead to plasma density enhancements of similar to 500-1000 per cent with respect to the quiet time reference level. Ionospheric modelling shows that increased ionization rate due to enhanced ionizing (>12-200 eV) electron impact is the prime cause of the large cometary plasma density enhancements during the CIRs. Plausible origin mechanisms of the cometary ionizing electron enhancements are discussed.

DES Collaboration	DES Y1 Results: validating cosmological parameter estimation using simulated Dark Energy Surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						large-scale structure of Universe; cosmological parameters	COSMIC SHEAR; GALAXY; MATTER; ALIGNMENTS; LUMINOSITY; CHALLENGE; SKEWNESS; BARYONS; PHYSICS; PROBES	We use mock galaxy survey simulations designed to resemble the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) data to validate and inform cosmological parameter estimation. When similar analysis tools are applied to both simulations and real survey data, they provide powerful validation tests of the DES Y1 cosmological analyses presented in companion papers. We use two suites of galaxy simulations produced using different methods, which therefore provide independent tests of our cosmological parameter inference. The cosmological analysis we aim to validate is presented in DES Collaboration et al. (2017) and uses angular two-point correlation functions of galaxy number counts and weak lensing shear, as well as their cross-correlation, in multiple redshift bins. While our constraints depend on the specific set of simulated realisations available, for both suites of simulations we find that the input cosmology is consistent with the combined constraints from multiple simulated DES Y1 realizations in the Omega(m) - sigma(8) plane. For one of the suites, we are able to show with high confidence that any biases in the inferred S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) and Omega(m) are smaller than the DES Y1 1 - sigma uncertainties. For the other suite, for which we have fewer realizations, we are unable to be this conclusive; we infer a roughly 60 per cent (70 per cent) probability that systematic bias in the recovered Omega(m) (S-8) is sub-dominant to the DES Y1 uncertainty. As cosmological analyses of this kind become increasingly more precise, validation of parameter inference using survey simulations will be essential to demonstrate robustness.

The STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) 2016 follow-up campaign - II. New quasar lenses from double component fitting	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; techniques: image processing; surveys; quasars: general	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; CANDIDATE SELECTION; SPECTROSCOPY	We report upon the follow-up of 34 candidate lensed quasars found in the Dark Energy Survey using NTTEFOSC, Magellan-IMACS, KECK-ESI, and SOAR-SAMI. These candidates were selected by a combination of double component fitting, morphological assessment, and colour analysis. Most systems followed up are indeed composed of at least one quasar image and 13 with two or more quasar images: two lenses, four projected binaries, and seven nearly identical quasar pairs (NIQs). The two systems confirmed as genuine gravitationally lensed quasars are one quadruple at z(s) = 1.713 and one double at z(s) = 1.515. Lens modelling of these two systems reveals that both systems require very little contribution from the environment to reproduce the image configuration. Nevertheless, small flux anomalies can be observed in one of the images of the quad. Further observations of nine inconclusive systems (including seven NIQs) will allow to confirm (or not) their gravitational lens nature.

New L subdwarfs, Gaia astrometry, population properties, and a blue brown dwarf binary	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						binaries: spectroscopic; brown dwarfs; stars: chemically peculiar; stars: Population II; stars: subdwarfs	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; SPECTRAL TYPE-L; T-DWARFS; SPECTROSCOPIC CLASSIFICATION; PHOTOMETRIC SYSTEM; ULTRACOOL DWARFS; DISCOVERY; MOTION; SDSS	We present 27 new L subdwarfs and classify five of them as esdL and 22 as sdL. Our L subdwarf candidates were selected with the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Spectroscopic follow-up was carried out primarily with the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Some of these new objects were followed up with the X-shooter instrument on the Very Large Telescope. We studied the photometric properties of the population of known L subdwarfs using colour-spectral type diagrams and colour-colour diagrams, by comparison with L dwarfs and main sequence stars, and identified new colour spaces for L subdwarf selection/study in current and future surveys. We further discussed the brown dwarf transition-zone and the observational stellar/substellar boundary. We found that about one-third of 66 known L subdwarfs are substellar objects, with two-thirds being very low-mass stars. We also present the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, spectral type-absolute magnitude corrections, and tangential velocities of 20 known L subdwarfs observed by the Gaia astrometry satellite. One of our L subdwarf candidates, ULAS J233227.03+123452.0, is a mildly metal-poor spectroscopic binary brown dwarf: a similar to L6p dwarf and a similar to T4p dwarf. This binary is likely a thick disc member according to its kinematics.	[Zhang, Z. H.] Univ PSI, Observ Paris, GEPI, CNRS, 5 Pl Jules Janssen, F-92190 Meudon, France; [Zhang, Z.

Consequently, it is an integral part of the sea-ice and climate systems. However, the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of snow pose challenges for observing, understanding and modelling those systems under anthropogenic warming. Here, we survey the snow-ice system, then provide recommendations for overcoming present challenges. These include: collecting process-oriented observations for model diagnostics and understanding snow-ice feedbacks, and improving our remote sensing capabilities of snow for monitoring large-scale changes in snow on sea ice. These efforts could be achieved through stronger coordination between the observational, remote sensing and modelling communities, and would pay dividends through distinct improvements in predictions of polar environments.

Swirl mission concept: Unraveling the enigma	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Lunar swirls; Reiner Gamma Swirl; Magnetic anomalies; Mission concept	MAGNETIC-FIELD; FLIGHT CALIBRATION; AURORAL CURRENT; LUNAR SWIRLS; MESSENGER; MOON; MERCURY; ANOMALIES	During the Apollo era of lunar exploration, mysterious albedo patterns, called swirls, captured the imagination of the scientific community. A key aspect of this interest was due to the discovery that the swirls are associated with localized relatively strong remnant magnetic fields. Analysis of returned soil samples revealed that solar wind, galactic cosmic rays, and micrometeorite impacts change the albedo of surface soil grains, a process known as space weathering that reduces regolith reflectance over time. Thus it was natural to invoke local magnetic structures as shields that retard space weathering resulting in relatively less space weathering of the regolith in regions with the strongest localized magnetic fields. However, the origins of the magnetic anomalies and associated swirls remain enigmatic to this day. We designed the Swirl CubeSat to determine the nature of remnant lunar magnetic fields and investigate their role in moderating space weathering of the regolith and assess their suitability for radiation protection of surface assets. Swirl has one focused observational objective: characterize the magnetic field associated with the Reiner Gamma Swirl (RGS) at sub-kilometer spatial sampling, with 0.5 nTesla accuracy and 100 m spatial precision. In the Swirl mission concept, the Swirl spacecraft, a 6U CubeSat, would deploy as a secondary payload from a vehicle on a deep space trajectory. A series of maneuvers would then place the spacecraft in a low orbit that would then be modified to have a periapse of 5-10 km for thirty orbits passing over RGS. Prime Swirl observations were designed during these low-altitude passes and consist of high-resolution vector magnetic field measurements and monochrome navigation imaging.

However, the high-precision, timeseries observations required for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and prior experience with Hubble, Spitzer, and other facilities indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST becomes operational. In this paper, we describe the science objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle 1. We also describe the simulations used to establish the program. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet observations with JWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative data sets that will enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS Program will exercise the timeseries modes of all four JWST instruments that have been identified as the consensus highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target planets with host stars that span an illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this program were defined through an inclusive and transparent process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in transiting exoplanet studies. The targets have been vetted with previous measurements, will be observable early in the mission, and have exceptional scientific merit. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of planetary spectra, timeseries instrument performance reports, and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST mission.

However, time is of the essence to take full advantage of this opportunity. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), although delayed, will still complete its nominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification, confirmation, and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization targets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future dedicated missions for atmospheric studies such as the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) require the discovery and confirmation of several hundred additional sub-Jovian size planets (R-p < 10 R circle plus) orbiting bright stars, beyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of exoplanet atmospheres. Ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will also contribute to surveying the atmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set of two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected signal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given planet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be readily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our proposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid follow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based on the catalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al., we determine appropriate cutoff values of the metrics, such that the TESS mission will ultimately yield a sample of similar to 300 high-quality atmospheric characterization targets across a range of planet size bins, extending down to Earth-size, potentially habitable worlds.

NASA's New Horizons mission comprises an instrument package that provides imaging capability from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (near-IR) wavelengths with moderate spectral resolution located beyond the orbit of Pluto. A carefully designed survey with New Horizons can optimize the use of expendable propellant and the limited data telemetry bandwidth to allow several measurements, including a detailed understanding of the cosmic extragalactic background light; studies of the local and extragalactic UV background; measurements of the properties of dust and ice in the outer solar system; confirmation and characterization of transiting exoplanets; determinations of the mass of dark objects using gravitational microlensing; and rapid follow-up of transient events. New Horizons is currently in an extended mission designed to focused on Kuiper Belt science that will conclude in 2021. The astrophysics community has a unique, generational opportunity to use this mission for astronomical observation at heliocentric distances beyond 50 au in the next decade. In this paper, we discuss the potential science cases for such an extended mission, and provide an initial assessment of the most important operational requirements and observation strategies it would require. We conclude that New Horizons is capable of transformative science, and that it would make a valuable and unique asset for astrophysical science that is unlikely to be replicated in the near future.

We present a new algorithm for detecting changes in glacier elevation from these satellite altimetry data and evaluate its performance in the case of Novaya Zemlya by comparing the results with GRACE. We find that the mass loss of Novaya Zemlya glaciers increased from 10 +/- 5 Gt/year over 2003-2009 to 14 +/- 4 Gt/year over 2010-2016, with a brief period of near-zero mass balance between 2009 and 2011. The results are consistent across the gravimetric and altimetric methods. Furthermore, the analysis of elevation change from CryoSat-2 indicates that the mass loss occurs at elevation below 700 m, where the highest thinning rates are found. We also find that marine-terminating glaciers in Novaya Zemlya are thinning significantly faster than land-terminating glaciers, which indicates an important role of ice dynamics of marine-terminating glaciers. We posit that the glacier changes have been caused by changes in atmospheric and ocean temperatures. We find that the increase in mass loss after 2010 is associated with a warming in air temperatures, which increased the surface melt rates. There is not enough information on the ocean temperature at the front of the glaciers to conclude on the role of the ocean, but we posit that the temperature of subsurface ocean waters must have increased during the observation period.

The SMOS SSS maps presented in this work are an improved version of the preliminary three-year dataset generated and freely distributed by the Barcelona Expert Center. In this new version, a time-dependent bias correction has been applied to mitigate the seasonal bias that affected the previous SSS maps. An extensive database of in situ data (Argo floats and thermosalinograph measurements) has been used for assessing the accuracy of this product. The standard deviation of the difference between the new SMOS SSS maps and Argo SSS ranges from 0.25 and 0.35. The major features of the inter-annual SSS variations observed by the thermosalinographs are also captured by the SMOS SSS maps. However, the validation in some regions of the Arctic Ocean has not been feasible because of the lack of in situ data. In those regions, qualitative comparisons with SSS provided by models and the remotely sensed SSS provided by Aquarius and SMAP have been performed. Despite the differences between SMOS and SMAP, both datasets show consistent SSS variations with respect to the model and the river discharge in situ data, but present a larger dynamic range than that of the model. This result suggests that, in those regions, the use of the remotely sensed SSS may help to improve the models.

Here, guidelines to optimize the design of these instruments starting from the basic sensitivity equations are presented. Unlike conventional scatterometers or pencil-beam imagers, appropriate sampling of the Doppler spectrum and optimizing the radial velocity error lead naturally to a design that incorporates a pulse-to-pulse separation and pulse length that vary with scan angle. Including this variation can improve radial velocity performance significantly and the optimal selection of system timing and bandwidth is derived. Following this, optimization of the performance based on frequency, incidence angle, antenna length, and spatial sampling strategy are considered. It is shown that antenna length influences the performance most strongly, while the errors depend only on the square root of the transmit power. Finally, a set of example designs and associated performance are presented.

Overall, the freshening was found to be related to the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific Warm Anomaly. The primary goal was to determine the feasibility of using SMAP data to observe the surface salinity signal associated with the warming and its coastal impact. As a first step, direct comparisons were done with salinity from the CalCOFI data at one-meter depth. During 2015, SMAP was saltier than CalCOFI by 0.5 Practical Salinity Units (PSU), but biases were reduced to <0.1 PSU during 2016. South of 33 degrees N, and nearer to the coast where upwelling dominates, SMAP was fresher in 2015 by almost 0.2 PSU. CalCOFI showed freshening of 0.1 PSU. North of 33 degrees N, SMAP and CalCOFI saw significant freshening in 2016, SMAP by 0.4 PSU and CalCOFI by 0.2 PSU. Differences between SMAP and CalCOFI are consistent with the increased stratification in 2015 and changes in the mixed layer depth. SMAP observed freshening that reached the Baja California Coast.

A large impact crater beneath Hiawatha Glacier in northwest Greenland	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							EROSION BENEATH; ICE-SHEET; QUARTZ; CONSTRAINTS; ABUNDANCES; HISTORY; EARTH; BAY	We report the discovery of a large impact crater beneath Hiawatha Glacier in northwest Greenland. From airborne radar surveys, we identify a 31-kilometer-wide, circular bedrock depression beneath up to a kilometer of ice. This depression has an elevated rim that cross-cuts tributary subglacial channels and a subdued central uplift that appears to be actively eroding. From ground investigations of the deglaciated foreland, we identify overprinted structures within Precambrian bedrock along the ice margin that strike tangent to the subglacial rim. Glaciofluvial sediment from the largest river draining the crater contains shocked quartz and other impact-related grains. Geochemical analysis of this sediment indicates that the impactor was a fractionated iron asteroid, which must have been more than a kilometer wide to produce the identified crater. Radiostratigraphy of the ice in the crater shows that the Holocene ice is continuous and conformable, but all deeper and older ice appears to be debris rich or heavily disturbed. The age of this impact crater is presently unknown, but from our geological and geophysical evidence, we conclude that it is unlikely to predate the Pleistocene inception of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

This challenge is particularly acute at high latitudes where the effects of space weather are most direct and no reliable predictive capability exists. We take advantage of a large volume of data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, increasingly sophisticated tools for data-driven discovery, and a machine learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) to develop a novel predictive model for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation. This work, to our knowledge, represents the first time an SVM model has been created to predict high-latitude phase scintillation. We use the true skill score to evaluate the SVM model and to establish a benchmark for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation prediction. The SVM model significantly outperforms persistence (i.e., current and future scintillation are identical), doubling the predictive skill according to the true skill score for a 1-hr lead time. For a 3-hr lead time, persistence is comparable to a random chance prediction, suggesting that the memory of the ionosphere in terms of high-latitude plasma irregularities is on the order of, or shorter than, a few hours. The SVM model predictive skill only slightly decreases between the 1- and 3-hr predictive tasks, pointing to the potential of this method. Our findings can serve as a foundation on which to evaluate future predictive models, a critical development toward the resolution of space weather impact on transionospheric radio signals.

J	Jewell, AD; Hoenk, ME; Carver, AG; Nikzad, S				Jewell, April D.; Hoenk, Michael E.; Carver, Alexander G.; Nikzad, Shouleh			Low-temperature homoepitaxial growth of two-dimensional antimony superlattices in silicon	JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A			English	Article							MOLECULAR-BEAM EPITAXY; SB SURFACE SEGREGATION; QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; CARRIER MOBILITY; ADSORPTION; STABILITY; LAYER; FILMS; UV	The authors present a low-temperature process for the homoepitaxial growth of antimony superlattices in silicon. The all low-temperature superlattice doping process is compatible as a postfabrication step for device passivation. The authors have used low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy to embed atomically thin (2D), highly concentrated layers of dopant atoms within nanometers of the surface. This process allows for dopant densities on the order of 10(13)-10(14) cm(-2) (10(20)-10(21) cm(-3)); higher than can be achieved with three-dimensional doping techniques. This effort builds on prior work with n-type delta doping; the authors have optimized the growth processes to achieve delta layers with sharp dopant profiles. By transitioning from a standard effusion cell to a valved cracker cell for antimony evaporation, the authors have achieved carrier densities approaching 10(21) cm(-3) with peak distribution at similar to 10 angstrom FWHM for single delta layers. Even at the highest dopant concentrations studied, no deterioration in carrier mobility is observed, suggesting the upper limit for dopant incorporation and activation has not yet been met. The authors will discuss the details related to growth optimization and show results from in situ monitoring by electron diffraction. They will also report on elemental and electrical characterization of the films. Published by the AVS.

South Pole Telescope Collaboration	Maps of the Southern Millimeter-wave Sky from Combined 2500 deg(2) SPT-SZ and Planck Temperature Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						cosmology: observations; cosmic background radiation	HISTORY	We present three maps of the millimeter-wave sky created by combining data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Planck satellite. We use data from the SPT-SZ survey, a survey of 2540 deg(2) of the the sky with arcminute resolution in three bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, and the full-mission Planck temperature data in the 100, 143, and 217 GHz bands. A linear combination of the SPT-SZ and Planck data is computed in spherical harmonic space, with weights derived from the noise of both instruments. This weighting scheme results in Planck data providing most of the large-angular-scale information in the combined maps, with the smaller-scale information coming from SPT-SZ data. A number of tests have been done on the maps. We find their angular power spectra to agree very well with theoretically predicted spectra and previously published results.

MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Circumstellar matter; Stars: individual: zeta(2) Reticuli	CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK; ALIGNMENT	The presence of a debris disc around the Gyr-old solar-type star zeta(2) Reticuli was suggested by the Spitzer infrared excess detection. Follow-up observations with Herschel/PACS revealed a double-lobed feature that displayed asymmetries both in brightness and position. Therefore, the disc was thought to be edge-on and significantly eccentric. Here we present ALMA/ACA observations in Band 6 and 7 which unambiguously reveal that these lobes show no common proper motion with zeta(2) Reticuli. In these observations, no flux has been detected around zeta(2) Reticuli that exceeds the 3 sigma levels. We conclude that surface brightness upper limits of a debris disc around zeta(2) Reticuli are 5.7 mu Jy arcsec(-2) at 1.3 mm, and 26 mu Jy arcsec(-2) at 870 microns. Our results overall demonstrate the capability of the ALMA/ACA to follow-up Herschel observations of debris discs and clarify the effects of background confusion.

First astrometric reduction of Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem images using an automatic procedure: application to Enceladus images 2013-2017	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: observational; catalogues; astrometry; planets and satellites: individual: Enceladus	SATELLITES; SATURN	We provide new astrometric observations of Enceladus from images taken using the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) Narrow-Angle Camera. Astrometric reduction was performed using a new fully automatic camera repointing technique built within the CAVIAR software package. The new automatic procedure is based on the k-d tree technique and has been developed as an alternative to the manual technique currently available in CAVIAR. We describe the new procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness compared with manual processing. Repointing corrections were computed using reference stars from the UCAC4 and Gaia DR1 star catalogues. We compare the observed-minus-computed (O-C) residuals of Enceladus based on UCAC4 with those based on Gaia DR1, relative to the JPL SAT375 ephemeris and the IMCCE NOE ephemeris, respectively. We reduced all available Cassini ISS images of Enceladus during the period 2013-2017, producing a total of 1109 Cassini-centred astrometric observations. These are provided in right ascension (alpha) and declination (delta) in the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). Estimated mean O-C residuals relative to JPL's SAT375 ephemeris were 0.7 km in alpha xcos(delta) and 1.8 km in delta, with standard deviations of 2.4 and 3.2 km, respectively. No improvement in the precision of the observations was obtained when using the GAIA DR1 star catalogue compared with UCAC4.	[Zhang, Q. F.; Peng, Q. Y.; Xiong, Y.

We present the first simultaneous fast optical spectrophotometry and broad-band photometry of the system, obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Liverpool Telescope, respectively. The observations spanned 5.5 h, somewhat longer than the 4.5-h orbital period of the debris. Dividing the GTC spectrophotometry into five wavelength bands reveals no significant colour differences, confirming grey transits in the optical. We argue that absorption by an optically thick structure is a plausible alternative explanation for the achromatic nature of the transits that can allow the presence of small-sized (similar to mu m) particles. The longest (87 min) and deepest (50 per cent attenuation) transit recorded in our data exhibits a complex structure around minimum light that can be well modelled by multiple overlapping dust clouds. The strongest circumstellar absorption line, Fe II lambda 5169, significantly weakens during this transit, with its equivalent width reducing from a mean out-of-transit value of 2 to 1 angstrom in-transit, supporting spatial correlation between the circumstellar gas and dust. Finally, we made use of the Gaia Data Release 2 and archival photometry to determine the white dwarf parameters. Adopting a helium-dominated atmosphere containing traces of hydrogen and metals, and a reddening E(B - V) = 0.01 we find T-eff = 15 020 +/- 520 K, log g = 8.07 +/- 0.07, corresponding to M-WD = 0.63 +/- 0.05 M-circle dot and a cooling age of 224 +/- 30 Myr.

The most complete previous study of the 3v(2) and v(4)+v(2) bands achieved the accuracy of 0.0069 cm(-1) as reflected by the root-mean-square error of their fit, which is slightly more than 10 times the experimental accuracy. In the present study, we performed a global fit of the existing 2141 literature data involving 3v(2), v(4)+v(2), 3v(2)-v(2) , (v(4)+v(2))-v(2) together with 1281 new data involving 3v(2)-2v(2), 3v(2)-3v(2) and (v(4)+v(2) )-(v(4)+v(2) ) using an effective Hamiltonian together with the Pickett suite of program SPFIT/SPCAT. The new dataset consists of three spectra recorded at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. The effective Hamiltonian model proposed for 3v(2)/v(4)+v(2) has achieved experimental accuracy. This success combined with our previous success of the 2v(2)/v(4) analysis leads us to believe that the vibrational states higher than 3v(2)/v(2)+v(4) may be analyzed with effective Hamiltonians as well.

The physical processes responsible for this behaviour are still debated, but changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disc structure appear more likely than changes in obscuration. Here, we report on four epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar at a redshift of z = 0.378 whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines have faded, and then returned over the past approximate to 20 yr. The change in this quasar was initially identified in the infrared, and an archival spectrum from 2010 shows an intermediate phase of the transition during which the flux below rest frame approximate to 3400 angstrom has decreased by close to an order of magnitude. This combination is unique compared to previously published examples of changing-look quasars, and is best explained by dramatic changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disc. The optical continuum has been rising since mid-2016, leading to a prediction of a rise in hydrogen emission-line flux in the next year. Increases in the infrared flux are beginning to follow, delayed by a similar to 3 yr observed time-scale. If our model is confirmed, the physics of changing-look quasars are governed by processes at the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole, and the structure of the innermost disc. The easily identifiable and monitored changing-look quasars would then provide a new probe and laboratory of the nuclear central engine.

Photometric limits on the high resolution imaging of exoplanets using the solar gravity lens	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Exoplanets; Interstellar; Solar gravity lens; Corona		We present an analysis of high-resolution imaging of an exoplanet by a meter-class telescope positioned at a real image of the exoplanet created by the solar gravity lens. We assume an exoplanet viewed in full phase and a simple deconvolution method to correct for the intrinsic blur caused by aberrations in the solar gravity lens, and account for the foreground light of the solar corona. We derive equations for the measurement times required for the telescope to produce such a high-resolution image, and find that due to shot noise considerations these times are large compared to human lifespans. We also discuss how measurement times could potentially be significantly shorter for exoplanets with special orbital and rotational parameters.

NuSTAR observations of Mrk 766: distinguishing reflection from absorption	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; black hole physics; galaxies: individual: Mrk 766; galaxies: Seyfert	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; X-RAY REVERBERATION; SEYFERT 1 GALAXIES; BLACK-HOLE; XMM-NEWTON; COLD MATTER; SPECTRAL VARIABILITY; COMPTON REFLECTION; ASCA OBSERVATIONS; TIME DELAYS	We present two new NuSTAR observations of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mrk 766 and give constraints on the two scenarios previously proposed to explain its spectrum and that of other NLS ls: relativistic reflection and partial covering. The NuSTAR spectra show a strong hard (>15 keV) X-ray excess, while simultaneous soft X-ray coverage of one of the observations provided by XMM-Newton constrains the ionized absorption in the source. The pure reflection model requires a black hole of high spin (a > 0.92) viewed at a moderate inclination (i = 46(-4)(-1)degrees). The pure partial covering model requires extreme parameters: the cut-off of the primary continuum is very low (22(-5)(+7) keV) in one observation and the intrinsic X-ray emission must provide a large fraction (75 per cent) of the bolometric luminosity. Allowing a hybrid model with both partial covering and reflection provides more reasonable absorption parameters and relaxes the constraints on reflection parameters. The fractional variability reduces around the iron K band and at high energies including the Compton hump, suggesting that the reflected emission is less variable than the continuum.	[Buisson, D. J.

J	Hamers, AS; Cai, MX; Roa, J; Leigh, N				Hamers, Adrian S.; Cai, Maxwell X.; Roa, Javier; Leigh, Nathan			Stability of exomoons around the Kepler transiting circumbinary planets	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			Spanish	Article						gravitation; planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability; planet-star interactions	HIERARCHICAL QUADRUPLE SYSTEMS; STELLAR BINARIES; SOLAR-SYSTEM; STAR SYSTEMS; ORBITS; HABITABILITY; DYNAMICS; EVOLUTION; ASTEROIDS; ORIGIN	The Kepler mission has detected a number of transiting circumbinary planets (CBPs). Although currently not detected, exomoons could be orbiting some of these CBPs, and they might be suitable for harbouring life. A necessary condition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical stability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler CBPs using numerical N-body integrations. We determine regions of stability and obtain stability maps in the (a(m), i(pm) ) plane, where a(m) is the initial exolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i(pm) is the initial inclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the orbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i(pm), for most Kepler CBPs, the stability regions are well described by the location of the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of the moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the binary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and which is borne out by corresponding three-body integrations. For high inclinations, the evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons in dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering strong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct collisions. This suggests that there is a dearth of highly inclined exomoons around the Kepler CBPs, whereas coplanar exomoons are dynamically allowed.

The experiment had three frequency bands centered at 150, 250, and 410 GHz and was the first to use a kilopixel array of transition edge sensor bolometers aboard a balloon platform. We describe the design and characterization of the array and the readout system. From the lowest to highest frequency, the median measured detectors' average thermal conductances were 39, 53, and 63 pW/K, the medians of transition temperatures were 0.45, 0.48, and 0.47 K, and the medians of normal resistances were 1.9, 1.5, and 1.4 Omega; we also give the measured distributions. With the exception of the thermal conductance at 150 GHz, all measured values are within 30% of their design. We measure median low-loop-gain time constants tau(0) = 88, 46, and 57 ms. Two measurements of bolometer absorption efficiency gave results consistent within 10% and showing high (similar to 0.9) efficiency at 150 GHz and medium (similar to 0.35 and similar to 0.25) efficiency at the two higher bands. We measure a median total optical power absorbed of 3.6, 5.3, and 5.0 pW. EBEX pioneered the use of the digital version of the frequency domain multiplexing system. We multiplexed the bias and readout of 16 bolometers onto two wires. The median per-detector noise-equivalent temperatures are 400, 920, and 14,500 mu K-cmb root s. We compare these values to our preflight predictions and to a previous balloon payload. We discuss the sources of excess noise and the path for a future payload to make full use of the balloon environment.

EBEX was the first balloon-borne instrument to implement a kilopixel array of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometric detectors and the first CMB experiment to use the digital version of the frequency domain multiplexing system for readout of the TES array. The scan strategy relied on 40 s peak-to-peak constant-velocity azimuthal scans. We discuss the unique demands on the design and operation of the payload that resulted from these new technologies and the scan strategy. We describe the solutions implemented, including the development of a power system designed to provide a total of at least 2.3 kW, a cooling system to dissipate 590 W consumed by the detectors' readout system, software to manage and handle the data of the kilopixel array, and specialized attitude reconstruction software. We present flight performance data showing faultless management of the TES array, adequate powering and cooling of the readout electronics, and constraint of attitude reconstruction errors such that the spurious B-modes they induced were less than 10% of the CMB B-mode power spectrum with r = 0.05.

We describe the experiment's optical system, receiver, and polarimetric approach and report on their in-flight performance. EBEX had three frequency bands centered on 150, 250, and 410. GHz. To make efficient use of limited mass and space, we designed a 115 cm(2) sr high-throughput optical system that had two ambient temperature mirrors and four antireflection-coated polyethylene lenses per focal plane. All frequency bands shared the same optical train. Polarimetry was achieved with a continuously rotating achromatic half-wave plate (AHWP) that was levitated with a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB). This is the first use of an SMB in astrophysics. Rotation stability was 0.45% over a period of 10 hr, and angular position accuracy was 0 degrees.01. The measured modulation efficiency was above 90% for all bands. To our knowledge the 109% fractional bandwidth of the AHWP was the broadest implemented to date. The receiver, composed of one lens and the AHWP at a temperature of 4 K, the polarizing grid and other lenses at 1 K, and the two focal planes at 0.25 K, performed according to specifications, giving focal plane temperature stability with a fluctuation power spectrum that had a 1/f knee at 2 mHz. EBEX was the first balloon-borne instrument to implement technologies characteristic of modern CMB polarimeters, including high-throughput optical systems, and large arrays of transition edge sensor bolometric detectors with multiplexed readouts.

The forward-facing direction of the C17 field means follow-up can begin immediately now that the campaign has concluded and interesting targets have been identified. The C17 field has a large overlap with C6, so this latest campaign also offers an infrequent opportunity to study a large number of targets already observed in a previous K2 campaign. The timing of the C17 data release, shortly before science operations begin with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), also lets us exercise some of the tools and methods developed for identification and dissemination of planet candidates from TESS. We find excellent agreement between these results and those identified using only K2-based tools. Among our planet candidates are several planet candidates with sizes < 4 R-circle plus and orbiting stars with Kp less than or similar to 10 (indicating good RV targets of the sort TESS hopes to find) and a Jupiter-sized single-transit event around a star already hosting a 6 day planet candidate.

Evolved Climates and Observational Discriminants for the TRAPPIST-1 Planetary System	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: detection; planets and satellites: individual (TRAPPIST-1); planets and satellites: terrestrial planets	ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; ABSOLUTE OSCILLATOR-STRENGTHS; COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; EDDY DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; EARTH-LIKE EXOPLANETS; EJECTION CME ACTIVITY; LOW-MASS STARS; SULFURIC-ACID; M-DWARF; HABITABLE ZONES	The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system provides an unprecedented opportunity to study terrestrial exoplanet evolution with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and ground-based observatories. Since M dwarf planets likely. experience extreme volatile loss, the TRAPPIST-1 planets may have highly evolved, possibly uninhabitable atmospheres. We used a versatile, 1D terrestrial planet climate model with line-by-line radiative transfer and mixing length convection (VPL Climate) coupled to a terrestrial photochemistry model to simulate environmental states for the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We present. equilibrium climates with self-consistent atmospheric compositions and observational discriminants of postrunaway, desiccated, 10-100 bar O-2- and CO2-dominated atmospheres, including interior outgassing, as well as for water-rich compositions. Our simulations show a range of surface temperatures, most of which are not habitable, although an aqua planet TRAPPIST-1 e could maintain a temperate surface. given Earth-like geological outgassing and CO2. We find that a. desiccated TRAPPIST-1 h may produce habitable surface temperatures beyond the maximum greenhouse distance.. Potential observational discriminants for these atmospheres. in transmission and emission spectra are influenced by photochemical processes and aerosol formation and include collision-induced oxygen absorption (O-2-O-2), and O-3, CO, SO2, H2O, and CH4 absorption features,. with transit signals of up to 200 ppm. Our simulated transmission spectra are consistent with K2, Hubble Space Telescope, and Spitzer observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. For several terrestrial atmospheric compositions, we find that TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to produce aerosols. These results can inform JWST observation planning and data interpretation for the TRAPPIST-1 system and other Mdwarf terrestrial planets.

The MUSCLES Treasury Survey. V. FUV Flares on Active and Inactive M Dwarfs	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; stars: activity; stars: low-mass; ultraviolet: stars	LOW-MASS STARS; EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER; EARTH-LIKE EXOPLANETS; EJECTION CME ACTIVITY; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; IN HABITABLE ZONES; SOLAR-TYPE STARS; X-CLASS FLARES; AD LEONIS; PROXIMA CENTAURI	M dwarf stars are known for their vigorous flaring. This flaring could impact the climate of orbiting planets, making it important to characterize M dwarf flares at the short wavelengths that drive atmospheric chemistry and escape. We conducted a far-ultraviolet flare survey of six M dwarfs from the recent MUSCLES (Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems) observations, as well as four highly active M dwarfs with archival data. When comparing absolute flare energies, we found the active-M-star flares to be about 10x more energetic than inactive-M-star flares. However, when flare energies were normalized by the star's quiescent flux, the active and inactive samples exhibited identical flare distributions, with a power-law index of -0.76(-0.1)(+0.09) (cumulative distribution). The rate and distribution of flares are such that they could dominate the FUV energy budget of M dwarfs, assuming the same distribution holds to flares as energetic as those cataloged by Kepler and ground-based surveys. We used the observed events to create an idealized model flare with realistic spectral and temporal energy budgets to be used in photochemical simulations of exoplanet atmospheres. Applied to our own simulation of direct photolysis by photons alone (no particles), we find that the most energetic observed flares have little effect on an Earth-like atmosphere, photolyzing similar to 0.01% of the total O-3 column. The observations were too limited temporally (73 hr cumulative exposure) to catch rare, highly energetic flares. Those that the power-law fit predicts occur monthly would photolyze similar to 1% of the O-3 column and those it predicts occur yearly would photolyze the full O-3 column. Whether such energetic flares occur at the rate predicted is an open question.	[Loyd, R. O. Parke] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Loyd, R. O.

In such antennas, the modulated reactance is typically obtained by subwavelength patches printed on a dielectric substrate. As an alternative technology, we propose the use of a class of metal-only MTSs in the synthesis of the reactance tensor. The absence of dielectric is useful to withstand harsh environments in space applications. The proposed element consists of a metallic cylinder with elliptical cross section, placed on a ground plane and arranged in a square lattice with subwavelength unit cells. This structure is well suited for fabrication by metal additive manufacturing. We have applied the metal cylinders in the design of a right-handed circularly polarized antenna, with broadside pencil beam at Ka-band. The obtained performance has been verified by full-wave simulations. A prototype has been successfully manufactured and measured, showing a good performance.

In particular, the number of spacecraft and their time-varying orbital parameters determine what interferometric baselines are feasible for each target, which in turn drives the imaging capabilities of the constellation. The large combinatorics of dynamic constellation configuration and the numerous competing engineering concerns present a challenge that is not well addressed by labor-intensive manual mission design processes. This paper describes search-based optimization methods that direct mission design effort toward promising constellation geometries: those that achieve broad interferometric coverage but remain cost-effective and resilient to failures. Six families of automatic optimization algorithms with complementary search strategies were created to explore among explicit constellation configuration plans. Evaluation of each candidate constellation plan was accelerated by efficiently combining precomputed caches of orbital and interferometric data. Comparative results indicate that leveraging automated optimization for constellation mission design is practical and useful. Optimized constellations demonstrated target image reconstruction errors 10% better than a manually designed constellation and up to 35% better than random solutions.

Variability of Southern Ocean Transports	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Ocean; Dynamics; Mass fluxes; transport; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics; Ocean models	MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; ANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DRAKE PASSAGE; INDIAN-OCEAN; ANNULAR MODE; SEA-ICE; HEAT; REGRESSION; TRENDS	The Southern Ocean (SO) is capable of transporting vast amounts of salt, heat, and nutrients, which allows it to influence and regulate global climate. The variability of depth- and density-integrated volume transports in the SO is studied using the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), version 4, release 3 (1992-2015), ocean state estimate. The estimate has a net eastward transport of 150.6 +/- 5.5, 162.6 +/- 7.4, and 148.2 +/- 5.4 Sv (1 Sv 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) between the Atlantic-Indian, Indian-Pacific, and Pacific-Atlantic basins, respectively. The time-mean meridional volume transport across 30 degrees S in the Atlantic is estimated to be -1.4 +/- 0.6 Sv, -14.4 +/- 3.5 Sv in the Indian basin, and 15.5 +/- 4.1 Sv in the Pacific, where negative values are southward. Trends in net volume transport between the basins are statistically insignificant. Within the water column, however, the middle and lower branches of the meridional overturning circulation have trends of -0.289 and 0.248 Sv decade(-1) in the Atlantic basin. The Indian and Pacific basins have decreasing trends in their lower overturning cells. These results indicate increased overturning circulation within the lower branch in the South Atlantic and decreased lower branch circulation within the Indian and Pacific basins and have implications on the thermohaline-driven circulation. Using ECCO, we estimate a southward potential temperature transport of -176.2 degrees +/- 197.2 degrees C Sv and salinity transport of -1.71 +/- 22.4 psu Sv into the SO and indicate potential temperature transport is increasing by -15.0 degrees +/- 13.2 degrees C Sv decade(-1).

Other studies have concluded that the source region for the Centaurs and Jupiter family comets (JFCs) is the scattered disk. Still other studies have suggested dynamical links between Centaurs and JFCs. The overarching goal of this study is to build upon our previous work and, using data mining techniques derived from big data applications, explore a database of close planet/planetesimal approaches in order to both examine these claims and demonstrate how complicated the trajectories of planetesimals wending between the Jovian planets can be-as they are subjected to impulsive alterations by close planetary encounters and resonant effects. Our results show that Centaurs, JFCs, and scattered disk objects are not dynamically distinct populations, and the paths planetesimals take over their lifetimes can be extremely complex. An understanding of this complexity offers solutions to other outstanding questions about the current solar system architecture.

Radar sounders can take advantage of strong coherent scattering from Fresnel zones at nadir which grow with sensor altitude. The strength of the signal and the actual rate of power fall-off, however, depend heavily on the surface properties. We first use the radar equation to separate geometric versus scattering mechanisms driving R-2, R-3, or R-4 fall-off. The Fresnel zone for planetary surfaces, where body curvature has an effect, is derived and its implications discussed. We show the impact of Gaussian and fractal surface roughness on the exponent of power fall-off and the transition from coherent to incoherent scattering. This is done in simulation and analytically to derive coherence loss functions. Finally, we study the effect of incoherent area fraction within the Fresnel zone. These results are intended to he used in radar link budgets, performance metrics, and scientific interpretation of sounding data.

The TKID is a type of bolometer which uses the kinetic inductance of a superconducting resonator to measure the temperature of the thermally isolated bolometer island. We measure bolometer thermal conductance, time constant, and noise equivalent power. We also measure the quality factor of our resonators as the bath temperature varies to show they are limited by effects consistent with coupling to two-level systems.	[Steinbach, B. A.; Bock, J.

Development of Multi-chroic MKIDs for Next-Generation CMB Polarization Studies	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD)	JUL 17-21, 2017	Kurume, JAPAN			MKIDs; Multi-chroic; CMB; Polarization	MULTICHROIC POLARIMETER ARRAY; DESIGN	We report on the status of an ongoing effort to develop arrays of horn-coupled, polarization-sensitive microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) that are each sensitive to two spectral bands between 125 and 280GHz. These multi-chroic MKID arrays are tailored for next-generation, large-detector-count experiments that are being designed to simultaneously characterize the polarization properties of both the cosmic microwave background and Galactic dust emission. We present our device design and describe laboratory-based measurement results from two 23-element prototype arrays. From dark measurements of our first engineering array, we demonstrated a multiplexing factor of 92, showed the resonators respond to bath temperature changes as expected, and found that the fabrication yield was 100%. From our first optically loaded array, we found the MKIDs respond to millimeter-wave pulses; additional optical characterization measurements are ongoing. We end by discussing our plans for scaling up this technology to kilo-pixel arrays over the next 2years.	[Johnson, B. R.; Flanigan, D.; Abitbol, M.

Electron-Phonon Coupling in Ti/TiN MKIDs Multilayer Microresonator	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD)	JUL 17-21, 2017	Kurume, JAPAN			Microwave kinetic inductance detectors; Temperature sensors; Electron-phonon coupling	DETECTORS	Over the last few years, there has been a growing interest toward the use of superconducting microwave microresonators operated in quasi-thermal equilibrium mode, especially applied to single particle detection. Indeed, previous devices designed and tested by our group with X-ray sources in the keV range evidenced that several issues arise from the attempt of detection through athermal quasiparticles produced within direct strikes of X-rays in the superconductor material of the resonator. In order to prevent issues related to quasiparticles self-recombination and to avoid exchange of athermal phonons with the substrate, our group focused on the development of thermal superconducting microresonators. In this configuration, resonators composed of multilayer films of Ti/TiN sense the temperature of an absorbing material. To maximize the thermal response, low-critical-temperature films are preferable. By lowering the critical temperature, though, the maximum probing power bearable by the resonators decreases abruptly because of the weakening of the electron-phonon coupling. A proper compromise between the value of critical temperature (and hence sensitivity to energy deposition) and readout power bearable by the device has to be found in order to avoid signal-to-noise ratio degradation. In this contribution, we report the latest measurement of the electron-phonon coupling.

Thin-Film Thermal Conductivity Measurements Using Superconducting Nanowires	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD)	JUL 17-21, 2017	Kurume, JAPAN			Thermometry; Superconductor; Nanowire	HEAT	We present a simple experimental scheme for estimating the cryogenic thermal transport properties of thin films using superconducting nanowires. In a parallel array of nanowires, the heat from one nanowire in the normal state changes the local temperature around adjacent nanowires, reducing their switching current. Calibration of this change in switching current as a function of bath temperature provides an estimate of the temperature as a function of displacement from the heater. This provides a method of determining the contribution of substrate heat transport to the cooling time of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. Understanding this process is necessary for successful electrothermal modeling of superconducting nanowire systems.	[Allmaras, J.

SuperSpec, The On-Chip Spectrometer: Improved NEP and Antenna Performance	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD)	JUL 17-21, 2017	Kurume, JAPAN			Spectrometer; Kinetic inductance detectors; NEP; Bow tie; Antenna; mm-wave		SuperSpec is a new technology for mm and sub-mm spectroscopy. It is an on-chip spectrometer being developed for multi-object, moderate-resolution large bandwidth survey spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies for the 1 mm atmospheric window. This band accesses the CO ladder in the redshift range of SuperSpec employs a novel architecture in which detectors are coupled to a series of resonant filters along a single microwave feedline instead of using dispersive optics. This construction allows for the creation of a full spectrometer occupying only of silicon, a reduction in size of several orders of magnitude when compared to standard grating spectrometers. This small profile enables the production of future multi-beam spectroscopic instruments envisioned for the millimeter band to measure the redshifts of dusty galaxies efficiently. The SuperSpec collaboration is currently pushing toward the deployment of a SuperSpec demonstration instrument in fall of 2018. The progress with the latest SuperSpec prototype devices is presented; reporting increased responsivity via a reduced inductor volume and the incorporation of a new broadband antenna. A detector NEP of 3-is obtained, sufficient for background-limited observation on mountaintop sites. In addition, beam maps and efficiency measurements of a new wide-band dual bow-tie slot antenna are shown.

A UV resonance line echo from a shell around a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							LUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE; PAIR-INSTABILITY; LOW-RESOLUTION; ETA-CARINAE; TELESCOPE; EMISSION; SPECTROGRAPH; EXPLOSIONS; DIVERSITY	Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I) are a class of rare and energetic explosions that have been discovered in untargeted transient surveys in the past decade(1,2). The progenitor stars and the physical mechanism behind their large radiated energies (about 1O(51) erg or 1O(44) J) are both debated, with one class of models primarily requiring a large rotational energy(3,4) and the other requiring very massive progenitors that either convert kinetic energy into radiation through interaction with circumstellar material (CSM)(5-8 )or engender an explosion caused by pair-instability (loss of photon pressure due to particle-antiparticle production)(9,10). Observing the structure of the CSM around SLSN-I offers a powerful test of some scenarios, although direct observations are scarce(11,)(12). Here, we present a series of spectroscopic observations of the SLSN-I iPTF16eh, which reveal both absorption and time- and frequency-variable emission in the Mg n resonance doublet. We show that these observations are naturally explained as a resonance scattering light echo from a circumstellar shell. Modelling the evolution of the emission, we infer a shell radius of 0.1 pc and velocity of 3,300 km s(-1), implying that the shell was ejected three decades before the supernova explosion. These properties match theoretical predictions of shell ejections occurring because of pulsational pair-instability and imply that the progenitor had a helium core mass of about 50-55 M-circle dot, corresponding to an initial mass of about 115 M-circle dot.

J	James, T; Hu, RY				James, Tre'Shunda; Hu, Renyu			Photochemical Oxygen in Non-1-bar CO2 Atmospheres of Terrestrial Exoplanets	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrobiology; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets	LIFE DETECTION; PLANETS; SEARCH; EARTH	Atmospheric chemistry models have shown that molecular oxygen can build up in CO2-dominated atmospheres on potentially habitable exoplanets without input of life. Existing models typically assume a surface pressure of 1 bar. Here we present model scenarios of CO2-dominated atmospheres with the surface pressure ranging from 0.1 to 10 bars, while keeping the surface temperature at 288 K. We use a one-dimensional photochemistry model to calculate the abundance of O-2 and other key species, for outgassing rates ranging from a Venus-like volcanic activity up to 20 times Earth-like activity. The model maintains the redox balance of the atmosphere and the ocean, and includes the pressure dependency of outgassing on the surface pressure. Our calculations show that the surface pressure is a controlling parameter in the photochemical stability and oxygen buildup of CO2-dominated atmospheres. The mixing ratio of O-2 monotonically decreases as the surface pressure increases at very high outgassing rates, whereas it increases as the surface pressure increases at lower-than-Earth outgassing rates. Abiotic O-2 can only build up to the detectable level, defined as 10(-3) in volume mixing ratio, in 10-bar atmospheres with the Venus-like volcanic activity rate and the reduced outgassing rate of H-2 due to the high surface pressure. Our results support the search for biological activities and habitability via atmospheric O-2 on terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars.

The transition from atoms to molecules and, in particular, the formation of the H-2 molecule, is a key step in cosmic structure formation en route to stars. Quantifying H-2 formation in space is difficult, due to the confusion in the emission of atomic hydrogen (H I) and the lack of a H-2 signal from the cold ISM. Here we present the discovery of a rare, isolated dark cloud currently undergoing H-2 formation, as evidenced by a prominent "ring" of H I. self-absorption. Through a combined analysis of H I. narrow self-absorption, CO emission, dust emission, and extinction, we directly measured, for the first time, the [H I]/[H-2] abundance varying from 2% to 0.2%, within one region. These measured H I. abundances are orders of magnitude higher than usually assumed initial conditions for protoplanetary disk models. None of the fast cloud formation model could produce such low atomic hydrogen abundance. We derived a cloud formation timescale of similar to 6 x 10(6) years, consistent with the global Galactic star formation rate, and favoring the classical star formation picture over fast star formation models. Our measurements also help constrain the H-2 formation rate, under various ISM conditions.

In Situ Observations Connected to the Io Footprint Tail Aurora	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Io; Jupiter; aurora	WAVE CURRENT SYSTEM; ELECTRON-BEAMS; FLUX TUBE; JUPITER; MAGNETOSPHERE; ACCELERATION; ENVIRONMENT; GENERATION; WAKE	The Juno spacecraft crossed flux tubes connected to the Io footprint tail at low Jovian altitudes on multiple occasions. The transits covered longitudinal separations of approximately 10 degrees to 120 degrees along the footprint tail. Juno's suite of magnetospheric instruments acquired detailed measurements of the Io footprint tail. Juno observed planetward electron energy fluxes of similar to 70mW/m(2) near the Io footprint and similar to 10mW/m(2) farther down the tail, along with correlated, intense electric and magnetic wave signatures, which also decreased down the tail. All observed electron distributions were broad in energy, suggesting a dominantly broadband acceleration process, and did not show any broad inverted-V structure that would be indicative of acceleration by a quasi-static, discrete, parallel potential. Observed waves were primarily below the proton cyclotron frequency, yet identification of a definitive wave mode is elusive. Beyond 40 degrees down the footprint tail, Juno observed depleted upward loss cones, suggesting that the broadband acceleration occurred at distances beyond Juno's transit distance of 1.3 to 1.7R(J). For all transits, Juno observed fine structure on scales of approximately tens of kilometers and confirmed independently with electron and wave measurements that a bifurcated tail can intermittently exist. Plain Language Summary The Juno spacecraft crossed regions magnetically connected to auroral structures associated with Jupiter's moon Io on multiple occasions. The transits covered longitudinal separations of approximately 10 degrees to 120 degrees along Io's auroral tail. Juno's suite of instruments acquired detailed measurements of these auroral structures. Juno directly observed the electrons that sustain these auroral features before they crash into the atmosphere and generate the brilliant aurora. The flux of these electrons decreased as Juno transited the tail farther from Io's longitude. While there are two main explanations for Io's auroral signatures, the nature of the observed electrons in this work favors one mechanism over the other. When Juno was far from Io's longitude, the observations suggest that the spacecraft was below the point at which the electrons are accelerated into the atmosphere. For all transits, Juno observed fine structure on scales of approximately tens of kilometers and confirmed that a bifurcated tail can intermittently exist.	[Szalay, J.

OCO-2 is a NASA mission designed to measure atmospheric CO2 but one of the novel data products is SIF, retrieved using reductions in the optical depth of Fraunhofer lines in OCO-2's O-2 Aband, covering 757-775 nm at 0.042 nm spectral resolution. CFIS was specifically designed to retrieve SIF within the wavelength range of OCO-2, but extends further down to 737 nm, nearly maintaining the high spectral resolution of the OCO-2 instrument (0.07 vs. 0.042 nm). Here, we provide an overview of the instrument calibration and performance as well as the retrieval strategy based on non-linear weighted least-squares. To illustrate the retrieval performance using actual flight data, we focus on data acquired over agricultural fields in Mead, Nebraska from an unpressurized Twin Otter (DHC-6) aircraft at a flight altitude of 3000 m above ground level (AGL). Spectral residuals are consistent with expected detector noise, which enables us to compute realistic 1-alpha precision errors of 0.5-0.7 W/m(2)/sr/mu m for typical SIF retrievals, which can be reduced to < 0.2 W/m(2)/sr/mu m when individual data is gridded at 30 m spatial resolution. The 30 m resolution also enabled direct comparison with the Crop Data Layer from the National Agricultural Statistics Service as well as Landsat imagery (NDVI, EVI, T-sk(in)), taken just a day prior to the CFIS overflights. Results show consistently higher vegetation indices and SIF values over soy fields compared to corn, likely due to the respective phenological stage, which might already have affected chlorophyll content and canopy structure (August 15, 2016). While this work is intended to highlight the technical capabilities and performance of CFIS, the comparisons against Landsat and crop types provide insights into how CFIS can be used to study mechanisms related to photosynthesis at fine spatial scales, with the fidelity needed to obtain un-biased SIF retrievals void of atmospheric correction.

J	Bandyopadhyay, S; Chung, SJ				Bandyopadhyay, Saptarshi; Chung, Soon-Jo			Distributed Bayesian filtering using logarithmic opinion pool for dynamic sensor networks	AUTOMATICA			English	Article							CONSENSUS; AGREEMENT	The discrete-time Distributed Bayesian Filtering (DBF) algorithm is presented for the problem of tracking a target dynamic model using a time-varying network of heterogeneous sensing agents. In the DBF algorithm, the sensing agents combine their normalized likelihood functions in a distributed manner using the logarithmic opinion pool and the dynamic average consensus algorithm. We show that each agent's estimated likelihood function globally exponentially converges to an error ball centered on the joint likelihood function of the centralized multi-sensor Bayesian filtering algorithm. We rigorously characterize the convergence, stability, and robustness properties of the DBF algorithm. Moreover, we provide an explicit bound on the time step size of the DBE algorithm that depends on the time-scale of the target dynamics, the desired convergence error bound, and the modeling and communication error bounds. Furthermore, the DBF algorithm for linear-Gaussian models is cast into a modified form of the Kalman information filter. The performance and robust properties of the DBF algorithm are validated using numerical simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Line positions and intensities were retrieved by least squares curve-fitting procedures and analyzed using the effective Hamiltonian and the effective dipole moment expressed in terms of irreducible tensor operators adapted to spherical top molecules. An 80 K spectrum recorded in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, of enriched (CH4)-C-12 was used for low-J line positions. Another 80 K spectrum of enriched (CH4)-C-13 from JPL was used to discern the isotopic lines. A new measured linelist contains positions and intensities for 5819 features. Quantum assignments were made for more than 3400 transitions, which represent similar to 95% of the integrated line intensity observed in this region. All assigned 3445 line positions were fitted with RMS standard deviations of 0.0024 cm(-1). The sum of observed intensities between 5550 and 5695 cm(-1) fell within 2% of the predicted value from ab initio variational calculations reported in the TheoReTS database (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr; http://theorets.tsu.ru).

A Bayesian Framework for Exoplanet Direct Detection and Non-detection	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: high angular resolution; methods: statistical; planetary systems; planet-disk interactions; planets and satellites: detection	EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; UPPER LIMITS; MASS; SPECTROSCOPY; CONFIDENCE; STARS	Rigorously quantifying the information in high-contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e., contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: (1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and (2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.

Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we obtained down to one milliarcsecond precision on the astrometry of these planets. We assessed four-planet orbit models with different levels of constraints and found that assuming the planets are near 1:2:4:8 period commensurabilities, or are coplanar, does not worsen the fit. We added the prior that the planets must have been stable for the age of the system (40 Myr) by running orbit configurations from our posteriors through N-body simulations and varying the masses of the planets. We found that only assuming the planets are both coplanar and near 1:2:4:8 period commensurabilities produces dynamically stable orbits in large quantities. Our posterior of stable coplanar orbits tightly constrains the planets' orbits, and we discuss implications for the outermost planet b shaping the debris disk. A four-planet resonance lock is not necessary for stability up to now. However, planet pairs d and e, and c and d, are each likely locked in two-body resonances for stability if their component masses are above 6 M-Jup and 7 M-Jup, respectively. Combining the dynamical and luminosity constraints on the masses using hot-start evolutionary models and a system age of 42 +/- 5 Myr, we found the mass of planet b to be 5.8 +/- 0.5 M-Jup, and the masses of planets c, d, and e to be 7.2(-0.7)(+0.6) M-Jup each.

Moist convection: a key to tropical wave-moisture interaction in Indian monsoon intraseasonal oscillation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC-WATER-BUDGET; REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL; ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; SCHEMES; SIMULATION; PARAMETERIZATION; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE; RESOLUTION; NORTHWARD	Simulation of moist convective processes is critical for accurately representing the interaction among tropical wave activities, atmospheric water vapor transport, and clouds associated with the Indian monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO). In this study, we apply the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate Indian monsoon ISO with three different treatments of moist convective processes: (1) the Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ) adjustment cumulus scheme without explicit simulation of moist convective processes; (2) the New Simplified Arakawa-Schubert (NSAS) mass-flux scheme with simplified moist convective processes; and (3) explicit simulation of moist convective processes at convection permitting scale (Nest). Results show that the BMJ experiment is unable to properly reproduce the equatorial Rossby wave activities and the corresponding phase relationship between moisture advection and dynamical convergence during the ISO. These features associated with the ISO are approximately captured in the NSAS experiment. The simulation with resolved moist convective processes significantly improves the representation of the ISO evolution, and has good agreements with the observations. This study features the first attempt to investigate the Indian monsoon at convection permitting scale.

At the beginning of 2016, using TEXES (Texas Echelon cross-dispersed Echelle Spectrograph), mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), we obtained data cubes of Jupiter in the 1930-1943 cm(-1) spectral ranges (around 5 mu m), which probe the atmosphere in the 1-4 bar region, with a spectral resolution of approximate to 0.15 cm(-1) and an angular resolution of approximate to 1.4". This dataset is analysed by a code that combines a line-by-line radiative transfer model with a non-linear optimal estimation inversion method. The inversion retrieves the vertical abundance profiles of NH3 - which is the main contributor at these wavelengths - with a maximum sensitivity at approximate to 1-3 bar, as well as the cloud transmittance. This retrieval is performed on more than one thousand pixels of our data cubes, producing maps of the disk, where all the major belts are visible. We present our retrieved NH3 abundance maps which can be compared with the distribution observed by Juno's MWR (Bolton et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017) in the 2 bar region and discuss their significance for the understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics. We are able to show important latitudinal variations - such as in the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), where the NH3 abundance is observed to drop down to 60 ppmv at 2 bar - as well as longitudinal variability. In the zones, we find the NH3 abundance to increase with depth, from 100 +/- 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 +/- 30 ppmv at 3 bar. We also display the cloud transmittance-NH3 abundance relationship, and find different behaviour for the NEB, the other belts and the zones. Using a simple cloud model (Lacis and Hansen, 1974; Ackerman and Marley, 2001), we are able to fit this relationship, at least in the NEB, including either NH3-ice or NH4SH particles with sizes between 10 and 100 mu m.

Pluto's haze as a surface material	ICARUS			English	Article						Pluto; Pluto, surface; Pluto, atmosphere; Geological processes; Ices; Photochemistry	OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; SPUTNIK PLANITIA; BLADED TERRAIN; NITROGEN-ICE; ATMOSPHERE; CHARON; SUBLIMATION; PLASMA; TITAN; DUST	Pluto's atmospheric haze settles out rapidly compared with geological timescales. It needs to be accounted for as a surface material, distinct from Pluto's icy bedrock and from the volatile ices that migrate via sublimation and condensation on seasonal timescales. This paper explores how a steady supply of atmospheric haze might affect three distinct provinces on Pluto. We pose the question of why they each look so different from one another if the same haze material is settling out onto all of them. Cthulhu is a more ancient region with comparatively little present-day geological activity, where the haze appears to simply accumulate over time. Sputnik Planitia is a very active region where glacial convection, as well as sublimation and condensation rapidly refresh the surface, hiding recently deposited haze from view. Lowell Regio is a region of intermediate age featuring very distinct coloration from the rest of Pluto. Using a simple model haze particle as a colorant, we are not able to match the colors in both Lowell Regio and Cthulhu. To account for their distinct colors, we propose that after arrival at Pluto's surface, haze particles may be less inert than might be supposed from the low surface temperatures. They must either interact with local materials and environments to produce distinct products in different regions, or else the supply of haze must be non-uniform in time and/or location, such that different products are delivered to different places.

The ions are coupled to a photonic crystal resonator and show strong enhancement of the optical emission rate via the Purcell effect, resulting in near radiatively limited single photon emission. The measured high coupling cooperativity between a single photon and the ion allows for the observation of coherent optical Rabi oscillations. This could enable optically controlled spin qubits, quantum logic gates, and spin-photon interfaces for future quantum networks.

It has been discovered that natural and anthropogenic aerosols have a great influence on meteorological variables such as temperature, snow water equivalent, and precipitation, which in turn impact the reservoir inflow. Therefore, it is imperative for us to quantify the impact of aerosols on reservoir inflow and to incorporate the aerosol models into future reservoir inflow forecasting models. In this paper, a comprehensive framework was developed to quantify the impact of aerosols on reservoir inflow by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and a dynamic regression model. The statistical dynamic regression model produces forecasts for reservoir inflow based on the meteorological output variables from the WRF-Chem model. The case study was performed on the Florence Lake and Lake Thomas Alva Edison of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project in the San Joaquin Region. The simulation results show that the presence of aerosols results in a significant reduction of annual reservoir inflow by 4-14%. In the summer, aerosols reduce precipitation, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt that leads to a reduction in inflow by 11-26%. In the spring, aerosols increase temperature and snowmelt which leads to an increase in inflow by 0.6-2%. Aerosols significantly reduce the amount of inflow in the summer when the marginal value of water is extremely high and slightly increase the inflow in the spring when the run-off risk is high. In summary, the presence of aerosols is detrimental to the optimal utilization of hydroelectric power systems.

J	Vergados, P; Liu, G; Mannucci, AJ; Janches, D				Vergados, Panagiotis; Liu, Guiping; Mannucci, Anthony J.; Janches, Diego			Equatorial Intraseasonal Temperature Oscillations in the Lower Thermosphere From SABER	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							NONMIGRATING DIURNAL TIDES; PERIOD WAVES; KELVIN WAVES; MESOSPHERE; STRATOSPHERE; VARIABILITY; TIMED/SABER; EXCITATION; ATMOSPHERE; MECHANISM	We analyze the spatial-temporal variability of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) temperature at +/- 15N/S over 14 years, using measurements from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument. We report that during the Madden-Julian Oscillation season (November-April) the MLT region exhibits temperature variations with dominant periodicities at 40 and 60 days with amplitudes as large as 5.0 K. These intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) are expressed across all longitudes, having superimposed zonal wave-like structures that resemble waves 3 and 4 with amplitudes as large as 5.0 K. The cold and warm ISO phases are ubiquitous and repeatable from year to year over the 14-year satellite record. We show that the MLT ISO exhibits the characteristics of a propagating wave carrying the embedded zonal wave-like structures. At 20 km an ISO signal also exists with similar characteristics as the MLT ISO, suggesting a potential connection with the lower atmosphere. Plain Language Summary We find that the Earth's temperature in the low-latitude mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region appears to increase and decrease by 5.0 K every 60 days. This behavior is present in every year from 2002 until 2016, and it affects all longitudes. Such an event was not possible before to observe, due to a limited number of ground-based stations that monitor the Earth's MLT region. In our analysis, we used satellite observations from 2002 to 2016 that covered all longitudes. The instrument we used was the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER). Interestingly, superimposed within these intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs), the MLT region is noticed to also vary as a function of longitude. These variations represent waves that travel around the Earth's atmosphere increasing and decreasing the Earth's MLT region by 5.0 K. Interestingly, when such oscillations are present in the MLT region, the lower stratosphere presents similar variability at the same periodicities, which makes us to believe that there may be a potential influence of the lower to upper atmosphere. Our results provide a unique picture of the MLT's thermal structure as a function of longitude, which is important in model simulations of the dynamic structure of the MLT region.

Martian Eolian Dust Probed by ChemCam	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; INSTRUMENT SUITE; MARS; CALIBRATION; ROVER; VIKING; CONSTRAINTS; MINERALOGY; CHEMISTRY; TARGETS	The ubiquitous eolian dust on Mars plays important roles in the current sedimentary and atmospheric processes of the planet. The ChemCam instrument retrieves a consistent eolian dust composition at the submillimeter scale from every first laser shot on Mars targets. Its composition presents significant differences with the Aeolis Palus soils and the Bagnold dunes as it contains lower CaO and higher SiO2. The dust FeO and TiO2 contents are also higher, probably associated with nanophase oxide components. The dust spectra show the presence of volatile elements (S and Cl), and the hydrogen content is similar to Bagnold sands but lower than Aeolis Palus soils. Consequently, the dust may be a contributor to the amorphous component of soils, but differences in composition indicate that the two materials are not equivalent. Plain Language Summary Eolian dust on Mars is very fine dust that covers the entire surface of the planet, gives it its typical red hue, and is mobilized by wind. It plays a significant role in the current rock cycle of the planet and for the temperature of the atmosphere. ChemCam uses a series of pulsed laser shots to analyze the chemical composition of target materials. Each first laser shot by ChemCam gives the composition of the deposited dust. These measurements have been constant over the duration of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The dust is homogeneous at the millimeter scale (approximately the size of the ChemCam analysis spot). Compared to local soils and sands at Gale crater, the dust contains higher levels of iron and titanium, associated with volatile elements like hydrogen, sulfur, and chlorine. We infer from this difference that the dust does not entirely originate locally and may be part of a separate global cycle.

Infrared Characterization of Jupiter's Equatorial Disturbance Cycle	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC THERMAL EMISSION; GALILEO PROBE; HOT-SPOTS; CLOUD; WAVES; TEMPERATURES; RETRIEVALS; WAVELENGTH; AMMONIA; BELT	We use an infrared data set captured between 1984 and 2017 using several instruments and observatories to report five rare equatorial disturbances that completely altered the appearance of Jupiter's equatorial zone (EZ): the clearance of tropospheric clouds revealed a new 5- mu m-bright band encircling the planet at the equator, accompanied by large 5-mu m-bright filaments. Three events were observed in ground-based images in 1973, 1979, and 1992. We report and characterize for the first time the entire evolution of two new episodes of this unusual EZ state that presented their maximum 5-mu m-brightness in December 1999 and February 2007, coinciding with a brown coloration south of the equator and with large bluish filaments and white plumes in the northern EZ at visible wavelengths. We characterize their typical infrared-bright lifetimes of 12-18 months, with possible periodicities of 6-8 or 13-14 years. We predict that a full-scale equatorial disturbance could occur in 2019-2021. Plain Language Summary Jupiter's banded structure, white zones (cloud-covered regions) and brown belts (cloud-free regions), exhibits dramatic planetary-scale changes. In this paper, we report five rare events at Jupiter's equatorial zone that changed the appearance of this zone completely at the cloud forming region (1-4 bar), leaving a bright band at the equator, accompanied by narrow and bright filaments (festoons) at the northern equatorial zone. We use ground-based 5-mu m data, which reveal the thermal emission from 1 to 4 bar region (bellow the ammonia cloud), captured between June 1984 and August 2017 (almost three Jovian years) to report and characterize for the first time two new disturbances at Jupiter's equatorial zone that took place in 1999-2000 and 2006-2007. We found that changes in the cloud morphology at the equatorial zone during these disturbances occurred first at the cloud tops (similar to 700 mbar), months before they were observed at the cloud forming region at 1-4 bar. We also found that these disturbances are confined at the cloud deck (similar to 150 mbar to 4 bar), lasting 12-18 months. After analyzing five documented equatorial zone disturbances, we conclude that these events are periodic/stochastic with typical intervals of 6-8 or 13-14 years. We predict a new disturbance in 2019-2021, during Juno's exploration epoch.	[Antunano, Arrate; Fletcher, Leigh N.; Melin, Henrik; Donnelly, Padraig T.; Rowe-Gurney, Naomi; Blake, James S.

Between 1978 and 1982, the speed of Storstrommen peaked at 3 km/year during an active surge phase that lasted 10 years and the glacier has stayed in a quiescent phase since. Bistrup started to surge in 1988, peaked in 1993, and stopped in 1996. Both glaciers displayed a slow surge initiation and termination. Since 1993, ice builds up in the upper part of Storstrommen at a 1 m/year, its lower part is thinning at its ablation rate of 1.4 m/year, and the grounding line has retreated by 10 km between 1992 and 2017, or 400 m/year. At these current rates, we project that Storstrommen will meet presurge conditions in 2027-2030. Plain Language Summary Storstrommen and L. Bistrup Brae in east Greenland probably are the largest surge-type glaciers in the world. Based on the history of frontal positions, it was suggested a surge periodicity on the order of 70 years. In this study, we use a multisensor approach combining historical data sets with the modern remote sensing techniques to reassess the surge history of Storstrommen and document the unknown behavior of L. Bistrup Brae. We found that, between 1978 and 1982, the speed of Storstrommen peaked at more than 3 km/year during an active surge phase that lasted 10 years and the glacier has stayed in a quiescent phase since. L. Bistrup Brae started to surge in 1988, peaked in 1993, and stopped in 1996. Since 1993, ice builds up in upper part of Storstrommen at a 1 m/year, its lower part is thinning at its ablation rate of 1.4 m/year, and the grounding line has retreated by 10 km between 1992 and 2017. At these current rates of mass accumulation upstream and retreat downstream, we project that Storstrommen will meet presurge conditions in 2027-2030.	[Mouginot, J.; Bjork, A.

However, the nature of the relationship between the ASL and sea ice is complicated by large seasonality in the ice cover and the ASL location and depth. Here we explore these relationships as a function of region, season, and lag. We find that the ASL can have a markedly different and sometimes opposite sign influence on sea ice in some regions, such as the western Ross Sea, depending on the season. This is in part due to differing influences of ASL-related meridional and zonal winds for ice transport in different times of year. The sea ice response to ASL variations is often largest at a lag of some months and can persist for up to 8 months. Plain Language Summary The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is a dominant feature of the atmospheric circulation in the Southern Ocean. Variations in this low pressure center influence winds over the Antarctic sea ice that can cause anomalies in sea ice transport and ice concentration. However, because the location of the low and the sea ice cover differ seasonally, the influence of ASL variability on sea ice differs by region and season. Additionally, the sea ice can exhibit a lagged response to the ASL, resulting in sea ice anomalies many months following variations in the ASL.

Satellite Detection of Water Stress Effects on Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux With MODIS Shortwave Infrared Reflectance Data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							LIGHT USE EFFICIENCY; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE; LAND-SURFACE EVAPORATION; SOUTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; SOIL-MOISTURE; EDDY-COVARIANCE; IN-SITU; VEGETATION INDEX; TRAPEZOID MODEL	The MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides spatially contiguous measurements of terrestrial biophysical variables, which can be used to estimate the terrestrial latent heat flux (LE). MODIS-derived shortwave infrared reflectance (SWIR) metrics (SWIRs) are sensitive to the soil moisture and vegetation water stress. In this study, we used the MODIS-derived SWIRs with eddy covariance flux measurements obtained from 25 flux tower sites representing 10 different land cover types within China to evaluate the sensitivity of SWIRs to ground-measured evaporation fraction and LE. The water constraint metrics determined using the MODIS-derived SWIR generally corresponded better with the ground-measured evaporation fraction values than those obtained without using SWIR. The MODIS-derived SWIRs were used as proxies for the soil and vegetation water supply constraints in a revised Priestley-Taylor algorithm to estimate the terrestrial LE. The estimated LE using the MODIS-derived SWIRs generally corresponded well with the ground-measured LE (0.56 <= R-2 <= 0.97) for most of the flux tower sites. Regional algorithm sensitivity analysis using the MODIS-derived SWIRs as water supply proxies demonstrated that water limitations reduce LE by more than 53% over China, and the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity are not sufficient to characterize both the atmosphere demand and water supply for LE estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of using MODIS-derived SWIRs to characterize soil and vegetation water supply factors for determining LE, where the relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions (500 m and daily) are closer to the scale of the eddy covariance ground measurements.

Temperature Trends and Anomalies in Modern Satellite Data: Infrared Sounding and GPS Radio Occultation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							CHAMP; ATMOSPHERE; ASSIMILATION; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; MISSION; SPACE; AIRS	Trends in monthly average, zonal average temperature in the stratosphere as retrieved from highly accurate modern satellite data are intercompared and compared with climate reanalyses from 2003 through 2014. The data sets used are those of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation, and the reanalyses are those of MERRA and ERA-Interim. Trends produced by all data sets agree to within 0.02 K/year in the lower stratosphere and 0.05 K/year in the middle stratosphere. A number of retrieval errors are found that introduce incorrect trends and seasonal anomalies. Adding microwave data to the infrared retrieval changes trends by approximately 0.01 K/year, thus improving agreement with the other data sets. The signature of the quasi-biennial oscillation in temperature and the annual cycle of temperature over Antarctica as retrieved from infrared data contain null-space errors of more than 3 K due to erroneous priors used in retrieval. Nonuniformity in GPS radio occultation gives rise to errors because changes in received GPS signal strength alter the upper boundary initialization in radio occultation retrieval. Finally, an incorrect specification of atmospheric water vapor introduces an erroneous seasonal cycle of temperature as retrieved from GPS radio occultation data in the upper troposphere. All of these time-dependent retrieval errors can be corrected with future research and improvements to spectral infrared and GPS radio occultation retrieval systems.	[Leroy, S.

Demonstration of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering Using Hybrid Continuous- and Discrete-Variable Entanglement of Light	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							QUANTUM; QUBITS	Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is known to be a key resource for one-sided device-independent quantum information protocols. Here we demonstrate steering using hybrid entanglement between continuous- and discrete-variable optical qubits. To this end, we report on suitable steering inequalities and detail the implementation and requirements for this demonstration. Steering is experimentally certified by observing a violation by more than 5 standard deviations. Our results illustrate the potential of optical hybrid entanglement for applications in heterogeneous quantum networks that would interconnect disparate physical platforms and encodings.

OH absorption in the first quadrant of the Milky Way as seen by THOR	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; surveys; molecular data; radio lines: ISM; ISM: abundances; instrumentation: interferometers	H II REGIONS; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; STAR-FORMATION; GROUND-STATE; DARK GAS; INTERSTELLAR; EMISSION; DUST; TRANSITIONS; CHEMISTRY	Context. The hydroxyl radical (OH) is present in the diffuse molecular and partially atomic phases of the interstellar medium (ISM), but its abundance relative to hydrogen is not clear. Aims. We aim to evaluate the abundance of OH with respect to molecular hydrogen using OH absorption against cm-continuum sources over the first Galactic quadrant. Methods. This OH study is part of the HI/OH/Recombination line survey of the inner Milky Way (THOR). THOR is a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) large program of atomic, molecular and ionized gas in the range 15 degrees <= l <= 67 degrees and vertical bar b vertical bar <= 1 degrees. It is the highest-resolution unbiased OH absorption survey to date towards this region. We combine the optical depths derived from these observations with literature (CO)-C-13(1-0) and HI observations to determine the OH abundance. Results. We detect absorption in the 1665 and 1667 MHz transitions, that is, the "main" hyperfine structure lines, for continuum sources stronger than F-cont >= 0.1 Jy beam(-1). OH absorption is found against approximately 15% of these continuum sources with increasing fractions for stronger sources. Most of the absorption occurs in molecular clouds that are associated with Galactic H II regions. We find OH and (CO)-C-13 gas to have similar kinematic properties. The data indicate that the OH abundance decreases with increasing hydrogen column density. The derived OH abundance with respect to the total hydrogen nuclei column density (atomic and molecular phase) is in agreement with a constant abundance for AV < 10 - 20. Towards the lowest column densities, we find sources that exhibit OH absorption but no (CO)-C-13 emission, indicating that OH is a well suited tracer of the low column density molecular gas. We also present spatially resolved OH absorption towards the prominent extended H II-region W43. Conclusions. The unbiased nature of the THOR survey opens a new window onto the gas properties of the interstellar medium. The characterization of the OH abundance over a large range of hydrogen gas column densities contributes to the understanding of OH as a molecular gas tracer and provides a starting point for future investigations.

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: (89) Julia; methods: observational; techniques: high angular resolution; methods: numerical	SPH/N-BODY SIMULATIONS; ASTEROID 2867 STEINS; COLLISIONAL HISTORY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; ROSETTA MISSION; NEARS FLYBY; SHAPE MODEL; 21 LUTETIA; 4 VESTA	Context. The vast majority of the geophysical and geological constraints (e.g., internal structure, cratering history) for main-belt asteroids have so far been obtained via dedicated interplanetary missions (e.g., ESA Rosetta, NASA Dawn). The high angular resolution of SPHERE/ZIMPOL, the new-generation visible adaptive-optics camera at ESO VLT, implies that these science objectives can now be investigated from the ground for a large fraction of D >= 100 km main-belt asteroids. The sharp images acquired by this instrument can be used to accurately constrain the shape and thus volume of these bodies (hence density when combined with mass estimates) and to characterize the distribution and topography of D >= 30 km craters across their surfaces. Aims. Here, via several complementary approaches, we evaluated the recently proposed hypothesis that the S-type asteroid (89) Julia is the parent body of a small compact asteroid family that formed via a cratering collisional event. Methods. We observed (89) Julia with VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL throughout its rotation, derived its 3D shape, and performed a reconnaissance and characterization of the largest craters. We also performed numerical simulations to first confirm the existence of the Julia family and to determine its age and the size of the impact crater at its origin. Finally, we utilized the images/3D shape in an attempt to identify the origin location of the small collisional family. Results. On the one hand, our VLT/SPHERE observations reveal the presence of a large crater (D similar to 75 km) in Julia's southern hemisphere. On the other hand, our numerical simulations suggest that (89) Julia was impacted 30-120 Myrs ago by a D similar to 8 km asteroid, thereby creating a D >= 60 km impact crater at the surface of Julia. Given the small size of the impactor, the obliquity of Julia and the particular orientation of the family in the (a,i) space, the imaged impact crater is likely to be the origin of the family. Conclusions. New doors into ground-based asteroid exploration, namely, geophysics and geology, are being opened thanks to the unique capabilities of VLT/SPHERE. Also, the present work may represent the beginning of a new era of asteroid-family studies. In the fields of geophysics, geology, and asteroid family studies, the future will only get brighter with the forthcoming arrival of 30-40 m class telescopes like ELT, TMT, and GMT.

Sensitivity limits of millimeter-wave photonic radiometers based on efficient electro-optic upconverters	OPTICA			English	Article							WHISPERING-GALLERY MODES; LITHIUM-NIOBATE; UP-CONVERSION; RESONATOR; MODULATOR; MICROWAVE	Conventional ultra-high sensitivity detectors in the millimeter-wave range are usually cooled as their own thermal noise at room temperature would mask the weak received radiation. The need for cryogenic systems increases the cost and complexity of the instruments, hindering the development of, among others, airborne and space applications. In this work, the nonlinear parametric upconversion of millimeter-wave radiation to the optical domain inside high-quality (Q) lithium niobate whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators is proposed for ultra-low noise detection. We experimentally demonstrate coherent upconversion of millimeter-wave signals to a 1550 nm telecom carrier, with a photon conversion efficiency surpassing the state-of-the-art by 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a theoretical model shows that the thermal equilibrium of counterpropagating WGMs is broken by overcoupling the millimeter-wave WGM, effectively cooling the upconverted mode and allowing ultra-low noise detection. By theoretically estimating the sensitivity of a correlation radiometer based on the presented scheme, it is found that room-temperature radiometers with better sensitivity than state-of-the-art high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)-based radiometers can be designed. This detection paradigm can be used to develop room-temperature instrumentation for radio astronomy, earth observation, planetary missions, and imaging systems.

We study the magnetar's radio profile shape, flux density, radio spectrum, and single pulse behavior over a similar to 1. year period between MJDs 57233 and 57621. In particular, the magnetar exhibits a significantly negative average spectral index of 'alpha' = -1.86 +/- 0.02 when the 8.4 GHz profile is single-peaked, which flattens considerably when the profile is double-peaked. We have carried out an analysis of single pulses at 8.4 GHz on MJD 57479 and find that giant pulses and pulses with multiple emission components are emitted during a significant number of rotations. The resulting single pulse flux density distribution is incompatible with a log-normal distribution. The typical pulse width of the components is similar to 1.8 ms, and the prevailing delay time between successive components is similar to 7.7 ms. Many of the single pulse emission components show significant frequency structure over bandwidths of similar to 100 MHz, which we believe is the first observation of such behavior from a radio magnetar. We report a characteristic single pulse broadening timescale of 'tau(d)' = 6.9 +/- 0.2 ms at 8.4 GHz. We find that the pulse broadening is highly variable between emission components and cannot be explained by a thin scattering screen at distances greater than or similar to 1 kpc. We discuss possible intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for the magnetar's emission and compare our results to other magnetars, high magnetic field pulsars, and fast radio bursts.

Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of Five Bright Seyfert 1 Galaxies	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BROAD-LINE REGION; BLACK-HOLE MASS; AGN MONITORING PROJECT; RADIUS-LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIP; EMISSION-LINES; DELAY MAPS; VARIABILITY; SPECTRUM; CONTINUUM	We present the first results from a reverberation-mapping campaign undertaken during the first half of 2012, with additional data on one active galactic nucleus (AGN) (NGC 3227) from a 2014 campaign. Our main goals are (1) to determine the black hole masses from continuum-H beta reverberation signatures, and (2) to look for velocity-dependent time delays that might be indicators of the gross kinematics of the broad-line region. We successfully measure H beta time delays and black hole masses for five AGNs, four of which have previous reverberation mass measurements. The values measured here are in agreement with earlier estimates, though there is some intrinsic scatter beyond the formal measurement errors. We observe velocity-dependent H beta lags in each case, and find that the patterns have changed in the intervening five years for three AGNs that were also observed in 2007.

We have detected HC3N including its C-13 and D isotopologues, CH3OH, CH3CCH, and several complex organic molecules. Using our previous results for HC5N in these sources, we compare their N(HC5N)/N(CH3OH) ratios. The ratio in G28.28-0.36 is derived to be 0.091(-0.039)(+0.109) which is higher than that in G12.89+0.49 by one order of magnitude, and higher than in G16.86-2.16 by a factor of similar to 5. We investigate the relationship between the N(HC5N)/N(CH3OH) and the N(CH3CCH)/N(CH3OH) ratios. The relationships of the two column density ratios in G28.28-0.36 and G16.86-2.16 are similar to each other, while HC5N is less abundant compared to CH3CCH in G12.89+0.49. These results imply a chemical diversity in the lukewarm (T similar to 20-30K) envelope around MYSOs. In addition, several spectral lines from complex organic molecules, including very-high-excitation energy lines, have been detected toward G12.89+0.49, while the line density is significantly low in G28.28-0.36. These results suggest that organic-poor MYSOs are surrounded by a carbon-chain-rich lukewarm envelope (G28.28 -0.36), while organic-rich MYSOs, namely hot cores, are surrounded by a CH3OH-rich lukewarm envelope (G12.89+0.49 and G16.86-2.16).

The reaction of hydroxyl and methylperoxy radicals is not a major source of atmospheric methanol	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							INTERMEDIATES CRI MECHANISM; OH RADICALS; PEROXY-RADICALS; GLOBAL CHEMISTRY; TRANSPORT MODEL; CH3O2 RADICALS; CROSS-SECTIONS; RATE-CONSTANT; KINETICS; YIELDS	Methanol is a benchmark for understanding tropospheric oxidation, but is underpredicted by up to 100% in atmospheric models. Recent work has suggested this discrepancy can be reconciled by the rapid reaction of hydroxyl and methylperoxy radicals with a methanol branching fraction of 30%. However, for fractions below 15%, methanol underprediction is exacerbated. Theoretical investigations of this reaction are challenging because of inter-system crossing between singlet and triplet surfaces - similar to 45% of reaction products are obtained via intersystem crossing of a pre-product complex - which demands experimental determinations of product branching. Here we report direct measurements of methanol from this reaction. A branching fraction below 15% is established, consequently highlighting a large gap in the understanding of global methanol sources. These results support the recent high-level theoretical work and substantially reduce its uncertainties.

Retreat and acceleration of outlet glaciers coincides with atmospheric and oceanic warming resulting in a significant contribution to sea-level rise. The relative role of surface meltwater production, runoff and infiltration on the dynamics of these systems is not well-understood. To assess how surface meltwater impacts shear margin dynamics and regional ice flow of outlet glaciers, we investigate the impact of basal lubrication of Jakobshavn Isbr ae shear margins due to drainage from water-filled crevasses. We map the areal extent of inundated crevasses during summer (May-August) from 2000 to 2012 using satellite imagery and determined an increasing trend in the total areal extent over this time interval. We use a numerical ice flow model to quantify the potential impact of weakened shear margins due to surface melt derived basal lubrication on regional flow velocities. Ice flow velocities 10 km from the lateral margins of Jakobshavn were amplified by as much as 20%, resulting in an increase of similar to 0.6 Gt yr(-1) in ice-mass discharge through the shear margins into the ice stream. Under future warming scenarios with increased surface melt ponding, simulations indicate up to a 30% increase in extra-marginal ice flow. We conclude that surface meltwater will likely play an important role in the evolving dynamics of glacier shear margins and the future mass flux through Greenland's major marine-terminating outlet glaciers.

J	Taylor, SR; Gerosa, D				Taylor, Stephen R.; Gerosa, Davide			Mining gravitational-wave catalogs to understand binary stellar evolution: A new hierarchical Bayesian framework	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MASS-SPECTRUM; NATAL KICKS; SPIN; STARS; RADIATION; INFERENCE; MODEL	Catalogs of stellar-mass compact binary systems detected by ground-based gravitational-wave instruments (such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo) will offer insights into the demographics of progenitor systems and the physics guiding stellar evolution. Existing techniques approach this through phenomenological modeling, discrete model selection, or model mixtures. Instead, we explore a novel technique that mines gravitational-wave catalogs to directly infer posterior probability distributions of the hyperparameters describing formation and evolutionary scenarios (e.g., progenitor metallicity, kick parameters, and common-envelope efficiency). We use a bank of compact-binary population-synthesis simulations to train a Gaussian-process emulator that acts as a prior on observed parameter distributions (e.g., chirp mass, redshift, rate). This emulator slots into a hierarchical population inference framework to extract the underlying astrophysical origins of systems detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Our method is fast, easily expanded with additional simulations, and can be adapted for training on arbitrary population-synthesis codes, as well as different detectors like LISA.

Observation of an Unusual Upward-Going Cosmic-Ray-like Event in the Third Flight of ANITA	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							ENERGY; EMISSION; SHOWERS; AIR	We report on an upward traveling, radio-detected cosmic-ray-like impulsive event with characteristics closely matching an extensive air shower. This event, observed in the third flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), a NASA-sponsored long-duration balloon payload, is consistent with a similar event reported in a previous flight. These events could be produced by the atmospheric decay of an upward-propagating tau lepton produced by v(tau) interaction, although their relatively steep arrival angles create tension with the standard model neutrino cross section. Each of the two events have a posteriori background estimates of less than or similar to 10(-2) events. If these are generated by tau-lepton decay, then either the charged-current v(tau) cross section is suppressed at EeV energies, or the events arise at moments when the peak flux of a transient neutrino source was much larger than the typical expected cosmogenic background neutrinos.

The GeoCarb mission will deliver daily maps of column concentrations of CO2, CH4, and CO over the observed landmasses in the Americas at a spatial resolution of roughly 10 x 10 km. Persistent measurements of CO2, CH4, CO, and SIF will contribute significantly to resolving carbon emissions and illuminating biotic processes at urban to continental scales, which will allow the improvement of modeled biogeochemical processes in Earth System Models as well as monitor the response of the biosphere to disturbance. This is essential to improve understanding of the Carbon-Climate connection. In this paper, we introduce the instrument and the GeoCarb Mission, and we demonstrate the potential scientific contribution of the mission through a series of CO2 and CH4 simulation experiments. We find that GeoCarb will be able to constrain emissions at urban to continental spatial scales on weekly to annual time scales. The GeoCarb mission particularly builds upon the Orbiting Carbon Obserevatory-2 (OCO-2), which is flying in Low Earth Orbit.	[Moore, Berrien, III; Crowell, Sean M.

The near-infrared band of the recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) features the required spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve SIF in a spectral range devoid of atmospheric absorption features. We find that initial TROPOMI spectra meet high expectations for a substantially improved spatiotemporal resolution (up to 7-km x 3.5-km pixels with daily revisit), representing a step change in SIF remote sensing capabilities. However, interpretation requires caution, as the broad range of viewing-illumination geometries covered by TROPOMI's 2,600-km-wide swath needs to be taken into account. A first intersensor comparison with OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) SIF shows excellent agreement, underscoring the high quality of TROPOMI's SIF retrievals and the notable radiometric performance of the instrument. Plain Language Summary Photosynthesis is the most essential process for life on Earth, but gradually changing environmental conditions such as increasing concentrations of atmospheric trace gases, rising temperatures, or reduced water availability could adversely affect the photosynthetic productivity. The recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument is designed to monitor atmospheric trace gases and air pollutants with an unprecedented resolution in space and time, while its radiometric performance also permits us to see a weak electromagnetic signal emitted by photosynthetically active vegetation-solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). Mounting evidence suggests that SIF observations from satellite instruments augment our abilities to track the photosynthetic performance and carbon uptake of terrestrial vegetation. In this study, we present the first TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument SIF retrievals, largely outperforming previous and existing capabilities for a spatial continuous monitoring of SIF from space.

Constraining Aerosol Vertical Profile in the Boundary Layer Using Hyperspectral Measurements of Oxygen Absorption	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							INFORMATION-CONTENT ANALYSIS; CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; LOS-ANGELES; A-BAND; OPTICAL DEPTH; CLARS-FTS; PART II; RADIATION; O-2; SENSITIVITY	This study attempts to infer aerosol vertical structure in the urban boundary layer using passive hyperspectral measurements. A spectral sorting technique is developed to retrieve total aerosol optical depth (AOD) and effective aerosol layer height (ALH) from hyperspectral measurements in the 1.27-mu m oxygen absorption band by the mountaintop Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing instrument (1,673 m above sea level) overlooking the LA basin. Comparison to AOD measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network and aerosol backscatter profile measurements from a Mini MicroPulse Lidar shows agreement, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.74 for AOD and 0.57 for effective ALH. On average, the AOD retrieval has an error of 24.9% and root-mean-square error of 0.013, while the effective ALH retrieval has an error of 7.8% and root-mean-square error of 67.01 m. The proposed method can potentially be applied to existing and future satellite missions with hyperspectral oxygen measurements to constrain aerosol vertical distribution on a global scale. Plain Language Summary Satellite and ground-based measurements have enabled accurate and continuous monitoring of total aerosol loading. However, these measurements provide little or no information on the vertical distribution of aerosols. In particular, there is poor measurement of aerosols in the planetary boundary layer, the part of the atmosphere closest to the surface. In this study, we develop an algorithm to retrieve the vertical structure of aerosols in the boundary layer using remote sensing observations of oxygen absorption with high spectral resolution. The algorithm is applied to infer the vertical profile of air pollutants in the Los Angeles basin using measurements made by a mountaintop instrument overlooking the basin. The proposed retrieval algorithm can potentially be applied to existing and future satellite missions with hyperspectral oxygen measurements to constrain the aerosol vertical distribution on a global scale. This important piece of information on aerosol vertical structure will potentially address several key priorities in the 2017 U.S. National Research Council Earth Science Decadal Survey, from forecasting air pollution in cities, quantifying the aerosol impact on Earth's climate, and reducing biases in greenhouse gas retrievals.

It has also been shown that black hole spins in comparable mass stellar-mass black hole binaries could preferentially lie in a resonant plane when their gravitational waves (GWs) enter the advanced LIGO frequency band [1]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to investigate the possibility of detection and subsequent characterization of such GW sources in the advanced detector era, which can, in turn, improve our perception of their high mass counterparts. The current detection pipelines involve only nonprecessing templates for compact binary searches whereas parameter estimation pipelines can afford to use approximate precessing templates. In this paper, we test the performance of these templates in detection and characterization of spin-orbit resonant binaries. We use fully precessing time-domain SEOBNRv3 waveforms as well as four numerical relativity (NR) waveforms to model GWs from spin-orbit resonant binaries and filter them through IMRPhenomD, SEOBNRv4 and IMRPhenomPv2 approximants. We find that the nonprecessing approximants IMRPhenomD and SEOBNRv4 recover only similar to 70% of injections with fitting factor (FF) higher than 0.97 (or 90% of injections with FF > 0.9). This loss in signal-to-noise ratio is mainly due to the missing physics in these approximants in terms of precession and nonquadrupole modes. However, if we use a new statistic, i.e., maximizing the matched filter output over the sky-location parameters as well, the precessing approximant IMRPhenomPv2 performs magnificently better than their nonprecessing counterparts with recovering 99% of the injections with FFs higher than 0.97. Interestingly, injections with Delta phi = 180 degrees have higher FFs (Delta phi is the angle between the components of the black hole spins in the plane orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum) as compared to their Delta phi = 0 degrees and generic counterparts. This is because Delta phi = 180 degrees binaries are not as strongly precessing as Delta phi = 0 degrees and generic binaries. This implies that we will have a slight observation bias towards Delta phi = 180 degrees and away from from Delta phi =0 degrees resonant binaries while using nonprecessing templates for searches. Moreover, all template approximants are able to recover most of the injected NR waveforms with FFs > 0.95. For all the injections including NR, the systematic error in estimating chirp mass remains below < 10% with minimum error for Delta phi = 180 degrees resonant binaries. The symmetric mass-ratio can be estimated with errors below 15%. The effective spin parameter chi(eff) is measured with maximum absolute error of 0.13. The in-plane spin parameter chi(p) is mostly underestimated indicating that a precessing signal will be recovered as a relatively less precessing signal. Based on our findings, we conclude that we not only need improvements in waveform models towards precession and nonquadrupole modes but also better search strategies for precessing GW signals.

Distinct Geologic Settings of Opal-A and More Crystalline Hydrated Silica on Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							GALE CRATER; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; HYDROUS MINERALS; AQUEOUS ACTIVITY; LANDING SITE; NEW-ZEALAND; WATER; DIAGENESIS; DEPOSITS	Opaline silica deposits have been identified on Mars from orbital near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra, but opal types (e.g., -A,/CT) have not yet been conclusively determined due to insufficient laboratory spectra acquired at Mars-relevant conditions. NIR reflectance spectra of siliceous deposits acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars instrument are compared with new laboratory spectra of terrestrial opal samples that we measured under Mars-relevant conditions. Opal-A occurrences on Mars are commonly associated with bedrock exposures, whereas more crystalline hydrated silica (opal-CT and quartz/chalcedony) is primarily observed in unconsolidated sediments. These differences suggest some opal-bearing deposits may have experienced prolonged interaction with near-surface water or diagenetic fluids, and bedrock exposures dominated by opal-A may have experienced less post-formation diagenesis compared with those containing more crystalline hydrated silica. NIR data thus provide a useful tool to assess opal maturity and relative potential for biosignature preservation for different siliceous deposits on Mars. Plain Language Summary Opals form in habitable aqueous environments and are known to preserve biosignatures on Earth. Opal-bearing deposits have also been identified on Mars, but the distribution of opal type is not well-understood and carries astrobiological implications. Opal-CT and quartz phases are more crystalline than opal-A and often result from post-formation interaction of opal-A with water; such progressive diagenesis could lead to less pristine biosignature preservation. In this work, we distinguish between opal-A and more crystalline hydrated silica (opal-CT and quartz/chalcedony) on Mars for the first time using orbital data. These orbital observations are compared to analogous near-infrared reflectance spectra of terrestrial opal-A, opal-CT, quartz, and chalcedony. On Mars, we find that opal-A is associated with bedrock, whereas more crystalline hydrated silica is associated with aeolian sediment. Because opal-A transforms into more crystalline forms in the presence of water, these findings suggest that silica in aeolian deposits has experienced longer interaction with water than opal-bearing bedrock throughout Martian history. These methods can help better identify and prioritize hydrated silica outcrops on Mars according to their likely degree of post-formation interaction with water and thus their potential to preserve biosignatures. These results have applications towards future astrobiological investigations such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Mars 2020 rover.

Morphologic Diversity of Martian Ripples: Implications for Large-Ripple Formation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							GALE-CRATER; AEOLIAN ACTIVITY; SAND RIPPLES; MERIDIANI PLANUM; BAGNOLD DUNES; MARS; BEDFORMS; ROVER; MEGARIPPLES; TRANSVERSE	Large ripples with meter-scale wavelengths are ubiquitous across Mars. Curiosity's traverse of the Bagnold Dune Field revealed a morphologic diversity of large Martian ripples that helps constrain their formative mechanism. Large ripples develop in isolated fields and on dunes. They form transversely and obliquely to longitudinally to the net sand-flux direction in unimodally and bimodally distributed very fine to very coarse sand. They have either straight or sinuous crestlines. Inactive ripples are covered with dust, whereas migrating ripples are dust free. Here we present a unifying view of ripples that form in near-bed sediment-transport conditions (encompassing fluid-drag and coarse-grained ripples) to explain the range of large-Martian-ripple morphologies and expand the use of bedforms as environmental indicators. Plain Language Summary Large sand ripples with meter-scale crest-to-crest spacings abound on the Martian surface but are not found in terrestrial sandy deserts. Along its traverse through the Bagnold Dune Field, the Curiosity rover witnessed a rich diversity of such large ripples, both in terms of their shape and of their behavior. Rover observations help understand how these mysterious large Martian ripples form. Here we present a unifying view of ripples that form when grains are mobilized near the sediment bed by various fluids and across planets. Such an understanding of the formation mechanics of similar ripples will enable scientists to use the ripples' imprints on landscapes and in rocks to infer modern and past environmental conditions.

Direct observations of asteroid interior and regolith structure: Science measurement requirements	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Near-earth asteroid; Radar tomography; Dielectric properties; Asteroid deep internal structure; Asteroid regolith	NUCLEUS SOUNDING EXPERIMENT; MAIN-BELT ASTEROIDS; RADIOWAVE TRANSMISSION; COLLISIONAL EVOLUTION; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; BINARY ASTEROIDS; WATER ICE; 2008 TC3; ITOKAWA; EARTH	Our knowledge of the internal structure of asteroids is, so far, indirect - relying entirely on inferences from remote sensing observations of the surface, and theoretical modeling of formation and evolution. What are the bulk properties of the regolith and deep interior? And what are the physical processes that shape asteroid internal structures? Is the composition and size distribution observed on the surface representative of the bulk? These questions are crucial to understand small bodies' history from accretion in the early Solar System to the present, and direct measurements are needed to answer these questions for the benefit of science as well as for planetary defense or exploration. Radar is one of the main instruments capable of sounding asteroids to characterize internal structure from sub-meter to global scale. In this paper, we review the science case for direct observation of the deep internal structure and regolith of a rocky asteroid of kilometer size or smaller. We establish the requirements and model dielectric properties of asteroids to outline a possible instrument suite, and highlight the capabilities of radar instrumentation to achieve these observations. We then review the expected science return including secondary objectives contributing to the determination of the gravitational field, the shape model, and the dynamical state.

Partitioning of evapotranspiration in remote sensing-based models	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Evapotranspiration; Partitioning; Modeling; Remote sensing; Transpiration; Soil evaporation	TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; GLOBAL TERRESTRIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER-BALANCE; SAP-FLOW; PORE-SCALE; PLANT TRANSPIRATION; CANOPY EVAPORATION; CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; INTERCEPTION LOSS	Satellite based retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET) are widely used for assessments of global and regional scale surface fluxes. However, the partitioning of the estimated ET between soil evaporation, transpiration, and canopy interception regularly shows strong divergence between models, and to date, remains largely unvalidated. To examine this problem, this paper considers three algorithms: the Penman-Monteith model from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (PM-MODIS), the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL), and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Surface flux estimates from these three models, obtained via the WACMOS-ET initiative, are compared against a comprehensive collection of field studies, spanning a wide range of climates and land cover types. Overall, we find errors between estimates of field and remote sensing-based soil evaporation (RMSD = 90-114%, r(2) = 0.14-0.25, N = 35), interception (RMSD = 62-181%, r(2) = 0.39-0.85, N = 13), and transpiration (RMSD = 54-114%, r(2) = 0.33-0.55, N = 35) are relatively large compared to the combined estimates of total ET (RMSD = 35-49%, r(2) = 0.61-0.75, N = 35). Errors in modeled ET components are compared between land cover types, field methods, and precipitation regimes. Modeled estimates of soil evaporation were found to have significant deviations from observed values across all three models, while the characterization of vegetation effects also influences errors in all three components. Improvements in these estimates, and other satellite based partitioning estimates are likely to lead to better understanding of the movement of water through the soil-plant-water continuum.

The theoretical capabilities of a submillimeter limb sounder placed in low Mars orbit are quantified, with a particular focus on the ability to make profile measurements of line-of-sight wind, temperature, water vapor, deuterated water vapor, several isotopes of carbon monoxide, oxygen-18 carbon dioxide, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide. We identify cases where all such measurements can be made within a single 25-70 GHz wide region of the submillimeter spectrum, enabling use of a single state-of-the-art submillimeter receiver. Six potential spectral regions, approximately centered at 335 GHz, 450 GHz, 550 GHz, 900 GHz, 1000 GHz, and 1130 GHz are found, any one of which can provide a complete measurement suite. The expected precision and vertical resolution of temperature, composition, and wind measurements from instruments in each range are quantified. This work thus follows on from that of Urban et al. (2005), Kasai et al. (2012), and earlier studies, expanding them to consider many alternative observing frequency regions. In general, performance (in terms of measurement precision and vertical resolution) is improved with increasing observation frequency. In part this is due to our choice to assume the same antenna size for each frequency, thus providing a narrower field of view for the higher frequency configurations. The general increase in emission line strengths with increasing frequency also contributes to this improved performance in some cases. However, increased instrument power needs for the higher frequency configurations may argue against their choice in some mission scenarios.

Reaction kinetics of OH + HNO3 under conditions relevant to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							NITRIC-ACID; MASTER EQUATION; HYDROXYL RADICALS; RATE-CONSTANT; CARBONACEOUS AEROSOLS; STRATOSPHERE; PRESSURE; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; HNO3	The OH initiated oxidation of HNO3 in the UT/LS plays an important role in controlling the O-3 budget, removing HOx radicals whilst driving NOx/y partitioning chemistry by yielding NO3 radicals: OH + HNO3 -> H2O + NO3. In this paper, k(1)(T, P) was measured using OH (A <- X) Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and the data was modelled over the 223-298 K temperature and 25-750 Torr pressure ranges, using the modified Lindemann-Hinshelwood expression k(1) = k(0) + k(3)[M]/1 k(3)[M]'vertical bar/k(2), where k(0) = 5.2 x 10(-14) exp(200/T) cm(3) s(-1), k(2) = 8.4 x 10(-17) exp(1900/T) cm(3) s(-1) and k(3) = 1.6 x 10(-34) exp(1745/T) cm(3) s(-1). A significant source of experimental uncertainty derives from accurate determination of HNO3 concentration, which is impacted by heterogeneous uptake of the low volatility HNO3 onto cold surfaces of the reactors. Our results represent the determination of k(1)(T, P) using two different in situ [HNO3] measurements: VUV absorption and a new two photon Photolysis Induced Fluoresence (PIF). Experimental results are discussed along with a computational master equation calculation (MESMER), which highlight the need for further theoretical study into the OH + HNO3 mechanism and potential energy surface. The atmospheric impact of these new rate constants were modelled using the STOCHEM-CRI chemistry transport global model, which have shown a small reduction in global budgets of key atmospheric species, with more significant changes in the NOx/HNO3 ratio, peaking in the tropical upper troposphere regions.

A hot and fast ultra-stripped supernova that likely formed a compact neutron star binary	SCIENCE			English	Article							LIGHT CURVES; WHITE-DWARF; SN 2013CU; EVOLUTION; COLLAPSE; PROGENITOR; EXPLOSION; ACCRETION; MERGERS; SINGLE	Compact neutron star binary systems are produced from binary massive stars through stellar evolution involving up to two supernova explosions. The final stages in the formation of these systems have not been directly observed. We report the discovery of iPTF 14gqr (SN 2014ft), a type Ic supernova with a fast-evolving light curve indicating an extremely low ejecta mass (approximate to 0.2 solar masses) and low kinetic energy (approximate to 2 x 10(50) ergs). Early photometry and spectroscopy reveal evidence of shock cooling of an extended helium-rich envelope, likely ejected in an intense pre-explosion mass-loss episode of the progenitor. Taken together, we interpret iPTF 14gqr as evidence for ultra-stripped supernovae that form neutron stars in compact binary systems.	[De, K.; Kasliwal, M. M.; Duggan, G. E.; Kulkarni, S.

Starting in 2008, TES global sampling of tropospheric ozone was gradually reduced in latitude, with global coverage stopping in 2011. To extend the record of TES, this work presents a multispectral approach that will provide O-3 data products with vertical resolution and measurement error similar to TES by combining the single-footprint thermal infrared (TIR) hyperspectral radiances from the Aqua Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument and the ultraviolet (UV) channels from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The joint AIRS+OMI O-3 retrievals are processed through the MUltiSpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, MUlti-SEnsors (MUSES) retrieval algorithm. Comparisons of collocated joint AIRS +OMI and TES to ozonesonde measurements show that both systems have similar errors, with mean and standard deviation of the differences well within the estimated measurement error. AIRS+OMI and TES have slightly different biases (within 5 parts per billion) vs. the sondes. Both AIRS and OMI have wide swath widths (similar to 1650 km for AIRS; similar to 2600 km for OMI) across satellite ground tracks. Consequently, the joint AIRS+OMI measurements have the potential to maintain TES vertical sensitivity while increasing coverage by 2 orders of magnitude, thus providing an unprecedented new data set with which to quantify the evolution of tropospheric ozone.

DES Collaboration	The First Tidally Disrupted Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy?: A Spectroscopic Analysis of the Tucana III Stream	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark matter; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: individual (Tucana III); Local Group; stars: abundances	LONG-TERM EVOLUTION; SKY SURVEY VIEW; GLOBULAR-CLUSTER; DARK-MATTER; LEO V; SPHEROIDAL GALAXIES; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; GALACTIC TIDES; STAR; SAGITTARIUS	We present a spectroscopic study of the tidal tails and core of the Milky Way satellite Tucana III, collectively referred to as the Tucana III stream, using the 2dF+AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the IMACS spectrograph on the Magellan Baade Telescope. In addition to recovering the brightest nine previously known member stars in the Tucana III core, we identify 22 members in the tidal tails. We observe strong evidence for a velocity gradient of 8.0 +/- 0.4 km s(-1) deg(-1) over at least 3 degrees on the sky. Based on the continuity in velocity, we confirm that the Tucana III tails are real tidal extensions of Tucana III. The large velocity gradient of the stream implies that Tucana III is likely on a radial orbit. We successfully obtain metallicities for four members in the core and 12 members in the tails. We find that members close to the ends of the stream tend to be more metal-poor than members in the core, indicating a possible metallicity gradient between the center of the progenitor halo and its edge. The spread in metallicity suggests that the progenitor of the Tucana III stream is likely a dwarf galaxy rather than a star cluster. Furthermore, we find that with the precise photometry of the Dark Energy Survey data, there is a discernible color offset between metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor stream members. This metallicity-dependent color offers a more efficient method to recognize metal-poor targets and will increase the selection efficiency of stream members for future spectroscopic follow-up programs on stellar streams.

In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up observations of a faint and fast-evolving transient, iPTF 16hgs, that exhibited a double-peaked light curve. Exhibiting a Type Ib spectrum in the photospheric phase and an early transition to a [Ca II] dominated nebular phase, iPTF 16hgs shows properties consistent with the class of Ca-rich gap transients, with two important exceptions. First, while the second peak of the light curve is similar to other Ca-rich gap transients, the first blue and fast-fading peak (declining over approximate to 2 days) is unique to this source. Second, we find that iPTF 16hgs occurred in the outskirts (projected offset of approximate to 6 kpc approximate to 1.9 R-eff) of a low-metallicity (approximate to 0.4 Z(circle dot)), star-forming, dwarf spiral galaxy. Deep limits from late-time radio observations suggest a low-density environment for the source. If iPTF 16hgs shares explosion physics with the class of Ca-rich gap transients, the first peak can be explained by the presence of 0.01 M-circle dot of Ni-56 in the outer layers the ejecta, reminiscent of some models of He-shell detonations on WDs. However, if iPTF 16hgs is physically unrelated to the class, the first peak is consistent with shock cooling emission (of an envelope with a mass of approximate to 0.08 M-circle dot and radius of approximate to 13 R-circle dot) in a core-collapse explosion of a highly stripped massive star in a close binary system.

Based on multi-band Hubble Space Telescope and Very Large Telescope (VLT) photometry of the supernova, and VLT spectroscopy of the host galaxy, we find a 97.5% probability that this SN is a SN Ia, and a 2.5% chance of a CC SN. Our typing algorithm combines the shape and color of the light curve with the expected rates of each SN type in the host galaxy. With a redshift of 2.2216, this is the highest redshift SN. Ia discovered with a spectroscopic host-galaxy redshift. A further distinguishing feature is that the lensing cluster, at redshift 1.23, is the most distant to date to have an amplified SN. The SN lies in the middle of the color and light-curve shape distributions found at lower redshift, disfavoring strong evolution to z = 2.22. We estimate an amplification due to gravitational lensing of 2.8(-0.5)(+0.6) (1.10 +/- 0.23 mag)-compatible with the value estimated from the weak-lensing-derived mass and the mass-concentration relation from Lambda CDM simulations-making it the most amplified SN Ia discovered behind a galaxy cluster.

Abiotic O-2 Levels on Planets around F, G, K, and M Stars: Effects of Lightning-produced Catalysts in Eliminating Oxygen False Positives	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planet-star interactions; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: composition; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets	PLATE-TECTONICS; OXIDATION-STATE; NITROGEN-OXIDES; SUPER-EARTHS; ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; ROCKY EXOPLANETS; HABITABLE ZONES; REDOX EVOLUTION; COSMIC-RAYS; RISE	Over the last few years, a number of authors have suggested that, under certain circumstances, molecular oxygen (O-2) or ozone (O-3) generated by abiotic processes may accumulate to detectable concentrations in a habitable terrestrial planet's atmosphere, producing so-called "false positives" for life. But the models have occasionally disagreed with each other, with some predicting false positives, and some not, for the same apparent set of circumstances. We show here that photochemical false positives derive either from inconsistencies in the treatment of atmospheric and global redox balance or from the treatment (or lack thereof) of lightning. For habitable terrestrial planets with even trace amounts of atmospheric N-2, NO produced by lightning catalyzes the recombination of CO and O derived from CO2 photolysis and should be sufficient to eliminate all reported false positives. Molecular oxygen thus remains a useful biosignature gas for Earth-like extrasolar planets, provided that the planet resides within the conventional liquid water habitable zone and has not experienced distinctly non-Earth-like, irrecoverable water loss.

A Luminous Transient Event in a Sample of WISE-selected Variable AGNs	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; infrared: general; quasars: general; supernovae: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; TIDAL DISRUPTION EVENT; BLACK-HOLE MASSES; BROAD-LINE REGION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; WIDE-FIELD SURVEY; SEYFERT-1 GALAXIES; SPITZER DEEP; TO 0.2; SUPERNOVA	Recently Assef et al. presented two catalogs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates over 30,093 deg(2) selected from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) observations. From their most reliable sample, Assef et al. identified 45 AGN candidates with the highest variability levels in the AllWISE catalog but that are not blazars. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of some of these targets to further constrain their nature. We also study their optical light curves using observations from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and find that only seven show significant optical variability, and that five of those seven are spectroscopically classified as AGNs. In one of them, WISEA J094806.56+031801.7 (W0948+0318), we identify a transient event in the CRTS light curve. We present a detailed analysis of this transient and characterize it through its CRTS light curve and its multiwavelength spectral energy distribution obtained from GALEX, Pan-STARRS, and WISE observations. We find that the most likely source of the transient is a superluminous supernova (SLSN) in W0948+0318. We estimate the total radiated energy to be E = (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(52) erg, making it one of the most energetic SLSNe observed. Based on the lack of change in mid-IR color throughout and after the transient event, we speculate that the location of the SLSN is within the torus of the AGN. We identify nine possible analogs to W0948+0318 based on their WISE light curves. None show optically detected transients and hence suggest significant dust obscuration. Finally, we estimate a rate of >2 x 10(-7) yr(-1) per AGN for these transients under the conservative assumption that none of the identified analogs have a common origin with the transient in W0948+0318.

Sample Selection	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; galaxies: statistics; surveys	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SPECTROSCOPIC TARGET SELECTION; MASS ASSEMBLY GAMA; WIDE-FIELD SURVEY; DATA RELEASE; EVOLUTION SURVEY; COSMOS; DEEP; TELESCOPE; EXPLORER	The WISE satellite surveyed the entire sky multiple times in four infrared (IR) wavelengths (3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mu m). This all-sky IR photometric survey makes it possible to leverage many of the large publicly available spectroscopic redshift surveys to measure galaxy properties in the IR. While characterizing the cross-matching of WISE data to a single survey is a straightforward process, doing it with six different redshift surveys takes a fair amount of space to characterize adequately, because each survey has unique caveats and characteristics that need addressing. This work describes a data set that results from matching five public redshift surveys with the AllWISE data release, along with a reanalysis of the data described in Lake et al. The combined data set has an additional flux limit of 80 mu Jy (19.14 AB mag) in WISE's W1 filter, imposed in order to limit it to targets with high completeness and reliable photometry in the AllWISE data set. Consistent analysis of all of the data is only possible if the color bias discussed in Ilbert et al. is addressed (e.g., the techniques explored in Lake et al.). The sample defined herein is used in a companion paper in this series to measure the luminosity function of galaxies at 2.4 mu m rest-frame wavelength, and the selection process of the sample is optimized for this purpose.

The big advantage of measuring LFs at wavelengths in the window of approximate to 2-3.5 mu m is that it correlates more closely to the total stellar mass in galaxies than others. In this paper we report on the parameters of the 2.4 mu m LF of galaxies obtained from applying the spectro-luminosity-functional-based methods to datasets from the previous papers in this series using the mean and covariance of 2.4 mu m normalized spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from our previous work. In terms of the single Schechter function parameters evaluated at the present epoch, the combined result is: phi(star) = 5.8 +/- [0.3(stat), 0.4(sys)] x 10(-3) Mpc(-3), L star = 6.4 +/- [0.1(stat), 0.3(sys)] x 10(10) L-2.4 (mu m circle dot) (M star = -21.67 +/- [0.02(stat), 0.05(sys)] AB mag), and alpha = -1.050 +/- [0.004(stat), 0.04(sys)]. The high statistical accuracy comes from combining public redshift surveys with the wide coverage from WISE, and the unevenness in statistical accuracy is a result of our efforts to work around biases of uncertain origin that affect resolved and marginally resolved galaxies. With further refinements, the techniques applied in this work promise to advance the study of the SED of the universe.	[Lake, S. E.; Wright, E.

Uniform Cloud Decks	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; methods: analytical; polarization; radiative transfer; scattering	LOW-MASS STARS; OPTICAL LINEAR-POLARIZATION; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA; ULTRA-COOL DWARFS; T-DWARFS; NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES; EXTRASOLAR PLANETS; LIGHT-SCATTERING; PHOTOMETRIC VARIABILITY; DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION	This work is a theoretical exploration facilitating the interpretation of polarimetric observations in terms of cloudiness, rotational velocities, and effective temperatures of brown dwarfs (BDs). An envelope of scatterers like free electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes vector of the radiation emitted by oblate bodies. Due to high rotation rates, BDs can be considerably oblate. We present a conics-based radiative transfer scheme for computing the disk-resolved and disk-integrated polarized emission of an oblate BD or extrasolar giant planet bearing homogeneous or patchy clouds. Assuming a uniform gray atmosphere, we theoretically examine the sensitivity of photopolarimetry to the atmosphere's scattering properties, like cloud optical thickness and grain size, concurrently with BD properties, like oblateness, inclination, and effective temperature, which are all treated as free parameters. Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational darkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disk-integrated polarization. GD imparts a nonlinear inverse temperature dependence to the resulting polarization. Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination. The degree of polarization increases in response to both, making it potentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD. Under our model assumptions, increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds causes a blueward shift in the near-infrared colors of BDs, which is interesting in light of the observed J - K brightening in the L/T transition. For large cloud grains, polarization decreases sharply, while the transmitted intensity shows a steady increase. BD polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the presence of clouds but also provides information on cloud grain size.

The system operates at F/1.8, providing the high throughput for low-reflectivity (<1%) water surfaces, while avoiding saturation over bright snow or clouds. The SWIS design utilizes heritage from previously demonstrated instruments on airborne platforms while advancing the state of the art in compact sensors of this kind in terms of size and spectral coverage. Compared with airborne campaigns, the CubeSat platform allows for more frequent and regular sampling, while maintaining intermediate to high resolution relative to heritage global sensors. Through frequent repeat observations from space at a moderate spatial resolution, SWIS can address key science questions concerning aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem changes, cryosphere warming and melt behavior, cloud and atmospheric science, and potential impacts of climate change and human activities on the environment.

TROPOMI is the first of ESA's atmospheric composition Sentinel missions, which will provide complete long-term records of atmospheric trace gases for the coming 30 years as a contribution to the European Union's Earth Observing program Copernicus. One of TROPOMI's primary products is atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO). It is observed with daily global coverage and a high spatial resolution of 7 x 7 km(2). The moderate atmospheric resistance time and the low background concentration leads to localized pollution hotspots of CO and allows the tracking of the atmospheric transport of pollution on regional to global scales. In this contribution, we demonstrate the groundbreaking performance of the TROPOMI CO product, sensing CO enhancements above cities and industrial areas and tracking, with daily coverage, the atmospheric transport of pollution from biomass burning regions. The CO data product is validated with two months of Fourier-transform spectroscopy (FTS) measurements at nine ground-based stations operated by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). We found a good agreement between both datasets with a mean bias of 6 ppb (average of individual station biases) for both clear-sky and cloudy TROPOMI CO retrievals. Together with the corresponding standard deviation of the individual station biases of 3.8 ppb for clear-sky and 4.0 ppb for cloudy sky, it indicates that the CO data product is already well within the mission requirement.

The Cassini spacecraft's traversals between Saturn and its innermost D ring allowed its cosmic dust analyzer (CDA) to collect material released from the main rings and to characterize the ring material infall into Saturn. We report the direct in situ detection of material from Saturn's dense rings by the CDA impact mass spectrometer. Most detected grains are a few tens of nanometers in size and dynamically associated with the previously inferred "ring rain." Silicate and water-ice grains were identified, in proportions that vary with latitude. Silicate grains constitute up to 30% of infalling grains, a higher percentage than the bulk silicate content of the rings.

PART I; AGGREGATE SNOWFLAKES; PRECIPITATION RADAR; TERMINAL VELOCITIES; ICE PARTICLES; FREQUENCY; SNOW; SIGNATURES; SIZE	We have developed an algorithm that retrieves the size, number concentration and density of falling snow from multifrequency radar observations. This work builds on previous studies that have indicated that three-frequency radars can provide information on snow density, potentially improving the accuracy of snow parameter estimates. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian framework, using lookup tables mapping the measurement space to the state space, which allows fast and robust retrieval. In the forward model, we calculate the radar reflectivities using recently published snow scattering databases. We demonstrate the algorithm using multifrequency airborne radar observations from the OLYMPEX-RADEX field campaign, comparing the retrieval results to hydrometeor identification using ground-based polarimetric radar and also to collocated in situ observations made using another aircraft. Using these data, we examine how the availability of multiple frequencies affects the retrieval accuracy, and we test the sensitivity of the algorithm to the prior assumptions. The results suggest that multifrequency radars are substantially better than single-frequency radars at retrieving snow microphysical properties. Meanwhile, triple-frequency radars can retrieve wider ranges of snow density than dual-frequency radars and better locate regions of highdensity snow such as graupel, although these benefits are relatively modest compared to the difference in retrieval performance between dual- and single-frequency radars. We also examine the sensitivity of the retrieval results to the fixed a priori assumptions in the algorithm, showing that the multi-frequency method can reliably retrieve snowflake size, while the retrieved number concentration and density are affected significantly by the assumptions.

Saturn's magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale	SCIENCE			English	Article							PLANETARY PERIOD OSCILLATIONS; GRAVITATIONAL-FIELD; ROTATION PERIOD; RING CURRENT; NEW-MODELS; NORTHERN; CURRENTS; DYNAMO; PERIODICITIES; HYDROGEN	During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate magnetometer made in situ measurements of Saturn's magnetic field at distances similar to 2550 +/- 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn's internal magnetic field and show displacement of the magnetic equator northward from the planet's physical equator. Persistent small-scale magnetic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric magnetic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn's interior. Some high-degree magnetic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of magnetic flux within the planet's deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.

Testing general relativity with geodetic VLBI What a single, specially designed experiment can teach us	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrometry; techniques: interferometric; gravitation	SOLAR GRAVITATIONAL DEFLECTION; BASE-LINE INTERFEROMETRY; LIGHT DEFLECTION; RADIO SIGNALS; ASTROMETRY; MOTIONS	Context. We highlight the capabilities of geodetic VLBI technique to test general relativity in the classical astrometric style, i.e. measuring the deflection of light in the vicinity of the Sun. Aims. In previous studies, the parameter y was estimated by global analyses of thousands of geodetic VLBI sessions. Here we estimate gamma from a single session where the Sun has approached two strong reference radio sources, 0229+131 and 0235+164, at an elongation angle of 1-3 degrees. Methods. The AUA020 VLBI session of 1 May 2017 was designed to obtain more than 1000 group delays from the two radio sources. The solar corona effect was effectively calibrated with the dual-frequency observations even at small elongation. Results. We obtained y with a greater precision (0.9 x 10(-4)) than has been obtained through global analyses of thousands of standard geodetic sessions over decades. Current results demonstrate that the modern VLBI technology is capable of establishing new limits on observational tests of general relativity.

J	Dewar, RE				Dewar, Robert Earl			My Art by the Numbers	PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES-A QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF JUNGIAN THOUGHT			English	Article								The author explains his affinity for numbers as it relates to his work as an artist spanning his long career. This affinity helped him invent one of the first systems for making four-color digital prints. Having been only recently introduced to the book Number and Time, by Marie-Louise von Franz, the author finds that he is in full agreement with her depth psychology theories on number. Recounting a synchronicity that he experienced while writing this paper helped the author to understand Jung's concept of the unus mundus, as explained by von Franz in Number and Time. He speculates that number archetypes must have evolved in human consciousness over very long periods of time and writes about the number zero as a "recent" example. The author also describes his experience of a spontaneous mathematical vision that led him to create an algorithm, which in turn led him to realize that crystals having fivefold symmetry could exist in nature, which was considered impossible at the time. The author discusses his new inventions of quasi-periodic and random tile patterns, which were inspired by 15th-century Islamic tile patterns, as they related to the aperiodic patterns invented by Roger Penrose in the 20th century. He speculates about the ability of artificially intelligent computer software to be able to generate random quasi-periodic patterns. Lastly, the author recounts a synchronistic experience that occurred during the month of his 72nd birthday, in which his work with numbers is seemingly reciprocated by nature.

Yet, there are still high uncertainties in forest carbon stock and flux estimates, notably because of their spatial and temporal variability across the tropics. Several upcoming spaceborne missions have been designed to address this gap. High-quality ground data are essential for accurate calibration/validation so that spaceborne biomass missions can reach their full potential in reducing uncertainties regarding forest carbon stocks and fluxes. The BIOMASS mission, a P-band SAR satellite from the European Space Agency (ESA), aims at improving carbon stock mapping and reducing uncertainty in the carbon fluxes from deforestation, forest degradation, and regrowth. In situ activities in support of the BIOMASS mission were carried out in French Guiana and Gabon during the TropiSAR and AfriSAR campaigns. During these campaigns, airborne P-band SAR, forest inventory, and lidar data were collected over six study sites. This paper describes the methods used for forest inventory and lidar data collection and analysis, and presents resulting plot estimates and aboveground biomass maps. These reference datasets along with intermediate products (e.g., canopy height models) can be accessed through ESA's Forest Observation System and the Dryad data repository and will be useful for BIOMASS but also to other spaceborne biomass missions such as GEDI, NISAR, and Tandem-L for calibration/validation purposes. During data quality control and analysis, prospects for reducing uncertainties have been identified, and this paper finishes with a series of recommendations for future tropical forest field campaigns to better serve the remote sensing community.

A series of controlled experiments is conducted by varying planetary rotation rate and imposed equator-to-pole temperature difference. These defining parameters are combined further with each other into dimensionless forms to establish a parameter space in which the occurrences of different circulation regimes are mapped and classified. Clear, coherent trends are found when varying planetary rotation rate (thermal Rossby number) and frictional and thermal relaxation time-scales. The sequence of circulation regimes as a function of parameters, such as the planetary rotation rate, strongly resembles that obtained in laboratory experiments on rotating, stratified flows, especially if a topographic -effect is included in those experiments to emulate the planetary vorticity gradients in an atmosphere induced by the spherical curvature of the planet. A regular baroclinic wave regime is also obtained at intermediate values of thermal Rossby number and its characteristics and dominant zonal wavenumber depend strongly on the strength of radiative and frictional damping. These regular waves exhibit some strong similarities to baroclinic storms observed on Mars under some conditions. Multiple jets are found at the highest rotation rates, when the Rossby deformation radius and other eddy-related length-scales are much smaller than the radius of the planet. These exhibit some similarity to the multiple zonal jets observed on gas giant planets. Jets form on a scale comparable to the most energetic eddies and the Rhines scale poleward of the supercritical latitude. The balance of heat transport varies strongly with between eddies and zonally symmetric flows, becoming weak with fast rotation.

Part II: Energy budgets and spectral transfers	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						atmosphere; dynamics; energy budget; general circulation model experiments; global	AVAILABLE POTENTIAL-ENERGY; ZONAL JETS; 2-DIMENSIONAL TURBULENCE; GEOSTROPHIC TURBULENCE; FLUXES; TRANSITION; MOTIONS; WAVES	The energetics of possible global atmospheric circulation patterns in an Earth-like atmosphere are explored using a simplified global General Circulation Model (GCM) based on the University of Hamburg's Portable University Model for the Atmosphere (designated here as PUMA-S), forced by linear relaxation towards a prescribed temperature field and subject to Rayleigh surface drag and hyperdiffusive dissipation. Results from a series of simulations, obtained by varying planetary rotation rate with an imposed equator-to-pole temperature difference, were analysed to determine the structure and magnitude of the heat transport and other contributions to the energy budget for the time-averaged, equilibrated flow. These show clear trends with rotation rate, with the most intense Lorenz energy cycle for an Earth-sized planet occurring with a rotation rate around half that of the present-day Earth (i.e., =/(E)=1/2, where (E) is the rotation rate of the Earth). Kinetic energy (KE) and available potential energy (APE) spectra, E-K(n) and E-A(n) (where n is total spherical wavenumber), also show clear trends with rotation rate, with n(-3) enstrophy-dominated spectra around =1 and steeper (approximate to n(-5)) slopes in the zonal mean flow with little evidence for the n(-5/3) spectrum anticipated for an inverse KE cascade. Instead, both KE and APE spectra become almost flat at scales larger than the internal Rossby radius, L-d, and exhibit near-equipartition at high wavenumbers. At <<1, the spectrum becomes dominated by KE with E-K(n)approximate to(2-3)E-A(n) at most wavenumbers and a slope that tends towards n(-5/3) across most of the spectrum. Spectral flux calculations show that enstrophy and APE are almost always cascaded downscale, regardless of rotation rate. KE cascades are more complicated, however, with downscale transfers across almost all wavenumbers, dominated by horizontally divergent modes, for less than or similar to 1 / 4 . At higher rotation rates, transfers of KE become increasingly dominated by rotational (horizontally nondivergent) components with strong upscale transfers (dominated by eddy-zonal flow interactions) for scales larger than L-d and weaker downscale transfers for scales smaller than L-d.

Springtime Bromine Activation over Coastal and Inland Arctic Snowpacks	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						snowpack; atmosphere; photochemistry; ozone; differential optical absorption spectroscopy; bromine; Arctic; Alaska	OZONE DEPLETION EVENTS; TROPOSPHERIC BRO COLUMNS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; MOLECULAR BROMINE; EXPLOSION EVENT; PRUDHOE BAY; WIND-SPEED; MONOXIDE; SNOW	With the return of sunlight in the polar spring, the snowpack serves as an effective source of molecular halogens to the Arctic boundary layer. Reactive bromine production and associated ozone depletion are typically associated with sea ice regions; however, the extent to which halogen chemistry occurs inland in coastal regions is unknown. During the March 2012 bromine, ozone, and mercury experiment (BROMEX), airborne nadir scanning differential optical absorption spectroscopy probed the spatial distribution of BrO over sea ice and tundra regions near Utqiagrvik, Alaska. We observed enhanced BrO lower tropospheric vertical column densities (LT-VCDs) up to 200 km inland. Vertical profiles showed that BrO was located near the snowpack surface, consistent with prior studies of snowpack chemical composition showing bromide enrichment, which is indicative of deposition of gas-phase bromine species to the snowpack. Over nine flights across the Alaskan Arctic, the highest BrO LT-VCDs were observed over snow-covered tundra regions rather than sea ice regions, although the variability was large at all locations. Characterization of the response of observed BrO over northern Alaska to ozone conditions at Utqiagvik showed that regional BrO levels were highest during times when ozone mole fractions were decreasing, consistent with locally occurring chemical destruction of ozone by bromine chemistry. These findings suggest that, while bromine activation is most commonly associated with sea ice regions, inland tundra snowpacks enable the transport and recycling of reactive bromine, extending this halogen chemistry and its associated impacts further inland.

DES science portal: Computing photometric redshifts	ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Astronomical databases: catalogs, surveys; Methods: data analysis; Galaxies: distances and redshifts, statistics	VLT DEEP SURVEY; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; CALIBRATION; GALAXIES; SPECTRA; SAMPLES	A significant challenge facing photometric surveys for cosmological purposes is the need to produce reliable redshift estimates. The estimation of photometric redshifts (photo-zs) has been consolidated as the standard strategy to bypass the high production costs and incompleteness of spectroscopic redshift samples. Training-based photo-z methods require the preparation of a high-quality list of spectroscopic redshifts, which needs to be constantly updated. The photo-z training, validation, and estimation must be performed in a consistent and reproducible way in order to accomplish the scientific requirements. To meet this purpose, we developed an integrated web-based data interface that not only provides the framework to carry out the above steps in a systematic way, enabling the ease testing and comparison of different algorithms, but also addresses the processing requirements by parallelizing the calculation in a transparent way for the user. This framework called the Science Portal (hereafter Portal) was developed in the context the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to facilitate scientific analysis. In this paper, we show how the Portal can provide a reliable environment to access vast datasets, provide validation algorithms and metrics, even in the case of multiple photo-zs methods. It is possible to maintain the provenance between the steps of a chain of workflows while ensuring reproducibility of the results. We illustrate how the Portal can be used to provide photo-z estimates using the DES first year (Y1A1) data. While the DES collaboration is still developing techniques to obtain more precise photo-zs, having a structured framework like the one presented here is critical for the systematic vetting of DES algorithmic improvements and the consistent production of photo-zs in future DES releases.

Orbital Characterization of GJ1108A System, and Comparison of Dynamical Mass with Model-derived Mass for Resolved Binaries	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: spectroscopic; binaries: visual; stars: imaging; stars: individual (GJ1108A); stars: low-mass	X-RAY-EMISSION; M-DWARFS; PLANET-SEARCH; BROWN DWARFS; STELLAR; STARS; ROTATION; EVOLUTION; PERTURBATIONS; SPECTROGRAPH	We report an orbital characterization of GJ1108Aab that is a low-mass binary system in the pre-main-sequence phase. Via the combination of astrometry using adaptive optics and radial velocity measurements, an eccentric orbital solution of e = 0.63 is obtained, which might be induced by the Kozai-Lidov mechanism with a widely separated GJ1108B system. Combined with several observed properties, we confirm that the system is indeed young. Columba is the most probable moving group, to which the GJ1108A system belongs, although its membership to the group has not been established. If the age of Columba is assumed for GJ1108A, the dynamical masses of both GJ1108Aa and GJ1108Ab (M-dynamical,M-GJ1108Aa= 0.72 +/- 0.04 M-circle dot and M-dynamical,M-GJ1108Ab = 0.30 +/- 0.03 M-circle dot) are more massive than what an evolutionary model predicts based on the age and luminosities. We consider that the discrepancy in mass comparison can be attributed to an age uncertainty; the system is likely older than stars in Columba, and effects that are not implemented in classical models such as accretion history and magnetic activity are not preferred to explain the mass discrepancy. We also discuss the performance of the evolutionary model by compiling similar low-mass objects in the evolutionary state based on the literature. Consequently, it is suggested that the current model on average reproduces the mass of resolved low-mass binaries without any significant offsets.

The question of the origin of these alkalis-endogenous or exogenous-remains open. They have been ascribed to exogenous contamination due to volcanism from nearby Io, or the accretion of meteorites and dust. However, these mechanisms fail to fit the observed sodium-to-potassium ratio. Sodium and potassium have also been considered to originate from Europa's putative subsurface ocean, generated by past rock-water leaching. The latter scenario implies a journey of the ions and atoms throughout the ice covering Europa. This raises questions about their stability into the bulk as well as on top of ice. These questions are addressed with first principle periodic solid-state density functional theory simulations describing the relative propensities of sodium, potassium, and calcium for being trapped in the bulk. The evolution of the ionic character of these atoms is followed by means of a topological analysis as they come up to the surface of the ice crust. We find that the metals, almost totally ionized in the ice bulk (net charge similar to+0.8) where they are stabilized by similar to 1 eV or more, recover a quasi-neutrality (net charge similar to+0.2) when weakly adsorbed at the surface by similar to 0.15 eV. Our results are consistent with the assumption that sodium and potassium observed in Europa exosphere come from the sputtering of materials issued from the underlying ocean and exposed by resurfacing events. They also suggest that calcium should be searched for by future missions.

The estimate was produced from a least squares fit of a free-running ocean general circulation model to almost all available near-global data. Data coverage in space and time during this period is far more homogeneous than in any earlier interval and includes CTD, elephant seal, and Argo temperature and salinity profiles; sea ice coverage; full altimetric and gravity-field coverage; satellite sea surface temperatures; and the initializing meteorological coverage from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim). Dominant remaining data inhomogeneity arises from increasing coverage from the Argo profiles from about 2000 to the present. The state estimate exactly satisfies the primitive equations of the free-running Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) at all times and hence produces values satisfying the fundamental conservation laws of energy, freshwater, and so forth, permitting its use for climate change studies. Quantities such as calculated heat content depend upon all observations, not just temperature, for example, altimetric height and meteorological exchanges. Output files are publicly available in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) and MATLAB form and include hydrographic variables, three components of velocity, and pressure at all depths, as well as other variables, including inferred air-sea momentum and buoyancy fluxes, 3D mixing parameters, and sea ice cover.

We regress magnitude determinations of 2600 randomly distributed marsquakes, simulated with a spectral element method for 13 published 1D structural models of Mars' interior. The continuous seismic data from InSight will be returned at 2 samples per second. To account for this limited bandwidth as well as for the expected noise conditions on Mars, we define and calibrate six magnitude scales: (1) local Mars magnitude M-L(Ma) at a period of 3 s for marsquakes at distances of up to 10 degrees; (2) P-wave magnitude m(b)(Ma); (3) S-wave magnitude m(bS)(Ma) each defined at a period of 3 s and calibrated for distances from 5 degrees to 100 degrees; (4) surface-wave magnitude M-s(Ma) defined at a period of 20 s, as well as (5) moment magnitudes M-FB(Ma); and (6) M-F(Ma) computed from the low-frequency (10-100 s) plateau of the displacement spectrum for either body waves or body and surface waves, respectively; we calibrate scales (4)-(6) for distances from 5 degrees to 180 degrees. We regress stable calibrations of the six scales with respect to the seismic moment magnitude at M-w 5.5 by correcting filtered phase amplitudes for attenuation with distance and source depth. Expected errors in epicentral distance and in source depth (25% and 20 km, respectively) translate into magnitude errors of 0.1-0.3 units. We validate our magnitude relations with an independent test dataset of 2600 synthetic marsquakes (1.0 <= M-w <= 7.0), for which seismograms are superimposed on the realistic noise predicted by the InSight noise model. Marsquakes with M-w < 3.0 and epicentral distances of Delta > 15 degrees are expected to be hidden in the Mars background noise and will likely not be detectable.

J	Seroussi, H; Morlighem, M				Seroussi, Helene; Morlighem, Mathieu			Representation of basal melting at the grounding line in ice flow models	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							PINE ISLAND GLACIER; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SHEET MODELS; WEST ANTARCTICA; SHELF; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; PARAMETERIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE	While a lot of attention has been given to the numerical implementation of grounding lines and basal friction in the grounding zone, little has been done about the impact of the numerical treatment of ocean-induced basal melting in this region. Several strategies are currently being employed in the ice sheet modeling community, and the resulting grounding line dynamics may differ strongly, which ultimately adds significant uncertainty to the projected contribution of marine ice sheets to sea level rise. We investigate here several implementations of basal melt parameterization on partially floating elements in a finite-element framework, based on the Marine Ice Sheet-Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (MISOMIP) setup: (1) melt applied only to entirely floating elements, (2) melt applied over all elements that are crossed by the grounding line, and (3) melt integrated partially over the floating portion of a finite element using two different sub-element integration methods. All methods converge towards the same state when the mesh resolution is fine enough. However, (2) and (3) will systematically overestimate the rate of grounding line retreat in coarser resolutions, while (1) converges faster to the solution in most cases. The differences between sub-element parameterizations are exacerbated for experiments with high melting rates in the vicinity of the grounding line and for a Weertman sliding law. As most real-world simulations use horizontal mesh resolutions of several hundreds of meters at best, and high melt rates are generally present close to the grounding lines, we recommend not using (3) to avoid overestimating the rate of grounding line retreat and to carefully assess the impact of mesh resolution and sub-element melt parameterizations on all simulation results.

J	Kwok, R				Kwok, R.			Arctic sea ice thickness, volume, and multiyear ice coverage: losses and coupled variability (1958-2018)	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Arctic sea ice thickness; Arctic sea ice volume; Arctic multiyear sea ice coverage	GREENLAND; OCEAN	Large-scale changes in Arctic sea ice thickness, volume and multiyear sea ice (MYI) coverage with available measurements from submarine sonars, satellite altimeters (ICESat and CryoSat-2), and satellite scatterometers are summarized. The submarine record spans the period between 1958 and 2000, the satellite altimeter records between 2003 and 2018, and the scatterometer records between 1999 and 2017. Regional changes in ice thickness (since 1958) and within the data release area of the Arctic Ocean, previously reported by Kwok and Rothrock (2009 Geophys. Res. Lea. 36 L15501), have been updated to include the 8 years of CryoSat-2 (CS-2) retrievals. Between the pre-1990 submarine period (1958-1976) and the CS-2 period (2011-2018) the average thickness near the end of the melt season, in six regions, decreased by 2.0 m or some 66% over six decades. Within the data release area (similar to 38% of the Arctic Ocean) of submarine ice draft, the thinning of similar to 1.75 m in winter since 1980 (maximum thickness of 3.64 m in the regression analysis) has not changed significantly; the mean thickness over the CS-2 period is similar to 2 m. The 15 year satellite record depicts losses in sea ice volume at 2870 km(3)/decade and 5130 km(3)/decade in winter (February-March) and fall (October-November), respectively: more moderate trends compared to the sharp decreases over the ICESat period, where the losses were weighted by record-setting melt in 2007. Over the scatterometer record (1999-2017), the Arctic has lost more than 2 x 10(6) km(2) of MYI-a decrease of more than 50%; MYI now covers less than one-third of the Arctic Ocean. Independent MYI coverage and volume records co-vary in time, the MYI area anomalies explain similar to 85% of the variance in the anomalies in Arctic sea ice volume. If losses of MYI continue, Arctic thickness/volume will be controlled by seasonal ice, suggesting that the thickness/volume trends will be more moderate (as seen here) but more sensitive to climate forcing.

Comparison of Small- and Large-Footprint Lidar Characterization of Tropical Forest Aboveground Structure and Biomass: A Case Study From Central Gabon	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						AfriSAR; and ice sensor (LVIS); Gabon; Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI); land; lidar; tropical forest; vegetation	WAVE-FORM LIDAR; AIRBORNE SCANNING LASER; SUBCANOPY ELEVATION; MAPPING BIOMASS; CARBON STOCKS; TREE HEIGHT; RAIN-FOREST; VALIDATION; VEGETATION; ALTIMETER	NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission has been designed to measure forest structure using lidar waveforms to sample the earth's vegetation while in orbit aboard the International Space Station. In this paper, we used airborne large-footprint (LF) lidar measurements to simulate GEDI observations from which we retrieved ground elevation, vegetation height, and aboveground biomass (AGB). GEDI-like product accuracy was then assessed by comparing them to similar products derived from airborne small-footprint (SF) lidar measurements. The study focused on tropical forests and used data collected during the NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) AfriSAR ground and airborne campaigns in the Lope National Park in Central Gabon. The measurements covered a gradient of successional stages of forest development with different height, canopy density, and topography. The comparison of the two sensors shows that LF lidar waveforms and simulated waveforms from SF lidar are equivalent in their ability to estimate ground elevation (RMSE = 0.5 m, bias = 0.29 m) and maximum forest height (RMSE = 2.99 m, bias = 0.24 m) over the study area. The difference in the AGB estimated from both lidar instruments at the 1-ha spatial scale is small over the entire study area (RMSE = 6.34 Mg.ha(-1), bias = 11.27 Mg.ha(-1)) and the bias is attributed to the impact of ground slopes greater than 10-20 degrees on the LF lidar measurements of forest height. Our results support the ability of GEDILF lidar to measure the complex structure of humid tropical forests and provide AGB estimates comparable to SF-derived ones.

SLAP: Simultaneous Localization and Planning Under Uncertainty via Dynamic Replanning in Belief Space	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Belief space; motion planning; mobile robots; partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP); robust; rollout; uncertainty	OPTIMAL FEEDBACK-CONTROL; MOTION UNCERTAINTY; ROBOTIC TASKS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; NAVIGATION	Simultaneous localization and planning (SLAP) is a crucial ability for an autonomous robot operating under uncertainty. In its most general form, SLAP induces a continuous partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which needs to be repeatedly solved online. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space. The underlying POMDP, which is continuous in state, action, and observation space, is approximated offline via sampling-based methods, but operates in a replanning loop online to admit local improvements to the coarse offline policy. This construct enables the proposed method to combat changing environments and large localization errors, even when the change alters the homotopy class of the optimal trajectory. It further outperforms the state-of-the-art Feedback-based Information RoadMap (FIRM) method by eliminating unnecessary stabilization steps. Applying belief space planning to physical systems brings with it a plethora of challenges. A key focus of this paper is to implement the proposed planner on a physical robot and show the SLAP solution performance under uncertainty, in changing environments and in the presence of large disturbances, such as a kidnapped robot situation.

Evaluation of a Data Assimilation System for Land Surface Models Using CLM4.5	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; ADAPTIVE COVARIANCE INFLATION; SOUTHWESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; SUB-ALPINE FOREST; LEAF-AREA INDEX; TERRESTRIAL CARBON; SOIL-MOISTURE; ECOSYSTEM MODEL; DATA FUSION; WATER AVAILABILITY	The magnitude and persistence of land carbon (C) pools influence long-term climate feedbacks. Interactive ecological processes influence land C pools and our understanding of these processes is imperfect so land surface models have errors and biases when compared to each other and to real observations. Here we implement an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), a sequential state data assimilation technique to reduce these errors and biases. We implement the EAKF using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed coupled with the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5 in CESM 1.2). We assimilated simulated and real satellite observations for a site in central New Mexico, United States. A series of observing system simulation experiments allowed assessment of the data assimilation system without model error. This showed that assimilating biomass and leaf area index observations decreased model error in C dynamics forecasts (29% using biomass observations and 40% using leaf area index observations) and that assimilation in combination shows greater improvement (51% using both observation streams). Assimilating real observations highlighted likely model structural errors and we implemented an adaptive model-variance-inflation technique to allow the model to track the observations. Monthly and longer model forecasts using real observations were improved relative to forecasts without data assimilation. The reliable forecast lead-time varied by model pool and is dependent on how tightly the C pool is coupled to meteorologically driven processes. The EAKF and similar state data assimilation techniques could reduce errors in projections of the land C sink and provide more robust forecasts of C pools and land-atmosphere exchanges. Plain Language Summary The amount of carbon stored in vegetation and soils is an important control on how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere, and that influences future climate. Land surface models are used to simulate where this carbon is, but they are imperfect and there are often differences between model predictions and observations of the carbon stores. Here we describe a system that combines model predictions and observations and updates the modeled carbon stores so they are closer to the observations, considering uncertainty in both the model and the observations. We test our system at a location in New Mexico, United States, where we use observations from satellites of the amount of leaves on the vegetation and the amount of carbon stored in the vegetation. When we combine these observations with our land surface model there are large changes in the predicted amounts of stored carbon and the times of the year when the vegetation has the most leaves. These changes persist in the model after we stop updating it with observations, improving the model forecast.	[Fox, Andrew M.; Smith, William K.; MacBean, Natasha; Moore, David J.

Constraining Aging Processes of Black Carbon in the Community Atmosphere Model Using Environmental Chamber Measurements	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							LIGHT-ABSORPTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MIXING STATE; REACTIVE GASES; URBAN HAZE; AEROSOLS; CHINA; HYGROSCOPICITY; ENHANCEMENT; PARTICLES	The direct radiative forcing of black carbon aerosol (BC) on the Earth system remains unsettled, largely due to the uncertainty with physical properties of BC throughout their lifecycle. Here we show that ambient chamber measurements of BC properties provide a novel constraint on the crude BC aging representation in climate models. Observational evidence for significant absorption enhancement of BC can be reproduced when the aging processes in the four-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4) aerosol scheme in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 are calibrated by the recent in situ chamber measurements. An observation-based scaling method is developed in the aging timescale calculation to alleviate the influence of biases in the simulated model chemical composition. Model sensitivity simulations suggest that the different monolayer settings in the BC aging parameterization of MAM4 can cause as large as 26% and 24% differences in BC burden and radiative forcing, respectively. We also find that an increase in coating materials (e.g., sulfate and secondary organic aerosols) reduces BC lifetime by increasing the hygroscopicity of the mixture but enhances its absorption, resulting in a net increase in BC direct radiative forcing. Our results suggest that accurate simulations of BC aging processes as well as other aerosol species are equally important in reducing the uncertainty of BC forcing estimation. Plain Language Summary Following carbon dioxide, black carbon particle (BC) is the second climate warming agent in the Earth system. However, BC radiative effect in most global climate models (GCM) varies by a factor of 2. The uncertainty mainly arises from the transformation of BC in the atmosphere during its lifecycle and the corresponding treatment in models. Recently, a series of BC chamber experiments were conducted over two polluted regions around the world, Beijing, China, and Houston, USA, to characterize BC aging processes. In this study, we capitalize those direct observations to calibrate a key parameter associated with BC lifetime and physical property in a GCM. Our work also illustrates the importance of the coating materials of aged BC on its radiative and climate impacts. Hence, our study calls on the deployment of the ambient smoke chamber over more places and development of a reliable aerosol composition data set with a global coverage to better constrain the BC forcing assessment.

Degradation of 100-m-Scale Rocky Ejecta Craters at the InSight Landing Site on Mars and Implications for Surface Processes and Erosion Rates in the Hesperian and Amazonian	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						InSight; impact craters; Erosion rates; Mars; Elysium Planitia; surface processes	SMALL IMPACT CRATERS; MARTIAN HIGHLANDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SINUS SABAEUS; CONSTRAINTS; MORPHOMETRY; STRATIGRAPHY; DENUDATION; CHRONOLOGY; MORPHOLOGY	Plain Language Summary Rocky ejecta craters (RECs) at the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) landing site on Elysium Planitia, Mars, provide constraints on crater modification and rates for the Hesperian and Amazonian. The RECs are between 10m and 1.2km in diameter and exhibit five classes of preservation. Class 1 represents pristine craters with sharp rims and abundant ejected rocks. From Classes 2 to 5, rims become more subdued, craters are infilled, and the ejecta become discontinuously distributed. High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment digital elevation models indicate a maximum depth to diameter ratio of 0.15, which is lower than pristine models for craters of similar size. The low ratio is related to the presence of a loosely consolidated regolith and early-stage eolian infill. Rim heights have an average height to diameter ratio of 0.03 for the most pristine class. The size-frequency distribution of RECs, plotted using cumulative and differential methods, indicates that crater classes within the diameter range of 200m to 1.2km are separated by 100 to 200Myr. Smaller craters degrade faster, with classes separated by <100Myr. Rim erosion can be entirely modeled by nonlinear diffusional processes using the calculated timescales and a constant diffusivity of 8x10(-7)m(2)/year for craters 200 to 500m in diameter. Diffusion models only partly capture depth-related degradation, which requires eolian infill. Depth degradation and rim erosion rates are 10(-2) to 10(-3)m/Myr, respectively. The rates are consistent with relatively slow modification that is typical of the last two epochs of Martian history. The shape and form of impact craters on Mars can tell us something about processes that operate on the surface and therefore inform our understanding of the planet's climate. Small, 100-m-scale craters have a known bowl-shaped form in their pristine state. Over time, wind, gravity, and, in some cases, ice and water, degrade them to nearly flat landforms. This study analyzes the degradational sequence of craters at the InSight landing site to infer something about surface processes and climate history at this location. InSight is a geophysical mission that is set to land on Elysium Planitia in November 2018. The craters show a broad range of morphologies that suggest slow, long-term degradation. The data indicate that over time, ejected rocks and crater rims disappear at rates that suggest degradation by dry processes like gravity failure and wind erosion. Furthermore, the craters also show evidence of being filled, likely by wind-driven sand. The calculated rim erosion rates and infill rates are similar to other landing sites on Mars and suggest a cold, hyperarid climate. This is consistent with the age and equatorial location of the terrain, which formed well after the warmer and wetter period of Mars history.	[Sweeney, J.; Warner, N.

DES meets Gaia: discovery of strongly lensed quasars from a multiplet search	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing; surveys	DARK ENERGY SURVEY; SKY SURVEY; GALAXY; SELECTION; SYSTEMS	We report the discovery, spectroscopic confirmation, and first lens models of the first, strongly lensed quasars from a combined search in WISE and Gaia-DR1 over the DES footprint. Their Einstein radii span a range between approximate to 2.0 arcsec and approximate to 0.4 arcsec. Two of these (WGD2038-4008, RA = 20: 38: 02.65, Dec. = -40: 08: 14.64; WGD2021-4115, RA = 20: 21: 39.45, Dec. = -41:15:57.11) also have confirmed deflector redshifts. The four-image lens WGD2038-4008, with source and deflector redshifts s = 0.777 +/- 0.001 and z(l) = 0.230 +/- 0.002, respectively, has a deflector with radius R-eff approximate to 3.4 arcsec, stellar mass log(M-star /M-circle dot) = 11.64(-0.43)(+ 0.20), and extended isophotal shape variation. Simple lens models yield Einstein radii R-E = (1.30 +/- 0.04) arcsec, axis ratio q = 0.75 +/- 0.1 (compatible with that of the starlight) and considerable shear-ellipticity degeneracies. The two-image lens WGD2021-4115 has z(s) = 1.390 +/- 0.001 and z(l) = 0.335 +/- 0.002, and Einstein radius R-E = (1.1 +/- 0.1) arcsec, but higher-resolution imaging is needed to accurately separate the deflector and faint quasar image. Analogous lens model degeneracies hold for the other six lenses (J0146-1133, J0150-4041, J0235-2433, J0245-0556, J0259-2338, and J0508-2748) shown in this paper.

Survey geometry and the internal consistency of recent cosmic shear measurements	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; methods: data analysis; methods: statistical	COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; ACCURATE HALO-MODEL; 2-POINT STATISTICS; DARK ENERGY; MASSIVE NEUTRINOS; POWER SPECTRA; CFHTLENS; CATALOG	We explore the impact of an update to the typical approximation for the shape noise term in the analytic covariance matrix for cosmic shear experiments that assumes the absence of survey boundary and mask effects. We present an exact expression for the number of galaxy pairs in this term based on the survey mask, which leads to more than a factor of three increase in the shape noise on the largest measured scales for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-450) real-space cosmic shear data. We compare the result of this analytic expression to several alternative methods for measuring the shape noise from the data and find excellent agreement. This update to the covariance resolves any internal model tension evidenced by the previously large cosmological best-fitting chi(2) for the KiDS-450 cosmic shear data. The best-fitting chi(2) is reduced from 161 to 121 for 118 degrees of freedom. We also apply a correction to how the multiplicative shear calibration uncertainty is included in the covariance. This change shifts the inferred amplitude of the correlation function to higher values. We find that this improves agreement of the KiDS-450 cosmic shear results with Dark Energy Survey Year 1 and Planck results.	[Troxel, M.

A dust twin of Cas A: cool dust and 21 mu m silicate dust feature in the supernova remnant G54.1+0.3	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: individual: G54.1+0.3; dust, extinction; infrared: ISM	WIND NEBULA G54.1+0.3; PULSAR WIND; CRAB-NEBULA; GRAIN DESTRUCTION; EMISSION FEATURE; EARLY UNIVERSE; COLD DUST; CASSIOPEIA; HERSCHEL; EVOLUTION	We present infrared (IR) and submillimetre observations of the Crab-like supernova remnant (SNR) G54.1+0.3 including 350 mu m (SHARC-II), 870 mu m (LABOCA), 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mu m (Herschel), and 3-40 mu m (Spitzer). We detect dust features at 9, 11, and 21 mu m and a long-wavelength continuum dust component. The 21 mu m dust coincides with [Ar II] ejecta emission, and the feature is remarkably similar to that in Cas A. The IRAC 8 mu m image including Ar ejecta is distributed in a shell-like morphology which is coincident with dust features, suggesting that dust has formed in the ejecta. We create a cold dust map that shows excess emission in the northwestern shell. We fit the spectral energy distribution of the SNR using the continuous distributions of ellipsoidal grain model of pre-solar grain SiO2 that reproduces the 21 and 9 mu m dust features and discuss grains of silicon carbide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that may be responsible for the 10-13 mu m dust features. To reproduce the long-wavelength continuum, we explore models consisting of different grains including Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, Al2O3, FeS, carbon, and Fe3O4. We tested a model with a temperature-dependent silicate absorption coefficient. We detect cold dust (27-44 K) in the remnant, making this the fourth such SNR with freshly formed dust. The total dust mass in the SNR ranges from 0.08 to 0.9 M-circle dot depending on the grain composition, which is comparable to predicted masses from theoretical models. Our estimated dust masses are consistent with the idea that SNe are a significant source of dust in the early Universe.

A Global Analysis of Wildfire Smoke Injection Heights Derived from Space-Based Multi-Angle Imaging	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						MISR; biomass burning; smoke plume height	TRANSPORT MODELS; PLUME RISE; MISR; FIRES	We present an analysis of over 23,000 globally distributed wildfire smoke plume injection heights derived from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) space-based, multi-angle stereo imaging. Both pixel-weighted and aerosol optical depth (AOD)-weighted results are given, stratified by region, biome, and month or season. This offers an observational resource for assessing first-principle plume-rise modelling, and can provide some constraints on smoke dispersion modelling for climate and air quality applications. The main limitation is that the satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit, crossing the equator at about 10:30 a.m. local time on the day side. Overall, plumes occur preferentially during the northern mid-latitude burning season, and the vast majority inject smoke near-surface. However, the heavily forested regions of North and South America, and Africa produce the most frequent elevated plumes and the highest AOD values; some smoke is injected to altitudes well above 2 km in nearly all regions and biomes. Planetary boundary layer (PBL) versus free troposphere injection is a critical factor affecting smoke dispersion and environmental impact, and is affected by both the smoke injection height and the PBL height; an example assessment is made here, but constraining the PBL height for this application warrants further work.
