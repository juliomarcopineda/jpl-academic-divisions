The array has an active area of 0.96 x 0.96 mm, making it the largest SNSPD array reported to date in terms of both active area and pixel count. Using a 64-channel time-tagging readout, we have characterized the array's yield, efficiency, and timing resolution.

For the presented setup, it is assumed that normalized velocity measurements are available from the camera. By applying results from nonlinear observer theory, we present velocity estimators with proven global stability under defined conditions, and without the need to observe features from several camera frames. Several nonlinear methods are compared with each other, also against an extended Kalman filter (EKF), where the robustness of the nonlinear methods compared with the EKF are demonstrated in simulations and experiments.

We detected hydrated silica in Jezero crater, the landing site of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Mars 2020 rover mission, by applying Dynamic Aperture Factor Analysis/Target Transformation to images from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars. Hydrated silica detections with Dynamic Aperture Factor Analysis/Target Transformation were verified using commonly accepted Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars analysis methods. The morphology of geologic units associated with silica was characterized with high-resolution imaging. Several hypotheses are presented for the formation environment of hydrated silica. All are testable via in situ investigation. We assess the likelihood of silica to preserve biosignatures in these different scenarios based on habitability considerations and biosignature preservation in Earth analog environments and materials. Also reported are possible detections of hydrated silica in the Nili Fossae basement and olivine-rich units, as well as Al-phyllosilicate within Jezero crater.	[Tarnas, J. D.; Mustard, J.

The water line emission and ortho-to-para ratio in the Orion Bar photon-dominated region	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: molecules; ISM: individual objects: Orion Bar; photon-dominated region; ISM: lines and bands; submillimeter: ISM	SUBMILLIMETER OBSERVATIONS; PHOTODISSOCIATION REGIONS; INTERSTELLAR WATER; RADIATION-FIELD; CHEMISTRY; DENSITY; ICE; PHOTODESORPTION; MODEL; GAS	Context. The ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of water in the interstellar medium (ISM) is often assumed to be related to the formation temperature of water molecules, making it a potentially interesting tracer of the thermal history of interstellar gas. Aims. A very low OPR of 0.1-0.5 was previously reported in the Orion Bar photon-dominated region (PDR), based on observations of two optically thin (H2O)-O-18 lines which were analyzed by using a single-slab large velocity gradient (LVG) model. The corresponding spin temperature does not coincide with the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas in this UV-illuminated region. This was interpreted as an indication of water molecules being formed on cold icy grains which were subsequently released by UV photodesorption. Methods. A more complete set of water observations in the Orion Bar, including seven (H2O)-O-16 lines and one (H2O)-O-18 line, carried out using Herschel/HIFI instrument, was reanalyzed using the Meudon PDR code to derive gas-phase water abundance and the OPR. The model takes into account the steep density and temperature gradients present in the region. Results. The model line intensities are in good agreement with the observations assuming that water molecules formed with an OPR corresponding to thermal equilibrium conditions at the local kinetic temperature of the gas and when solely considering gas-phase chemistry and water gas-grain exchanges through adsorption and desorption. Gas-phase water is predicted to arise from a region deep into the cloud, corresponding to a visual extinction of A(V) similar to 9, with a (H2O)-O-16 fractional abundance of similar to 2 x 10(-7) and column density of (1.4 +/- 0.8) x 10(15) cm(-2) for a total cloud depth of A(V) = 15. A line-of-sight average OPR of 2.8 +/- 0.2 is derived. Conclusions. The observational data are consistent with a nuclear spin isomer repartition corresponding to the thermal equilibrium at a temperature of 36 +/- 2 K, much higher than the spin temperature previously reported for this region and close to the gas kinetic temperature in the water-emitting gas.

Beyond the most discussed biosignature gas O-2, only a handful of gases have been considered in detail. In this study, we evaluate phosphine (PH3). On Earth, PH3 is associated with anaerobic ecosystems, and as such, it is a potential biosignature gas in anoxic exoplanets. We simulate the atmospheres of habitable terrestrial planets with CO2- and H-2-dominated atmospheres and find that PH3 can accumulate to detectable concentrations on planets with surface production fluxes of 10(10) to 10(14) cm(-2) s(-1) (corresponding to surface concentrations of 10s of ppb to 100s of ppm), depending on atmospheric composition and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. While high, the surface flux values are comparable to the global terrestrial production rate of methane or CH4 (10(11) cm(-2) s(-1)) and below the maximum local terrestrial PH3 production rate (10(14) cm(-2) s(-1)). As with other gases, PH3 can more readily accumulate on low-UV planets, for example, planets orbiting quiet M dwarfs or with a photochemically generated UV shield. PH3 has three strong spectral features such that in any atmosphere scenario one of the three will be unique compared with other dominant spectroscopic molecules. Phosphine's weakness as a biosignature gas is its high reactivity, requiring high outgassing rates for detectability. We calculate that tens of hours of JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) time are required for a potential detection of PH3. Yet, because PH3 is spectrally active in the same wavelength regions as other atmospherically important molecules (such as H2O and CH4), searches for PH3 can be carried out at no additional observational cost to searches for other molecular species relevant to characterizing exoplanet habitability. Phosphine is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known abiotic false positives on terrestrial planets from any source that could generate the high fluxes required for detection.

The pathways of mCDW towards grounding lines are crucial as they directly control the heat reaching the ice. A realistic representation of mCDW circulation, however, remains challenging due to the sparsity of in-situ observations and the difficulty of ocean models to reproduce the available observations. In this study, we use an unprecedentedly high-resolution (200 m horizontal and 10 m vertical grid spacing) ocean model that resolves shelf-sea and sub-ice-shelf environments in qualitative agreement with existing observations during austral summer conditions. We demonstrate that the waters reaching the Pine Island and Thwaites grounding lines follow specific, topographically-constrained routes, all passing through a relatively small area located around 104 degrees W and 74.3 degrees S. The temporal and spatial variabilities of ice shelf melt rates are dominantly controlled by the sub-ice shelf ocean current. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate and high-resolution ocean bathymetry and subglacial topography for determining mCDW pathways and ice shelf melt rates.

The role of cyclone activity in snow accumulation on Arctic sea ice	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ERA-INTERIM; EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONES; VARIABILITY; DEPTH; BEHAVIOR; IDENTIFICATION; OPERATION; SYSTEM	Identifying the mechanisms controlling the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation on sea ice is crucial for understanding snow's net effect on the surface energy budget and sea-ice mass balance. Here, we analyze the role of cyclone activity on the seasonal buildup of snow on Arctic sea ice using model, satellite, and in situ data over 1979-2016. On average, 44% of the variability in monthly snow accumulation was controlled by cyclone snowfall and 29% by sea-ice freeze-up. However, there were strong spatio-temporal differences. Cyclone snowfall comprised similar to 50% of total snowfall in the Pacific compared to 83% in the Atlantic. While cyclones are stronger in the Atlantic, Pacific snow accumulation is more sensitive to cyclone strength. These findings highlight the heterogeneity in atmosphere-snow-ice interactions across the Arctic, and emphasize the need to scrutinize mechanisms governing cyclone activity to better understand their effects on the Arctic snow-ice system with anthropogenic warming.

In particular, we focus on the upper atmospheric responses to atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves generated during impulsive surface disturbance events including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and explosions. We review the theoretical background for the generation and propagation of atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves from surface disturbance events as well as of the ionospheric plasma response to such acoustic-gravity waves. We review a variety of observational techniques that have been successfully utilized to detect upper atmospheric perturbations induced by surface disturbances and summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge on the coupling processes learnt from these observations.

We report here measurements of volume mixing ratios in Gale Crater using the SAM quadrupole mass spectrometer, obtained over a period of nearly 5 years (3 Mars years) from landing. The observation period spans the northern summer of MY 31 and solar longitude (L-S) of 175 degrees through spring of MY 34, L-S = 12 degrees. This work expands upon prior reports of the mixing ratios measured by SAM QMS in the first 105 sols of the mission. The SAM QMS atmospheric measurements were taken periodically, with a cumulative coverage of four or five experiments per season on Mars. Major observations include the seasonal cycle of CO2, N-2, and Ar, which lags approximately 20-40 degrees of L-S behind the pressure cycle driven by CO2 condensation and sublimation from the winter poles. This seasonal cycle indicates that transport occurs on faster timescales than mixing. The mixing ratio of O-2 shows significant seasonal and interannual variability, suggesting an unknown atmospheric or surface process at work. The O-2 measurements are compared to several parameters, including dust optical depth and trace CH4 measurements by Curiosity. We derive annual mean volume mixing ratios for the atmosphere in Gale Crater: CO2 = 0.951 (+/- 0.003), N-2 = 0.0259 (+/- 0.0006), Ar-40 = 0.0194 (+/- 0.0004), O-2 = 1.61 (+/- 0.09) x 10(-3), and CO = 5.8 (+/- 0.8) x 10(-4).

Electron Densities and Nitrogen Abundances in Ionized Gas Derived Using [N ii] Fine-structure and Hydrogen Recombination Lines	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Hii regions; ISM: abundances; ISM: clouds; local interstellar matter	GALACTIC PLANE SURVEY; REGIONS; GALAXIES; OXYGEN	We present a method for deriving the electron density of ionized gas using the ratio of the intensity of the [N ii] 205 ?m line to that of hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs). We use this method to derive electron densities of 21 velocity components in 11 lines of sight through the Galaxy, including the Galactic center. We observed, at high spectral resolution, the [N ii] 205 ?m with the Herschel/HIFI and SOFIA/GREAT instruments and the RRLs with the Green Bank Telescope and the NASA Deep Space Network Deep Space Station 43 (DSS-43) telescope. We find typical electron densities between 8 and 170 cm(?3), which are consistent with those derived at low spectral resolution using the [N ii] 205 ?m/122 ?m ratio with Herschel/PACS on a larger sample of sight lines in the Galactic plane. By matching the electron densities derived from the [N ii] 205 ?m/RRL intensity ratio and the [N ii] 122 ?m/205 ?m intensity ratio, we derive the nitrogen fractional abundance for most of the velocity components. We investigate the dependence of the N/H ratio on galactocentric distance in the inner Galaxy (R-gal<6 kpc), which is inaccessible in optical studies owing to dust extinction. We find that the distribution of nitrogen abundances in the inner Galaxy derived from our data has a slope that is consistent with that found in the outer Galaxy in optical studies. This result is inconsistent with some suggestions of a flatter distribution of the nitrogen abundance in the inner Galaxy.	[Pineda, Jorge L.; Langer, William D.; Goldsmith, Paul F.; Kuiper, Thomas B.

A Search for Late-time Radio Emission and Fast Radio Bursts from Superluminous Supernovae	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Extragalactic radio sources; Radio bursts; Supernovae; Radio interferometry	PULSAR; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; TRANSIENTS; DIVERSITY; BIRTH	We present results of a search for late-time radio emission and fast radio bursts (FRBs) from a sample of type-I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). We used the Karl G.;Jansky Very Large Array to observe 10 SLSN-I more than 5 yr old at a frequency of 3;GHz. We searched fast-sampled visibilities for FRBs and used the same data to perform a deep imaging search for late-time radio emission expected in models of magnetar-powered supernovae. No FRBs were found. One SLSN-I, PTF10hgi, is detected in deep imaging, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.2;;10(28) erg s(?1). This luminosity, considered with the recent 6;GHz detection of PTF10hgi in Eftekhari et al., supports the interpretation that it is powered by a young, fast-spinning (?ms spin period) magnetar with ?15 M of partially ionized ejecta. Broadly, our observations are most consistent with SLSNe-I being powered by neutron stars with fast spin periods, although most require more free?free absorption than is inferred for PTF10hgi. We predict that radio observations at higher frequencies or in the near future will detect these systems and begin constraining properties of the young pulsars and their birth environments.	[Law, C.

Planetary heat flow estimates can thus provide critical insights into the thermal state of a planet and the bulk distribution of the HPE. The lack of appreciable lithospheric deflection in the north polar region of Mars by the weight of the polar ice cap is suggestive of low heat flow. Here we model the deflection of the Martian lithosphere and show that the present-day mantle heat flow cannot exceed 7 mW m(-2) in the north polar region of Mars. Our mantle heat flow estimate is notably lower than the heat flow expected from a chondritic mantle suggesting the Martian mantle to be depleted in HPE. If our result is globally representative, lower levels of heat generation in the planet's mantle may have inhibited widespread late-stage volcanism on Mars.

The 2000 earthquake ruptured an extensive fault system over a distance of similar to 150 km including the entire 60-km long onshore segment of the Weitin fault and its offshore continuation southeast of New Ireland. The northern portion of the onshore Weitin fault segment ruptured again in 2019. Most of the moment was released by a compact, shallow, high stress-drop slip patch on the northwestern continuation of the Weitin fault in the Saint George Channel, which was brought closer to failure by the 2000 earthquake. The two ruptures overlap over about 20 km but in fact mostly complement each other. Large dynamic stresses may have driven the partial rerupture of the Weitin fault during the 2019 event.

Both SABER and MLS show a rapid global H2O increase of 5-6% per decade in the lower stratosphere after the 2001 drop. The increasing zonal mean H2O at 40 degrees N in SABER and MLS is consistent with the Boulder frost point hygrometer data in the lower stratosphere. The global distribution of SABER and MLS H2O trends are positive at most altitudes and latitudes, and they peak in the tropical lower stratosphere. In the mesosphere the SABER H2O trend is 0.1-0.2 ppmv per decade and the MLS H2O trend is 0.2-0.3 ppmv per decade. The trend and solar cycle response derived from the observations are compared against the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). The solar cycle response of H2O from WACCM agrees with SABER and MLS. The linear H2O trend from WACCM does not show the observed increase in the lower stratosphere.

Environmental impacts on the flux of mass through deep convection	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						convection; ensemble; sensitivity analysis	MICROPHYSICS PARAMETERIZATION; TRANSITION; RADAR	Though deep convective clouds are important to numerous aspects of the climate system, they remain a source of much uncertainty. The varying large-scale dynamics, relatively short development time, range of spatial scales, and complex microphysics involved in deep convection lead to difficulty in both observation of these clouds and modelling their impacts on larger spatial and longer temporal scales. This study utilizes an ensemble of high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations of deep convection forming in a spectrum of different environments to explore the sensitivity of deep convection, and in particular convective mass flux to changes in the initial conditions. We find that convection strength is strongly sensitive to small perturbations in the environment, specifically the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and boundary-layer humidity. That storm effects on the environment, such as mass transport and tropospheric moistening through detrainment, are sensitive to these initial conditions points to the importance of better representing such parameters in global models.

Design and performance of hafnium optical and near-IR kinetic inductance detectors	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTING TUNNEL-JUNCTIONS; SPECTROMETERS; FILMS	We report on the design and performance of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) sensitive to single photons in the optical to near-infrared range using hafnium as the sensor material. Our test device had a superconducting transition temperature of 395 mK and a room temperature normal state resistivity of 97 mu Omega cm with RRR = 1.6. Resonators on the device displayed internal quality factors of around 200 000. Similar to the analysis of MKIDs made from other highly resistive superconductors, we find that modeling the temperature response of the detector requires an extra broadening parameter in the superconducting density of states. Finally, we show that this material and design is compatible with a full-array fabrication process, which resulted in pixels with decay times of about 40 mu s and resolving powers of similar to 9 at 800 nm.

Ensemble mean biases and Brier Skill Scores are examined for no, moderate, and high levels of AR activity (0, 1-2, and 3-7 AR days/week, respectively). All hindcast systems are more skillful in predicting no and high AR activity relative to moderate activity. There are isolated regions of skill at week-3 over 150-125 degrees W, 25-35 degrees N for the no and high AR activity levels, with larger magnitude and spatial extent of the skill in ECMWF and ECCC compared to NCEP. The spatial pattern of this skill suggests that for high AR activity, a southwest-to-northeast orientation is more predictable at subseasonal lead times than other orientations, and for no AR activity, more skill exists in the subtropical North Pacific, upstream of central and southern California. AR hindcast skill along the western U.S. is most strongly increased in hindcasts initialized during MaddenJulian Oscillation (MJO) Phases 1 and 8, and hindcast skill is substantially decreased over California in hindcasts initialized during MJO Phase 4. Skill modulations in the ECMWF hindcast system conditioned on El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase are weaker than those conditioned on particular MJO phases. This work provides hindcast skill benchmarks and uncertainty quantification for experimental real-time forecasts of AR activity during winters 2019-2021 as part of the S2S Prediction Project Real-time Pilot Initiative in collaboration with the California Department of Water Resources.

Vortex-Wide Detection of Large Aspherical NAT Particles in the Arctic Winter 2011/12 Stratosphere	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						polar winter; stratosphere; denitrification; nitric acid trihydrate; infrared limb sounding	NITRIC-ACID TRIHYDRATE; LARGE HNO3-CONTAINING PARTICLES; OZONE LOSS; HETEROGENEOUS FORMATION; SPECTROSCOPIC EVIDENCE; VAPOR-PRESSURES; POLAR; DENITRIFICATION; ICE; CLOUDS	Micron-sized HNO3-containing particles in polar stratospheric clouds are known to denitrify the polar winter stratosphere and support chemical ozone loss. We show that populations of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles with volume-equivalent median radii of 3-7 mu m can be detected vortex-wide by means of infrared limb sounding. Key for detection are the applied optical characteristics of highly aspherical particles consisting of the beta-NAT phase. Spectroscopic signatures and ambient conditions of detected populations show that these particles play a key role in denitrification of the Arctic winter stratosphere. Complementary gas-phase HNO3 observations indicate collocated highly efficient HNO3 sequestration within days and are consistent with measured spectral signals of populations of large NAT particles. High amounts of condensed gas-phase equivalent HNO3 exceeding 10 ppbv and long persistence of detected populations, despite expected gravitational settling, imply that our understanding of the particles is incomplete.

Investigating the behaviour of the CRI-MECH gas-phase chemistry scheme on a regional scale for different seasons using the WRF-Chem model	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						WRF-Chem model; Trace species; Diurnal; Seasonal; Model validation	AIR-QUALITY; WEATHER RESEARCH; FORECASTING-MODEL; GLOBAL CHEMISTRY; MACC REANALYSIS; LAND-SURFACE; MECHANISM; OZONE; EMISSIONS; PARAMETERIZATION	The behaviour of the CRI-MECH chemistry scheme was investigated over North-West Europe for the first week of each month for the year of 2015 using the mesoscale non-hydrostatic 3-D meteorological model, WRF-Chem. The model simulations of the distribution of important trace gas species (e.g. ozone, CO, NO, NO2 and SO2) were compared with ground-based measurements of selected rural and urban areas in UK. The model validation using the UK Defra Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) measured data from sites across the UK showed a reasonable agreement between model-measurement for ozone (R = 0.45 for rural sites and R = 0.34 for urban sites), for NO2 (R = 0.65 for rural sites and R = 0.45 for urban sites) and for NO (R = 0.35 for rural sites and R = 0.22 for urban sites). However, a poor correlation between model-measurement is found for CO (R = 0.15 for urban sites) and for SO2 (R = 0.1 for rural sites and R = 0.27 for urban sites). Further investigations showed a poorer performance of the model ozone, CO, NO and NO2 during summer and autumn months compared with winter months. The differences in model performance were most noticeable for ozone with the other species having more variance between sites and months. The possible causes for the deviations between the modelled and the measured data are discussed.	[Khan, M. A. H.; Clements, J.; Shallcross, D.

The diurnal hysteresis patterns of ecosystem fluxes and meteorological variables are important to understand the relations and interactions between vegetation and its surrounding environment. To provide new insights on hysteresis at the ecosystem scale, we systematically evaluated the differences in ecosystem fluxes between morning (time of day before the highest potential shortwave incoming) and afternoon (time of day after the highest potential shortwave incoming), as well as both biotic and abiotic driving mechanisms, using half-hourly and hourly data from 82 eddy-covariance sites in the FLUXNET2015 Tier 1 dataset. Results show that gross primary production (GPP) is slightly higher in the morning for most plant functional types (PFTs), with less water stress, yet with higher, compensating, CO2 concentration. Conversely, evapotranspiration (ET) is larger in the afternoon, with higher atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and a tendency for decreased stomatal opening, in response to daytime boundary layer warming and drying. The higher ET reduces the afternoon increase of the leaf-scale VPD compared to the atmospheric VPD. A GPP decomposition analysis suggests that changes in light use efficiency (LUE) are the main factor explaining the difference in GPP between the morning and afternoon. Additionally, simulations from an ecosystem conductance model show that plant responses to VPD are higher and interactions with the atmosphere are stronger in the afternoon. Both evaluations of LUE and responses to VPD along a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model suggest a systematic drop in leaf water potential in the afternoon affecting ecosystem stress responses. Accordingly, the hysteresis effects ultimately result in daytime variations in ET and GPP, through changes in ecosystem conductance coupled to the atmosphere.

J	Frederikse, T; Landerer, FW; Caron, L				Frederikse, Thomas; Landerer, Felix W.; Caron, Lambert			The imprints of contemporary mass redistribution on local sea level and vertical land motion observations	SOLID EARTH			English	Article							GLACIAL ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; WATER STORAGE; TIDE-GAUGE; EARTH; RISE; TRENDS; MODEL; DEGLACIATION; BUDGET; GNSS	Observations from permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations are commonly used to correct tide-gauge observations for vertical land motion (VLM). We combine GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) observations and an ensemble of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) predictions to assess and evaluate the impact of solid-Earth deformation (SED) due to contemporary mass redistribution and GIA on VLM trends derived from GNSS stations. This mass redistribution causes relative sea-level (RSL) and SED patterns that not only vary in space but also exhibit large interannual variability signals. We find that for many stations, including stations in coastal locations, this deformation causes VLM trends on the order of 1 mm yr(-1) or higher. In multiple regions, including the Amazon Basin and large parts of Australia, the SED trend flips sign between the first half and second half of the 15-year GRACE record. GNSS records often only span a few years, and due to these interannual variations SED causes substantial biases when the linear trends in these short records are extrapolated back in time. We propose a new method to avoid this potential bias in the VLM-corrected tide-gauge record: instead of correcting tide-gauge records for the observed VLM trend, we first remove the effects from GIA and contemporary mass redistributions from the VLM observations before computing the VLM trend. This procedure reduces the extrapolation bias induced by SED, and it also avoids the bias due to sea-floor deformation: SED includes net sea-floor deformation, which is ignored in global-mean sea-level reconstructions based on VLM-corrected tide-gauge data. We apply this method to 8166 GNSS stations. With this separation, we are able to explain a large fraction of the discrepancy between observed sea-level trends at multiple long tide-gauge records and the global-mean sea-level trend from recent reconstructions.

Dusty Deep Convection in the Mars Year 34 Planet-Encircling Dust Event	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; deep convection; water vapor; middle atmosphere; global dust storm; vertical mixing	WINTER POLAR WARMINGS; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; WATER-VAPOR; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CLIMATE SOUNDER; GLOBAL SURVEYOR; STORMS	Dusty convection, convective activity powered by radiative heating of dust, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in Mars's atmosphere but is especially deep (i.e., impactful on the middle atmosphere) and widespread during planet-encircling dust events (PEDEs) that occur every few Mars Years (MYs). Yet the relative roles of dusty deep convection and global dynamics, such as the principal meridional overturning cell and the radiative tides, in dust storm development and the vertical transport of dust and water are still unclear. Here, observations from the Mars Climate Sounder on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO-MCS) are used to study dusty deep convection and its impact on middle atmospheric water content during the MY 34 PEDE (commenced June 2018). Additional context is provided by MRO-MCS observations of the MY 28 PEDE (commenced June 2007). This investigation establishes that a few, localized centers of dusty deep convection in the tropics formed in the initial phases of both PEDE simultaneously with a substantial increase in middle atmospheric water content. The growth phase of the MY 34 PEDE was defined by episodic outbreaks of deep convection along the Acidalia and Utopia storm tracks as opposed to less episodic, more longitudinally distributed convective activity during the MY 28 PEDE. The most intense convection during both PEDE was observed in southern/eastern Tharsis, where MRO-MCS observed multiple instances of deep convective clouds transporting dust to altitudes of 70-90 km. These results suggest that Martian PEDE typically contain multiple convectively active mesoscale weather systems.

Evolution of ice shelf rifts: Implications for formation mechanics and morphological controls	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Antarctic ice shelves; fracture mechanics; laser altimetry; surface topography; Landsat-derived velocity; ice shelf rifts	FILCHNER-RONNE ICE; FRACTURE-MECHANICS; PROPAGATION; ANTARCTICA; SURFACE; ROSS	Ice shelf rifts are predecessors to iceberg calving events. Observations of their morphology over time and interaction with their surroundings are presented. Newly-available Landsat-derived annual velocity data and laser altimetry from NASA's ICESat, ICESat-2 and Operation IceBridge missions were used to characterize several ice shelf rift systems. Actively propagating ice shelf rifts exhibit uplift on both sides, with an offset in height between the two rift walls, suggesting an asymmetric buoyancy force resulting from the rifting process itself. It is observed that the direction of the asymmetry is the same for rifts within a single ice shelf, but not between ice shelves. This finding suggests a rheological or basal properties influence on rift formation and buoyancy asymmetry. It is shown that this asymmetry can be accounted for by modeling ice shelf rifts as subvertical faults. With time and inactivity, rift walls eventually relax and become rounded off. Measurements of widening suggest that rift infilling is active on many active rifts. Active rifts experience higher spreading rates than do dormant rifts. Lastly, two candidate processes are identified for rift nucleation (subvertical basal crevassing and localized melt). It is found that more than any other ice shelf in this study, rifting in Pine Island Glacier is driven by ocean heat variations and is showing signs of increasing destabilization.

Constraints on Uranus's haze structure, formation and transport	ICARUS			English	Article						Uranus; Haze microphysics; Radiative transfer	ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; MIDINFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; PHYSICAL MODEL; OVERTONE BAND; TEMPERATURES; METHANE; PAIRS; STRATOSPHERE; ATMOSPHERE	Microphysical simulations have been performed to constrain the formation and structure of haze in Uranus's atmosphere. These simulations were coupled to a radiative-transfer code to fit observations performed by the SINFONI Integral Field Unit Spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2014. Our simulations yield an effective radius of similar to 0.2 mu m for the haze particles in the tropopause and a density of similar to 2.9 particles per cm(3). Our simulations also provide an estimate for the haze production rate in the stratosphere of between similar to 3.10(-16) and 3.10(-15) kg m(-2 )s(-1), about 100 times smaller than that found in Titan's atmosphere (e.g. Rannou et al., 2004). This range of values is very similar to that derived by Pollack et al. (1987) from Voyager-2 observations in 1986, suggesting microphysical timescales greater than the elapsed time between these observations (28 years, or 1/3 of a Uranian year). This result is in agreement with analyses performed with our microphysical model that show timescales for haze particles to grow and settle out to be > similar to 30 years at pressure levels > 0.1 bar. However, these timescales are too big to explain the observed variations in the haze structure over Uranus's northern hemisphere after 2007 equinox (e.g. de Pater et al., 2015). This indicates that dynamics may be the main factor controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of the haze over the poles. A meridional stratospheric transport of haze particles with winds velocities > similar to 0.025 m s(-1) would result in dynamics timescales shorter than 30 years and thus may explain the observed variations in the haze structure.

We present data and analysis that supports the existence of two genetically related pairs in near-Earth space. The members of the individual systems, 2015 EE7 - 2015 FP124 and 2017 SN16 - 2018 RY7, are found to be of the same spectral taxonomic class, and both pairs are interpreted to have volatile-poor compositions. In conjunction with dynamical arguments, this suggests that these two systems formed via YORP spin-up and/or dissociation of a binary precursor. Backwards orbital integrations suggest a separation age of < 10 kyr for the pair 2017 SN16 - 2018 RY7, making these objects amongst the youngest multiple asteroid systems known to date. A unique separation age was not realized for 2015 EE7 - 2015 FP124 due to large uncertainties associated with these objects' orbits. Determining the ages of such young pairs is of great value for testing models of space weathering and asteroid spin-state evolution. As the NEO catalog continues to grow with current and future discovery surveys, it is expected that more NEO pairs will be found, thus providing an ideal laboratory for studying time dependent evolutionary processes that are relevant to asteroids throughout the Solar System.

Surface composition and properties of Ganymede: Updates from ground-based observations with the near-infrared imaging spectrometer SINFONI/VLT/ESO	ICARUS			English	Article						Ganymede; Satellites, surfaces; Spectroscopy; Geological processes; Infrared observations	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ICY GALILEAN SATELLITES; HYDRATED SALT MINERALS; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; PLANETARY SURFACES; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SULFURIC-ACID; MU-M; SPECTRA; EUROPA	Ganymede's surface exhibits great geological diversity, with old dark terrains, expressed through the surface composition, which is known to be dominated by two constituents: H2O-ice and an unidentified darkening agent. In this paper, new investigations of the composition of Ganymede's surface at global scale are presented. The analyses are derived from the linear spectral modeling of a high spectral resolution dataset, acquired with the near-infrared (1.40-2.50 mu m) ground-based integral field spectrometer SINFONI (SINgle Faint Object Near-IR Investigation) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT hereafter) located in Chile. We show that, unlike the neighboring moon Europa, photometric corrections cannot be performed using a simple Lambertian model. However, we find that the Oren-Nayar (1994) model, generalizing the Lambert's law for rough surfaces, produces excellent results. Spectral modeling confirms that Ganymede's surface composition is dominated by H2O-ice, which is predominantly crystalline, as well as a darkening agent, but it also clearly highlights the necessity of secondary species to better fit the measurements: sulfuric acid hydrate and salts, likely sulfates and chlorinated. A latitudinal gradient and a hemispherical dichotomy are the strongest spatial patterns observed for the darkening agent, the H2O-ice, and the sulfuric acid: the darkening agent is by far the major compound at the equator and mid-latitudes (<= +/- 35 degrees N), especially on the trailing hemisphere, while the H2O-ice and the sulfuric acid are mostly located at high latitudes and on the leading hemisphere. This anti-correlation is likely a consequence of the bombardment of the constituents in the Jovian magnetosphere which are much more intense at latitudes higher than +/- 35 degrees N. Furthermore, the modeling confirms that polar caps are enriched in small, fresh, H2O-ice grains (i.e. <= 50 mu m) while equatorial regions are mostly composed of larger grains (i.e. >= 200 mu m, up to 1 mm). Finally, the spatial distribution of the salts is neither related to the Jovian magnetospheric bombardment nor the craters. These species are mostly detected on bright grooved terrains surrounding darker areas. Endogenous processes, such as freezing of upwelling fluids going through the ice shell, may explain this distribution. In addition, a small spectral residue that might be related to brines and/or hydrated silica-bearing minerals are located in the same areas.

The analysis of these ocean parameters from passive microwave satellite measurements requires a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). In this study, we compare three ocean RTMs from 1.4 to 89 GHz. A data set of satellite observations from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) collocated with surface and atmospheric parameters from ECMWF ERA-Interim and Mercator reanalysis has been developed. The selected ocean RTMs are as follows: LOCEAN a physical model with parameters adjusted to L band measurements, FASTEM (FAST microwave Emissivity Model) a fast parameterized model, and RSS (Remote Sensing Systems) an empirical model fitting satellite observations. Global systematic errors between simulations and observations tend to increase with frequency and are generally higher at horizontal than at vertical polarizations. Then, the analysis focuses on the accuracy of the RTMs as a function of the key ocean variables, SST, SSS, and OWS. Major discrepancies are found at frequencies above 1.4 GHz, for OWS higher than 7 m/s, with the LOCEAN and the FASTEM models, with differences strongly increasing with increasing OWS. Cold SSTs are identified as a source of disagreement between the simulations and the observations, regardless of the model. This is a critical issue, especially at 6 GHz, which is the key channel for the SST analysis from satellite. The present study is the first step toward the development of a new physically based community model.

Shape model and spin-state analysis of PHA contact binary (85990) 1999 JV6 from combined radar and optical observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: (85990) 1999 JV6; methods: observational; methods: data analysis; techniques: photometric; techniques: radar astronomy; radiation mechanisms: thermal	ASTEROID LIGHTCURVE INVERSION; OPTIMIZATION METHODS; ROTATIONAL FISSION; YARKOVSKY; ACCELERATION; RADIATION; DYNAMICS	Context. The potentially hazardous asteroid (85990) 1999 JV6 has been a target of previously published thermal-infrared observations and optical photometry. It has been identified as a promising candidate for possible Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect detection. Aims. The YORP effect is a small thermal-radiation torque considered to be a key factor in spin-state evolution of small Solar System bodies. In order to detect YORP on 1999 JV6 we developed a detailed shape model and analysed the spin-state using both optical and radar observations. Methods. For 1999 JV6, we collected optical photometry between 2007 and 2016. Additionally, we obtained radar echo-power spectra and imaging observations with Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radar facilities in 2015, 2016, and 2017. We combined our data with published optical photometry to develop a robust physical model. Results. We determine that the rotation pole resides at negative latitudes in an area with a 5 degrees radius close to the south ecliptic pole. The refined sidereal rotation period is 6.536787 +/- 0.000007 h. The radar images are best reproduced with a bilobed shape model. Both lobes of 1999 JV6 can be represented as oblate ellipsoids with a smaller, more spherical component resting at the end of a larger, more elongated component. While contact binaries appear to be abundant in the near-Earth population, there are only a few published shape models for asteroids in this particular configuration. By combining the radar-derived shape model with optical light curves we determine a constant-period solution that fits all available data well. Using light-curve data alone we determine an upper limit for YORP of 8.5 x 10(-8) rad day(-2). Conclusions. The bifurcated shape of 1999 JV6 might be a result of two ellipsoidal components gently merging with each other, or a deformation of a rubble pile with a weak-tensile-strength core due to spin-up. The physical model of 1999 JV6 presented here will enable future studies of contact binary asteroid formation and evolution.	[Rozek, A.; Lowry, S. C.; Zegmott, T.

Organo-mineral associations in chert of the 3.5 Ga Mount Ada Basalt raise questions about the origin of organic matter in Paleoarchean hydrothermally influenced sediments	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STRELLEY POOL FORMATION; CARBON ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES; PILBARA CRATON; CONTINENTAL-CRUST; GREENSTONE-BELT; CHINAMAN CREEK; SOUTH-AFRICA; ICP-MS; CR-NI; PRESERVATION	Hydrothermal and metamorphic processes could have a biotically produced organo-mineral associations displaying morphological and isotopic characteristics similar to those of fossilized microorganisms in ancient rocks, thereby leaving false-positive evidence for early life in the geological record. Recent studies revealed that geologically-induced alteration processes do not always completely obliterate all molecular information about the original organic precursors of ancient microfossils. Here, we report the molecular, geochemical, and mineralogical composition of organo-mineral associations in a chert sample from the ca. 3.47 billion-year-old (Ga) Mount Ada Basalt, in the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia. Our observations indicate that the molecular characteristics of carbonaceous matter are consistent with hydrothermally altered biological organics, although significantly distinct from that of organic microfossils discovered in a chert sample from the ca. 3.43 Ga Strelley Pool Formation in the same area. Alternatively, the presence of native metal alloys in the chert, previously believed to be unstable in such hydrothermally influenced environments, indicates strongly reducing conditions that were favorable for the abiotic formation of organic matter. Drawing definitive conclusions about the origin of most Paleoarchean organo-mineral associations therefore requires further characterization of a range of natural samples together with experimental simulations to constrain the molecular composition and geological fate of hydrothermally-generated condensed organics.

The status of large trees in tropical forest is unclear, with both increasing and decreasing trends reported. We sampled across an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to study the distribution and performance of large trees and their contribution to forest structure and dynamics. We censused all large trees in 238 0.50 ha plots, and also identified and measured all stems >= 10 cm diameter in 18 0.50 ha plots annually for 20 years (1997-2017). We assessed abundance, species diversity, and crown conditions of large trees in relation to soil type and topography, measured the contribution of large trees to stand structure, productivity, and dynamics, and analyzed the decadal population trends of large trees. Large trees accounted for 2.5% of stems and similar to 25% of mean basal area and Estimated Above-Ground Biomass, and produced similar to 10% of the estimated wood production. Crown exposure increased with stem diameter but predictability was low. Large tree density was about twice as high on more-fertile flat sites compared to less fertile sites on slopes and plateaus. Density of large trees increased 27% over the study interval, but the increase was restricted to the flat more-fertile sites. Mortality and recruitment differed between large trees and smaller stems, and strongly suggested that large tree density was affected by past climatic disturbances such as large El Nino events. Our results generally do not support the hypothesis of increasing biomass and turnover rates in tropical forest. We suggest that additional landscape-scale studies of large trees are needed to determine the generality of disturbance legacies in tropical forest study sites.

This reanalysis is produced by the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE) constrained by the chemical observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board the Aura satellite. BASCOE is based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method and includes a chemical transport model driven by the winds and temperature from the ERA-Interim meteorological reanalysis. The model resolution is 3.75 degrees in longitude, 2.5 degrees in latitude and 37 vertical levels from the surface to 0.1 hPa with 25 levels above 100 hPa. The outputs are provided every 6 h. This reanalysis is called BRAM2 for BASCOE Reanalysis of Aura MLS, version 2. Vertical profiles of eight species from MLS version 4 are assimilated and are evaluated in this paper: ozone (O-3), water vapour (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrogen chloride (HCl), chlorine oxide (ClO), methyl chloride (CH3Cl) and carbon monoxide (CO). They are evaluated using independent observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) and N2O observations from a different MLS radiometer than the one used to deliver the standard product and ozonesondes. The evalu- ation is carried out in four regions of interest where only selected species are evaluated. These regions are (1) the lowerstratospheric polar vortex where O-3, H2O, N2(O), HNO3, HCl and ClO are evaluated; (2) the upper-stratospheric-lowermesospheric polar vortex where H2O, N2O, HNO3 and CO are evaluated; (3) the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) where O-3, H2O, CO and CH3Cl are evaluated; and (4) the middle stratosphere where O-3, H2O, N2O, HNO3, HCl, ClO and CH3Cl are evaluated. In general BRAM2 reproduces MLS observations within their uncertainties and agrees well with independent observations, with several limitations discussed in this paper (see the summary in Sect. 5.5). In particular, ozone is not assimilated at altitudes above (i.e. pressures lower than) 4 hPa due to a model bias that cannot be corrected by the assimilation MLS ozone profiles display unphysical oscillations in the tropical UTLS, which are corrected by the assimilation, allowing a good agreement with ozonesondes. Moreover, in the upper troposphere, comparison of BRAM2 with MLS and independent observations suggests a positive bias in MLS O-3 and a negative bias in MLS H2O. The reanalysis also reveals a drift in MLS N2O against independent observations, which highlights the potential use of BRAM2 to estimate biases between instruments. BRAM2 is publicly available and will be extended to assimilate MLS observations after 2017.

One challenge is to generate multiple local oscillator (LO) beams. Here, we succeeded in generating 81 beams at 3.86 THz by combining a reflective, metallic Fourier grating with an unidirectional antenna coupled 3rd-order distributed feedback (DFB) quantum cascade laser (QCL). We have measured the diffracted 81 beams by scanning a single pyroelectric detector at a plane, which is in the far field for the diffraction beams. The measured output beam pattern agrees well with a simulated result from COMSOL Multiphysics, with respect to the angular distribution and power distribution among the 81 beams. We also derived the diffraction efficiency to be 94 +/- 3%, which is very close to what was simulated for a manufactured Fourier grating (97%). For an array of equal superconducting hot electron bolometer mixers, 64 out of 81 beams can pump the HEB mixers with similar power, resulting in receiver sensitivities within 10%. Such a combination of a Fourier grating and a QCL can create an LO with 100 beams or more, enabling a new generation of large heterodyne arrays for astronomical instrumentation.

What Caused Recent Shifts in Tropical Pacific Decadal Sea-Level Trends?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						sea-level change; sea-level variability; decadal variability; tropical Pacific; state estimation	WARMING HIATUS; OCEAN; CIRCULATION; VARIABILITY; HEAT; MODEL; ACCELERATION; ANOMALIES; PATTERNS; ORIGINS	Satellite altimetry reveals substantial decadal variability in sea level zeta across the tropical Pacific during 1993-2015. An ocean state estimate that faithfully reproduces the observations is used to elucidate the origin of these low-frequency tropical Pacific zeta variations. Analysis of the hydrostatic equation reveals that recent decadal zeta changes in the tropical Pacific are mainly thermosteric in nature, related to changes in upper-ocean heat content. A forcing experiment performed with the numerical model suggests that anomalous wind stress was an important driver of the relevant heat storage and thermosteric variation. Closed budget diagnostics further clarify that the wind-stress-related thermosteric zeta variation resulted from the joint actions of large-scale ocean advection and local surface heat flux, such that advection controlled the budget over shorter, intraseasonal to interannual time scales, and local surface heat flux became increasingly influential at longer decadal periods. In particular, local surface heat flux was important in contributing to a recent reversal of decadal zeta trends in the tropical Pacific. Contributions from local surface heat flux partly reflect damping latent heat flux tied to wind-stress-driven sea-surface-temperature variations.

Partitioning CO fluxes to different source types in top-down inversion methods is challenging; typically a simple scaling of the posterior flux to prior flux values for fossil fuel, biogenic and biomass burning sources is used. Here we show top-down estimates of biogenic CO fluxes using a Bayesian inference approach, which explicitly accounts for both posterior and a priori CO flux uncertainties. This approach re-partitions CO fluxes following inversion of Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) CO observations with the GEOS-Chem model, a global chemical transport model driven by assimilated meteorology from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS). We compare these results to the prior information for CO used to represent biogenic NMVOCs from GEOS-Chem, which uses the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) for biogenic emissions. We evaluate the a posteriori biogenic CO fluxes against top-down estimates of isoprene fluxes using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) formaldehyde observations. We find similar seasonality and spatial consistency in the posterior CO and top-down isoprene estimates globally. For the African savanna region, both top-down CO and isoprene seasonality vary significantly from the MEGAN a priori inventory. This method for estimating biogenic sources of CO will provide an independent constraint on modeled biogenic emissions and has the potential for diagnosing decadal-scale changes in emissions due to land-use change and climate variability.

Underestimation of Global Photosynthesis in Earth System Models Due to Representation of Vegetation Structure	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES			English	Article						photosynthesis; Earth System Models; tropical forests; vegetation clumping; radiative transfer schemes; light interception	ENVIRONMENT SIMULATOR JULES; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CARBON FLUXES; FOREST; INDEX; CO2; PRODUCTIVITY	The impact of vegetation structure on the absorption of shortwave radiation in Earth System Models (ESMs) is potentially important for accurate modeling of the carbon cycle and hence climate projections. A proportion of incident shortwave radiation is used by plants to photosynthesize and canopy structure has a direct impact on the fraction of this radiation which is absorbed. This paper evaluates how modeled carbon assimilation of the terrestrial biosphere is impacted when clumping derived from satellite data is incorporated. We evaluated impacts of clumping on photosynthesis using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator, the land surface scheme of the UK Earth System Model. At the global level, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) increased by 5.53 +/- 1.02 PgC/year with the strongest absolute increase in the tropics. This is contrary to previous studies that have shown a decrease in photosynthesis when similar clumping data sets have been used to modify light interception in models. In our study additional transmission of light through upper canopy layers leads to enhanced absorption in lower layers in which photosynthesis tends to be light limited. We show that this result is related to the complexity of canopy scheme being used.	[Braghiere, R. K.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Braghiere, R.

Improving electronic properties and mechanical stability of Yb14MnSb11 via W compositing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE; THERMOELECTRIC PROPERTIES; CARBON NANOTUBES	Many of the missions proposed and successfully completed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration seek to scientifically investigate remote locations in our solar system, in particular to better understand the origin, evolution and structure of planetary systems. Long-lived, robust power systems are a fundamental capability for such missions, and radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have proven to be a reliable power for exploration missions in deep space for the past 50 years. With increasing power needs for future missions, the improvement of thermoelectric materials' conversion efficiency is necessary. In this paper, we show how compositing with inert metallic inclusions can be efficiently used to improve the electronic properties of Yb14MnSb11. In this study, we found that the power factor of the p-type high temperature material, Yb14MnSb11, increases from similar to 8 to similar to 11.5 mu Wcm(-1) K-2 when composited with 5 vol. % W particles. At the same time, the composite samples have a higher thermal conductivity and, therefore, the final zT remains unchanged (similar to 1.3 at 1273 K). Preliminary hardness tests indicated a qualitative increase in mechanical robustness for the tungsten composite samples. These results can play a relevant role in device design and performance, improving the thermoelectric impedance matching for leg segmentation and helping overcome the intrinsic brittleness of high temperature ceramics such as Yb14MnSb11 for advanced device fabrication.

Minimization of non-common path aberrations at the Palomar telescope using a self-coherent camera	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: high angular resolution; techniques: high angular resolution	ON-AXIS TELESCOPES; CONTRAST; SPACE	Context. The two main advantages of exoplanet imaging are the discovery of objects in the outer part of stellar systems, which constrains the models of planet formation, and its ability to spectrally characterize the planets to study their atmospheres. It is, however, challenging because exoplanets are up to 10(10) times fainter than their stars and are separated by a fraction of an arcsecond. Current instruments like SPHERE-VLT or GPI-Gemini detect young and massive planets only because of non-common path aberrations (NCPA) that are not corrected by the adaptive optics system. To probe fainter exoplanets a new instruments capable of minimizing the NCPA is needed. One solution is the self-coherent camera (SCC) focal plane wavefront sensor which is able to attenuate the starlight by factors of up to several 10(8) in the laboratory in space-like conditions. Aims. In this paper, we demonstrate the SCC on the sky for the first time. Methods. We installed an SCC on the stellar double coronagraph instrument at the Hale telescope. We minimize the NCPA that limited the vortex coronagraph performance. We then compared this procedure to the standard procedure used at Palomar. Results. On internal sources, we demonstrated that the SCC improves the coronagraphic detection limit by a factor of 4-20 between 1.5 and 5 lambda/D. Using this SCC calibration, the on-sky contrast is improved by a factor of 5 between 2 and 4 lambda/D. These results prove the ability of the SCC to be implemented in an existing instrument. Conclusions. This paper highlights two interests of the self-coherent camera. First, the SCC can minimize the speckle intensity in the field of view, especially the ones that are very close to the star where many exoplanets are to be discovered. Then the SCC has a 100% efficiency with science time as each image can be used for both science and NCPA minimization.

California's methane super-emitters	NATURE			English	Article							LOS-ANGELES; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; EMISSIONS; GOSAT	Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is targeted for emissions mitigation by the US state of California and other jurisdictions worldwide(1,2). Unique opportunities for mitigation are presented by point-source emitters-surface features or infrastructure components that are typically less than 10 metres in diameter and emit plumes of highly concentrated methane(3). However, data on point-source emissions are sparse and typically lack sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to guide their mitigation and to accurately assess their magnitude(4). Here we survey more than 272,000 infrastructure elements in California using an airborne imaging spectrometer that can rapidly map methane plumes(5-7). We conduct five campaigns over several months from 2016 to 2018, spanning the oil and gas, manure-management and waste-management sectors, resulting in the detection, geolocation and quantification of emissions from 564 strong methane point sources. Our remote sensing approach enables the rapid and repeated assessment of large areas at high spatial resolution for a poorly characterized population of methane emitters that often appear intermittently and stochastically. We estimate net methane point-source emissions in California to be 0.618 teragrams per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.523-0.725), equivalent to 34-46 per cent of the state's methane inventory(8) for 2016. Methane 'super-emitter' activity occurs in every sector surveyed, with 10 per cent of point sources contributing roughly 60 per cent of point-source emissions-consistent with a study of the US Four Corners region that had a different sectoral mix(9). The largest methane emitters in California are a subset of landfills, which exhibit persistent anomalous activity. Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41 per cent), followed by dairies (26 per cent) and the oil and gas sector (26 per cent). Our data have enabled the identification of the 0.2 per cent of California's infrastructure that is responsible for these emissions. Sharing these data with collaborating infrastructure operators has led to the mitigation of anomalous methane-emission activity(10).

Ecosystems dominated by distinct mycorrhizal types differ strongly in their biogeochemistry. Quantitative analyses of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning are hindered by the scarcity of information on mycorrhizal distributions. Here we present global, high-resolution maps of vegetation biomass distribution by dominant mycorrhizal associations. Arbuscular, ectomycorrhizal, and ericoid mycorrhizal vegetation store, respectively, 241 +/- 15, 100 +/- 17, and 7 +/- 1.8 GT carbon in aboveground biomass, whereas non-mycorrhizal vegetation stores 29 +/- 5.5 GT carbon. Soil carbon stocks in both topsoil and subsoil are positively related to the community-level biomass fraction of ectomycorrhizal plants, though the strength of this relationship varies across biomes. We show that human-induced transformations of Earth's ecosystems have reduced ectomycorrhizal vegetation, with potential ramifications to terrestrial carbon stocks. Our work provides a benchmark for spatially explicit and globally quantitative assessments of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling.

We employ an extensive set of waveform models, including new improved models that incorporate the effect of higher-order waveform modes which are particularly important for massive systems. We find no indication of spin-precession, but the inclusion of higher-order modes in the models results in an improved estimate for the mass ratio of (0.3-0.8) at the 90% credible level. Our updated measurement excludes equal masses at that level. We also find that models with higher-order modes lead to the data being more consistent with a smaller effective spin, with the probability that the effective spin is greater than zero being reduced from 99% to 94%. The 90% credible interval for the effective spin parameter is now (-0.01 - 0.50). Additionally, the recovered signal-to-noise ratio increases by similar to 0.3 units compared to analyses without higher-order modes; the overall Bayes factor in favor of the presence of higher-order modes in the data is 5.1 : 1. We study the effect of common spin priors on the derived spin and mass measurements, and observe small shifts in the spins, while the masses remain unaffected. We argue that our conclusions are robust against systematic errors in the waveform models. We also compare the above waveform-based analysis which employs compact-binary waveform models to a more flexible wavelet- and chirplet-based analysis. We find consistency between the two, with overlaps of similar to 0.9, typical of what is expected from simulations of signals similar to GW170729, confirming that the data are well-described by the existing waveform models. Finally, we study the possibility that the primary component of GW170729 was the remnant of a past merger of two black holes and find this scenario to be indistinguishable from the standard formation scenario.

SIF can be used to improve GPP simulations by optimizing critical model parameters through statistical Bayesian data assimilation techniques. A prerequisite is the availability of a functional link between GPP and SIF in terrestrial biosphere models. Here we present the development of a mechanistic SIF observation operator in the ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems) terrestrial biosphere model. It simulates the regulation of photosystem II fluorescence quantum yield at the leaf level thanks to a novel parameterization of non-photochemical quenching as a function of temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and normalized quantum yield of photochemistry. It emulates the radiative transfer of chlorophyll fluorescence to the top of the canopy using a parametric simplification of the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy) model. We assimilate two years of monthly OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) SIF product at 0.5 degrees (2015-2016) to optimize ORCHIDEE photosynthesis and phenological parameters over an ensemble of grid points for all plant functional types. The impact on the simulated GPP is considerable with a large decrease of the global scale budget by 28 GtC/year over the period 1990-2009. The optimized GPP budget (134/136 GtC/year over 1990-2009/2001-2009) remarkably agrees with independent GPP estimates, FLUXSAT (137 GtC/year over 2001-2009) in particular and FLUXCOM (121 GtC/year over 1990-2009). Our results also suggest a biome dependency of the SIF-GPP relationship that needs to be improved for some plant functional types.

Arcuate features are called cycloids and can be modeled using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Here, we build on existing terrestrial models of rift propagation and extend them to cycloids on the moon. We propose that these cracks tend to grow as a series of nearly instantaneous events, spaced by periods of inactivity. The behavior is similar to what is observed on Antarctic ice shelves, where rifts can remain dormant for years. We argue that dormant periods between growth events could explain the presence of cycloids on Europa even without invoking secular motion of the crust. Furthermore, being able to model propagation events and their timing should help future missions exploring the moon.

P-band synthetic aperture radar-derived RZSM estimates were incorporated into the ecosystem demography (ED2) terrestrial biosphere model through a model-data blending approach. Analysis shows that the model qualitatively captures inter-daily and seasonal variability of observed RZSM at seven flux tower sites (r = 0.59 +/- 0.26 and r = 0.70 +/- 0.22 for 0-10 and 10-40 cm of soil layers, respectively; P < 0.001). Incorporating the remotely sensed RSZM estimates increases the accuracy (root-mean-square deviations decrease from 0.10 +/- 0.07 and 0.09 +/- 0.06 m(3)center dot m(-3) to 0.08 +/- 0.05 and 0.07 +/- 0.03 m(3) center dot m(-3) for 0-10 and 10-40 cm of soil layers, respectively) of the model's RZSM predictions. The regional carbon fluxes predicted by the native and RZSM-constrained model were used to quantify sensitivities of gross primary productivity, autotrophic respiration (R-a), heterotrophic respiration (R-h), and net ecosystem exchange to variation in RZSM. Gross primary productivity exhibited the largest sensitivity (6.6 +/- 10.7 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year center dot theta(-1)) followed by R-a (2.9 +/- 7.3 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year(-1)center dot theta(-1)), R-h (2.6 +/- 3.1 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year(-1)center dot theta(-1)), and net ecosystem exchange (-1.7 +/- 7.8 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year(-1)center dot theta(-1)). Analysis shows that these carbon flux sensitivities varied considerably across regions, reflecting influences of canopy structure, soil properties, and the ecophysiological properties of different plant functional types. This study highlights (1) the importance of improved terrestrial biosphere model predictions of RZSM to improve predictions of terrestrial carbon fluxes, (2) a need for improved pedotransfer functions, and (3) improved understanding of how soil characteristics, climate, and vegetation composition interact to govern the responses of different ecosystems to changing hydrological conditions.

Effects of Fault Roughness on Coseismic Slip and Earthquake Locations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						fault roughness; earthquake catalog simulation; rate-state friction; preferred earthquake location	DOUBLE-DIFFERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; SAN-ANDREAS FAULT; STRAIN ACCUMULATION; VELOCITY STRUCTURE; GUTENBERG-RICHTER; SURFACE RUPTURE; PUNCHBOWL FAULT; DYNAMIC RUPTURE; HAYWARD FAULT; DEFORMATION	Fault zone structure is well known to exert strong controls on earthquake properties including coseismic slip distribution, rupture propagation direction, and hypocenter location. It has also been well established that the principal slip surface, which accommodates the majority of earthquake displacement, exhibits roughness at all scales following self-affine fractal distributions. Here we explore the relationship between fault roughness and specific earthquake properties including coseismic slip distribution and hypocenter location based on long-term simulations of earthquake catalogs on fractally rough faults. We begin by using the von Karman autocorrelation function to procedurally generate single faults with different fractal roughness properties, which we place in a homogeneous elastic solid and apply pure right-lateral shear at a constant back slip rate with the earthquake simulator RSQSim. Running the simulations for 10,000 years each, we generate millions of earthquakes including thousands of events with Mw > 6.0, which rupture the surface. We show that the patterns of surface rupture in these large events follow self-affine fractal distributions with consistent fractal dimension related distinctly to the fractal dimension of the fault. In addition, the hypocenters of these large events occur in very specific predictable locations where the longest wavelength structure produces a stress asperity (i.e., restraining bend). The resulting patterns can explain many features observed on real fault systems, including clustered hypocenter locations, spatially variable coseismic slip distributions, and characteristic slip recurrence behavior. These results demonstrate a quantitative link between a directly measurable fault property-roughness-and the properties of future earthquakes.	[Allam, A.

Far from Saturn, the vast debris ring from Phoebe progressively coats the leading side of Iapetus with optically dark material reducing its radar brightness. On the contrary, close to the planet, the extreme radar brightness of the innermost moons Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys (that exceeds that of the Galilean satellites) is most likely related to Enceladus's geysers and the E-ring which brings ultraclean water ice to their surfaces. The measured radar albedos and observed hemispheric dichotomies require at least a few decimeters thick "snow" cover and that the near surfaces of Saturn's innermost moons contain especially efficient backscattering structures whose nature remains an outstanding problem.

Increased high-latitude photosynthetic carbon gain offset by respiration carbon loss during an anomalous warm winter to spring transition	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						ABoVE; boreal; carbon cycle; climate change; productivity; respiration; SMAP L4C; soil moisture; tundra	BLACK SPRUCE FOREST; NON-FROZEN SEASONS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS; DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; PERMAFROST; CYCLE	Arctic and boreal ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon (C) budget, and whether they act as a future net C sink or source depends on climate and environmental change. Here, we used complementary in situ measurements, model simulations, and satellite observations to investigate the net carbon dioxide (CO2) seasonal cycle and its climatic and environmental controls across Alaska and northwestern Canada during the anomalously warm winter to spring conditions of 2015 and 2016 (relative to 2010-2014). In the warm spring, we found that photosynthesis was enhanced more than respiration, leading to greater CO2 uptake. However, photosynthetic enhancement from spring warming was partially offset by greater ecosystem respiration during the preceding anomalously warm winter, resulting in nearly neutral effects on the annual net CO2 balance. Eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements showed that air temperature has a primary influence on net CO2 exchange in winter and spring, while soil moisture has a primary control on net CO2 exchange in the fall. The net CO2 exchange was generally more moisture limited in the boreal region than in the Arctic tundra. Our analysis indicates complex seasonal interactions of underlying C cycle processes in response to changing climate and hydrology that may not manifest in changes in net annual CO2 exchange. Therefore, a better understanding of the seasonal response of C cycle processes may provide important insights for predicting future carbon-climate feedbacks and their consequences on atmospheric CO2 dynamics in the northern high latitudes.

Relative Humidity on Mars: New Results From the Phoenix TECP Sensor	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; Phoenix; TECP; relative humidity; water vapor; water cycle	WATER-VAPOR; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; LANDING SITE; GALE CRATER; PERCHLORATE; CYCLE; SURFACE; VIKING; SALTS; DELIQUESCENCE	In situ measurements of relative humidity (RH) on Mars have only been performed by the Phoenix (PHX) and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) missions. Here we present results of our recalibration of the PHX thermal and electrical conductivity probe (TECP) RH sensor. This recalibration was conducted using a TECP engineering model subjected to the full range of environmental conditions at the PHX landing site in the Michigan Mars Environmental Chamber. The experiments focused on the warmest and driest conditions (daytime) because they were not covered in the original calibration (Zent et al., 2010, https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JE003420) and previous recalibration (Zent et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004933). In nighttime conditions, our results are in excellent agreement with the previous 2016 recalibration, while in daytime conditions, our results show larger water vapor pressure values. We obtain vapor pressure values in the range similar to 0.005-1.4 Pa, while Zent et al. (2016, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004933) obtain values in the range similar to 0.004-0.4 Pa. Our higher daytime values are in better agreement with independent estimates from the ground by the PHX Surface Stereo Imager instrument and from orbit by Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars. Our results imply larger day-to-night ratios of water vapor pressure at PHX compared to MSL, suggesting a stronger atmosphere-regolith interchange in the Martian arctic than at lower latitudes. Further, they indicate that brine formation at the PHX landing site via deliquescence can be achieved only temporarily between midnight and 6 a.m. on a few sols. The results from our recalibration are important because they shed light on the near-surface humidity environment on Mars.	[Fischer, E.; Martinez, G. M.; Renno, N.

The estimation algorithm incorporates a function penalizing changes far from known well locations, linking the aquifer volume changes to agricultural, industrial, and municipal pumping within the Tulare basin. We show that the range changes are compatible with the hypothesis that the source of aquifer volume changes are variations in effective pressure around documented wells. Specifically, inclusion of the well distance penalty does not degrade the fit to the observations, inversions with and without it both give variance reductions of 99.6%. The patterns of aquifer volume change vary significantly from the drought year, between October 2015 and October 2016, to a wet year in 2017, and into 2018, a year with near average rainfall. The 2.3 million acre-feet of estimated volume reduction, a lower bound on the amount of water extracted from the basin between October 2015 and 2016, agrees with independent estimates of 1.8 and 2.3 million acrefeet. The aquifer volume reduction is also compatible with a loss of 3.1 km(3) (2.5 million acre-feet) in groundwater volume derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data.

Two cycles of accumulation and release of magnetic flux, named magnetic loading/unloading, were identified during this period, which correlate well with electron energization and auroral intensifications. Magnetic reconnection events are identified during both the loading and unloading periods, indicating that reconnection and unloading are independent processes. These results show that the dynamics in the middle magnetosphere are coupled with auroral variability.	[Yao, Z.

The observed bias relative to the RTGSST between 2002 and 2019 was less than 250 mK, with a 2-3-mK/yr trend. Establishing the stability of the 1,231-cm(-1) channel at tropical ocean temperatures at the 2-3-mK/yr level is a necessary but not sufficient condition of establishing the calibration stability of all AIRS channels over the full dynamic range at a comparable level. Our analysis indirectly establishes the stability of the RTGSST for the 2002-2017 time period and region at the 2-3-mK/yr level, with a degradation since 2017.

Distinct Frontal Ablation Processes Drive Heterogeneous Submarine Terminus Morphology	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						ice-ocean processes; buoyant-plume melt; glacier terminus; outlet glacier	SUBGLACIAL DISCHARGE; TIDEWATER GLACIER; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; MELTWATER PLUMES; LECONTE GLACIER; GREENLAND; MELT; DYNAMICS; RETREAT; WATERS	Calving and submarine melt drive frontal ablation and sculpt the ice face of marine-terminating glaciers. However, there are sparse observations of submarine termini, which limit estimates of spatially varying submarine melt. Here we present a detailed survey of a west Greenland glacier to reveal heterogeneity in submarine terminus morphology. We find that the majority of the terminus (similar to 77%) is undercut, driven by calving in the upper water column and submarine melting at depth. The remaining similar to 23% of the terminus is overcut, driven by calving alone. We use observations of six subglacial discharge outlets, combined with a plume model, to estimate spatially varying discharge fluxes. While small discharge fluxes (<43 m(3)/s) feed numerous, deeply undercut outlets with subsurface plumes, similar to 70% of the net subglacial flux emerges at the terminus center, producing a vigorous, surface-reaching plume. This primary outlet drives large, localized seasonal retreat that exceeds calving rates at secondary outlets. Plain Language Summary Using a sensor to map the shape of a glacier terminus below sea level, we are able to quantify how the terminus shape changes across the glacier. This allows us to identify different classes of terminus shape, which vary from undercut to overcut. Undercut regions are formed through melting focused near the base of the terminus, where freshwater emerges from discrete channels. Using a model, we explain the degree of undercutting found in channels by varying the flux of freshwater emerging from each channel. This allows us to understand the relative role of small channels on total terminus melt compared to much larger, more frequently observed channels. We find that small channels produce significant melting compared to a much larger channel at the glacier center but not as much iceberg calving.	[Fried, M. J.] ICF, Washington, DC USA; [Fried, M.

Bi-Directional Reflectance Factor Determination of the Railroad Valley Playa	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						vicarious calibration; Railroad Valley; RadCalNet; PARABOLA; MISR; MODIS; Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO)	VICARIOUS CALIBRATION	Vicarious calibration is the determination of an on-orbit sensor's radiometric response using measurements over test sites such as Railroad Valley (RRV), Nevada. It has the highest accuracy when a remote sensor's view angle is aligned with that of the surface measurements, namely at a nadir view. For view angles greater than 10 degrees, the dominant error is the uncertainty in the off-nadir correction factor. The factor is largest in the back-scatter principal plane and can reach 20%. The Orbiting-Carbon Observatory has access to a number of datasets to determine this deviation. These include measurements from field instruments such as the Portable Apparatus for Rapid Acquisition of Bidirectional Observation of the Land and Atmosphere (PARABOLA), as well as satellite measurements from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The correction factor derived from PARABOLA is consistent in time and space to within 2% for view angles as large as 30 degrees. Field spectrometer data show that the correction term is spectrally invariant. For this reason, a time-invariant model of RRV surface reflectance, along with empirically derived coefficients, is sufficient to use in the calibration of off-nadir sensors, provided there has been no recent rainfall. With this off-nadir correction, calibrations can be expected to have uncertainties within 5%.

AquaSat: A Data Set to Enable Remote Sensing ofWater Quality for InlandWaters	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; LAKE WATER-QUALITY; UNITED-STATES; CHLOROPHYLL; SEDIMENT; RIVERS; STREAMS; TRENDS; SCALE; TERRESTRIAL	Satellite estimates of inland water quality have the potential to vastly expand our ability to observe and monitor the dynamics of large water bodies. For almost 50 years, we have been able to remotely sense key water quality constituents like total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and Secchi disk depth. Nonetheless, remote sensing of water quality is poorly integrated into inland water sciences, in part due to a lack of publicly available training data and a perception that remote estimates are unreliable. Remote sensing models of water quality can be improved by training and validation on larger data sets of coincident field and satellite observations, here called matchups. To facilitate model development and deeper integration of remote sensing into inland water science, we have built AquaSat, the largest such matchup data set ever assembled. AquaSat contains more than 600,000 matchups, covering 1984-2019, of ground-based total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and SDDSecchi disk depth measurements paired with spectral reflectance from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 collected within +/- 1 day of each other. To build AquaSat, we developed open source tools in R and Python and applied them to existing public data sets covering the contiguous United States, including the Water Quality Portal, LAGOS-NE, and the Landsat archive. In addition to publishing the data set, we are also publishing our full code architecture to facilitate expanding and improving AquaSat. We anticipate that this work will help make remote sensing of inland water accessible to more hydrologists, ecologists, and limnologists while facilitating novel data-driven approaches to monitoring and understanding critical water resources at large spatiotemporal scales.

The NASA SnowEx campaign is focused on addressing the primary gaps in snow remote sensing in order to gain an improved spatiotemporal understanding of this important resource and to further efforts toward a future satellitebased snow remote sensing mission. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is an efficient and mature approach for measuring snow depth and SWE. We collected similar to 1.3 million GPR snow depth observations during the NASA SnowEx 2017 campaign, yielding a spatially extensive (similar to 133-km total length) and high-resolution (similar to 10-cm lateral spacing) validation data set to assess various remote sensing and modeling approaches. We found high correlation between the GPR and manual snow probe derived snow depths (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 18 cm), but a median difference of -10 cm, which we attribute, in part, to probe penetration into the unfrozen subsurface. We also compared GPR-derived snow depths to two other independent estimates of snow depth, as an example of how this data set can be used for validation of remote sensing techniques: Airborne Snow Observatory lidar-derived snow depths (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001, median difference = -1 cm, RMSE = 14 cm) and preliminary DigitalGlobe WorldView-3 satellite-derived snow depths (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001, median difference = -3 cm, RMSE = 24 cm).

During the spacecraft assembly process subsystems undergo functional testing, a task that verifies critical components can survive from launch through the duration of the mission. Despite efforts to keep spacecraft clean during these ground testing operations, as well as during transportation, recontamination frequently occurs and results in the need to re-clean the spacecraft, putting stress on the spacecraft assembly critical path. In response, the Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group (BPPG) at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has designed a Ground Support Biobarrier (GSB) capable of protecting flight hardware continuously from an up-to 150 degrees C Heat Microbial Reduction (HMR) sterilization through hardware integration with the spacecraft, itself. The biobarrier consists of aluminum brackets bolted together and covered with thin aluminum sheets sealed via epoxy. The base plate of the biobarrier contains bolt connections and a gasket to ensure that all venting is through the HEPA-filtered vent when the biobarrier is closed. Additionally, the GSB allows for vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP) sterilization as well as the ability to functionally test hardware without opening the barrier. The GSB provides a safety-net against microbiological re-contamination during critical functional testing, decreasing the need for re-cleaning and reducing schedule impact risk.

These policies seek to limit the (forward) biological contamination of the target body by terrestrial microorganisms on the spacecraft, so that future missions to the target body will provide accurate and reliable scientific results. Also, these policies seek to prevent the (backward) biological contamination of the Earth by a sample returned from the target body. Bioburden reduction is an integral part of current space missions and its importance will magnify as bioburden requirements become more stringent in the future. Since life-detection and sample-return procedures require sterile handling in situ (to protect scientific results), subsystems and instruments which will be in contact with extraterrestrial matter must be sterilized to prevent a false positive. Since the first Viking mission, heat microbial reduction (HMR) has served as a well-understood common practice for reducing bioburden. More recently, NASA and ESA have approved a standard protocol for vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP) microbial reduction to address some of the drawbacks of HMR by lowering operating costs and decreasing schedule impacts, as detailed in the certification processes conducted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Steris. Steris has also conducted many testing campaigns on behalf of JPL over the past 20 years. The main results of their campaigns are hence reported. However, even VHP has certain limitations that do not make it an all-encompassing microbial reduction/sterilization modality for spacecraft hardware. Therefore, this review also investigates the state-of-the-art sterilization and cleaning techniques used in other fields, such as in the medical, food, and drug industries, for application to flight hardware. Major techniques covered include cold atmospheric plasma, electron beam irradiation, and gamma irradiation. Some techniques have proven to be good candidates for adaptation for future NASA spacecraft missions. Techniques such as gamma irradiation (gamma rad), can broaden the scope of NASA-approved protocols and expand the currently limited toolkit. Cleaning, the removal of bioburden, is also an important aspect of bioburden reduction; despite the best microbial reduction/sterilization technologies, dead microbes can interfere with and potentially invalidate the results of biosignature models of relevant celestial bodies. Therefore, cleaning techniques, such as carbon dioxide snow, can significantly contribute to the bioburden reduction process. With the development of standardized protocols for these additional microbial reduction/sterilization and cleaning modalities-in combination with the well-known techniques with NASA and ESA approved protocols-we anticipate that future space missions may be able to achieve a higher biological standard.

An Induced Special Region is defined as a place where the presence of the spacecraft could induce water activity and temperature to be sufficiently high and persist for long enough to plausibly harbor life. The questions the workshop participants addressed were: (1) What is a safe stand-off distance, or formula to derive a safe distance, to a purported special region? (2) Questions about RTGs (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator), other heat sources, and their ability to induce special regions. (3) Is it possible to have an infected area on Mars that does not contaminate the rest of Mars? The workshop participants reached a general consensus addressing the posed questions, in summary: (1) While a spacecraft on the surface of Mars may not be able to explore a special region during the prime mission, the safe stand-off distance would decrease with time because the sterilizing environment, that is the martian surface would progressively clean the exposed surfaces. However, the analysis supporting such an exploration should ensure that the risk to exposing interior portions of the spacecraft (i.e., essentially unsterilized) to the martian surface is minimized. (2) An RTG at the surface of Mars would not create a Special Region but the short-term result depends on kinetics of melting, freezing, deliquescence, and desiccation. While a buried RTG could induce a Special Region, it would not pose a long-term contamination threat to Mars, with the possible exception of a migrating RTG in an icy deposit. (3) Induced Special Regions can allow microbial replication to occur (by definition), but such replication at the surface is unlikely to globally contaminate Mars. An induced subsurface Special Region would be isolated and microbial transport away from subsurface site is highly improbable.

A key step toward this objective is to precisely detect water areas. In this article, we present a method to detect water in SWOT images. Water is detected based on the relative brightness of the water and nonwater surfaces. Water brightness varies throughout the swath because of system parameters (i.e., the antenna pattern), as well as the phenomenology such as wind speed and surface roughness. To handle the effects of brightness variability, we propose to model the problem with one Markov random field (MRF) on the binary classification map, and two other MRFs to regularize the estimation of the class parameters (i.e., the land and water background power images). Our experiments show that the proposed method is more robust to the expected variations in SWOT images than traditional approaches.

HAMMR includes: low-frequency microwave channels at 18.7, 23.8, and 34.0 GHz at two linear-orthogonal polarizations; high-frequency millimeter-wave channels at 90, 130 and 168 GHz; and millimeter-wave sounding channels consisting of eight channels near the 118.75GHz oxygen absorption line for temperature profiling and eight additional channels near the 183.31 GHz water vapor absorption line for water vapor profiling. HAMMR was deployed on a twin otter aircraft for a west coast flight campaign (WCFC) from November 4-17, 2014. During the WCFC, HAMMR collected radiometric observations for more than 53.5 h under diverse atmospheric conditions, including clear sky, scattered and dense clouds, as well as over a variety of surface types, including coastal ocean areas, inland water and land. These measurements provide a comprehensive dataset to validate the instrument.

Improving Brightness Temperature Measurements Near Coastal Areas for SMAP	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Brightness temperature (TB); coastal areas; land contamination; Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP); water contamination	WIND RETRIEVAL; MICROWAVE; LAND	The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is designed to acquire L-band radiometer measurements for the estimation of soil moisture with 0.04m(3)m(3) volumetric accuracy in the top 5 cm for vegetation with water content of less than 5kgm(2). In regions near the coast or near inland bodies of water, the signal measured by the SMAP radiometer contains emissions from land and water, resulting in errors in the soil moisture estimation. In this article, the effort to extract the brightness temperature (TB) according to the land fraction or water fraction (depending on the center of the footprint location) from the affected SMAP measurements was addressed. A single pixel correction algorithm was applied and its performance was evaluated over simulated data. A data-driven approach for the estimation of land and water TB for data correction was developed. The correction algorithm was then applied to real data and its performance was assessed over the SMAP soil moisture retrievals. We showed that the single pixel algorithm is an effective and computationally efficient algorithm for removing land or water TB contamination from the SMAP data.

In this work, we develop a modified quadratic estimator (QE) that is designed to mitigate the lensing biases due to the kinematic and thermal SZ effects. The idea behind the approach is to use inpainting technique to eliminate the cluster's own emission from the large-scale CMB gradient map. In this inpainted gradient map, we fill the pixel values at the cluster location based on the information from surrounding regions using a constrained Gaussian realization. We show that the noise induced due to inpainting process is small compared to other noise sources for upcoming surveys and has negligible impact on the final lensing signal-to-noise. Without any foreground cleaning, we find a stacked mass uncertainty of 6.5% for the CMB-S4 experiment on a cluster sample containing 5000 clusters with M-200c = 2 x 10(14) M-circle dot at z = 0.7. In addition to the SZ-induced lensing biases, we also quantify the low mass bias arising due to the contamination of the CMB gradient by the cluster convergence. For the fiducial cluster sample considered in this work, we find that this bias is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainties for both the standard and the modified QE even when modes up to similar to 2700 are used for the gradient estimation. With more gradient modes, we demonstrate that the sensitivity can be increased by 14% compared to the fiducial result quoted above using gradient modes up to 2000.

This study leverages airborne data from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) to assess their unique capabilities in combination to estimate AGB in coastal deltaic wetlands. Here we develop AGB models for emergent herbaceous and forested wetland vegetation in coastal Louisiana. In addition to horizontally emitted, vertically received (HV) backscatter, SAR parameters are expressed by the Freeman-Durden polarimetric decomposition components representing volume and double-bounce scattering. The imaging spectrometer parameters include normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), reflectance from 290 visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) bands, the first derivatives from those bands, or partial least squares (PLS) x-scores derived from those data. Model metrics and cross-validation indicate that the integrated models using the Freeman-Durden components and PLS x-scores improve AGB estimates for both wetland vegetation types. In our study domain over Louisiana's Wax Lake Delta (WLD), we estimated a mean herbaceous wetland AGB of 3.58 Megagrams/hectare (Mg/ha) and a total of 3551.31 Mg over 9.92 km(2), and a mean forested wetland AGB of 294.78 Mg/ha and a total of 27,499.14 Mg over 0.93 km(2). While the addition of SAR-derived values to imaging spectrometer data provides a nominal error decrease for herbaceous wetland AGB, this combination significantly improves forested wetland AGB prediction. This integrative approach is particularly effective in forested wetlands as canopy-level biochemical characteristics are captured by the imaging spectrometer in addition to the variable structural information measured by the SAR.

It is advantageous to observe these stars at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (1-2.5 mu m) where they emit the bulk of their bolometric luminosity and are most quiescent. In this work, we describe our methodology and results in obtaining precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of low-mass stars using K-band spectra taken with the R similar to 80,000 iSHELL spectrograph and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility using a methane isotopologue gas cell in the calibration unit. Our novel analysis pipeline extracts RVs by minimizing the rms of the residuals between the observed spectrum and a forward model. The model accounts for the gas cell, tellurics, blaze function, multiple sources of quasi-sinusoidal fringing, and line spread function of the spectrograph. The stellar template is derived iteratively using the target observations themselves through averaging barycenter-shifted residuals. We have demonstrated 5 m s(-1) precision over one-year timescales for the M4 dwarf Barnard's Star and K dwarf 61 Cygni A, and 3 m s(-1) over a month for the M2 dwarf GJ 15 A. This work demonstrates the potential for iSHELL to determine dynamical masses for candidate exoplanets discovered with the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission, and to search for exoplanets orbiting moderately active and/or young K & M dwarfs.

They are typically effective in absorbing energy through plastic deformation or fragmentation. However, existing solutions are passive, only effective against specific threats and they are usually damaged after use. Here, we overcome these limitations designing energy absorbing materials that use architected lattices filled with granular particles. We use architected lattices to take advantage of controlled bending and buckling of members to enhance energy absorption. We actively control the negative pressure level within the lattices, to tune the jamming phase transition of the granular particles, inducing controllable energy absorption and recoverable deformations. Our system shows tunable stiffness and yield strength by over an order of magnitude, and reduces the transmitted impact stress at different levels by up to 40% compared to the passive lattice. The demonstrated adaptive energy absorbing system sees wide potential applications from personal protective equipment, vehicle safety systems to aerospace structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Asymmetric Craters on the Dwarf Planet Ceres-Results of Second Extended Mission Data Analysis	GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						crater formation on small bodies; cratering processes; influence of slopes; asteroids; dwarf planets; asymmetrical cratering; XM2	IMPACT; EVOLUTION; VESTA; SHAPE	After almost three years of successful operation on Ceres, the Dawn spacecraft entered its last orbits around the dwarf planet and obtained a set of high-resolution images of 3 to 5 m/pixel. These images reveal a variety of morphologic features, including a set of asymmetric crater morphologies as observed earlier in the mission on the asteroid Vesta. We identified 269 craters, which are located between 60 degrees N to 60 degrees S latitude and 197 degrees E to 265 degrees E longitude, and investigated their morphological characteristics using a digital terrain model (DTM). These craters range in diameter from 0.30 to 4.2 km, and exhibit a sharp crater rim on the uphill side and a smooth one on the downhill side. We found that all asymmetric craters are formed on a sloping surface with the majority appearing at slope angles between 5 and 20 degrees. This implies that, as observed on Vesta, the topography is the main cause for these asymmetries.

However, drought information products are traditionally designed by scientists with little input from the end users. This has resulted in an inundation of products ill suited to stakeholder needs and requirements, limiting the potential for improving management through the use of these products. In a different field-the field of product design-product designers and strategists have matured methodologies for optimizing the creation of material products, such as shoes and cars, for example, for customers. A multitude of design-centric strategies are employed to determine customer needs and requirements (e.g., lighter shoe, more cushioning, breathable, reflectivity, arch support, width options, color options). These approaches can be extended from material to information or data products. Here, we describe how the methodological approaches within the field of product design can be interdisciplinarily employed to data products for drought indicators, with water managers as end users (i.e., the "customers"). New results for drought data products may be transformative in how drought indices are constructed, communicated, and delivered, with potentially significant improvements for water management.

Asymmetric Response of Land Storage to ENSO Phase and Duration	WATER			English	Article						terrestrial water storage; ENSO; teleconnections; hydroclimatic variability; CESM	EL-NINO; SYSTEM MODEL; PACIFIC; VARIABILITY; PATTERNS	Emergence of global mean sea level (GMSL) from a 'hiatus' following a persistent La Nina highlights the need to understand the causes of interannual variability in GMSL. Several studies link interannual variability in GMSL to anomalous transport of water mass between land and ocean-and subsequent changes in water storage in these reservoirs-primarily driven by El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Despite this, asymmetries in teleconnections between ENSO mode and land water storage have received less attention. We use historical simulations of natural climate variability to characterize asymmetries in the hydrological response to ENSO based on phase and duration. Findings indicate pronounced phase-specific and duration-specific asymmetries covering up to 93 and 50 million km(2) land area, respectively. The asymmetries are seasonally dependent, and based on the mean regional climate are capable of influencing inherently bounded storage by pushing the storage-precipitation relationship towards nonlinearity. The nonlinearities are more pronounced in dry regions in the dry season, wet regions in the wet season, and during Year 2 of persistent ENSO events, limiting the magnitude of associated anomalies under persistent ENSO influence. The findings have implications for a range of stakeholders, including sea level researchers and water managers.

Main objective of this mission is to gain more knowledge of the evolution of terrestrial planets. Beside a number of different scientific instruments onboard the lander there are two instruments that will perform measurements on the Martian ground. One of the instruments is HP3 (Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package), which was developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to measure the heat flow of the Martian outer crust. Main elements of this instrument are the heat flow probe, the Backend Electronic and the Support System. With this paper the authors give a detailed insight of the function of the Support System within the instrument and its development. The Support System enables the operation of the heat flow probe on the surface. The mechanical design of the Support System is mainly driven by a unique set of requirements derived from the working environment on Mars, the deployment from the lander deck, and the mechanically separated operation on the surface. The paper will give an overview of the development and the qualification of the structure of the Support System. It will focus on the mechanical design and the analysis of the structural dynamics, and on the testing which includes standard environmental testing but also numerous development tests that are very mission specific.

DLR's HP3- instrument (Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package) will measure Mars' interior heat flux and thermal gradient down to a depth of 5 m and thus penetrates deeper below the Martian surface than any other instrument before. Being the locomotion system of the instrument, the HP3 Mole acts as a self-impelling nail in order to accomplish this goal. The inner hammering mechanism is spring driven and periodically loaded by a cylindrical cam mechanism. The innovative impact driven locomotion principle enables a minimum in required energy and mass, but leads to complex system behaviour and dependence of the inner mechanism dynamics on the outer force conditions exerted by the soil. The scope of this paper is to provide an overview of the Mole, its role in the mission and payload, as well as to give a brief overview about its subsystems, its interfaces and working principle.

Despite the weak signal, they have successfully provided LLR range data for about 49 years, generating about 26,000 normal points. Recent system upgrades and new observatories have made millimeter-level range accuracy achievable. Based on appropriate modeling and sophisticated data analysis, LLR is able to determine many parameters associated with Earth-Moon dynamics, involving the lunar ephemeris, lunar physics, the Moon's interior, reference frames and Earth orientation parameters. LLR has also become one of the strongest tools for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity in the solar system. By extending the standard solution, it is possible to solve for parameters related to gravitational physics, like the temporal variation of the gravitational constant, metric parameters as well as the strong equivalence principle, preferred-frame effects and standard-model extensions. This paper provides a review about LLR measurement and analysis. After a short historical overview, we describe the key findings of LLR, the apparatus and technologies involved, the requisite modeling techniques, some recent results and future prospects on all fronts. We expect continued improvements in LLR, maintaining its lead in contributing to science.

Modernizing and expanding the NASA Space Geodesy Network to meet future geodetic requirements	JOURNAL OF GEODESY			English	Article						Space Geodesy; Terrestrial Reference Frame; ITRF; VLBI; SLR; GNSS; DORIS	SYSTEM	NASA maintains and operates a global network of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), and Global Navigation Satellite System ground stations as part of the NASA Space Geodesy Program. The NASA Space Geodesy Network (NSGN) provides the geodetic products that support Earth observations and the related science requirements as outlined by the US National Research Council (NRC in Precise geodetic infrastructure: national requirements for a shared resource, National Academies Press, Washington, 2010. , Thriving on our changing planet: a decadal strategy for Earth observation from space, National Academies Press, Washington, 2018. ). The Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) and the NRC have set an ambitious goal of improving the Terrestrial Reference Frame to have an accuracy of 1 mm and stability of 0.1 mm per year, an order of magnitude beyond current capabilities. NASA and its partners within GGOS are addressing this challenge by planning and implementing modern geodetic stations colocated at existing and new sites around the world. In 2013, NASA demonstrated the performance of its next-generation systems at the prototype next-generation core site at NASA's Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory in Greenbelt, Maryland. Implementation of a new broadband VLBI station in Hawaii was completed in 2016. NASA is currently implementing new VLBI and SLR stations in Texas and is planning the replacement of its other aging domestic and international legacy stations. In this article, we describe critical gaps in the current global network and discuss how the new NSGN will expand the global geodetic coverage and ultimately improve the geodetic products. We also describe the characteristics of a modern NSGN site and the capabilities of the next-generation NASA SLR and VLBI systems. Finally, we outline the plans for efficiently operating the NSGN by centralizing and automating the operations of the new geodetic stations.	[Merkowitz, S. M.; Esper, J.; Hilliard, L.; Hoffman, E.

This paper describes the results of an integrated approach to analyzing the potential environmental impacts of urbanization that has profoundly transformed land cover and land-use in Vietnam. A combination of remote-sensing techniques and ancillary indices enables a quantitative evaluation of urbanization impacts on 12 sites in the Complex of Hue Monuments, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, from 1968 to 2016. This approach includes classifying satellite images, analyzing urbanization characteristics with land-cover and land-use change and urbanization indices, and quantifying environmental impacts by ecosystem service values. Object-based classification results indicate that the support vector machine algorithm achieves an optimum overall accuracy of 84.78-86.5% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.82-0.84. Quantitative results of the total absolute loss value reveal the largest negative effect at Hue Citadel and the most positive at Tu' Du'c Tomb, with the overall consequence of urbanization being predominantly negative for the whole complex. The adverse impacts are found primarily from the degradation of agriculture and green space. The negative total loss value also serves as a quantification of impacts from increased urbanization on human well-being. This integrated methodology can be a potentially effective tool to plan for sustainable development in the continual trend toward further urbanization in Vietnam.

Given the ubiquity of solar photons incident on these water-ice-dominated surfaces, experiments were conducted to better understand the photochemistry of ozone-water ice mixtures. Samples were deposited as thin films in a vacuum chamber under temperature and pressure conditions relevant to satellites in the outer solar system. Chemical changes in the ices were monitored with infrared spectroscopy as they were exposed to ultraviolet light at 116.5/123.6, 147, and 254 nm emitted from Kr, Xe, and Hg resonant lamps, respectively. In all instances, hydrogen peroxide formed after ultraviolet irradiation, while the amount of ozone present decreased. Of the wavelengths tested, irradiation at 254 rim induced the most rapid change both in terms of irradiation time and number of incident photons. This work emphasizes the importance of wavelengths longer than the vacuum ultraviolet in the chemical evolution of ozone on Ganymede, Dione, and Rhea.

Modeling Binary Mixtures of Water plus Light Hydrocarbon Using the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory with Induced Association: Improvement in Describing All Equilibrium Phases	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						water-hydrocarbon mixtures; PC-SAFT; induced association; aqueous solubility; mutual solubility; supercooled water; Titan	SOLUBILITY MEASUREMENT; SAFT EQUATION; METHANE-WATER; N-ALKANES; SYSTEMS; ETHANE; BEHAVIOR; LIQUID; STATE; NITROGEN	Hydrophobic effects, including low mutual solubilities, are well-documented between water and hydrocarbons. However, as deduced from quantum chemical calculations and molecular simulations, an attractive interaction as a result of electrostatic interactions and induction by water on hydrocarbon molecules exists and must be included to adequately model water-hydrocarbon systems. As shown in this work, the inclusion of these interactions allows for the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state (EOS) to perform well in all equilibrium phases. Without these corrections, the EOS usually performs well only for the phase used for parametrization. Because the EOS will also be used in near-freezing water temperatures, the parameters of water are carefully derived to be able to reproduce the density anomaly of water and behavior when extrapolated to the supercooled region. The improvements and calculations will be useful for the assessment of the occurrences of potentially habitable water-poor and water-rich environments within the ice crusts and rocky crusts of extraterrestrial bodies.

Updated validation of ACE and OSIRIS ozone and NO2 measurements in the Arctic using ground-based instruments at Eureka, Canada	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Validation; ACE; OSIRIS; Ozone; NO2; Arctic	FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTROMETERS; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; CHEMISTRY; CLOUD; LIMB; CLASSIFICATION; RETRIEVAL; O-3; CLIMATOLOGY	This paper presents long-term intercomparisons (2003-2017) between ozone and NO2 measured by the Optical Spectrograph and Infra-Red Imager System (OSIRIS) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) satellite instruments, and by ground-based instruments at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), near Eureka, Nunavut, Canada (80 degrees N, 86 degrees W). The ground-based instruments include four zenith-sky differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instruments, two Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, and a Brewer spectrophotometer. Comparisons of 14-52 km ozone partial columns show good agreement between OSIRIS v5.10 and ACE-FTS v3.5/3.6 data (1.2%), while ACE-MAESTRO v3.13 ozone is smaller than the other two datasets by 6.7% and 5.9%, respectively. Satellite profiles were extended to the surface using ozonesonde data, and the resulting columns agree with the ground-based datasets with mean relative differences of 0.1-12.0%. For NO2, 12-40 km partial columns from ACE-FTS v3.5/3.6 and 12-32 km partial columns from OSIRIS v6.0 (scaled to 40 km) agree with ground-based partial columns with mean relative differences of 0.7-33.2%. Dynamical coincidence criteria improved the ACE to ground-based FTIR ozone comparisons, while little to no improvements were seen for other instruments, and for NO2. A +/- 1 degrees latitude criterion modestly improved the spring and fall NO2 comparisons. The results of this study are consistent with previous validation exercises. In addition, there are no significant drifts between the satellite datasets, or between the satellites and the ground-based measurements, indicating that the OSIRIS and ACE instruments continue to perform well.

ACE-FTS data provide volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles of OCS, (OCS)-S-34 and (OCS)-C-13 from 8 km in troposphere up to 31 km in the stratosphere. The global zonal and seasonal distributions of OCS isotopologues were studied. OCS observations made with the MkIV balloon-borne Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) are also presented. The results indicate a slight enrichment of (OCS)-S-34 and a significant enrichment of (OCS)-C-13 as the altitude increases. The contribution of OCS to the background Stratospheric Sulfate Aerosol Layer (SSA) is discussed and ACE-FTS data indicate that OCS is a major contributor. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We assess the dependences of the equivalent widths of many outflow metal absorption features on outflow velocity, trough width and position, and quasar magnitude and redshift. The evolution of the equivalent widths of the O vi and N v lines with outflow velocity correlates with that of the mean absorption-line width, the outflow electron density, and the strength of lines arising from collisionally excited metastable states. None of these correlations are found for the other high- or low-ionization species, and different behaviors with trough width are also suggested. We find no dependence on quasar magnitude or redshift in any case. All the observed trends can be reconciled by considering a multiphase stratified outflow structure, where inner regions are colder, denser, and host lower-ionization species. Given the prevalence of radiative acceleration in quasar outflows found by Mas-Ribas & Mauland, we suggest that radiation pressure sweeps up and compresses the outflowing gas outward, creating waves or filaments where the multiphase stratified structure could take form. This scenario is supported by the suggested correlation between electron density and outflow velocity, as well as by the similar behavior observed for the line and line-locking components of the absorption features. We show that this outflow structure is also consistent with other X-ray, radiative transfer, and polarization results, and discuss the implications of our findings for future observational and numerical quasar outflow studies.

Our sample extends our previous study, which compared a Planck detected cold cloud in the outskirts of the LMC with the 30 Doradus molecular cloud and found the typical line width for 1 pc radius structures to be five times larger in 30 Doradus. By observing clouds with intermediate levels of star formation activity, we find evidence that the line width at a given size increases with increasing local and cloud-scale 8 ?m intensity. At the same time, the line width at a given size appears to independently correlate with measures of the mass surface density. Our results suggest that both virial-like motions due to gravity and local energy injection by star formation feedback play important roles in determining intracloud dynamics.

Kojima-1Lb Is a Mildly Cold Neptune around the Brightest Microlensing Host Star	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							LOW-MASS STARS; DETERMINISTIC MODEL; PLANETARY FORMATION; SNOW LINE; EVENT; DISTRIBUTIONS; DISCOVERY; FIELD	We report the analysis of additional multiband photometry and spectroscopy and new adaptive optics (AO) imaging of the nearby planetary microlensing event TCP J05074264+2447555 (Kojima-1), which was discovered toward the Galactic anticenter in 2017 (Nucita et al.). We confirm the planetary nature of the light-curve anomaly around the peak while finding no additional planetary feature in this event. We also confirm the presence of apparent blending flux and the absence of significant parallax signal reported in the literature. The AO image reveals no contaminating sources, making it most likely that the blending flux comes from the lens star. The measured multiband lens flux, combined with a constraint from the microlensing model, allows us to narrow down the previously unresolved mass and distance of the lens system. We find that the primary lens is a dwarf on the K/M boundary (0.581 0.033 M<sub) located at 505 +/- 47 pc, and the companion (Kojima-1Lb) is a Neptune-mass planet (20.0 2.0 M-?) with a semimajor axis of <i au. This orbit is a few times smaller than those of typical microlensing planets and is comparable to the snow-line location at young ages. We calculate that the a priori detection probability of Kojima-1Lb is only 35%, which may imply that Neptunes are common around the snow line, as recently suggested by the transit and radial velocity techniques. The host star is the brightest among the microlensing planetary systems (K-s = 13.7), offering a great opportunity to spectroscopically characterize this system, even with current facilities.

Following the detection of the first binary neutron star merger in this run (LIGO/Virgo S190425z), we performed a dedicated follow-up campaign with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Palomar Gattini-IR telescopes. The initial skymap of this single-detector gravitational wave (GW) trigger spanned most of the sky observable from Palomar Observatory. Covering 8000 deg(2) of the initial skymap over the next two nights, corresponding to 46% integrated probability, ZTF system achieved a depth of 21 m(AB) in g- and r-bands. Palomar Gattini-IR covered 2200 square degrees in J-band to a depth of 15.5 mag, including 32% integrated probability based on the initial skymap. The revised skymap issued the following day reduced these numbers to 21% for the ZTF and 19% for Palomar Gattini-IR. We narrowed 338,646 ZTF transient ?alerts? over the first two nights of observations to 15 candidate counterparts. Two candidates, ZTF19aarykkb and ZTF19aarzaod, were particularly compelling given that their location, distance, and age were consistent with the GW event, and their early optical light curves were photometrically consistent with that of kilonovae. These two candidates were spectroscopically classified as young core-collapse supernovae. The remaining candidates were ruled out as supernovae. Palomar Gattini-IR did not identify any viable candidates with multiple detections only after merger time. We demonstrate that even with single-detector GW events localized to thousands of square degrees, systematic kilonova discovery is feasible.

Four Newborn Planets Transiting the Young Solar Analog V1298 Tau	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Exoplanets; Exoplanet astronomy; Exoplanet evolution; Transit photometry; Planetary system formation; Weak-line T Tauri stars; Young star clusters	KEPLER; SYSTEMS; MIGRATION; EFFICIENT; ORIGIN; ORBITS; STARS; MASS	Exoplanets orbiting pre-main-sequence stars are laboratories for studying planet evolution processes, including atmospheric loss, orbital migration, and radiative cooling. V1298 Tau, a young solar analog with an age of 23 +/- 4 Myr, is one such laboratory. The star is already known to host a Jupiter-sized planet on a 24 day orbit. Here, we report the discovery of three additional planets?all between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn?based on our analysis of K2 Campaign 4 photometry. Planets c and d have sizes of 5.6 and 6.4 <CDATA<i, respectively, and with orbital periods of 8.25 and 12.40 days reside 0.25% outside of the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Planet e is 8.7 K2 time series and thus has a period longer than 36 days, but likely shorter than 223 days. The V1298 Tau system may be a precursor to the compact multiplanet systems found to be common by the Kepler mission. However, the large planet sizes stand in sharp contrast to the vast majority of Kepler multiplanet systems, which have planets smaller than 3 <CDATA<i. Simple dynamical arguments suggest total masses of <28 <CDATA<i and <120 <CDATA<i for the c?d and d?b planet pairs, respectively. The implied low masses suggest that the planets may still be radiatively cooling and contracting, and perhaps losing atmosphere. The V1298 Tau system offers rich prospects for further follow-up including atmospheric characterization by transmission or eclipse spectroscopy, dynamical characterization through transit-timing variations, and measurements of planet masses and obliquities by radial velocities.

Currently, SMAP has an L-band radiometer and a defunct L-band radar with a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna. On July 7th, 2015, the SMAP radar malfunctioned and became inoperable. Consequently, the production of high-resolution active-passive soil moisture product got hampered, and only similar to 2.5 months (April 15th, 2015 to July 7th, 2015) of data remain available. Therefore, during the SMAP post-radar phase, many ways were examined to restart the high-resolution soil moisture product generation of the SMAP mission. One of the feasible approaches was to substitute the SMAP radar with other available SAR data. Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B SAR data was found most suitable for combining with the SMAP radiometer data because of its nearly similar orbit configuration that allows overlapping of their swaths with a minimal time difference, a key feature/requirement for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. The Sentinel interferometric wide swath (IW) mode acquisition also provides the co-polarized and cross-polarized observations required for the SMAP active-passive algorithm. However, some differences do exist between the SMAP and Sentinel SAR data. They are mainly: 1) Sentinel has a C-band SAR whereas SMAP operates at L-band; 2) Sentinel has multiple incidence angles within its swath, and SMAP has one single incidence angle; and 3) Sentinel 1A/B Interferometric Wide (IW) swath width is similar to 250 km as compared to SMAP with 1000 km swath width. On any given day, the narrow swath width of the Sentinel observations significantly reduces the overlap spatial coverage between SMAP and Sentinel as compared to the original SMAP radar and radiometer swath coverage. Hence, the temporal resolution (revisit interval) suffers due to narrow overlapped swath width and degrades from 3 days to 12 days. One advantage of using very high-resolution resolution Sentinel-1A/Sentinel-1B data in the SMAP active-passive algorithm is the potential of obtaining the disaggregated brightness temperature and thus soil moisture at a much finer spatial resolution of 3 km and 1 km at global extent. The assessment of high-resolution product at 3 km and 1 km using the soil moisture calibration and validations sites shows reasonable accuracy of similar to 0.05 m(3)/m(3). The SMAP-Sentinel1 active-passive high-resolution product is now available to the public (new version released in October 2018) through NSIDC (NASA DAAC). The duration of this product is from April 2015 to current date.	[Das, Narendra N.; Dunbar, R.

Working towards confident spaceborne monitoring of carbon emissions from cities using Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						OCO-2; Urban emissions; Carbon dioxide; Urbanization	DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; CO2 EMISSIONS; URBAN; FLUX; AREAS; MODIS; VARIABILITIES; URBANIZATION; ENHANCEMENTS; INVENTORY	Cities are responsible for 70% of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (FFCO2), and these emissions are poorly monitored. As a result, the use of spaceborne observation as a tool for addressing urban FFCO2 emissions has intensified. This work aims to understand the suitability of modern spaceborne remote sensing for capturing CO2 urban enhancement and for monitoring FFCO2 emissions from cities. We have used the first four years of observations from NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) to collect CO2 urban anomalies (XCO2ano) from large cities (> 500 km(2) area) by combining urban-to-rural gradient and statistical filtering approaches. Approximately half of all XCO2ano (44%) were significant and noise-free to meet the accuracy requirements for city-scale applications. We captured positive CO2 enhancement over urban areas compared to background at a global scale. Median XCO2ano estimates were positive at 1.07 +/- 0.80 ppm (worldwide), 1.05 +/- 0.80 ppm (Northern Hemisphere), and 0.96 +/- 0.80 ppm (Southern Hemisphere). Most monthly XCO2ano (similar to 83%) emerged in four regions of the Northern Hemisphere (East Asia, Europe, North America, and South Asia), where most cities with strong emissions are located. We report that the XCO2ano from numerous cities have a moderate linear relationship with city size (r = 0.54-0.65) and FFCO2 strength (r = 0.64). As expected, five out of the six strongest XCO2ano were found over the megacities ( > 10 million population) of Los Angeles (2.04 +/- 0.91 ppm), Tehran (1.94 +/- 1.54 ppm), Rhine-Main Metropolitan Area (1.51 +/- 0.59 ppm), Pearl River Delta (1.48 +/- 1.11 ppm), and Seoul (1.47 +/- 1.72 ppm), with Houston (1.50 +/- 0.72 ppm) as the only non-megacity. Overall, we have shown that spaceborne remote sensing of XCO2 is suitable for capturing CO2 enhancement over a wide range of cities (especially in the Northern Hemisphere). Though we registered the global-scale urban footprint in CO2 signal and demonstrated the sensitivity of XCO2ano to city size and FFCO2, spaceborne remote sensing is still limited in its provision of columnar CO2 enhancement which is fundamentally linked with underlying urban emissions. This linkage may be more effectively addressed when spaceborne remote sensing becomes increasingly optimized for city-scale applications.

Half a century of satellite remote sensing of sea-surface temperature	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Fifty year review	INFRARED RADIOMETER CALIBRATION; TRACK SCANNING RADIOMETERS; GULF-STREAM SEPARATION; IN-SITU; GLOBAL OCEAN; MEDITERRANEAN-SEA; DATA ASSIMILATION; DIURNAL CYCLE; SKIN TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Sea-surface temperature (SST) was one of the first ocean variables to be studied from earth observation satellites. Pioneering images from infrared scanning radiometers revealed the complexity of the surface temperature fields, but these were derived from radiance measurements at orbital heights and included the effects of the intervening atmosphere. Corrections for the effects of the atmosphere to make quantitative estimates of the SST became possible when radiometers with multiple infrared channels were deployed in 1979. At the same time, imaging microwave radiometers with SST capabilities were also flown. Since then, SST has been derived from infrared and microwave radiometers on polar orbiting satellites and from infrared radiometers on geostationary spacecraft. As the performances of satellite radiometers and SST retrieval algorithms improved, accurate, global, high resolution, frequently sampled SST fields became fundamental to many research and operational activities. Here we provide an overview of the physics of the derivation of SST and the history of the development of satellite instruments over half a century. As demonstrated accuracies increased, they stimulated scientific research into the oceans, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the climate. We provide brief overviews of the development of some applications, including the feasibility of generating Climate Data Records. We summarize the important role of the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) in providing a forum for scientists and operational practitioners to discuss problems and results, and to help coordinate activities world-wide, including alignment of data formatting and protocols and research. The challenges of burgeoning data volumes, data distribution and analysis have benefited from simultaneous progress in computing power, high capacity storage, and communications over the Internet, so we summarize the development and current capabilities of data archives. We conclude with an outlook of developments anticipated in the next decade or so.	[Minnett, P.

The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is the first science-driven GNSS-R satellite mission. Although the CYGNSS mission is motivated and designed to better observe weather processes, the data are also useful for other applications, including surface hydrology. This paper aims to demonstrate that CYGNSS has a capability for frequent, high-resolution observations of the wetland dynamics across a wide range of timescales in the tropics. Using matched estimates of water depth from the Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN), we develop methods for mapping inundation over the South Florida Everglades wetland region using CYGNSS data. CYGNSS enables inundation mapping at rapid timescales throughout the diverse Everglades ecosystem, and the data could be complementary to those of well-established observational platforms. The strengths of GNSS-R could be leveraged with the strengths of other techniques to enable studies of wetlands dynamically at short timescales.

Land ice height-retrieval algorithm for NASA's ICESat-2 photon-counting laser altimeter	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						ICESat-2; Laser altimeter; Ice sheets; Glaciers; Land ice; Cryosphere	GREENLAND	The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and its sole scientific instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), was launched on 15 September 2018 with a primary goal of measuring changes in the surface of the Earth's land ice (glaciers and ice sheets). ATLAS is a photon-counting laser altimeter, which records the transit time of individual photons in order to reconstruct surface height along track. The ground-track pattern repeats every 91 days such that changes in ice sheet surface height can be estimated through time. In this paper, we describe the set of algorithms that have been developed for ICESat-2 to retrieve ice sheet surface height from the geolocated photons for the Land Ice Along-Track Height Product (ATL06), and demonstrate their output and performance using a synthetic dataset over various land-ice surfaces and under different cloud conditions. We show that the ATL06 algorithm is expected to perform at the level required to meet the ICESat-2 science objectives for land ice.

Persistence of the colour-density relation and efficient environmental quenching to z similar to 1.4	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: groups: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; POST-STARBURST GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION ACTIVITY; VLT DEEP SURVEY; SDSS-IV MANGA; STELLAR MASS; RED-SEQUENCE; SPECTROSCOPIC CONFIRMATION; CL-1604 SUPERCLUSTER; CL1604 SUPERCLUSTER	Using similar to 5000 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies drawn from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey we investigate the relationship between colour and galaxy density for galaxy populations of various stellar masses in the redshift range 0.55 <= z <= 1.4. The fraction of galaxies with colours consistent with no ongoing star formation (f(q)) is broadly observed to increase with increasing stellar mass, increasing galaxy density, and decreasing redshift, with clear differences observed in (fq) between field and group/cluster galaxies at the highest redshifts studied. We use a semi-empirical model to generate a suite of mock group/cluster galaxies unaffected by environmentally specific processes and compare these galaxies at fixed stellar mass and redshift to observed populations to constrain the efficiency of environmentally driven quenching (Psi(convert)). High-density environments from 0.55 <= z <= 1.4 appear capable of efficiently quenching galaxies with log(M-*/M-circle dot) > 10.45. Lower stellar mass galaxies also appear efficiently quenched at the lowest redshifts studied here, but this quenching efficiency is seen to drop precipitously with increasing redshift. Quenching efficiencies, combined with simulated group/cluster accretion histories and results on the star formation rate-density relation from a companion ORELSE study, are used to constrain the average time from group/cluster accretion to quiescence and the elapsed time between accretion and the inception of the quenching event. These time-scales were constrained to be < t(convert)> = 2.4 +/- 0.3 and < t(delay)> = 1.3 +/- 0.4 Gyr, respectively, for galaxies with log(M-*/M-circle dot) > 10.45 and < t(convert)> = 3.3 +/- 0.3 and < t(delay)> = 2.2 +/- 0.4 Gyr for lower stellar mass galaxies. These quenching efficiencies and associated time-scales are used to rule out certain environmental mechanisms as being the primary processes responsible for transforming the star formation properties of galaxies over this 4 Gyr window in cosmic time.

Quantitative Assessment of State-Dependent Atmospheric Motion Vector Uncertainties	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Cloud tracking; cloud motion winds; Satellite observations; Error analysis; Data assimilation	TROPICAL CYCLONE TRACK; CLOUD-DRIFT WINDS; WATER-VAPOR; TROPOSPHERIC WINDS; MET OFFICE; ASSIMILATION; IMPACT; FORECASTS; SYSTEM; IMAGES	This study examines the error characteristics of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) obtained by tracking the movement of water vapor features. A high-resolution numerical simulation of a dynamic weather event is used as a baseline, and AMVs tracked from retrieved water vapor fields are compared with the "true" winds produced by the model. The sensitivity of AMV uncertainty to time interval, AMV tracking window size, water vapor content, horizontal gradient, and wind structure is examined. AMVs are derived from the model water vapor field at a specific height and also from water vapor fields vertically blurred using smoothing functions consistent with high-spectral-resolution infrared (IR) and high-frequency microwave (MW) water vapor sounders. Uncertainties in water vapor AMVs are state dependent and are largest for regions with small water vapor content and small water vapor spatial gradient and in places where the flow runs parallel to contours of constant water vapor content. Smoothing of water vapor consistent with IR and MW retrievals does not increase AMV uncertainty; however, the yield of AMVs from IR sounders is much lower than from MW sounders because of the inability of IR sounders to retrieve water vapor below clouds. The yield and error are similar for AMVs in the lower and upper troposphere, even though the water vapor content in the upper troposphere is much smaller. The results have implications for the design of new observing systems, as well as the specification of errors when AMVs are ingested in data assimilation systems.

(1)), providing critical information on the formation of the planets, stars and galaxies, as well as the atmospheric constituents of the planets, their moons, comets and asteroids(2-9). The detection of faint fluxes of photons at terahertz frequencies is crucial for many planetary, cosmological and astrophysical studies(10-14). For example, understanding the physics and molecular chemistry of the life cycle of stars and their relationship with the interstellar medium in galaxies requires heterodyne detectors with noise temperatures close to the quantum limit(15). Near-quantum-limited heterodyne terahertz detection has so far been possible only through the use of cryogenically cooled superconducting mixers as frequency downconverters(15-18). Here we introduce a heterodyne terahertz detection scheme that uses plasmonic photomixing for frequency downconversion to offer quantum-level sensitivities at room temperature. Frequency downconversion is achieved by mixing terahertz radiation and a heterodyning optical beam with a terahertz beat frequency in a plasmonics-enhanced semiconductor active region. We demonstrate terahertz detection sensitivities down to three times the quantum limit at room temperature. With a versatile design capable of broadband operation over a 0.1-5.0 THz bandwidth, this plasmonic photomixer has broad applicability to astronomy, cosmology, atmospheric studies, gas sensing and quantum optics.

Validation of SMAP Soil Moisture Products Using Ground-Based Observations for the Paddy Dominated Tropical Region of India	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Soil moisture; Moisture; Soil measurements; Moisture measurement; Agriculture; Geophysical measurements; Eastern India; enhanced soil moisture product; paddy dominated region; Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP); SMAP-Sentinel; validation		The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission currently provides three surface soil moisture products based solely on instrument measurements. The three soil moisture products are: 1) the radiometer-only 36 km gridded; 2) a radiometer-only enhanced product gridded at 9 km; and 3) a high-resolution (3 km) SMAP-Sentinel activepassive product. It is important to validate these released SMAP soil moisture products over various land covers and hydroclimatic domains before they are routinely used in scientific research and applications. This paper evaluates SMAP-based soil moisture products for typical Indian conditions of extreme seasonal variability that leads to changes from very wet to dry soil, especially for the paddy dominated region. The assessment metrics indicate that the enhanced passive-only soil moisture product meets the SMAP accuracy requirement of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) during the nongrowing season (NGS) with unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values ranging between 0.025 and 0.036 m(3)/m(3). However, this product underperformed during the paddy growing season (GS) with ubRMSE values ranging between 0.063 and 0.097 m(3)/m(3). In addition, the SMAP-Sentinel activepassive soil moisture product shows satisfactory performance during the NGS (ubRMSE, 0.0170.051 m(3)/m(3)), but during the GS, ubRMSE ranged between 0.089 and 0.104 m(3)/m(3). Use of the vegetation water content climatology and low clay fraction in SMAP baseline algorithm (auxiliary database) that mismatched with the actual values may be the possible source of errors and biases in the SMAP soil moisture products. The reported study provides guidelines for the application of enhanced SMAP soil moisture products in India, especially for the tropical region, and provides information that can be used to improve the retrieval algorithm.

Spectra over the range of 0.52 GHz were compared to thermal infrared images collected during the airborne campaign and also compared to nearly concurrent Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Based on those comparisons, spectral signatures were associated with thick multiyear ice and thin ice. A radiative transfer (RT) model consisting of a homogeneous slab of sea ice bounded by sea water and air was then used to invert the spectra for sea ice thickness and salinity. Inferred thicknesses were consistent with ice thickness climatology for ice floes in the Lincoln Sea. Salinities are higher than expected which may be a consequence of neglecting surface and volume scattering contributions in the models.

Robotic mobility systems can study the varied geology and origins of these bodies if they are able to navigate the complex terrains of ocean worlds. The topographical features of ocean worlds present a unique combination of challenges for mobility. These include cryogenic ice, penitentes, salt evaporites, chaotic regions, and regolith with uncertain shear and sinkage properties. Uncertainty in both terrain properties and geometry motivates design of a platform that is mobile within a large range of obstacle geometries and terrain properties. This article reports on a research effort to study the requirements and numerically optimize the kinematic parameters of the rover to satisfy these goals. The platforms selected in the process were further verified via simulation. A simulation and analysis of grousers generated suitable designs for interaction with similar ledges and rough terrain. From this analysis, a prototype was developed and tested to meet the wide range of topography and terramechanics conditions expected on these bodies.

However, conversion of cropland to meet the cellulosic feedstock production goals may have unforeseen environmental consequences. Using Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) outputs and National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA NASS) economic data, we conducted a spatial optimization of bioenergy feedstock introduction into the Arkansas White-Red River Basin based on water quality and economic objectives, subject to constraints on total land conversion. Results displayed tradeoffs between bioenergy yield for three crops (switchgrass, sorghum and poplar) and land rent objectives. Optimal solutions tended to prioritize conversion of land in eastern AWR subbasins where yield and water quality objective improvements were greatest. A small number of subbasins contributed to basin-wide water quality improvements, whereas subbasins contributing to economic benefits were more spatially dispersed, indicating that water quality responses are more likely to constrain feedstock placement. Biomass production targets can be met vianumerous spatial arrangements, whereas marginal improvement in water quality objectives can best be achieved by selectively siting perennial feedstocks in the eastern half of the region.

However, the amount of CO2 released in winter is not known and has not been well represented by ecosystem models or empirically based estimates(5,6). Here we synthesize regional in situ observations of CO2 flux from Arctic and boreal soils to assess current and future winter carbon losses from the northern permafrost domain. We estimate a contemporary loss of 1,662 TgC per year from the permafrost region during the winter season (October-April). This loss is greater than the average growing season carbon uptake for this region estimated from process models (-1,032 TgC per year). Extending model predictions to warmer conditions up to 2100 indicates that winter CO2 emissions will increase 17% under a moderate mitigation scenario-Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5-and 41% under business-as-usual emissions scenario-Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Our results provide a baseline for winter CO2 emissions from northern terrestrial regions and indicate that enhanced soil CO2 loss due to winter warming may offset growing season carbon uptake under future climatic conditions.

An interval of high salinity in ancient Gale crater lake on Mars	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; CALCIUM-SULFATE; PAHRUMP HILLS; IDENTIFICATION; CHEMISTRY; ROCKS; PRECIPITATION; STRATIGRAPHY	Precipitated minerals, including salts, are primary tracers of atmospheric conditions and water chemistry in lake basins. Ongoing in situ exploration by the Curiosity rover of Hesperian (around 3.3-3.7 Gyr old) sedimentary rocks within Gale crater on Mars has revealed clay-bearing fluvio-lacustrine deposits with sporadic occurrences of sulfate minerals, primarily as late-stage diagenetic veins and concretions. Here we report bulk enrichments, disseminated in the bedrock, of 30-50 wt% calcium sulfate intermittently over about 150 m of stratigraphy, and of 26-36 wt% hydrated magnesium sulfate within a thinner section of strata. We use geochemical analysis, primarily from the ChemCam laser-induced breakdown spectrometer, combined with results from other rover instruments, to characterize the enrichments and their lithology. The deposits are consistent with early diagenetic, pre-compaction salt precipitation from brines concentrated by evaporation, including magnesium sulfate-rich brines from extreme evaporative concentration. This saline interval represents a substantial hydrological perturbation of the lake basin, which may reflect variations in Mars' obliquity and orbital parameters. Our findings support stepwise changes in Martian climate during the Hesperian, leading to more arid and sulfate-dominated environments as previously inferred from orbital observations.

Earthquake-triggered 2018 Palu Valley landslides enabled by wet rice cultivation	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							LIQUEFACTION; SUPERSHEAR; FAULT	The death toll and economic impact of an earthquake can be greatly exacerbated if seismic ground shaking triggers landslides. Earthquake-triggered landslides typically occur in two different contexts: localized failure of steep slopes and resulting landslides that pose a major threat to life in areas below; and lateral spreading of nearly flat sediment plains due to shaking-induced liquefaction, which can damage large areas of critical infrastructure. Unexpected catastrophic landsliding triggered by the 28 September 2018 earthquake at Palu, Indonesia did not occur in either typical context, but produced both destructive outcomes. Here, we show that alluvial ground failure in the Palu Valley was a direct consequence of irrigation creating a new liquefaction hazard. Aqueduct-supported cultivation, primarily of wet rice, raised the water table to near ground level, saturating sandy alluvial soils that liquefied in response to strong ground shaking. Large-displacement lateral spreads occurred on slopes of 1 degrees. Slopes steeper than 1.5 degrees sourced long-runout landslides and debris flows that swept through villages occupying the gentler slopes below. The resulting damage and loss of life would probably not have occurred in the absence of a raised water table. Earthquake-triggered landsliding of gentle, irrigated alluvial slopes is an under-recognized, but avoidable, anthropogenic hazard.

Evaluation of CMIP5 ability to reproduce twentieth century regional trends in surface air temperature and precipitation over CONUS	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						CMIP5; Model evaluation; Surface air temperature; Multi-model ensemble	EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BASIC EVALUATION; UNITED-STATES; WARMING HOLE; SIMULATION; VARIABILITY; FORMULATION	The ability of the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to reproduce twentieth-century climate trends over the seven CONUS regions of the National Climate Assessment is evaluated. This evaluation is carried out for summer and winter for three time periods, 1895-1939, 1940-1979, and 1980-2005. The evaluation includes all 206 CMIP5 historical simulations from 48 unique models and their multi-model ensemble (MME), as well as a gridded in situ dataset of surface air temperature and precipitation. Analysis is performed on both individual members and the MME, and considers reproducing the correct sign of the trends by the members as well as reproducing the trend values. While the MME exhibits some trend bias in most cases, it reproduces historical temperature trends with reasonable fidelity for summer for all time periods and all regions, including at the CONUS scale, except the Northern Great Plains from 1895 to 1939 and Southeast during 1980-2005. Likewise, for DJF, the MME reproduces historical temperature trends across all time periods over all regions, including at the CONUS scale, except the Southeast from 1895 to 1939 and the Midwest during 1940-1979. Model skill was highest across all of the seven regions during JJA and DJF for the 1980-2005 period. The quantitatively best result is seen during DJF in the Southwest region with at least 74% of the ensemble members correctly reproducing the observed trend across all of the time periods. No clear trends in MME precipitation were identified at these scales due to high model precipitation variability.

Two models were run, a primary model by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a secondary model by researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both of which were based on selected starting conditions for various surface composition cases that establish the worst-case scenario, including geological data collected by the Mars Science Laboratory at Gale Crater. The summary outputs of both modeling efforts showed similar results: that the introduction of the modeled heat source could temporarily create the conditions established for a Special Region, but that there would be no transport mechanism by which an introduced terrestrial microbe, even if it was active during the temporarily induced Special Region conditions, could be transported to a naturally occurring Special Region of Mars.

Assessing present and future coastal moderation of extreme heat in the Eastern United States	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme heat; downscaled projections; coastal impacts; climate change; high resolution	LARGE-SCALE FLOW; NEW-YORK-CITY; SEA-BREEZE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENSEMBLE PROJECTIONS; POPULATION EXPOSURE; REGIONAL CLIMATE; WARMING CONTRAST; BIAS CORRECTION; TEMPERATURE	Climate models suggest a rapid increase of extremely hot days in coming decades. Cool marine air currently ventilates extreme heat in populous coastal regions, diminishing its impacts, but how well climate models capture this effect is uncertain. Here we conduct a comprehensive observational analysis of coastal extreme-heat ventilation?its length scale, magnitude, and regional patterns?and evaluate two ensembles of downscaled global climate models along the eastern US coast. We find that coastal areas are 2 C?4 C cooler than ?60 km inland, resulting in reductions near 50% in population exposure to temperatures above 35 C. Large seasonal and inter-regional variations are closely linked with land-sea temperature contrasts. High-resolution models underestimate coastal cooling by 50%?75%, implying that substantial and spatiotemporally varying model bias correction is necessary to create accurate projections of coastal extreme heat, which is expected to rise considerably with anthropogenic forcing. Our results underline the importance of regionally- and observationally-based perspectives for assessing future extreme heat and its impacts, and for positioning effective heat-risk management for communities and jurisdictions that span coast-to-inland areas.

J	Amrouni, O; Hzami, A; Heggy, E				Amrouni, Oula; Hzami, Abderraouf; Heggy, Essam			Photogrammetric assessment of shoreline retreat in North Africa: Anthropogenic and natural drivers	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Shoreline retreat; Coastal dynamics; Littoral sedimentation; Seawater intrusion; Change detection; Land-use and groundwater	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CAP-BON; SEDIMENT DYNAMICS; COASTAL AQUIFER; TUNISIA; VARIABILITY; GROUNDWATER; GULF; SALINIZATION; EVOLUTION	Shoreline retreat along extended semi-arid areas of North African coasts are indicative of the imbalance of coastal sedimentary processes due to modern abrupt changes in precipitation patterns and urban growth. Monitoring of the diachronic shoreline position and land-use from 1952 to 2018 in the coast of the Hammamet Bay in central-east Tunisia, using both aerial and orbital photogrammetric scenes and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System from 1887 to 2018, suggests shoreline retreat rates ranging from -1.3 to -5.6 m/yr. Such rates are abnormal when compared to the average of -0.07 m/yr suggested by global-scale assessment modeling for sandy beach evolution. These abnormal erosions extend over 65 km of sandy beaches, resulting from a severe deficit of sediment transport caused primarily by rapid coastal urban growth that obstructs sediment flow to the shoreline. We suggest that the high retreat rates observed in the low-population period of 1884-1931 originated mainly from storm surges and tsunamis, or potentially subsidence in the coastal substratum. Moreover, our analysis of the salinity of shallow coastal aquifers and land coverage suggests that shoreline retreat coupled with rapid urban growth accelerated seawater intrusion similar to 5 km inland, causing soil desiccation, the development of salt lakes, and reduction of vegetation coverage by similar to 18%. These abrupt environmental changes have a severe, adverse impact on crop production and food security in these densely populated and economically important areas across significant parts of the North African coasts, sharing similar key environmental parameters with our study site. We conclude that anthropogenic drivers are the major source of shoreline retreat rather than natural ones.

An Observational Overview of Dusty Deep Convection in Martian Dust Storms	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Deep convection; Dust or dust storms; Mesoscale processes; Mesoscale systems; Planetary atmospheres	MARS ORBITER CAMERA; WATER ICE CLOUDS; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; OPTICAL DEPTH; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CIRCULATION; VAPOR; TRANSPORT; CLIMATE	Deep convection, as used in meteorology, refers to the rapid ascent of air parcels in Earth's troposphere driven by the buoyancy generated by phase change in water. Deep convection undergirds some of Earth's most important and violent weather phenomena and is responsible for many aspects of the observed distribution of energy, momentum, and constituents (particularly water) in Earth's atmosphere. Deep convection driven by buoyancy generated by the radiative heating of atmospheric dust may be similarly important in the atmosphere of Mars but lacks a systematic description. Here we propose a comprehensive framework for this phenomenon of dusty deep convection (DDC) that is supported by energetic calculations and observations of the vertical dust distribution and exemplary dusty deep convective structures within local, regional, and global dust storm activity. In this framework, DDC is distinct from a spectrum of weaker dusty convective activity because DDC originates from preexisting or concurrently forming mesoscale circulations that generate high surface dust fluxes, oppose large-scale horizontal advective-diffusive processes, and are thus able to maintain higher dust concentrations than typically simulated. DDC takes two distinctive forms. Mesoscale circulations that form near Mars's highest volcanoes in dust storms of all scales can transport dust to the base of the upper atmosphere in as little as 2 h. In the second distinctive form, mesoscale circulations at low elevations within regional and global dust storm activity generate freely convecting streamers of dust that are sheared into the middle atmosphere over the diurnal cycle.

Megan			BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey - XIII. The nature of the most luminous obscured AGN in the low-redshift universe	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert; radio continuum: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; X-RAY-EMISSION; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; FUNDAMENTAL PLANE; STAR-FORMATION; STELLAR MASS; II QUASARS; HOST GALAXIES; DATA RELEASE	We present a multiwavelength analysis of 28 of the most luminous low-redshift narrow-line, ultra-hard X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) drawn from the 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky survey, with bolometric luminosities of log(L-bol/erg s(-1)) greater than or similar to 45.25. The broad goal of our study is to determine whether these objects have any distinctive properties, potentially setting them aside from lower luminosity obscured AGN in the local Universe. Our analysis relies on the first data release of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS/DR1) and on dedicated observations with the VLT, Palomar, and Keck observatories. We find that the vast majority of our sources agree with commonly used AGN selection criteria which are based on emission line ratios and on mid-infrared colours. Our AGN are pre-dominantly hosted in massive galaxies (9.8 less than or similar to log (M-*/M-circle dot) less than or similar to 11.7); based on visual inspection of archival optical images, they appear to be mostly ellipticals. Otherwise, they do not have distinctive properties. Their radio luminosities, determined from publicly available survey data, show a large spread of almost four orders of magnitude- much broader than what is found for lower X-ray luminosity obscured AGN in BASS. Moreover, our sample shows no preferred combination of black hole masses (M-BH) and/or Eddington ratio (lambda(Edd)), covering 7.5 less than or similar to log (M-BH/M-circle dot) less than or similar to 10.3 and 0.01 less than or similar to lambda(Edd) less than or similar to 1. Based on the distribution of our sources in the lambda(Edd)-N-H plane, we conclude that our sample is consistent with a scenario where the amount of obscuring material along the line of sight is determined by radiation pressure exerted by the AGN on the dusty circumnuclear gas.

We present BRAAI, a convolutional-neural-network, deep-learning real/bogus classifier designed to separate genuine astrophysical events and objects from false positive, or bogus, detections in the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a new robotic time-domain survey currently in operation at the Palomar Observatory in California, USA. BRAAI demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance as quantified by its low false negative and false positive rates. We describe the open-source software tools used internally at Caltech to archive and access ZTF's alerts and light curves (KOWALSKI), and to label the data (ZWICKYVERSE). We also report the initial results of the classifier deployment on the Edge Tensor Processing Units that show comparable performance in terms of accuracy, but in a much more (cost-) efficient manner, which has significant implications for current and future surveys.

Discs and star-forming galaxies follow similar mass-size relations. The mass-size relation of bulges is less steep than the one of quiescent galaxies (best-fitting slope of 0.7 for quiescent galaxies against 0.4 for bulges). We find little dependence of the structural properties of massive bulges and discs with the global morphology of galaxies (disc versus bulge dominated) and the star formation activity (star-forming versus quiescent). This result suggests similar bulge formation mechanisms for most massive galaxies and also that the formation of the bulge component does not significantly affect the disc structure. Our results pose a challenge to current cosmological models that predict distinct structural properties for stellar bulges arising from mergers and disc instabilities.

Template-free estimates of galaxy properties from colours	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: fundamental parameters	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; MASS; CLASSIFICATION; EVOLUTION; COSMOS; ULTRAVIOLET; CONSTRAINTS	Using the HORIZON-AGN hydrodynamical simulation and self-organizing maps (SOMs), we show how to compress the complex, high-dimensional data structure of a simulation into a 2D grid, which greatly facilitates the analysis of how galaxy observables are connected to intrinsic properties. We first verify the tight correlation between the observed 0.3-5 mu m broad-band colours of HORIZON-AGN galaxies and their high-resolution spectra. The correlation is found to extend to physical properties such as redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). This direct mapping from colour to physical parameter space still works after including photometric uncertainties that mimic the COSMOS survey. We then label the SOM grid with a simulated calibration sample to estimate redshift and SFR for COSMOS-like galaxies up to z similar to 3. In comparison to state-of-the-art techniques based on synthetic templates, our method is comparable in performance but less biased at estimating redshifts, and significantly better at predicting SFRs. In particular, our 'data-driven' approach, in contrast to model libraries, intrinsically allows for the complexity of galaxy formation and can handle sample biases. We advocate that observations to calibrate this method should be one of the goals of next-generation galaxy surveys.	[Davidzon, I.; Capak, P.

In a fiducial non-linear alignment model analysis, assuming a flat Lambda cold dark matter cosmology, we find a significant difference in intrinsic alignment amplitude, with early-type galaxies favouring A(IA) = 2.38(-0.31)(+0.32) and latetype galaxies consistent with no intrinsic alignments at 0.05(-0.09)(+0.10). The analysis is repeated using a number of extended model spaces, including a physically motivated model that includes both tidal torquing and tidal alignment mechanisms. In multiprobe likelihood chains in which cosmology, intrinsic alignments in both galaxy samples and all other relevant systematics are varied simultaneously, we find the tidal alignment and tidal torquing parts of the intrinsic alignment signal have amplitudes A(1) = 2.66(-0.66)(+0.67), A(2) = -2.94(-1.83)(+1.94), respectively, for earlytype galaxies and A(1) = 0.62(-0.41)(+0.41), A(2) = -2.26(-1.16)(+1.30) for late-type galaxies. In the full (mixed) Y1 sample the best constraints are A(1) = 0.70(-0.38)(+0.41), A(2) = -1.36(-1.41)(+1.08). For all galaxy splits and IA models considered, we report cosmological parameter constraints consistent with the results of the main DES Y1 cosmic shear and multiprobe cosmology papers.

Both at the Jet Propulsion Lab-where the SKD materials were developed-and at Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc.-where the technology is being matured and optimized for fabrication under the Skutterudite Technology Maturation (SKD Tech Mat) Project-many SKD material batches have been produced. A strong correlation has been observed between the TE performance of the materials and the particular lot numbers (same producer and supplier) of various raw materials used to produce the SKD materials. An analysis of the differences between lots, their effects on performance, and the current plan to mitigate the risk posed by these results is discussed.

With this approach emissions are estimated as the products of estimates of areas of land use change characterized as activity data and estimates of emissions per unit area characterized as emission factors. For the special case of complete deforestation, the emission factor for the aboveground, live tree, biomass (AGB) pool can be estimated as mean biomass per unit area prior to the deforestation which, in turn, can be estimated using a single-date ground sample or a single-date biomass map. Multiple biomass maps at continental and global scales that can be considered for estimation of emissions factors have been forthcoming in recent years. However, regardless of the source of biomass data, estimates of emissions factors must still comply with the IPCC good practice guidelines for accuracy and uncertainty. For emission factors based on a biomass map, compliance requires validation of the map where validation means that independent reference data are used to ensure that the map is free from systematic error. The primary objective of the study was to illustrate methods for validating global AGB maps by assessing their conformity to reference data at the spatial scale of a sub-global validation site. For this study, validation entailed assessing the accuracy of map-based estimates of mean biomass per unit area for a sub-global, approximate 7600-km(2) validation site in Minnesota, United States of America (USA). The accuracy assessment was in the form of a test of the hypothesis of whether the map-based estimate is or is not equivalent to an estimate based on independent reference data obtained from either a ground sample or a local biomass map of greater quality than the global map. Design-based, model-based, and hybrid inferential methods were used to conduct the test. The primary conclusions were threefold. First, no map exhibited systematic error; second, the model-based inferential approach produced the smallest standard errors; and third, operationally, differences between validation site estimates of mean biomass per unit area for two global biomass maps and estimates based on reference data were not statistically significantly different.

Most of our detailed information about them comes from fleeting looks by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1980s. Voyager, and ground-based work since then, found that these planets, their satellites, rings, and magnetospheres, challenge our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We also now know that Uranus Neptune size planets are common around other stars. These are some of the reasons ice giant exploration was a high priority in NASA's most recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. In preparation for the next Decadal Survey, NASA, with ESA participation, conducted a broad study of possible ice giant missions in the 2024-2037 time frame. This paper summarizes the key results of the study, and addresses questions that have been raised by the science community and in a recent NASA review. Foremost amongst these are questions about the science objectives, the science payload, and the importance of an atmospheric probe. The conclusions of the NASA/ESA study remain valid. In particular, it is a high priority to send an orbiter and atmospheric probe to at least one of the ice giants, with instrumentation to study all components of an ice giant system. Uranus and Neptune are found to be equally compelling as science targets. The two planets are not equivalent, however, and each system has things to teach us the other cannot. An additional mission study is needed to refine plans for future exploration of these worlds.

The MINERVA mission is to discover super-Earths in the habitable zones of nearby stars. This can be accomplished with MINERVA's unique combination of high precision and high cadence over long time periods. In this work, we detail changes to the MINERVA facility that have occurred since our previous paper. We then describe MINERVA's robotic control software, the process by which we perform 1D spectral extraction, and our forward modeling Doppler pipeline. In the process of improving our forward modeling procedure, we found that our spectrograph's intrinsic instrumental profile is stable for at least nine months. Because of that, we characterized our instrumental profile with a time-independent, cubic spline function based on the profile in the cross dispersion direction, with which we achieved a radial velocity precision similar to using a conventional "sum-of-Gaussians" instrumental profile: 1.8 m s(-1) over 1.5 months on the RV standard star HD 122064. Therefore, we conclude that the instrumental profile need not be perfectly accurate as long as it is stable. In addition, we observed 51 Peg and our results are consistent with the literature, confirming our spectrograph and Doppler pipeline are producing accurate and precise radial velocities.

Evidence for ultra-cold traps and surface water ice in the lunar south polar crater Amundsen	ICARUS			English	Article						Moon; Permanent shadow; Polar; Volatiles; Emissivity	RADIOMETER; MOONS; TEMPERATURES; REGIONS	The northern floor and wall of Amundsen crater, near the lunar south pole, is a permanently shaded region (PSR). Previous study of this area using data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Diviner and LAMP instruments aboard Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) shows a spatial correlation between brighter 1064 nm albedo, annual maximum surface temperatures low enough to enable persistence of surface water ice (< 110 K), and anomalous ultraviolet radiation. We present results using data from Diviner that quantify the differential emissivities observed in the far-IR (near the Planck peak for PSR-relevant temperatures) between the PSR and a nearby non-PSR target in Amundsen Crater. We find features in far-IR emissivity (50-400 mu m) could be attributed to either, or a combination, of two effects (i) differential regolith emissive behavior between permanently-shadowed temperature regimes and those of normally illuminated polar terrain, perhaps related to presence of water frost (as indicated in other studies), or (ii) high degrees of anisothermality within observation fields of view caused by doubly-shaded areas within the PSR target that are colder than observed brightness temperatures. The implications in both cases are compelling: The far-IR emissivity curve of lunar cold traps may provide a metric for the abundance of "micro" cold traps that are ultra-cool, i.e. shadowed also from secondary and higher order radiation (absorption and re-radiation or scattering by surrounding terrain), or for emissive properties consistent with the presence of surface water ice.

The mean rotation rate of Venus from 29 years of Earth-based radar observations	ICARUS			English	Article						Venus; Radar observations; Rotational dynamics	WORKING GROUP; SPIN VECTOR; PERIOD; ELEMENTS	We measured the length of the Venus sidereal day (LOD) from Earth-based radar observations collected from 1988 to 2017, using offsets in surface feature longitudes from a prediction based on a 243.0185d period derived from analysis of Magellan mission images over a 487-day interval. We derive a mean LOD over 29 years of 243.0212 +/- 0.0006d. Our result is consistent with earlier estimates (but with smaller uncertainties), including those based on offsets between Venus Express infrared mapping data and Magellan topography that suggest a mean LOD of 243.0228 +/- 0.002d over a 16-year interval. We cannot detect subtle, short-term oscillations in rate, but the derived value provides an excellent fit to observational data over a 29-year period that can be used for future landing-site planning.

Unraveling the geologic and tectonic history of the Memnonia-Sirenum region of Mars: Implications on the early formation of the Tharsis rise	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Terra Sirenum; Tharsis; Sirenum Fossae; Memnonia Fossae	ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER; IMPACT CRATER; VALLES MARINERIS; SYRIA PLANUM; ALBA-PATERA; SYSTEM; TOPOGRAPHY; SURFACE; DEPRESSIONS; CHRONOLOGY	The geologic and tectonic history of the Memnonia-Sirenum region of Mars has been reconstructed on the basis of geologic mapping and relative-age dating of rock units and structures using crater counts and superposition relations. Comparisons between the ages of rock unit formation and the orientations of the earliest structures associated with Tharsis demonstrate a strong interplay among tectonic, magmatic, and aqueous activity in the Memnonia-Sirenum region. Early Noachian geologic activity identified within this region includes the formation of large northeast-trending, extensional basins. Stratigraphic and tectonic evidence suggests that these basins formed concurrently with the early formation of Tharsis when the dynamo and associated magnetosphere were still in operation. In addition to the ancient basins, later Tharsis-influenced activity includes prominent tectonic fault systems associated with the formation of Tharsis and Arsia Mons. Detailed mapping of the faults indicates that structures associated with Memnonia and Sirenum Fossae resulted from the formation of Tharsis during the Middle to Late Noachian. Late-stage (Amazonian) activity also identified within this region includes valley networks and collapse depressions that are linked and/or occur among Tharsis-centered faults that cut features throughout this region, including Mangala Valles.

Evaluation of Available Global Runoff Datasets Through a River Model in Support of Transboundary Water Management in South and Southeast Asia	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						water balance; discharge; global LSM; GLDAS; ERA-interim; GBM; Mekong	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; MEKONG BASIN; BRAHMAPUTRA; IRRIGATION; GANGES; FLOW; SIMULATIONS; NETWORK; FLOODS	Numerical models have become essential tools for simulating and forecasting hydro-meteorological variability, and to help better understand the Earth's water cycle across temporal and spatial scales. Hydrologic outputs from these numerical models are widely available and represent valuable alternatives for supporting water management in regions where observations are scarce, including in transboundary river basins where data sharing is limited. Yet, the wide range of existing Land Surface Model (LSM) outputs makes the choice of datasets challenging in the absence of detailed analysis of the hydrological variability and quantification of associated physical processes. Here we focus on two of the world's most populated transboundary river basins-the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) in South Asia and the Mekong in Southeast Asia-where downstream countries are particularly vulnerable to water related disasters in the absence of upstream hydro-meteorological information. In this study, several freely-available global LSM outputs are obtained from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis-interim/Land (ERA-interim/Land) and used to compute river discharge across these transboundary basins using a river network routing model. Simulations are then compared to historical discharge to assess runoff data quality and identify best-performing models with implications for the terrestrial water balance. This analysis examines the effects of meteorological inputs, land surface models, and their spatio-temporal resolution, as well as river network fineness and routing model parameters on hydrologic modeling performance. Our results indicate that the most recent runoff datasets yield the most accurate simulations in most cases, and suggest that meteorological inputs and the selection of the LSM may together be the most influential factors affecting discharge simulations. Conversely, the spatial and temporal resolution of the LSM and river model might have the least impact on the quality of simulated discharge, although the routing model parameters affect the timing of hydrographs.

Re(tBu-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl Supported on Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Selectively Reduces CO2 in Water	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; ELECTRODES; DIOXIDE; RHENIUM; CATALYSTS; ELECTROCATALYSTS; SUBSTITUENT; MANGANESE; PLANET; GOLD	The selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in water by a Re(tBu-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl catalyst incorporated into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was investigated. Current densities of similar to 4 mA/cm(2) and selectivities (FECO) of 99% were achieved at -0.56 V vs RHE in CO2-saturated aqueous KHCO3 solutions. The Re(tBu-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl catalyst has been widely studied as a homogeneous catalyst in organic solvents. Supporting Re(tBu-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl on MVVCNTs increases current densities, decreases overpotential, retains selectivity for reduction of CO2 to CO, and allows operation in water at pH = 7.3 compared to the molecular catalyst in acetonitrile solution. The Re/MWCNT electrocatalysts achieve TON > 5600 and TOF > 1.6 s(-1). This electrocatalyst material is efficient, robust, simple to prepare, and scalable.

Asymmetrical Shift Toward Longer Dry Spells Associated with Warming Temperatures During Russian Summers	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						drought; dry spell duration; climate change; Russia; precipitation; asymmetrical shift	HEAT WAVES; WATER-VAPOR; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; CLIMATE; INTENSITY; MORTALITY; WET	This study examines the changing behavior of summer dry spell duration in response to increasing air temperatures at 517 Russian stations during 1966-2010. We found that the frequency distribution of dry spell duration (as represented by histograms) is becoming skewed toward longer dry spells. This asymmetrical shift is accompanied by mean increases in dry spell duration. This asymmetry is also reflected in exponentially higher increasing rates of dry spell duration toward higher percentiles. Consequently, across Russia, summers have experienced significant increases in 7-day-or-longer dry spells (at 6.1%/degrees C of warming) and fewer occurrences of 3-day-or-shorter dry spells (at 2.4%/degrees C). This study suggests that hotter summers favor more frequent prolonged dry spells, exacerbating drought and heat wave conditions during Russian summers as air temperatures continue to rise.

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is emitted by chlorophyll, has a strong positive linear relationship with photosynthesis at the canopy scale. Recent advancements have allowed us to observe SIF globally with Earth observation satellites. Here we show that forest SIF did not decrease in the early dry season and increased substantially in the late dry season and early part of wet season, using SIF data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which has unprecedented spatial resolution and near-daily global coverage. Using in situ CO2 eddy flux data, we also show that cloud cover rarely affects photosynthesis at TROPOMI's midday overpass, a time when the forest canopy is most often light-saturated. The observed dry-season increases of forest SIF are not strongly affected by sun-sensor geometry, which was attributed as creating a pseudo dry-season green-up in the surface reflectance data. Our results provide strong evidence that greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of the tropical Amazonian forest increase during the dry season.

The timing jitter, which denotes the temporal resolution of the detection, is a crucial parameter for many applications. Despite extensive work since their apparition, the lowest jitter achievable with SNSPDs is still not clear, and the origin of the intrinsic limits is not fully understood. Understanding its intrinsic behavior and limits is a mandatory step toward improvements. Here, we report our experimental study on the intrinsically-limited timing jitter in molybdenum silicide SNSPDs. We show that to reach intrinsic jitter, crucial properties such as the latching current and the kinetic inductance of the devices have to be understood. The dependence on the nanowire thickness and the energy dependence of the intrinsic jitter are quantified, and the origin of the limits is exhibited. System timing jitter of 6.0 ps at 532 nm and 10.6 ps at 1550 nm photon wavelength has been obtained. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

Hydride assisted synthesis of the high temperature thermoelectric phase: Yb14MgSb11	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							YB14MNSB11; YB	Yb14MnSb11 is a p-type high temperature thermoelectric material that has been shown to have a peak zT of 1.3 at 1273 K and stable lifetime testing at that temperature for over 1500 h by NASA. Yb14MgSb11 is a structural analog, but the highest temperature thermoelectric properties have not yet been reported. Yb14MgSb11 has been prepared in an environmentally friendly route employing metal hydrides to provide phase pure samples with excellent control of stoichiometry. We present a comparative study employing either MgH2 or YbH2 as a reactive precursor that also facilitates milling of the elements. High purity compositions are synthesized, and their high temperature thermoelectric properties were measured on dense pellets. Temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties were measured from 300 to 1273 K. Yb14MgSb11 exhibited a peak zT = 1.2 at 1273 K due to an appreciable power factor and low-lattice thermal conductivity. Carrier concentration and hall mobility were also measured from 300 to 1275 K and ranged from 5.3 x 10(20) to 1.3 x 10(21) cm(-3) and from 4.7 to 0.7 cm(2) V-1 S-1, respectively.

This is done with a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) using synthetic CO2 column-average dry air mole fraction (XCO2) retrievals sampled at the OCO-2 satellite spatiotemporal frequency. The OSSEs utilized a 4-D variational (4D-Var) assimilation system with the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (CTM) to estimate CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes using synthetic OCO-2 observations. The impact of biosphere models in inverse model estimates of NEE is quantified by conducting OSSEs using the NASA-CASA, CASA-GFED, SiB-4, and LPJ models as prior estimates and using NEE from the multi-model ensemble mean of the Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project as the "truth". Results show that the assimilation of simulated XCO2 retrievals at OCO-2 observing modes over land results in posterior NEE estimates which generally reproduce "true" NEE globally and over terrestrial TransCom-3 regions that are well-sampled. However, we find larger spread among pos- terior NEE estimates, when using different prior NEE fluxes, in regions and seasons that have limited OCO-2 observational coverage and a large range in "bottom-up" NEE fluxes. Seasonally averaged posterior NEE estimates had standard deviations (SD) of similar to 10 % to similar to 50 % of the multi-modelmean NEE for different TransCom-3 land regions with significant NEE fluxes (regions/seasons with a NEE flux >= 0.5 PgC yr(-1)). On a global average, the seasonally averaged residual impact of the prior model NEE assumption on the posterior NEE spread is similar to 10 %-20 % of the posterior NEE mean. Additional OCO-2 OSSE simulations demonstrate that posterior NEE estimates are also sensitive to the assumed prior NEE flux uncertainty statistics, with spread in posterior NEE estimates similar to those when using variable prior model NEE fluxes. In fact, the sensitivity of posterior NEE estimates to prior error statistics was larger than prior flux values in some regions/times in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere where sufficient OCO-2 data were available and large differences between the prior and truth were evident. Overall, even with the availability of spatiotemporally dense 000-2 data, noticeable residual differences (up to similar to 20 %-30 % globally and 50 % regionally) in posterior NEE flux estimates remain that were caused by the choice of prior model flux values and the specification of prior flux uncertainties.

Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS-2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety-nine 10-km segments) that averages to >0.95 and > 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS-2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10-km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m. Sources of residual variance, attributable to differences between the two instruments, are discussed.	[Kwok, R.; Kacimi, S.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Markus, T.; Kurtz, N.

While observations at such high altitudes are rare, recently, NASA-HS3 and the Office of Naval Research-Tropical Cyclone Intensity campaigns deployed dropsondes from unprecedented levels around 18 km. In this work we use a wavenumber decomposition method to reproduce 2-D slices and 3-D structures from three storms from these campaigns: Edouard (2014), Joaquin (2015), and Patricia (2015). The analyzed data show that the development of high pressure at the hurricane's top leads to various degrees of gradient nonbalance. These highs are a hydrostatic reflection of the storm tilt, which offsets the warm core with respect to the near surface low and the slanted eyewall. The implications of these findings and the relations with recent reports of upper-level wind field are discussed.

Predicted yield of redshift 7 < z < 9 quasars from the wide survey	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						quasars: general; methods: statistical; surveys	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; LY-ALPHA EMISSION; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; Z-SIMILAR-TO-6 QUASARS; NEUTRAL HYDROGEN; ACCRETION FLOWS; BLACK-HOLES; REIONIZATION; STELLAR; IONIZATION	We provide predictions of the yield of 7 < z < 9 quasars from the Euclid wide survey, updating the calculation presented in the Euclid Red Book in several ways. We account for revisions to the Euclid near-infrared filter wavelengths; we adopt steeper rates of decline of the quasar luminosity function (QLF; Phi) with redshift, Phi proportional to 10(k(z-6)), k = 0:72, and a further steeper rate of decline, k = 0:92; we use better models of the contaminating populations (MLT dwarfs and compact early-type galaxies); and we make use of an improved Bayesian selection method, compared to the colour cuts used for the Red Book calculation, allowing the identification of fainter quasars, down to J(AB) similar to 23. Quasars at z > 8 may be selected from Euclid OYJH photometry alone, but selection over the redshift interval 7 < z < 8 is greatly improved by the addition of z-band data from, e.g., Pan-STARRS and LSST. We calculate predicted quasar yields for the assumed values of the rate of decline of the QLF beyond z = 6. If the decline of the QLF accelerates beyond z = 6, with k = 0.92, Euclid should nevertheless find over 100 quasars with 7.0 < z < 7.5, and similar to 25 quasars beyond the current record of z = 7.5, including similar to 8 beyond z = 8.0. The first Euclid quasars at z > 7.5 should be found in the DR1 data release, expected in 2024. It will be possible to determine the bright-end slope of the QLF, 7 < z < 8, M-1450 < 25, using 8m class telescopes to confirm candidates, but follow-up with JWST or E-ELT will be required to measure the faint-end slope. Contamination of the candidate lists is predicted to be modest even at J(AB) similar to 23. The precision with which k can be determined over 7 < z < 8 depends on the value of k, but assuming k = 0.72 it can be measured to a 1 sigma uncertainty of 0.07.	[Barnett, R.; Warren, S.

Also of interest, is the potential for in-space manufacturing of metal alloys and the use of microgravity to determine fundamental thermophysical properties to inform ground-based modeling and experimentation. In this work, a Zr-based bulk metallic glass was processed in the electromagnetic levitator ISS-EML to determine undercooling, electrical resistivity, specific heat capacity, surface tension, and viscosity. A 6.5 mm sphere was vitrified during the processing, resulting in the first bulk metallic glass manufactured on board the international space station (ISS).	[Mohr, M.; Wunderlich, R.

A Recent Systematic Increase in Vapor Pressure Deficit over Tropical South America	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DRY-SEASON CLIMATE; EVAPORATIVE FRACTION; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; AMAZON BASIN; LAND-USE; DROUGHT; CARBON; FOREST; DEFORESTATION; TRENDS	We show a recent increasing trend in Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) over tropical South America in dry months with values well beyond the range of trends due to natural variability of the climate system defined in both the undisturbed Preindustrial climate and the climate over 850-1850 perturbed with natural external forcing. This trend is systematic in the southeast Amazon but driven by episodic droughts (2005, 2010, 2015) in the northwest, with the highest recoded VPD since 1979 for the 2015 drought. The univariant detection analysis shows that the observed increase in VPD cannot be explained by greenhouse-gas-induced (GHG) radiative warming alone. The bivariate attribution analysis demonstrates that forcing by elevated GHG levels and biomass burning aerosols are attributed as key causes for the observed VPD increase. We further show that There is a negative trend in evaporative fraction in the southeast Amazon, where lack of atmospheric moisture, reduced precipitation together with higher incoming solar radiation (similar to 7% decade(-1) cloud-cover reduction) influences the partitioning of surface energy fluxes towards less evapotranspiration. The VPD increase combined with the decrease in evaporative fraction are the first indications of positive climate feedback mechanisms, which we show that will continue and intensify in the course of unfolding anthropogenic climate change.

Potential of next-generation imaging spectrometers to detect and quantify methane point sources from space	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; RESOLUTION APPLICATION; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; 4 CORNERS; EMISSIONS; RETRIEVALS; CH4; SPECTROSCOPY; TROPOMI; PERFORMANCE	We examine the potential for global detection of methane plumes from individual point sources with the new generation of spaceborne imaging spectrometers (EnMAP, PRISMA, EMIT, SBG, CHIME) scheduled for launch in 2019-2025. These instruments are designed to map the Earth's surface at high spatial resolution (30m x 30m) and have a spectral resolution of 7-10 nm in the 2200-2400 nm band that should also allow useful detection of atmospheric methane. We simulate scenes viewed by EnMAP (10 nm spectral resolution, 180 signal-to-noise ratio) using the EnMAP end-to-end simulation tool with superimposed methane plumes generated by large-eddy simulations. We retrieve atmospheric methane and surface reflectivity for these scenes using the IMAP-DOAS optimal estimation algorithm. We find an EnMAP precision of 3 %-7% for atmospheric methane depending on surface type. This allows effective single-pass detection of methane point sources as small as 100 kg h(-1) depending on surface brightness, surface homogeneity, and wind speed. Successful retrievals over very heterogeneous surfaces such as an urban mosaic require finer spectral resolution. We tested the EnMAP capability with actual plume observations over oil/gas fields in California from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor (3m x 3m pixel resolution, 5 nm spectral resolution, SNR 200-400), by spectrally and spatially downsampling the AVIRIS-NG data to match EnMAP instrument specifications. Results confirm that EnMAP can successfully detect point sources of similar to 100 kg h(-1) over bright surfaces. Source rates inferred with a generic integrated mass enhancement (IME) algorithm were lower for EnMAP than for AVIRIS-NG. Better agreement may be achieved with a more customized IME algorithm. Our results suggest that imaging spectrometers in space could play an important role in the future for quantifying methane emissions from point sources worldwide.

Layla; Bramer, Lisa			Event detection for undersampled electron microscopy experiments: A control chart case study	QUALITY ENGINEERING			English	Article						Event detection; multivariate statistics; STEM	LITHIUM	Making efficient and timely inferences about data generated by real-time systems is challenging, as they often consist of high-volume, high-velocity data streams. In particular, when a user interacts with a real-time system to gain insights, detect events, and make decisions about the system, the rate and amount of information the user is required to process is generally overwhelming. In addition, analytically processing large volumes of data can be computationally expensive and, in real-time, renders traditional inferential methods effectively useless. One approach to mitigate these challenges is to reduce both the amount of information presented to the user and the volume of data placed in the stream. Similar to other multivariate quality control techniques, we will describe a method constructed specifically for high throughput images in addition to the development and deployment of an online tool, Real time Event Detector for Subsampled Images (REDSI), designed to provide feedback on a real-time system by characterizing and detecting events of interest. We will discuss REDSI in the context of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), which is a powerful real-time system that provides high spatial and temporal resolution on nanoscale structures and processes. The data produced by in situ STEM experiments are a stream of images relaying structural, compositional, and dynamic interphase information to scientists in fields ranging from microbiology and neuroscience to materials science and energetics.

Electrolyzer Durability at Low Catalyst Loading and with Dynamic Operation	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							OXYGEN EVOLUTION ACTIVITY; WATER ELECTROLYSIS; CURRENT-DENSITY; IRIDIUM; PERFORMANCE; HYDROGEN; STABILITY; DEGRADATION; NANOPARTICLES; DISSOLUTION	Membrane electrode assembly durability is explored for polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers, focusing on catalyst (iridium, Ir) degradation at low loading and dynamic operation. Low catalyst loading and high cell potential are critical to observing durability losses over reasonably short experiments, regardless of test profile. While small losses are seen during steady operation, cycling greatly accelerates performance decreases. Ir dissolution mechanistically drives performance loss, thinning the anode catalyst layer and resulting in increasing kinetic losses during extended operation. While morphological changes to the catalyst layer are found, increasing polarization resistance suggests that degradation at the catalyst/ionomer/membrane interface may also contribute. Electrolyzer operation with model wind and solar profiles results in less severe performance losses compared to triangle- and square-wave potential cycling due to the lower cycling frequency of the renewable profiles. However, in both cases kinetics dominated the loss, indicating that higher cycling rates accelerate loss and can be used to project the impact of intermittency on device lifetime. These results suggest that performance losses impact electrolyzers' abilities to operate with low catalyst loading and intermittent inputs, and that a combination of component development and system controls are needed to limit potential and performance loss.

J	Michel, S; Gualandi, A; Avouac, JP				Michel, Sylvain; Gualandi, Adriano; Avouac, Jean-Philippe			Similar scaling laws for earthquakes and Cascadia slow-slip events	NATURE			English	Article							SUBDUCTION ZONE; EPISODIC TREMOR; GUERRERO	Faults can slip not only episodically during earthquakes but also during transient aseismic slip events(1-5), often called slow-slip events. Previous studies based on observations compiled from various tectonic settings(6-8) have suggested that the moment of slow-slip events is proportional to their duration, instead of following the duration-cubed scaling found for earthquakes(9). This finding has spurred efforts to unravel the cause of the difference in scaling(6,10-14). Thanks to a new catalogue of slow-slip events on the Cascadia megathrust based on the inversion of surface deformation measurements between 2007 and 2017(15), we find that a cubic moment-duration scaling law is more likely. Like regular earthquakes, slow-slip events also have a moment that is proportional to A(3/2), where A is the rupture area, and obey the Gutenberg-Richter relationship between frequency and magnitude. Finally, these slow-slip events show pulse-like ruptures similar to seismic ruptures. The scaling properties of slow-slip events are thus strikingly similar to those of regular earthquakes, suggesting that they are governed by similar dynamic properties.

An Open-Source Tool to Facilitate the Processing of GRACE Observations and GLDAS Outputs: An Evaluation in Bangladesh	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						water resources; groundwater; sustainable management; food security; open-source software	GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT; WATER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SATELLITE; DISCHARGE; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; VARIABILITY; TRENDS	Bangladesh lies at the intersection of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers with a combined average discharge of 38,000 m(3)s(-1) ranking fourth globally. Despite the volume of water flowing through and seasonally inundating parts of the landscape, groundwater reliance is necessary to support an intensive agricultural industry. Here we use newly-developed open-source software to combine observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites with hydrologic estimates of land water storage from the Global Land Assimilation Data System (GLDAS) to isolate basin-scale groundwater anomalies in Northwest Bangladesh from 2002 to 2016. We place our estimates in the context of previously-published water management estimates and our results suggest the largest losses in water storage are due to groundwater abstractions with groundwater storage decreasing at a rate of 0.88 cm yr(-1). We estimate basin-averaged total water storage loss from 2002 to 2016 at 27.92 cm with groundwater and surface water storage loss accounting for 12.46 cm or 44.6%. For Bangladesh, a region where 80% of landcover is dedicated for agricultural use and over half of the country's population is employed in the agricultural sector, the estimated declines in water storage hold long-term implications for the livelihood and food supply of the region.

J	Reid, W; Fitch, R; Goktogan, AH; Sukkarieh, S				Reid, William; Fitch, Robert; Goktogan, Ali H.; Sukkarieh, Salah			Sampling-based hierarchical motion planning for a reconfigurable wheel-on-leg planetary analogue exploration rover	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article						legged robots; planetary robotics; wheeled robots	ROADMAPS; ATHLETE; DESIGN; SYSTEM	Reconfigurable mobile planetary rovers are versatile platforms that may safely traverse cluttered environments by morphing their physical geometry. Planning paths for these adaptive robots is challenging due to their many degrees of freedom, and the need to consider potentially continuous platform reconfiguration along the length of the path. We propose a novel hierarchical structure for asymptotically optimal (AO) sampling-based planners and specifically apply it to the state-of-the-art Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) AO planner. Our algorithm assumes a decomposition of the full configuration space into multiple subspaces, and begins by rapidly finding a set of paths through one such subspace. This set of solutions is used to generate a biased sampling distribution, which is then explored to find a solution in the full configuration space. This technique provides a novel way to incorporate prior knowledge of subspaces to efficiently bias search within existing AO sampling-based planners. Importantly, probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality are preserved. Experimental results in simulation are provided that benchmark the algorithm against state-of-the-art sampling-based planners without the hierarchical variation. Additional experimental results performed with a physical wheel-on-leg platform demonstrate application to planetary rover mobility and showcase how constraints such as actuator failures and sensor pointing may be easily incorporated into the planning problem. In minimizing an energy objective that combines an approximation of the mechanical work required for platform locomotion with that required for reconfiguration, the planner produces intuitive behaviors where the robot dynamically adjusts its footprint, varies its height, and clambers over obstacles using legged locomotion. These results illustrate the generality of the planner in exploiting the platform's mechanical ability to fluidly transition between various physical geometric configurations, and wheeled/legged locomotion modes, without the need for predefined configurations.

ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; LAND; TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE; DROUGHT; MODEL; SINKS; CYCLE	Interannual variations in temperature and precipitation impact the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, leaving an imprint in atmospheric CO2. Quantifying the impact of climate anomalies on the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of terrestrial ecosystems can provide a constraint to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against and may provide an emergent constraint on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. We investigate the spatial scales over which interannual variability in NEE can be constrained using atmospheric CO2 observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). NEE anomalies are calculated by performing a series of inversion analyses using the GEOS-Chem adjoint model to assimilate GOSAT observations. Monthly NEE anomalies are compared to "proxies", variables that are associated with anomalies in the terrestrial carbon cycle, and to upscaled NEE estimates from FLUXCOM. Statistically significant correlations (P < 0.05) are obtained between posterior NEE anomalies and anomalies in soil temperature and FLUXCOM NEE on continental and larger scales in the tropics, as well as in the northern extratropics on subcontinental scales during the summer (R-2 >= 0.49), suggesting that GOSAT measurements provide a constraint on NEE interannual variability (IAV) on these spatial scales. Furthermore, we show that GOSAT flux inversions are generally better correlated with the environmental proxies and FLUXCOM NEE than NEE anomalies produced by a set of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), suggesting that GOSAT flux inversions could be used to evaluate TBM NEE fluxes.

Here we evaluate MOPITT Version 7 joint (V7J) thermal-infrared and near-infrared (TIR-NIR) retrieval accuracy and precision and suggest ways to further improve the accuracy of the observations. We take five steps involving filtering or bias corrections to reduce scatter and bias in the data relative to other MOPITT soundings and ground-based measurements. (1) We apply a preliminary filtering scheme in which measurements over snow and ice are removed. (2) We find a systematic pairwise bias among the four MOPITT alongtrack detectors (pixels) on the order of 3-4 ppb with a small temporal trend, which we remove on a global scale using a temporally trended bias correction. (3) Using a small-region approximation (SRA), a new filtering scheme is developed and applied based on additional quality indicators such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). After applying these new filters, the root-mean-squared error computed using the local median from the SRA over 16 years of global observations decreases from 3.84 to 2.55 ppb. (4) We also use the SRA to find variability in MOPITT retrieval anomalies that relates to retrieval parameters. We apply a bias correction to one parameter from this analysis. (5) After applying the previous bias corrections and filtering, we compare the MOPITT results with the GGG2014 ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) observations to obtain an overall global bias correction. These comparisons show that MOPITT V7J is biased high by about 6 %-8 %, which is similar to past studies using independent validation datasets on V6J. When using TCCON spectrometric column retrievals without the standard airmass correction or scaling to aircraft (WMO scale), the ground- and satellite-based observations overall agree to better than 0.5 %. GEOS-Chem data assimilations are used to estimate the influence of filtering and scaling to TCCON on global CO and tend to pull concentrations away from the prior fluxes and closer to the truth. We conclude with suggestions for further improving the MOPITT data products.	[Hedelius, Jacob K.; He, Tai-Long; Jones, Dylan B.

Long-term thermal stability of fluorescent dye used for chiral amino acid analysis on future spaceflight missions	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article; Early Access						Amino acids; Biosignatures; Extraterrestrial; In situ analysis; Life detection	CAPILLARY-ELECTROPHORESIS; SEPARATION	Future spaceflight missions focused on life detection will carry with them new, state-of-the-art instrumentation capable of highly selective and sensitive organic analysis. CE-LIF is an ideal candidate for such a mission due to its high separation efficiency and low LODs. One perceived risk of utilizing this technique on a future mission is the stability of the chemical reagents in the spaceflight environment. Here, we present an investigation of the thermal stability of the fluorescent dye (5-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) used for amino acid analysis. The dye was stored at 4, 25, and 60 degrees C for 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. When stored at 4 degrees C for 2 years, 25 degrees C for 6 months, or 60 degrees C for 1 month there was no effect on CE-LIF assay performance due to dye degradation. Beyond these time points, while the dye degradation begins to interfere with the analysis, it is still possible to perform the analysis and achieve the majority of amino acid biosignature science goals described in the science definition team report for the potential Europa Lander mission. This work indicates that thermal control of the dye at <= 4 degrees C will be needed during transit on future spaceflight missions to maintain dye stability.

However, gauges may contain large errors. A major source of gauge-measurement error is snowfall undercatch in high latitudes. We show that the two popular correction factors (CFs) used in the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre monitoring and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project products are different by more than 50%. The CFs can be as large as 3; thus, the choice of CF introduces large uncertainties. Here, in light of observation of storage change from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and by using the mass conservation principle, we assess the two popular CFs over six Arctic basins. By investigating monthly time series and multiyear precipitation rates over the studied basins using GRACE-based analysis, the CF based on Fuchs dynamic correction model used in Global Precipitation Climatology Centre monitoring is preferred.

Global Climate Model Ensemble Approaches for Future Projections of Atmospheric Rivers	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						climate change; atmospheric rivers; extreme weather; model averaging; skill and independence; bayesian model averaging	WEST-COAST; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; NORTH-AMERICA; CMIP5; IMPACTS; WEATHER; SIMULATIONS; CONSTRAINTS; MULTIMODEL	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow jets of integrated water vapor transport that are important for the global water cycle and also have large impacts on local weather and regional hydrology. Uniformly weighted multi-model averages have been used to describe how ARs will change in the future, but this type of estimate does not consider skill or independence of the climate models of interest. Here, we utilize information from various model averaging approaches, such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA), to evaluate 21 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Model ensemble weighting strategies are based on model independence and AR performance skill relative to ERA-Interim reanalysis data and result in higher accuracy for the historic period, for example, root mean square error for AR frequency (in % of time steps) of 0.69 for BMA versus 0.94 for the multi-model ensemble mean. Model weighting strategies also result in lower uncertainties in the future estimates, for example, only 20-25% of the total uncertainties seen in the equal weighting strategy. These model averaging methods show, with high certainty, that globally the frequency of ARs is expected to have average relative increases of similar to 50% (and similar to 25% in AR intensity) by the end of the century.

Bathymetry of Southeast Greenland From Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Greenland; gravity; remote sensing; bathymetry; climate change; oceanography	RESOLUTION AIRBORNE GRAVITY; EAST GREENLAND; WEST GREENLAND; ICE-SHEET; GLACIER; RETREAT; ACCELERATION; WATERS	Southeast Greenland has been a major participant in the ice sheet mass loss over the last several decades. Interpreting the evolution of glacier fronts requires information about their depth below sea level and ocean thermal forcing, which are incompletely known in the region. Here, we combine airborne gravity and multibeam echo sounding data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission with ocean probe and fishing boat depth data to reconstruct the bathymetry extending from the glacier margins to the edges of the continental shelf. We perform a three-dimensional inversion of the gravity data over water and merge the solution with a mass conservation reconstruction of bed topography over land. In contrast with other parts of Greenland, we find few deep troughs connecting the glaciers to the sources of warm Atlantic Water, amidst a relatively uniform, shallow (350 m) continental shelf. The deep channels include the Kangerlugssuaq, Sermilik, Gyldenlove, and Tingmiarmiut Troughs.

Ram-pressure Stripping of a Kicked Hill Sphere: Prompt Electromagnetic Emission from the Merger of Stellar Mass Black Holes in an AGN Accretion Disk	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article							RADIATION PRESSURE; GALACTIC-CENTER; BINARIES	Accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are promising sites for stellar mass black hole (BH) mergers due to mass segregation and merger acceleration by disk gas torques. Here we show that a gravitational-wave (GW) kick at BH merger causes ram-pressure stripping of gas within the BH Hill sphere. If R-H >= H, the disk height, an off-center UV flare at a(BH) similar to 10(3)r(g), emerges within t(UV) >= O(2 days)(a(BH)/10(3)r(g))(M-SMBH/10(8)M(circle dot))(v(kick)/10(2) km s(-1)) postmerger and lasts O(R-H/v(kick)) similar to O(5t(UV)). The flare emerges with luminosity O(10(42)erg s(-1))(t(UV)/2 days)(-1)(M-Hill/1M(circle dot))(v(kick)/10(2) km s(-1))(2). Active galactic nucleus optical/UV photometry is altered and asymmetric broad emission line profiles can develop after weeks. If R-H < H, detectability depends on disk optical depth. Follow-up by large optical sky surveys is optimized for small GW error volumes and for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory/Virgo triggers >50M(circle dot).	[McKernan, B.; Ford, K. E.

Keck Array Collaboration; BICEP2 Collaboration	BICEP2/Keck Array XI: Beam Characterization and Temperature-to-Polarization Leakage in the BK15 Data Set	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; gravitational waves; inflation polarization		Precision measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization require extreme control of instrumental systematics. In a companion paper we have presented cosmological constraints from observations with the BICEP2 and Keck Array experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season (BK15), resulting in the deepest CMB polarization maps to date and a statistical sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of s(r).=.0.020. In this work we characterize the beams and constrain potential systematic contamination from main beam shape mismatch at the three BK15 frequencies (95, 150, and 220 GHz). Far-field maps of 7360 distinct beam patterns taken from 2010-2015 are used to measure differential beam parameters and predict the contribution of temperature-to-polarization leakage to the BK15 B-mode maps. In the multifrequency, multicomponent likelihood analysis that uses BK15, Planck, and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe maps to separate sky components, we find that adding this predicted leakage to simulations induces a bias of Delta r = 0.0027 +/- 0.0019. Future results using higher-quality beam maps and improved techniques to detect such leakage in CMB data will substantially reduce this uncertainty, enabling the levels of systematics control needed for BICEP Array and other experiments that plan to definitively probe large-field inflation.

Discovery and Identification of MAXI J1621-501 as a Type I X-Ray Burster with a Super-orbital Period	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							JEM-X; ACCRETION; BINARIES; SCIENCE; ONBOARD; IMAGER; MASS	MAXI J1621-501 is the first Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey transient that was followed up with a multitude of space missions (NuSTAR, Swift, Chandra, NICER, INTEGRAL, and MAXI) and ground-based observatories (Gemini, IRSF, and ATCA). The source was discovered with MAXI on 2017 October 19 as a new, unidentified transient. Further observations with NuSTAR revealed two Type I X-ray bursts, identifying MAXI J1621-501 as a low mass x-ray binary with a neutron star primary. Overall, 24 Type I bursts were detected from the source during a 15 month period. At energies below 10 keV, the source spectrum was best fit with three components: an absorbed blackbody with kT = 2.3 keV, a cutoff power law with index Gamma = 0.7, and an emission line centered on 6.3 keV. Timing analysis of the X-ray persistent emission and burst data has not revealed coherent pulsations from the source or an orbital period. We identified, however, a super-orbital period similar to 78 days in the source X-ray light curve. This period agrees very well with the theoretically predicted radiative precession period of similar to 82 days. Thus, MAXI J1621-501 joins a small group of sources characterized with super-orbital periods.

Surface Height and Sea Ice Freeboard of the Arctic Ocean From ICESat-2: Characteristics and Early Results	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						altimetry; Arctic; Antarctic; sea ice thickness; freeboard; surface height		We present the first winter season of surface height and sea ice freeboards of the Arctic Ocean from the new Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2; IS-2) mission. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System onboard has six photon-counting beams for surface profiling with a 10-kHz pulse rate (interpulse distance similar to 0.7 m) and footprints of similar to 17 m. Geolocated heights assigned to individual photons scattered from the surface allow significant flexibility in the construction of height distributions used in surface finding. For IS-2 sea ice products, a fixed 150-photon aggregate is used to control height precision and obtain better along-track resolution over high reflectance surfaces. Quasi-specular returns in openings as narrow as similar to 27 m, crucial for freeboard calculations, are resolved. The fixed photon aggregate results in unique variable along-track resolutions and nonuniform sampling (17 m x 27 m to 17 m x 200 m for the strong beams) of the surface. The six profiling beams-three pairs separated by 3.3 km with a strong and weak beam in each pair-provide correlated statistics at regional length scales for assessment of beam-to-beam retrieval consistency and accuracy. Analysis shows along-track height precisions of similar to 2 cm and agreement in the monthly freeboard distributions across the strong beams to 1-2 cm. In this paper, we describe briefly the approaches used in surface height and freeboard retrievals from Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System photon clouds and detail the key features of these along-track sea ice products, focusing on the first release of data collected over the Arctic Ocean, which spans the period between 14 October 2018-the start of data collection-and the end of March 2019.

This sequence included a foreshock with a moment magnitude (M-w) of 6.4 followed by a M-w 7.1 mainshock nearly 34 hours later. Geodetic, seismic, and seismicity data provided an integrative view of this sequence, which ruptured an unmapped multiscale network of interlaced orthogonal faults. This complex fault geometry persists over the entire seismogenic depth range. The rupture of the mainshock terminated only a few kilometers from the major regional Garlock fault, triggering shallow creep and a substantial earthquake swarm. The repeated occurrence of multifault ruptures, as revealed by modern instrumentation and analysis techniques, poses a formidable challenge in quantifying regional seismic hazards.

Mars Science Laboratory Observations of Chloride Salts in Gale Crater, Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover; chlorine; halite; salts; groundwater	INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; YELLOWKNIFE BAY; MOLECULAR-EMISSION; ROCKS; CHEMISTRY; QUANTIFICATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; ASSEMBLAGES; SOILS	The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover is traversing a sequence of stratified sedimentary rocks in Gale crater that contain varied eolian, fluviodeltaic, and lake deposits, with phyllosilicates, iron oxides, and sulfate salts. Here, we report the chloride salt distribution along the rover traverse. Chlorine is detected at low levels (<3 wt.%) in soil and rock targets with multiple MSL instruments. Isolated fine-scale observations of high chlorine (up to >= 15 wt.% Cl), detected using the ChemCam instrument, are associated with elevated Na2O and interpreted as halite grains or cements in bedrock. Halite is also interpreted at the margins of veins and in nodular, altered textures. We have not detected halite in obvious evaporitic layers. Instead, its scattered distribution indicates that chlorides emplaced earlier in particular members of the Murray formation were remobilized and reprecipitated by later groundwaters within Murray formation mudstones and in diagenetic veins and nodules. Plain Language Summary Chlorine is measured in soils and rocks in Gale crater by multiple instruments on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. Fine-scale points of enriched chlorine are detected by the ChemCam instrument in bedrock, nodules, and at the margins of veins in the Murray formation. Chlorine content is correlated with weight percent Na2O indicating halite composition, corroborated by CheMin and SAM data. The scattered distribution of chlorides in the Murray formation indicates they were dissolved by later groundwaters then recrystallized. The chlorides may have been emplaced as small-scale primary deposits in particular members of the Murray formation, consistent with varying salinity in the waters that deposited the Murray.

A New Method for Isolating Elastic From Inelastic Deformation in Aquifer Systems: Application to the San Joaquin Valley, CA	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						elastic deformation; aquifer; Central Valley; InSAR; independent component analysis	SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LAND SUBSIDENCE; SURFACE DEFORMATION; LAS-VEGAS; INSAR; CALIFORNIA; GROUNDWATER; ALGORITHM; UAVSAR	Separating recoverable (elastic) from permanent (inelastic) deformation of aquifer systems is critical to develop sustainable pumping practices but remains a challenge because the preconsolidation stress is unknown. Previous works often assume that inelastic deformation occurs over years while elastic deformation is seasonal. This assumption may not hold for systems where groundwater extraction controls drawdowns and recharge because elastic deformation may not be exclusively seasonal (e.g., drought and recovery periods). Here we present an independent component analysis-based method for extracting elastic aquifer properties without relying on sedimentary data or on curve fitting of seasonal signal. We applied this method to 2015-2019 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements of deformation in the San Joaquin Valley and show that elastic deformation is always present and captured by IC2 with both seasonal patterns and post drought recovery longer-term deformation. Independent component analysis is the first method which enables isolating elastic deformation and properties even through periods that do not exhibit a clear seasonal signal.

Robust observations of land-to-atmosphere feedbacks using the information flows of FLUXNET	NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE			English	Article							ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE; AFTERNOON PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; UNITED-STATES; SURFACE; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; SUPPRESSION	Feedbacks between atmospheric processes like precipitation and land surface fluxes including evapotranspiration are difficult to observe, but critical for understanding the role of the land surface in the Earth System. To quantify global surface-atmosphere feedbacks we use results of a process network (PN) applied to 251 eddy covariance sites from the LaThuile database to train a neural network across the global terrestrial surface. There is a strong land-atmosphere coupling between latent (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) and precipitation (P) during summer months in temperate regions, and between H and P during winter, whereas tropical rainforests show little coupling seasonality. Savanna, shrubland, and other semi-arid ecosystems exhibit strong responses in their coupling behavior based on water availability. Feedback couplings from surface fluxes to P peaks at aridity (P/potential evapotranspiration ETp) values near unity, whereas coupling with respect to clouds, inferred from reduced global radiation, increases as P/ETp approaches zero. Spatial patterns in feedback coupling strength are related to climatic zone and biome type. Information flow statistics highlight hotspots of (1) persistent land-atmosphere coupling in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) boreal summer coupling in the central and southwestern US, Brazil, and the Congo basin and (3) in the southern Andes, South Africa and Australia during austral summer. Our data-driven approach to quantifying land atmosphere coupling strength that leverages the global FLUXNET database and information flow statistics provides a basis for verification of feedback interactions in general circulation models and for predicting locations where land cover change will feedback to climate or weather.

We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), with time-lapse digital elevation models (DEMs) and numerical models to study the dynamics of coupled magma reservoir deflation and lava effusion. InSAR recorded 2.2-2.5 m of subsidence after the first three days of the eruption, which can be modeled using a spheroidal magma reservoir at a depth of 5 km, 20 km long, and with a pressure drop of 20-30 MPa. The source is elongated in the NW-SE direction and its large dimensions imply a large plumbing system active throughout the eruption and spanning neighboring volcanoes, with a slight change in the geometry halfway through the effusive phase. TanDEM-X and Pleiades DEMs record the extrusion of both the rhyolitic lava flow and the intrusion of a shallow laccolith around the eruptive vent after the third day of the eruption, with a total volume of similar to 1.45 km(3) DRE. The laccolith was emplaced during the first month of the eruption, during both the explosive and effusive stages of the eruption. Both the reservoir pressure drop and the extruded volume time series follow quasi-exponential trends, and can be explained by a model that couples the reservoir pressure decrease, time- and pressure-dependent variations in the magma properties inside of the reservoir, and conduit flow. This model predicts both the temporal evolution and amplitude of both time series during the effusive phase, and a magma compressibility of similar to 10(-10) Pa-1, half the reported compressibility of the magma of the sub-Plinian explosive phase. Further, we estimate that the reservoir contained 1-3 wt.% dissolved H2O at the onset of lava effusion, with no exsolved CO2 and H2O in the reservoir throughout the effusive phase. This implies that the magma was significantly degassed after the explosive phase. The remaining volatiles in the magma after the explosive stage might have caused magma fragmentation, consistent with the hybrid explosive-effusive style observed during the waning of the eruption.

J	Kite, ES; Daswani, MM				Kite, Edwin S.; Daswani, Mohit Meiwani			Geochemistry constrains global hydrology on Early Mars	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; geochemistry; hydrology; planetary science	MERIDIANI-PLANUM; BURNS FORMATION; GALE CRATER; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; GUSEV-CRATER; EVOLUTION; DEPOSITS; CLIMATE	Ancient hydrology is recorded by sedimentary rocks on Mars. The most voluminous sedimentary rocks that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are sulfate-rich rocks, explored by the Opportunity rover from 2004-2012 and soon to be investigated by the Curiosity rover at Gale crater. A leading hypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived from evaporation of deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation of groundwater. Global groundwater circulation would imply sustained warm Earthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation of groundwater including infiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO2 atmosphere implies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO2 sequestration implied by the global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of sulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the Opportunity data are representative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that (even accounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This disfavors the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from upwelling of deep-sourced groundwater. If, instead, Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the CO2 sequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from upwelling of deep-sourced groundwater. In both cases, carbon sequestration by global groundwater circulation actively works to terminate surface habitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions. Curiosity will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate cation composition, carbon isotopes, and climate change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The exercise utilized the CSA Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) rover, deployed to Utah, USA, at a Mars-analogue field site. The principal features of the field site located near Green River, Utah are Late Jurassic inverted, fluvial paleochannels, analogous to features on Mars in sites being considered for the ESA ExoMars rover mission and present within the chosen landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The in-simulation ("in-sim") mission operations team worked remotely from The University of Western Ontario, Canada. A suite of MESR-integrated and hand-held spectrometers was selected to mimic those of the Mars 2020 payload, and a Utah-based, on-site team was tasked with field operations to carry out the data collection and sampling as commanded by the in-sim team. As a validation of the in-sim mission science findings, the field team performed an independent geological assessment. This paper documents the field team's on-site geological assessment and subsequent laboratory and analytical results, then offers a comparison of mission (in-sim) and post-mission (laboratory) science results. The laboratory-based findings were largely consistent with the in-sim rover-derived data and geological interpretations, though some notable exceptions highlight the inherent difficulties in remote science. In some cases, available data was insufficient for lithologic identification given the absence of other important contextual information (e.g., textural information). This study suggests that the in-sim instruments were largely adequate for the Science Team to characterize samples; however, rover-based field work is necessarily hampered by mobility and time constraints with an obvious effect on efficiency but also precision, and to some extent, accuracy of the findings. The data show a dearth of preserved total organic carbon (TOC) - used as a proxy for ancient biosignature preservation potential - in the fluvial-lacustrine system of this field site, suggesting serious consideration with respect to the capabilities and opportunities for addressing the Mars exploration goals. We therefore suggest a thorough characterization of terrestrial sites analogous to those of Mars rover landing sites, and in-depth field studies like CanMars as important, pre-mission strategic exercises.

Version 4 of the SMAP Level-4 Soil Moisture Algorithm and Data Product	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						soil moisture; L-band passive microwave; data assimilation; Catchment land surface model; Soil Moisture Active Passive; runoff	CLIMATE REFERENCE NETWORK; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER MODEL; CATCHMENT-BASED APPROACH; LAND-SURFACE PROCESSES; L-BAND; TEMPORAL STABILITY; DATA ASSIMILATION; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VALIDATION	The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission Level-4 Soil Moisture (L.4_SM) product provides global, 3-hourly, 9-km resolution estimates of surface (0-5 cm) and root zone (0-100 cm) soil moisture with a mean latency of 2.5 days. The underlying L4_SM algorithm assimilates SMAP radiometer brightness temperature (Tb) observations into the NASA Catchment land surface model using a spatially distributed ensemble Kalman filter. In Version 4 of the L4_SM modeling system the upward recharge of surface soil moisture from below under nonequilibrium conditions was reduced, resulting in less bias and improved dynamic range of L4_SM surface soil moisture compared to earlier versions. This change and additional technical modifications to the system reduce the mean and standard deviation of the observation-minus-forecast Tb residuals and overall soil moisture analysis increments while maintaining the skill of the L4_SM soil moisture estimates versus independent in situ measurements; the average, bias-adjusted root-mean-square error in Version 4 is 0.039 m(3)/m(3) for surface and 0.026 m(3)/m(3) for root zone soil moisture. Moreover, the coverage of assimilated SMAP observations in Version 4 is near global owing to the use of additional satellite Tb records for algorithm calibration. L4_SM soil moisture uncertainty estimates are biased low (by 0.01-0.02 m(3)/m(3)) against actual errors (computed versus in situ measurements). L4_SM runoff estimates, an additional product of the L4_SM algorithm, are biased low (by 35 mm/year) against streamflow measurements. Compared to Version 3, bias in Version 4 is reduced by 46% for surface soil moisture uncertainty estimates and by 33% for runoff estimates. Plain Language Summary Soil moisture is important because of its impact on the land surface water, energy, and nutrient cycles. The low-frequency microwave observations collected by the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite are suitable for estimating soil moisture globally. Their sensitivity, however, is limited to the top few centimeters of the soil, and observations are only available every other day depending on location. The SMAP Level-4 Soil Moisture (L4_SM) data product addresses these limitations by merging the satellite observations into a numerical model of the land surface water and energy balance while considering the uncertainty of the observations and model estimates. The resulting L4_SM data product is publicly disseminated within 2.5 days from the time of observation and provides global estimates of surface and deeper-layer (or "root zone") soil moisture at 3-hourly temporal and 9-km spatial resolution. This study presents an overview of recent updates in the L4_SM algorithm and an assessment of the quality of the resulting Version-4 soil moisture estimates. The algorithm updates reduce bias in L4_SM surface soil moisture and runoff estimates compared to previous versions while otherwise maintaining the product skill, which meets the accuracy requirement specified prior to SMAP's launch.

The biophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry of functionally diverse, vertically and horizontally heterogeneous ecosystems: the Ecosystem Demography model, version 2.2-Part 1: Model description	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE MODEL; ENVIRONMENT SIMULATOR JULES; DYNAMIC VEGETATION MODEL; LAND-SURFACE PROCESSES; TAPAJOS RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; CARBON FLUXES; ATMOSPHERE INTERACTIONS; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; PLANT GEOGRAPHY	Earth system models (ESMs) have been developed to represent the role of terrestrial ecosystems on the energy, water, and carbon cycles. However, many ESMs still lack representation of within-ecosystem heterogeneity and diversity. In this paper, we present the Ecosystem Demography model version 2.2 (ED-2.2). In ED-2.2, the biophysical and physiological processes account for the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity of the ecosystem: the energy, water, and carbon cycles are solved separately for a series of vegetation cohorts (groups of individual plants of similar size and plant functional type) distributed across a series of spatially implicit patches (representing collections of micro-environments that have a similar disturbance history). We define the equations that describe the energy, water, and carbon cycles in terms of total energy, water, and carbon, which simplifies the differential equations and guarantees excellent conservation of these quantities in long-term simulation (< 0.1% error over 50 years). We also show examples of ED-2.2 simulation results at single sites and across tropical South America. These results demonstrate the model's ability to characterize the variability of ecosystem structure, composition, and functioning both at stand and continental scales. A detailed model evaluation was conducted and is presented in a companion paper (Longo et al., 2019a). Finally, we highlight some of the ongoing model developments designed to improve the model's accuracy and performance and to include processes hitherto not represented in the model.

The biophysics, ecology, and biogeochemistry of functionally diverse, vertically and horizontally heterogeneous ecosystems: the Ecosystem Demography model, version 2.2-Part 2: Model evaluation for tropical South America	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE MODEL; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; AMAZON FOREST STRUCTURE; LAND-SURFACE MODELS; RAIN-FOREST; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; CARBON FLUXES; WOOD DENSITY; EDDY COVARIANCE; DYNAMICS	The Ecosystem Demography model version 2.2 (ED-2.2) is a terrestrial biosphere model that simulates the biophysical, ecological, and biogeochemical dynamics of vertically and horizontally heterogeneous terrestrial ecosystems. In a companion paper (Longo et al., 2019a), we described how the model solves the energy, water, and carbon cycles, and verified the high degree of conservation of these properties in long-term simulations that include long-term (multi-decadal) vegetation dynamics. Here, we present a detailed assessment of the model's ability to represent multiple processes associated with the biophysical and biogeochemical cycles in Amazon forests. We use multiple measurements from eddy covariance towers, forest inventory plots, and regional remote-sensing products to assess the model's ability to represent biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes at multiple timescales, ranging from subdaily to century long. The ED-2.2 model accurately describes the vertical distribution of light, water fluxes, and the storage of water, energy, and carbon in the canopy air space, the regional distribution of biomass in tropical South America, and the variability of biomass as a function of environmental drivers. In addition, ED-2.2 qualitatively captures several emergent properties of the ecosystem found in observations, specifically observed relationships between aboveground biomass, mortality rates, and wood density; however, the slopes of these relationships were not accurately captured. We also identified several limitations, including the model's tendency to overestimate the magnitude and seasonality of heterotrophic respiration and to overestimate growth rates in a nutrient-poor tropical site. The evaluation presented here highlights the potential of incorporating structural and functional heterogeneity within biomes in Earth system models (ESMs) and to realistically represent their impacts on energy, water, and carbon cycles. We also identify several priorities for further model development.

J	Chua, AJK				Chua, Alvin J. K.			Sampling from manifold-restricted distributions using tangent bundle projections	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Density estimation; Manifold; Derivative-based; Importance sampling	PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; DATA-COMPRESSION; LANGEVIN	A common problem in Bayesian inference is the sampling of target probability distributions at sufficient resolution and accuracy to estimate the probability density and to compute credible regions. Often by construction, many target distributions can be expressed as some higher-dimensional closed-form distribution with parametrically constrained variables, i.e., one that is restricted to a smooth submanifold of Euclidean space. I propose a derivative-based importance sampling framework for such distributions. A base set of n samples from the target distribution is used to map out the tangent bundle of the manifold, and to seed nm additional points that are projected onto the tangent bundle and weighted appropriately. The method essentially acts as an upsampling complement to any standard algorithm. It is designed for the efficient production of approximate high-resolution histograms from manifold-restricted Gaussian distributions and can provide large computational savings when sampling directly from the target distribution is expensive.

Nevertheless, recent work has suggested that ozone in the lower stratosphere (< 24 km) continued to decline over the 1998-2016 period, offsetting recovery at higher altitudes and preventing a statistically significant increase in quasi-global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) total column ozone. In 2017, a large lower stratospheric ozone resurgence over less than 12 months was estimated (using a chemistry transport model; CTM) to have offset the long-term decline in the quasi-global integrated lower stratospheric ozone column. Here, we extend the analysis of space-based ozone observations to December 2018 using the BASIC(SG) ozone composite. We find that the observed 2017 resurgence was only around half that modelled by the CTM, was of comparable magnitude to other strong interannual changes in the past, and was restricted to Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitudes (60-30 degrees S). In the SH midlatitude lower stratosphere, the data suggest that by the end of 2018 ozone is still likely lower than in 1998 (probability similar to 80 %). In contrast, tropical and Northern Hemisphere (NH) ozone continue to display ongoing decreases, exceeding 90 % probability. Robust tropical (> 95 %, 30 degrees S-30 degrees N) decreases dominate the quasi-global integrated decrease (99 % probability); the integrated tropical stratospheric column (1-100 hPa, 30 degrees S-30 degrees N) displays a significant overall ozone decrease, with 95 % probability. These decreases do not reveal an inefficacy of the Montreal Protocol; rather, they suggest that other effects are at work, mainly dynamical variability on long or short timescales, counteracting the positive effects of the Montreal Protocol on stratospheric ozone recovery. We demonstrate that large interannual midlatitude (30-60 degrees) variations, such as the 2017 resurgence, are driven by non-linear quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) phase-dependent seasonal variability. However, this variability is not represented in current regression analyses. To understand if observed lower stratospheric ozone decreases are a transient or long-term phenomenon, progress needs to be made in accounting for this dynamically driven variability.

Carbon and Water Use Efficiencies: A Comparative Analysis of Ten Terrestrial Ecosystem Models under Changing Climate	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROGRAM MULTISCALE SYNTHESIS; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; EDDY COVARIANCE; ELEVATED CO2; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; TIBETAN PLATEAU; FOREST; NITROGEN	Terrestrial ecosystems carbon and water cycles are tightly coupled through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes. The ratios of carbon stored to carbon uptake and water loss to carbon gain are key ecophysiological indicators essential to assess the magnitude and response of the terrestrial plant to the changing climate. Here, we use estimates from 10 terrestrial ecosystem models to quantify the impacts of climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and nitrogen (N) deposition on water use efficiency (WUE), and carbon use efficiency (CUE). We find that across models, WUE increases over the 20th Century particularly due to CO2 fertilization and N deposition and compares favorably to experimental studies. Also, the results show a decrease in WUE with climate for the last 3 decades, in contrasts with up-scaled flux observations that demonstrate a constant WUE. Modeled WUE responds minimally to climate with modeled CUE exhibiting no clear trend across space and time. The divergence between simulated and observationally-constrained WUE and CUE is driven by modeled NPP and autotrophic respiration, nitrogen cycle, carbon allocation, and soil moisture dynamics in current ecosystem models. We suggest that carbon-modeling community needs to reexamine stomatal conductance schemes and the soil-vegetation interactions for more robust modeling of carbon and water cycles.

The increasing number of newly detected exoplanets at short orbital periods raises questions about their formation and migration histories. Planet formation and migration depend heavily on the structure and dynamics of protoplanetary disks. A particular puzzle that requires explanation arises from one of the key results of the Kepler mission, namely the increase in the planetary occurrence rate with orbital period up to 10 days for F, G, K and M stars. Aims. We investigate the conditions for planet formation and migration near the dust sublimation front in protostellar disks around young Sun-like stars. We are especially interested in determining the positions where the drift of pebbles would be stopped, and where the migration of Earth-like planets and super-Earths would be halted. Methods. For this analysis we use iterative 2D radiation hydrostatic disk models which include irradiation by the star, and dust sublimation and deposition depending on the local temperature and vapor pressure. Results. Our results show the temperature and density structure of a gas and dust disk around a young Sun-like star. We perform a parameter study by varying the magnetized turbulence onset temperature, the accretion stress, the dust mass fraction, and the mass accretion rate. Our models feature a gas-only inner disk, a silicate sublimation front and dust rim starting at around 0.08 au, an ionization transition zone with a corresponding density jump, and a pressure maximum which acts as a pebble trap at around 0.12 au. Migration torque maps show Earth- and super-Earth-mass planets halt in our model disks at orbital periods ranging from 10 to 22 days. Conclusions. Such periods are in good agreement with both the inferred location of the innermost planets in multiplanetary systems, and the break in planet occurrence rates from the Kepler sample at 10 days. In particular, models with small grains depleted produce a trap located at a 10-day orbital period, while models with a higher abundance of small grains present a trap at around a 17-day orbital period. The snow line lies at 1.6 au, near where the occurrence rate of the giant planets peaks. We conclude that the dust sublimation zone is crucial for forming close-in planets, especially when considering tightly packed super-Earth systems.

Power spectra of the Faraday rotation angle and conversion rate	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; large-scale structure of Universe; cosmology: theory	MICROWAVE BACKGROUND POLARIZATION; SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH FLUCTUATIONS; RADIO-EMISSION; MASS FUNCTION; CLUSTERS; FIELD; GALAXIES; DISCOVERY; ELECTRONS; MODELS	Magnetized plasmas within haloes of galaxies leave their footprint on the polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The two dominant effects of astrophysical haloes are Faraday rotation, which generates rotation of the plane of linear polarization, and Faraday conversion, which induces a leakage from linear polarization to circular polarization. We revisit these sources of secondary anisotropies by computing the angular power spectra of the Faraday rotation angle and the Faraday conversion rate by the large-scale structures. To this end, we use the halo model and we pay special attention to the impact of magnetic field projections. Assuming magnetic fields of haloes to be uncorrelated, we found a vanishing two-halo term, and angular power spectra peaking at multipoles l similar to 10(4). The Faraday rotation angle is dominated by the contribution of thermal electrons. For the Faraday conversion rate, we found that both thermal electrons and relativistic, non-thermal electrons contribute equally in the most optimistic case for the density and Lorentz factor of relativistic electrons, while in more pessimistic cases the thermal electrons give the dominant contribution. Assuming the magnetic field to be independent of the halo mass, the angular power spectra for both effects roughly scale with the amplitude of matter perturbations as similar to sigma(3)(8), and with a very mild dependence with the density of cold dark matter. Introducing a dependence of the magnetic field strength with the halo mass leads to an increase of the scaling at large angular scales (above a degree) with the amplitude of matter fluctuations up to similar to sigma(9.5)(8) for Faraday rotation and similar to sigma(15)(8) for Faraday conversion for a magnetic field strength scaling linearly with the halo mass. Introducing higher values of the magnetic field for galaxies, as compared to clusters, instead leads to a decrease of such a scaling at arcminute scales down to similar to sigma(0.9)(8) for Faraday rotation.

In addition, we present near-infrared (2-2.45 mu m) observations of FU Ori taken with the General Relativity Analysis via VLT InTerferometrY (GRAVITY; similar to 1 mas angular resolution) instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We find that the emission in both FU Ori and FU Ori S at (sub)millimeter and near-infrared bands is dominated by structures inward of similar to 10 au radii. We detected closure phases close to zero from FU Ori with VLTI/GRAVITY, which indicate the source is approximately centrally symmetric and therefore is likely viewed nearly face-on. Our simple model to fit the GRAVITY data shows that the inner 0.4 au radii of the FU Ori disk has a triangular spectral shape at 2-2.45 mu m, which is consistent with the H2O and CO absorption features in a (M) over dot similar to 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1), viscously heated accretion disk. At larger (similar to 0.4-10 au) radii, our analysis shows that viscous heating may also explain the observed (sub)millimeter and centimeter spectral energy distribution when we assume a constant, similar to 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1) mass inflow rate in this region. This explains how the inner 0.4 au disk is replenished with mass at a modest rate, such that it neither depletes nor accumulates significant masses over its short dynamic timescale. Finally, we tentatively detect evidence of vertical dust settling in the inner 10 au of the FU Ori disk, but confirmation requires more complete spectral sampling in the centimeter bands.

Recent studies suggest that planetesimal collisions and the resulting impact melts are promising for forming chondrules. Given that the dynamics of planetesimals is a key in impact-based chondrule formation scenarios, we here perform direct N-body simulations to examine how the presence of Jupiter affects the properties of chondrule-forming collisions. Our results show that the absence/presence of Jupiter considerably changes the properties of high-velocity collisions whose impact velocities are higher than 2.5 km s(-1). High-velocity collisions occur due to impacts between protoplanets and planetesimals for the case without Jupiter; for the case with Jupiter, the eccentricities of planetesimals are pumped up by the secular and resonant perturbations from Jupiter. We also categorize the resulting planetesimal collisions and find that most high-velocity collisions are classified as grazing ones for both cases. To examine the effect of Jupiter on chondrule formation directly, we adopt the impact-jetting scenario and compute the resulting abundance of chondrules. Our results show that for the case without Jupiter, chondrule formation proceeds in the inside-out manner, following the growth of protoplanets. If Jupiter is present, the location and timing of chondrule formation are determined by Jupiter's eccentricity, which is treated as a free parameter in our simulations. Thus, the existence of Jupiter is the key parameter for specifying when and where chondrule formation occurs for impact-based scenarios.

Imaging extended sources with the solar gravitational lens	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We investigate the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) with respect to an extended source located at a large but finite distance from the Sun. The static, spherically symmetric gravitational field of the Sun is modeled within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We consider the propagation of monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) waves near the Sun. We develop, based on a Mie theory, a vector theory of diffraction that accounts for the refractive properties of the solar gravitational field. The finite distance to a point source can be accounted for using a rotation of the coordinate system to align its polar axis with the axis directed from the point source to the center of the Sun, which we call the optical axis. We determine the EM field and study the key optical properties of the SGL in all four regions formed behind the Sun by an EM wave diffracted by the solar gravity field: the shadow, geometric optics, and weak and strong interference regions. Extended sources can then be represented as collections of point sources. We present the power density of the signal received by a telescope in the image plane. Our discussion concludes with considering the implications for imaging with the SGL.

Near the time of merger, the gravitational waves from merging black holes can be computed only using numerical relativity. In this paper, we present a major update of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration catalog of numerical simulations for merging black holes. The catalog contains 2018 distinct configurations (a factor of 11 increase compared to the 2013 SXS catalog), including 1426 spin-precessing configurations, with mass ratios between 1 and 10, and spin magnitudes up to 0.998. The median length of a waveform in the catalog is 39 cycles of the dominant l = m = 2 gravitational-wave mode, with the shortest waveform containing 7.0 cycles and the longest 351.3 cycles. We discuss improvements such as correcting for moving centers of mass and extended coverage of the parameter space. We also present a thorough analysis of numerical errors, finding typical truncation errors corresponding to a waveform mismatch of similar to 10(-4). The simulations provide remnant masses and spins with uncertainties of 0.03% and 0.1% (90th percentile), about an order of magnitude better than analytical models for remnant properties. The full catalog is publicly available at www.blackholes.org/waveforms.	[Boyle, Michael; Iozzo, Dante A.

Our experience shows that Tethys significantly lowers the barrier for cloud-based app development, simplifies the process of accessing scalable distributed cloud computing resources and leverages additional software for data and computationally intensive modeling. The Tethys software development kit allows users to create web apps for visualizing, analyzing, and modeling Earth Observation data. Tethys platform provides a collaborative environment for scientists to develop and deploy several Earth Observation web applications across multiple Tethys portals. We work in partnership with leading regional organizations world-wide to help developing countries use information provided by earth-observing satellites and geospatial technologies for managing climate risks and land use. This paper highlights the several Tethys portals and web applications that were developed as part of this effort. Implementation of the Tethys framework has significantly improved the Application Readiness Level metric for several NASA projects and the potential impact of Tethys to replicate and scale other applied science programs.

Fine-Scale Spatiotemporal Air Pollution Analysis Using Mobile Monitors on Google Street View Vehicles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Early Access						Google Street View Air Quality Data; Kriging; Mobile sensors; Spatiotemporal models; Vecchia approximation	COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS; EXPOSURE; SENSOR; SYSTEM; MODEL	People are increasingly concerned with understanding their personal environment, including possible exposure to harmful air pollutants. To make informed decisions on their day-to-day activities, they are interested in real-time information on a localized scale. Publicly available, fine-scale, high-quality air pollution measurements acquired using mobile monitors represent a paradigm shift in measurement technologies. A methodological framework utilizing these increasingly fine-scale measurements to provide real-time air pollution maps and short-term air quality forecasts on a fine-resolution spatial scale could prove to be instrumental in increasing public awareness and understanding. The Google Street View study provides a unique source of data with spatial and temporal complexities, with the potential to provide information about commuter exposure and hot spots within city streets with high traffic. We develop a computationally efficient spatiotemporal model for these data and use the model to make short-term forecasts and high-resolution maps of current air pollution levels. We also show via an experiment that mobile networks can provide more nuanced information than an equally sized fixed-location network. This modeling framework has important real-world implications in understanding citizens? personal environments, as data production and real-time availability continue to be driven by the ongoing development and improvement of mobile measurement technologies. for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

Validation of OCO-2 error analysis using simulated retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; MISSION; BIAS; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; QUANTIFICATION; DIOXIDE; GEOCARB; CH4	Characterization of errors and sensitivity in remotely sensed observations of greenhouse gases is necessary for their use in estimating regional-scale fluxes. We analyze 15 orbits of the simulated Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) retrieval, which utilizes an optimal estimation approach, to compare predicted versus actual errors in the retrieved CO2 state. We find that the nonlinearity in the retrieval system results in XCO2 errors of similar to 0.9 ppm. The predicted measurement error (resulting from radiance measurement error), about 0.2 ppm, is accurate, and an upper bound on the smoothing error (resulting from imperfect sensitivity) is not more than 0.3 ppm greater than predicted. However, the predicted XCO2 interferent error (resulting from jointly retrieved parameters) is a factor of 4 larger than predicted. This results from some interferent parameter errors that are larger than predicted, as well as some interferent parameter errors that are more strongly correlated with XCO2 error than predicted by linear error estimation. Variations in the magnitude of CO2 Jacobians at different retrieved states, which vary similarly for the upper and lower partial columns, could explain the higher interferent errors. A related finding is that the error correlation within the CO2 profiles is less negative than predicted and that reducing the magnitude of the negative correlation between the upper and lower partial columns from -0.9 to -0.5 results in agreement between the predicted and actual XCO2 error. We additionally study how the postprocessing bias correction affects errors. The bias-corrected results found in the operational OCO-2 Lite product consist of linear modification of XCO2 based on specific retrieved values, such as the CO2 grad del (delta del(CO2)), ("grad del" is a measure of the change in the profile shape versus the prior) and dP (the retrieved surface pressure minus the prior). We find similar linear relationships between XCO2 error and dP or delta del(CO2) but see a very complex pattern of errors throughout the entire state vector. Possibilities for mitigating biases are proposed, though additional study is needed.

Structural Complexity and High Thermoelectric Performance of the Zintl Phase: Yb21Mn4Sb18	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; EFFICIENCY; SEMICONDUCTOR; TRANSITION; DIVERSE; GLASS; EU; PN; SB	Thermoelectric materials are a unique class of compounds that can recycle energy through conversion of heat into electrical energy. A new 21-4-18 Zintl phase has been discovered in the Yb-Mn-Sb system with high performance in the mid-to-high temperature regime. The efficiency of the Yb21Mn4Sb18 results mainly from its large Seebeck coefficient (similar to 290 mu V K-1 at 650 K) and extremely low thermal conductivity (similar to 0.4 W m(-1) K-1). The complex crystal structure has been studied through single crystal X-ray diffraction, synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis using time-of-flight neutron diffraction revealing positional disorder on several sites. Electronic structure calculations of the band structure and the partial spin-density of states reveal that states near the Fermi level are contributed mostly by the Mn and Sb atoms that participate in the [Mn4Sb10](22-) motif of the structure. The band structure confirms the p-type semiconducting nature of this material. The optimization of the hole carrier concentration was tuned according to a single parabolic band model through Na doping on the Yb site (Yb21-xNaxMn4Sb18, x = 0, 0.2, 0.4) showing an improvement in zT over the whole temperature range. A maximum zT 0.8 at 800 K is obtained for the x = 0.4 sample and increases the ZT(avg) from 0.34 to 0.49 (over the entire temperature range) compared to the undoped sample.

Microorganisms, which are not part of the cleanroom certification metrics, should not be overlooked when assessing the cleanliness of the facility since they can enter through soil or air, shed from humans, adapt to the oligotrophic conditions, and subsequently could contaminate spacecraft. These biogenic particles need to be identified to extend our knowledge of biological contamination for future NASA mission use. This study collected particles from the cleanroom and estimated the distribution of fallout microbial cell and inert dust particles using microscopy and molecular techniques. Aluminum coupon-based polycarbonate filter assemblies were deployed in the spacecraft assembly cleanroom facility to collect fallout particles. Epifluorescence and electron microscopy showed that particles varied in size and structure, and displayed live/dead biological and inert particle signatures from sources that include spores and fungal hyphae. Additionally, correlative epifluorescence and field emission scanning electron microscopy, combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (for elemental compositions) methods, differentiated whether microbes adhering to particles were live/dead cells or inert particles. This visualization approach allowed for the classification of microorganisms as being standalone (free-living) or associated with a particle, as well as its characteristic size. Furthermore, time-course microscopy was used to determine the microbial cell growth and confirm the biological/molecular identification. Routine investigation of cleanroom biological and inert fallout particles will help to determine the biological load of spacecraft components and will also have direct relevance to the pharmaceutical and medical industries. One of the main objectives for NASA's current and future missions is to prevent forward and back contamination of exploring planets. The goal of this study is to determine the association of microorganisms with the inert, natural cleanroom fallout particles and to ascertain whether microorganisms prefer to adhere to a particle size. A novel microscopy technique was developed, and by utilizing various molecular techniques, particles and associated microbial phylogeny were characterized. An accurate assessment of the microbes associated with cleanroom particles is necessary to protect the health of the people who occupy the room for long duration for aeronautical, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.

HCFC consumption and production are currently regulated under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and their emissions have started to stabilize or even decrease. As HCFC-22 (CHClF2) is by far the most abundant HCFC in today's atmosphere, it is crucial to continue to monitor the evolution of its atmospheric concentration. In this study, we describe an improved HCFC-22 retrieval strategy from ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar spectra recorded at the high-altitude scientific station of Jungfraujoch, the Swiss Alps, 3580 m a.m.s.l. (above mean sea level). This new strategy distinguishes tropospheric and lower-stratospheric partial columns. Comparisons with independent datasets, such as the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), supported by models, such as the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObErvation (BASCOE) and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), demonstrate the validity of our tropospheric and lower-stratospheric long-term time series. A trend analysis on the datasets used here, now spanning 30 years, confirms the last decade's decline in the HCFC-22 growth rate. This updated retrieval strategy can be adapted for other ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), such as CFC-12. Measuring or retrieving ODS atmospheric concentrations is essential for scrutinizing the fulfilment of the globally ratified Montreal Protocol.

However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE % = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5-12) than LiDAR-only models (2-5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 31%, R-2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets. Results show that the synergistic use of LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential for improving the accuracy of the biomass estimates in the Brazilian Amazon.

Present coronagraphic systems have yet to achieve the required 10(-10) broadband contrast in a laboratory environment, but promising progress toward this goal continues. An approach to starlight suppression is the use of a single-mode fiber (SMF) behind a coronagraph. By using deformable mirrors to create a mismatch between incoming starlight and the fiber mode, SMF can be turned into an integral part of the starlight suppression system. We present simulation results of a system with five SMFs coupled to shaped pupil and vortex coronagraphs. We investigate the properties of the system, including its spectral bandwidth, throughput, and sensitivity to low-order aberrations. We also compare the performance of the SMF configuration with conventional imaging and multiobject modes, finding improved spectral bandwidth, raw contrast, background-limited signal-to-noise ratio, and demonstrate a wavefront control algorithm, which is robust to tip/tilt errors.

When phase errors from high-altitude turbulence scintillate due to Fresnel propagation, wavefront amplitude errors may be spatially offset from residual phase errors. These correlated errors appear as asymmetry in the image plane under the Fraunhofer condition. In an analytic model with an open-loop AO system, the strength of the asymmetry is calculated for a single mode of phase aberration, which generalizes to two dimensions under a Fourier decomposition of the complex illumination. Other parameters included are the spatial offset of the AO correction, which is the wind velocity in the frozen flow regime multiplied by the effective AO time delay and propagation distance or altitude of the turbulent layer. In this model, the asymmetry is strongest when the wind is slow and nearest to the coronagraphic mask when the turbulent layer is far away, such as when the telescope is pointing low toward the horizon. A great emphasis is made about the fact that the brighter asymmetric lobe of the PSF points in the opposite direction as the wind, which is consistent analytically with the clarification that the image plane electric field distribution is actually the inverse Fourier transform of the aperture plane.

Traditional, bottom-up detector characterization methods provide one way to model underlying detector physics and generate ever more faithful numerical simulations, but this approach is vulnerable to preconceptions and over-simplification. The alternative top-down approach is laboratory emulation, which enables observation, calibration, and analysis scenarios to be tested without relying on a complete understanding of the underlying physics. This complements detector characterization and simulation efforts by testing their validity. We describe a laboratory facility and experimental testbed that supports the emulation of a wide range of mission concepts such as gravitational weak lensing measurements by the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope and high precision spectrophotometry of transiting exoplanets by James Webb Space Telescope. An Offner relay projects readily customizable "scenes" (e.g., stars, galaxies, and spectra) with very low optical aberration over the full area of a typical optical or near-infrared image sensor. f/8 and slower focal ratios may be selected, spanning those of most proposed space missions and approximating the point spread function (PSF) size of seeing limited ground-based surveys. Diffraction limited PSFs are projected over a wide field of view and wavelength range to deliver highly predictable image patterns down to subpixel scales with stable intensity and fine motion control. The testbed enables realistic validation of detector performance on science-like images, which aids mission design and survey strategy as well as targeted investigations of various detector effects.

Identifying surface changes in these images, e.g., new impact craters, is critical for investigating many scientific hypotheses. Traditional approaches to change detection rely on image differencing and manual feature engineering. These methods can be sensitive to irrelevant variations in illumination or image quality and typically require before and after images to be coregistered, which itself is a major challenge. Additionally, most prior change detection studies have been limited to remote sensing images of earth. We propose a new deep learning approach for binary patch-level change detection involving transfer learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction using convolutional autoencoders. Our experiments on diverse remote sensing datasets of Mars, the moon, and earth show that our methods can detect meaningful changes with high accuracy using a relatively small training dataset despite significant differences in illumination, image quality, imaging sensors, coregistration, and surface properties. We show that the latent representations learned by a convolutional autoencoder yield the most general representations for detecting change across surface feature types, scales, sensors, and planetary bodies.

Performance characterization of a low-power magnetically shielded Hall thruster with an internally-mounted hollow cathode	PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Hall thruster; low power; magnetic shielding		Magnetically shielded miniature (MaSMi) is a low power (<= 1 kW) long life (>100 kg Xe throughput) magnetically shielded Hall thruster that features an internally mounted hollow cathode. The development model MaSMi Hall thruster was designed, fabricated, and tested in preparation for advancement into an engineering model design. The MaSMi-DM uses an ultracompact internally-mounted heaterless hollow cathode, which has previously demonstrated stable operation over a discharge current range of 0.5-4 A. More than 100 heaterless ignitions were performed during this test campaign, revealing consistent and predictable start-up behavior. Component testing of a novel anode manifold used in the MaSMi-DM demonstrated peak-to-peak azimuthal propellant flow distribution variations of less than 3.2% across three flow rates and two anodes. Current-voltage-magnetic field testing of the MaSMi-DM was completed over a discharge voltage range of 200-600 V, a discharge current range of 0.5-4.0 A, and a discharge power range of 150-1000 W. The MaSMi-DM demonstrated the highest total efficiency and highest total specific impulse of any sub-kW Hall thruster to date. Performance highlights include a peak thrust of 68.6 mN, a peak total specific impulse of 1940 s at 1000 W with >1500 s available above 500 W, and a peak total efficiency of 54.2% at 1000 W with >40% available above 300 W. Visual observations of the plasma discharge, carbon-coated discharge channel walls post-operation, and the results from plasma simulations provided strong evidence of magnetic shielding and the projected >100 kg Xe throughput capability of the thruster.

Attenuation of Ultraviolet Radiation in Rocks and Minerals: Implications for Mars Science	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							SIMULATED MARTIAN ENVIRONMENTS; ORGANIC-MOLECULES; UV-RADIATION; GALE CRATER; SPACECRAFT SURFACES; PHOTOSTABILITY; DEGRADATION; PERCHLORATE; SOIL; IRRADIATION	The effects of radiation on the survivability of key biosignatures are a driving factor in exploration strategies throughout the solar system. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, especially shorter wavelength UVC radiation, is known to be damaging to organisms and to potential organic biosignatures; however, the interaction of UV radiation with minerals and rocks is not well understood. Constraining the survivability of organics and generation of habitable zones requires assessment of physical parameters such as penetration depth of UV photons. This type of information helps to identify to what extent rocks and minerals can provide effective shielding against UV radiation and is especially important on Mars, where the surface chemistry is more oxidizing, and the radiation environment is more extreme than on Earth. Using pressed pellets of natural gypsum, kaolinite, Mars simulant basalt, and welded tuff, we measured the spectral transmittance of each in the wavelength range of 220-400 nm. Although transmittance drops off quickly with depth, detectable levels of UV can penetrate >500 mu m in each material. Each substrate allowed higher transmittance of UVC radiation than of longer wavelength UVA/B radiation, possibly as a result of surface reflectance and internal scattering properties. This could result in increased subsurface photolysis of organic compounds and biosignatures. We have used the transmittance data collected herein to constrain the lifetimes of several organic molecules in the Martian subsurface. These results will also have implications for organic analyses to be conducted by Mars 2020 and could be used to better constrain the SHERLOC/Mars 2020 interrogation volume. Plain Language Summary Some types of radiation, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation, can be damaging to organisms and to organic molecules which could potentially be used as evidence of life. For this reason it is important to understand how rocks and minerals can provide protection against these types of radiation. In this study we prepared pellets of varying thickness made of different types of rocks and minerals relevant to Mars exploration and measured the amount of UV light that was able to pass through them. These data were used in combination with knowledge of the UV environment on Mars in order to determine what the UV radiation dosage would be under various thicknesses of the rocks and minerals we had analyzed. The percentage of UV radiation that was able to pass through the rock and mineral pellets was found to be higher than we expected, which suggests that this type of damaging radiation would be able to penetrate further into rock and mineral environments. This information was then used to determine approximately how long different types of organic molecules could be expected to survive if buried under different depths in rock and mineral materials.

Extensive Polygonal Fracture Network in Siccar Point group Strata: Fracture Mechanisms and Implications for Fluid Circulation in Gale Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Gale crater; polygonal fractures; fluid flow; sediment contraction	DIAGENETIC FEATURES; TEPEE STRUCTURES; CALCIUM-SULFATE; MOUNT SHARP; ORIGIN; STRATIGRAPHY; CRACKS; DESICCATION; EVOLUTION; VEINS	Rock fractures are indicators of stress release within geologic systems, and fracture morphologies can commonly be used to infer formation conditions. Polygonal fractures are common in isotropic, contractional stress regimes such as in rocks exposed at the surface of a planet undergoing thermal cycling or in sedimentary substrates undergoing repeated wetting and drying. Such polygonal fracture systems, on centimeter to decameter scales, have been widely documented on Mars. Utilizing a combination of orbital- and ground-based images, we report a laterally extensive polygonal fracture network that occurs within siliciclastic rocks of the lowermost Siccar Point group, Gale crater, Mars. The Siccar Point group is exposed over approximately 20 km(2) in northwest Gale crater, where it unconformably overlies eroded strata of Mount Sharp (Aeolis Mons) and reflects likely aeolian deposition along the lower flanks of Mount Sharp. Images reveal an extensive network of erosionally resistant polygons, approximately 7.5 m across, that exhibit interior angles (i.e., fracture intersections) with modes at 90 degrees and 120 degrees. Polygon morphology indicates that fractures formed during multiple cycles of expansion and contraction, which is attributed to desiccation and subsequent recharge of near-surface groundwater. The erosional resistance of preserved fractures is inferred to reflect postfracture diagenetic fluid flow along the sub-Siccar Point group unconformity and cementation. Evidence for multiple fluid events in the relatively young strata of the Siccar Point group requires a protracted history of fluid stability in Gale crater. Plain Language Summary Deciphering the processes that affect sedimentary rocks after their deposition is critical to understanding the geologic history of a basin. Fractures occur when applied forces exceed the strength of the host material, and we can infer the process by which fracturing occurred by assessing the morphology of fractures. In this study, we analyze a network of polygonal fractures within rocks of the Siccar Point group, a relatively young geologic unit that is exposed over similar to 20 km(2) of Gale crater, the field site of the Curiosity rover. Polygons formed by these fractures are similarly sized and intersect at angles that show dominant modes at 90 degrees and 120 degrees. These observations suggest that fractures formed under conditions of uniform stress and likely result from contractional processes such as climate-driven wet-dry cycles. The cementation of fractures by later fluids then imparted erosional resistance that permits these features to be recognized from orbit. The presence of an extensive, fluid-driven fracture system within aeolian strata highlights the potential complexity of martian climate signals.	[Kronyak, R. E.; Kah, L. C.; Miklusicak, N.

Differences Between OCO-2 and GOME-2 SIF Products From a Model-Data Fusion Perspective	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						solar-induced fluorescence (SIF); land surface model; data assimilation; products comparison	INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SUN-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; CANOPY PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RED FLUORESCENCE; RETRIEVAL; CYCLE; ASSIMILATION; SIMULATIONS; DYNAMICS	Space-borne retrievals of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) over land surfaces have recently become a resource for studying and quantifying the broad scale dynamics of gross carbon uptake (gross primary productivity-GPP) across ecosystems. To prepare for the assimilation of SIF data in terrestrial biosphere models, we examine how differences between SIF products (due to differences in acquisition characteristics and processing chain) may affect the optimization of model parameters and the resultant GPP estimate. We compare recent daily mean SIF products (one from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 [OCO-2] and two from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 [GOME-2], GlobFluo [GF] and NASA-v28 [N28], missions), averaged at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution and 16-day temporal resolution, at the biome level. Phase differences between these products are relatively small. A first-order correction of the difference in spectral sampling between the two instruments shows that OCO-2 and N28 are consistent in terms of magnitude and amplitude, while GF is twice as large as the others. Using a bias-blind toy data assimilation framework, we analyze how biases between SIF products, and between model and products, can be partially alleviated by optimizing the slope and intercept parameters of a linear GPP-SIF operator. As observation biases can transfer to biases in other optimized process-based parameters and to modeled carbon fluxes- thereby resulting in unidentified inaccurate parameter values-we argue that potential SIF biases should be treated cautiously in real-world experiments in order to achieve realistic and reliable future simulations.

Validation of the HITRAN 2016 and GEISA 2015 line lists using ACE-FTS solar occultation observations	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						ACE-FTS; HITRAN; GEISA; ExoMars; Line-list	RANGES 1850-2280 CM(-1); HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRA; 3.3 MU-M; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; OZONE SPECTROSCOPY; CO2 ISOTOPOLOGUES; SHAPE PARAMETERS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; H2O LINES	The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) began its nominal science phase at Mars in April 2018, following releases of editions to two major spectroscopic line lists: GEISA 2015 (Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques Atmospheriques: Management and Study of Atmospheric Spectroscopic Information), and HITRAN 2016 (High Resolution Transmission). This work evaluates both line lists over the spectral region between 2325-4350 cm(-1) using terrestrial solar occultation observations made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). This spectral region is targeted on Mars by two complementary solar occultation instruments on TGO that will monitor temperature and pressure, aerosols, the abundance of CO2, CO, H2O, HDO, CH4, and other undetected trace gases. Major updates to GEISA 2015 and HITRAN 2016, with respect to previous editions, have been focused on CO2 absorption features in support of Earth-observing missions to monitor greenhouse. Since CO2 is the dominant absorber on Mars, making up 96.5% of the atmosphere, validating the updated line lists is critically important before their deployment for ExoMars. We report that updated CO2 parameters make significant improvements to spectral fits made when using both line lists. Several updates to H2O lines in both line lists also show improvement. The primary difference we observe between the two line lists comes from O-3 absorption features near 3850 cm(-1) and from several CH4 absorption lines in the regions 2800-3200 cm(-1) and 4000-4300 cm(-1). Because of these differences, we find that using HITRAN 2016 tends to result in better spectral fits, especially below 30 km, than using GEISA 2015 in this spectral region. Differences are strongly reduced with increasing altitude (> 40 km) as pressure and gas abundance falls off. It was also discovered that several new errors in both new editions of GEISA and HITRAN were introduced since the HITRAN 2012. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Olsen, K.

Monitoring Groundwater Change in California's Central Valley Using Sentinel-1 and GRACE Observations	GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						satellite InSAR; groundwater change; subsidence; GRACE; remote sensing	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; SAN-JOAQUIN VALLEY; DEPLETION; STORAGE; INSAR; SUBSIDENCE; PRECIPITATION; MODEL	The San Joaquin Valley and Tulare basins in California's Central Valley have intensive agricultural activity and groundwater demand that has caused significant subsidence and depletion of water resources in the past. We measured groundwater pumping-induced land subsidence in the southern Central Valley from March 2015 to May 2017 using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The InSAR measurements provided fine spatial details of subsidence patterns and displayed a superposition of secular and seasonal variations that were coherent across our study region and correlated with precipitation variability and changes in freshwater demand. Combining InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, precipitation, and in situ well records showed a broad scale slowdown/cessation of long term subsidence in the wetter winter of 2017, likely reflecting the collective response of the Central Valley aquifer system to heavier-than-usual precipitation. We observed a very good temporal correlation between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite groundwater anomaly (GWA) variation and long-term subsidence records, regardless of local hydrogeology and mechanical properties. This indicates the subsidence from satellite geodesy is a very useful indicator for tracking groundwater storage change. With the continuing acquisition of Sentinel-1 and other satellites, we anticipate decadal-scale subsidence records with a spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of meters will be available in the near future to be combined with basin-averaged GRACE measurements to improve our estimate of time-varying groundwater change.

Evaluation of Approaches for Mapping Tidal Wetlands of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Tidal wetlands; synthetic aperture radar; random forest; R; Google Earth Engine; Chesapeake Bay; Delaware Bay; Sentinel-1A; Sentinel-2A; PALSAR; PALSAR-2; Landsat 8	POLARIMETRIC SAR; FRESH-WATER; VEGETATED WETLANDS; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; GREAT-LAKES; COASTAL; MARSHES; PALSAR; CARBON; COVER	The spatial extent and vegetation characteristics of tidal wetlands and their change are among the biggest unknowns and largest sources of uncertainty in modeling ecosystem processes and services at the land-ocean interface. Using a combination of moderate-high spatial resolution (<= 30 meters) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, we evaluated several approaches for mapping and characterization of wetlands of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Sentinel-1A, Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), PALSAR-2, Sentinel-2A, and Landsat 8 imagery were used to map wetlands, with an emphasis on mapping tidal marshes, inundation extents, and functional vegetation classes (persistent vs. non-persistent). We performed initial characterizations at three target wetlands study sites with distinct geomorphologies, hydrologic characteristics, and vegetation communities. We used findings from these target wetlands study sites to inform the selection of timeseries satellite imagery for a regional scale random forest-based classification of wetlands in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Acquisition of satellite imagery, raster manipulations, and timeseries analyses were performed using Google Earth Engine. Random forest classifications were performed using the R programming language. In our regional scale classification, estuarine emergent wetlands were mapped with a producer's accuracy greater than 88% and a user's accuracy greater than 83%. Within target wetland sites, functional classes of vegetation were mapped with over 90% user's and producer's accuracy for all classes, and greater than 95% accuracy overall. The use of multitemporal SAR and multitemporal optical imagery discussed here provides a straightforward yet powerful approach for accurately mapping tidal freshwater wetlands through identification of non-persistent vegetation, as well as for mapping estuarine emergent wetlands, with direct applications to the improved management of coastal wetlands.

SMAP-Reflectometry (SMAP-R) brings a set of unique capabilities, such as polarimetry and improved spatial resolution, that allow for the exploration of scientific applications that other GNSS-R missions cannot address. In order to leverage SMAP-R for scientific applications, a calibration must be performed to account for the characteristics of the SMAP radar receiver and each GPS transmitter. In this study, we analyze the unique characteristics of SMAP-R, as compared to other GNSS-R missions, and present a calibration method for the SMAP-R signals that enables the standardized use of these signals by the scientific community. There are two key calibration parameters that need to be corrected: The first is the GPS transmitted power and GPS antenna gain at the incidence angle of the measured reflections and the second is the convolution of the SMAP high gain antenna pattern and the glistening zone (Earth surface area from where GPS signals scatter). To account for the GPS transmitter variability, GPS instrument properties-transmitted power and antenna gain-are collocated with information collected from the CYclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) at SMAP's range of incidence angles (37.3 degrees to 42.7 degrees). To account for the convolutional effect of the SMAP antenna gain, both the scattering area of the reflected GPS signal and the SMAP antenna footprint are mapped on the surface. We account for the size of the scattering area corresponding to each delay and Doppler bin of the SMAP-R measurements based off the SMAP antenna pattern, and normalize according to the size of a measurement representative to one obtained with an omnidirectional antenna. We have validated these calibration methods through an analysis of the coherency of the reflected signal over an extensive area of old sea ice having constant surface characteristics over a period of 3 months. By selecting a vicarious scattering surface with high coherency, we eliminated scene variability and complexity in order to avoid scene dependent aliases in the calibration. The calibration method reduced the dependence on the GPS transmitter power and gain from -1.08 dB/dB to a residual error of about -0.2 dB/dB. Results also showed that the calibration method eliminates the effect of the high gain antenna filtering effect, thus reducing errors as high as 10 dB on angles furthest from SMAP's constant 40 degrees incidence angle.

David			Benefits of a Closely-Spaced Satellite Constellation of Atmospheric Polarimetric Radio Occultation Measurements	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						convection; precipitation; moisture; GPM; GNSS; GPS; satellite constellation; cubesat; radio occultation	CONVECTIVE TRANSITION STATISTICS; MOISTURE VERTICAL STRUCTURE; WATER-VAPOR; PRECIPITATION; ORGANIZATION; TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY; EVOLUTION; ARRIVAL; ERRORS	The climate and weather forecast predictive capability for precipitation intensity is limited by gaps in the understanding of basic cloud-convective processes. Currently, a better understanding of the cloud-convective process lacks observational constraints, due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate, vertically resolved pressure, temperature, and water vapor structure inside and near convective clouds. This manuscript describes the potential advantages of collecting sequential radio occultation (RO) observations from a constellation of closely spaced low Earth-orbiting satellites. In this configuration, the RO tangent points tend to cluster together, such that successive RO ray paths are sampling independent air mass quantities as the ray paths lie "parallel" to one another. When the RO train orbits near a region of precipitation, there is a probability that one or more of the RO ray paths will intersect the region of heavy precipitation, and one or more would lie outside. The presence of heavy precipitation can be discerned by the use of the polarimetric RO (PRO) technique recently demonstrated by the Radio Occultations through Heavy Precipitation (ROHP) receiver onboard the Spanish PAZ spacecraft. This sampling strategy provides unique, near-simultaneous observations of the water vapor profile inside and in the environment surrounding heavy precipitation, which are not possible from current RO data.

One reason is that firehose instabilities would be triggered, leading to an ongoing driving/saturation evolution mechanism. We verify this assumption here for the first time for the electron distribution function and the electron firehose instability (EFI), using fully kinetic simulations with the Expanding Box Model. This allows the self-consistent study of onset and evolution of the oblique, resonant EFI in an expanding solar wind. We characterize how the competition between EFI and adiabatic expansion plays out in high- and low-beta cases, in high- and low-speed solar wind streams. We observe that, even when competing against expansion, the EFI results in perpendicular heating and parallel cooling. These two concurrent processes effectively limit the expansion-induced increase in temperature anisotropy and parallel electron beta. We show that the EFI goes through cycles of stabilization and destabilization: when higher wave number EFI modes saturate, lower wave number modes are destabilized by the effects of the expansion. We show how resonant wave/particle interaction modifies the electron velocity distribution function after the onset of the EFI. The simulations are performed with the fully kinetic, semi-implicit expanding box code EB-iPic3D.

This paper presents an event observation in order to explore the dynamics of charged particles and plasma waves, i.e., mirror, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC), and whistler waves, in the Earth's magnetosheath. It shows that when ions have a high-speed streaming velocity parallel to the magnetic field, EMIC waves arise. We also find that the frequency distribution of nearly parallel and nearly antiparallel whistler waves depends on the parallel streaming velocity of electrons. Based on the linear kinetic theory and the fitting plasma parameters, we show that the differential flows among ion components can enhance the ion cyclotron anisotropy instability that is even stronger than the mirror instability. The differential electron flows induce an asymmetry of the growth rate of counter-propagating whistler waves in the electron cyclotron anisotropy instability. On the other hand, the low-frequency EMIC and transverse electromagnetic waves modulate the ion pitch angle distribution. Moreover, when charged particles flow across the magnetic field, both low- and high-energy electrons are deeply trapped by mirror waves. These results illustrate new features of the observed plasma waves and charged particles in the Earth's magnetosheath, which could inspire improvement of the wave models therein.

Though conventional methods are highly reliable, they could damage the container or destroy the contents, rendering the collection of microorganisms pointless. In this paper, a pulsed subatmospheric pressure microsecond spark discharge plasma jet, referred to as a pin-to-hole discharge (PHD), was used as a source of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) for the sterilization of inoculated surfaces with limited thermal impact. A device was created to generate an overlapped region of treatment on a cylindrical body from an array of these PHDs. The surface was inoculated with vegetative bacteria (Escherichia coli), sporulated bacteria (Bacillus atrophaeus), or a simulated dirt and spore solution and then treated with the plasma array. Gas composition effects on the bacterial load reduction were explored, and the combination of RONS from air was found to be an improvement of the effects from pure oxygen. Increasing treatment time caused an increase in bacterial load reduction, regardless of the distance or gas composition. Treatment of simulated soil inoculation showed suppressed sterilization results which asserted the fact that addition of UV radiation from the discharges improved bacterial inactivation from PHDs. The radial array of pulsed subatmospheric pressure microsecond spark discharges was shown to reduce the bacterial load on the inoculated surface by 5-log within 20 min of treatment from a discharge in air.

While in-situ measurements from buoys and flux towers will continue to be the standard in regard to surface heat flux estimates, they commonly have significant gaps in temporal and spatial coverage. Previous and current satellite missions have filled these gaps; though they may not observe the fluxes directly, they can measure the variables needed (wind speed, temperature and humidity) to estimate latent and sensible heat fluxes. However, current remote sensing instruments have their own limitations, such as infrequent coverage, signals attenuated by precipitation or both. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission overcomes these limitations over the tropical and subtropical oceans by providing improved coverage in nearly all weather conditions. While CYGNSS (Level 2) primarily estimates surface winds, when coupled with observations or estimates of temperature and humidity from reanalysis data, it can provide estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes along its orbit. This paper describes the development of the Surface Heat Flux Product for the CYGNSS mission, its current results and expected improvements and changes in future releases.

The framework takes advantage of the improvements in spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-16 platform along with elevation information to improve the precipitation estimates. The procedure begins by first deriving a Rain/No Rain (R/NR) binary mask through classification of the pixels and then applying regression to estimate the amount of rainfall for rainy pixels. A Fully Convolutional Network is used as a regressor to predict precipitation estimates. The network is trained using the non-saturating conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss terms to generate results that better learn the complex distribution of precipitation in the observed data. Common verification metrics such as Probability Of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), Critical Success Index (CSI), Bias, Correlation and MSE are used to evaluate the accuracy of both R/NR classification and real-valued precipitation estimates. Statistics and visualizations of the evaluation measures show improvements in the precipitation retrieval accuracy in the proposed framework compared to the baseline models trained using conventional MSE loss terms. This framework is proposed as an augmentation for PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network- Cloud Classification System) algorithm for estimating global precipitation.

The Potential for Discriminating Microphysical Processes in Numerical Weather Forecasts Using Airborne Polarimetric Radio Occultations	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						numerical weather prediction; cloud microphysics; microphysical parameterization; radio occultation; polarimetric radar; precipitation; convection; atmospheric river	DROP SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; EARTHS ATMOSPHERE; PACIFIC-OCEAN; WEST-COAST; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; RADAR; IMPACT	Accurate representation of cloud microphysical processes in numerical weather and climate models has proven challenging, in part because of the highly specialized instrumentation required for diagnosing errors in simulated distributions of hydrometeors. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) polarimetric radio occultation (PRO) is a promising new technique that is sensitive to hydrometeors and has the potential to help address these challenges by providing microphysical observations that are relevant to larger spatial scales, especially if this type of observing system can be implemented on aircraft that can target heavy precipitation events. Two numerical experiments were run using a mesoscale model configured with two different microphysical parameterization schemes for a very intense atmospheric river (AR) event that was sampled by aircraft deploying dropsondes just before it made landfall in California, during the CalWater 2015 field campaign. The numerical experiments were used to simulate profiles of airborne polarimetric differential phase delay observations. The differential phase delay due to liquid water hydrometeors below the freezing level differed significantly in the two experiments, as well as the height of the maximum differential phase delay due to all hydrometeors combined. These results suggest that PRO observations from aircraft have the potential to contribute to validating and improving the representation of microphysical processes in numerical weather forecasts once these observations become available.

We fix the values of the GPS ephemerides and time-varying clock offsets to precise estimates from the definitive constellation product produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As part of the POD process of the LEOs, we estimate a translation of the reference coordinate system realized by the GPS orbit and clock product. Doing so accounts for the inconsistency between the Earth's center of mass coordinate system used for the orbit integration of the LEOs, and the terrestrial reference frame produced by the GPS orbit and clock product. The resulting translation parameters estimated separately from the GRACE-A and GRACE-B satellites show very similar variations from day to day. They represent the geocenter motion, as realized from the difference between the origin of the terrestrial reference frame represented by the GPS orbit and clock product and the Earth's instantaneous center of mass defined by the GRACE satellite dynamical orbital motion. Comparisons with geocenter motion observations from other techniques show that our daily estimates of geocenter motion agree well, when smoothed, in both the amplitude and phase of the annual signal. This validates both the high sensitivity of the GRACE GPS measurement type to geocenter motion and the high precision of the GRACE force model enabled by accelerometer measurements, the two essential components for estimation of geocenter motion with this technique.

A Kalman filter-based strategy fuses star camera and angular acceleration measurements to reconstruct spacecraft attitude with reduced high-frequency noise and fewer gaps and corrects a pair of processing errors. Running data from tailored accelerometer characterization maneuvers in 2017, K-band calibration maneuvers in 2003, and nominal mission operations through our Kalman filter, estimated aliasing factors from linear to angular acceleration account for multiple forms of observed noise. During most of the mission, V03 produced very limited gains in our gravity field products, but during early and late mission high error regimes the reduction in high-frequency attitude noise substantially damped systematic gravity solution effects (latitudinal bands) and noise (stripes).

Wheel surface features, such as grousers, are known to improve tractive capability in planetary-relevant soils. However there are no comprehensive design guidelines for these wheel features. In this research, a series of intensive and extensive parametric studies were carried out in full-scale vehicle slope experiments and single-wheel tests that assess the influence of grouser count, height, orientation, and end-cap in various longitudinal and lateral slip conditions. This work also investigates the traction process of grousers based on a soil flow imaging technique. The soil motion analysis reveals that grousers reduce forward soil flow/motion resistance and increase net traction. A grouser design formula is derived from the soil flow observation, and design guidelines of rigid wheels of planetary rovers for loose soil are proposed based on these results. The proposed guidelines are applied to the modification of grouser design of the Mars Science Laboratory rover to improve tractive performance on loose terrain. (C) 2019 ISTVS.

Coupled, Physics-Based Modeling Reveals Earthquake Displacements are Critical to the 2018 Palu, Sulawesi Tsunami	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Sulawesi; tsunami; earthquake dynamics; coupled model; physics-based modeling; strike slip	DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHOD; OFF-FAULT PLASTICITY; SHALLOW-WATER FLOWS; UNSTRUCTURED MESHES; TRIPLE JUNCTION; RUPTURE PROCESS; SEISMIC CYCLE; INDONESIA; SUPERSHEAR; MAGNITUDE	The September 2018, M-w 7.5 Sulawesi earthquake occurring on the Palu-Koro strike-slip fault system was followed by an unexpected localized tsunami. We show that direct earthquake-induced uplift and subsidence could have sourced the observed tsunami within Palu Bay. To this end, we use a physics-based, coupled earthquake-tsunami modeling framework tightly constrained by observations. The model combines rupture dynamics, seismic wave propagation, tsunami propagation and inundation. The earthquake scenario, featuring sustained supershear rupture propagation, matches key observed earthquake characteristics, including the moment magnitude, rupture duration, fault plane solution, teleseismic waveforms and inferred horizontal ground displacements. The remote stress regime reflecting regional transtension applied in the model produces a combination of up to 6 m left-lateral slip and up to 2 m normal slip on the straight fault segment dipping 65 degrees East beneath Palu Bay. The time-dependent, 3D seafloor displacements are translated into bathymetry perturbations with a mean vertical offset of 1.5 m across the submarine fault segment. This sources a tsunami with wave amplitudes and periods that match those measured at the Pantoloan wave gauge and inundation that reproduces observations from field surveys. We conclude that a source related to earthquake displacements is probable and that landsliding may not have been the primary source of the tsunami. These results have important implications for submarine strike-slip fault systems worldwide. Physics-based modeling offers rapid response specifically in tectonic settings that are currently underrepresented in operational tsunami hazard assessment.	[Ulrich, T.; Madden, E.

Each satellite carries a radar receiver that measures GPS signals scattered from the surface. Wind speed over the ocean is determined from distortions in the signal caused by wind-driven surface roughness. GPS operates at a sufficiently low frequency to allow for propagation through all precipitation, including the extreme rain rates present in the eyewall of tropical cyclones. The spacing and orbit of the satellites were chosen to optimize frequent sampling of tropical cyclones. In this study, we characterize the CYGNSS ocean surface wind speed measurements by their uncertainty, dynamic range, sensitivity to precipitation, spatial resolution, spatial and temporal sampling, and data latency. The current status of each of these properties is examined and potential future improvements are discussed. In addition, examples are given of current science investigations that make use of the data.

In this work, we present confidence-rich mapping (CRM), a new algorithm for spatial grid-based mapping of the 3D environment. CRM augments the occupancy level at each voxel by its confidence value. By explicitly storing and evolving confidence values using the CRM filter, CRM extends traditional grid mapping in three ways: first, it partially maintains the probabilistic dependence among voxels; second, it relaxes the need for hand-engineering an inverse sensor model and proposes the concept of sensor cause model that can be derived in a principled manner from the forward sensor model; third, and most importantly, it provides consistent confidence values over the occupancy estimation that can be reliably used in collision risk evaluation and motion planning. CRM runs online and enables mapping environments where voxels might be partially occupied. We demonstrate the performance of the method on various datasets and environments in simulation and on physical systems. We show in real-world experiments that, in addition to achieving maps that are more accurate than traditional methods, the proposed filtering scheme demonstrates a much higher level of consistency between its error and the reported confidence, hence, enabling a more reliable collision risk evaluation for motion planning.

Direct Kinetic and Atmospheric Modeling Studies of Criegee Intermediate Reactions with Acetone	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Criegee intermediates; acetone; atmospheric chemistry; global modelling; reaction rates	GAS-PHASE OZONOLYSIS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; POTENTIAL SOURCE; CRI MECHANISM; GLOBAL-SCALE; ACID; REACTIVITY; AEROSOL; BUDGET	Mounting evidence suggests that Criegee intermediates are important tropospheric oxidants of both organic and inorganic gases, supplementing the oxidation chemistry initiated by OH radicals. Here, the rate coefficient for the reaction of the simplest Criegee intermediate CH2OO with acetone, k(CH2OO + (CH3)(2)CO), was measured using laser flash photolysis and cavity ring-down spectroscopy methods under tropospherically relevant conditions of pressure and temperature. The pressure dependence of k(CH2OO + (CH3)(2)CO) = (4.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(-13) [N-2]/((3.7 +/- 1.4) x 10(16) + [N-2]) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) was measured in the 5-100 Torr range, returning a high-pressure limit value of (4.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 293 K. A temperature dependence of k(CH2OO + (CH3)(2)CO) = (1.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(-21) T-2 exp(2421 +/- 40/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) was observed in the 250-310 K range. The global chemical transport model (STOCHEM-CRI) was used to model the speciated Criegee intermediate field using the recently reported temperature-dependent rate coefficient values for various reactions of Criegee intermediates. The incorporation of the Criegee intermediate reaction with acetone in the model predicts decreases in acetone concentration of as much as 10-40 ppt in various regions of the world.

A major factor that limits the functionality of CubeSats is the absence of high-gain antennas (HGAs) that can sustain a high data-rate link for communications or provide the required spatial resolution for remote sensing. In this work, we discuss the development of one of the largest apertures at Ka-band for CubeSats-a 1 m mesh deployable offset reflector antenna, with a stowed volume of 3U ( $10\times 10\times 30 \,\,\text {cm}<^>{3}$ )-to enable precipitation radars that can achieve the required spatial resolution while meeting the stringent mechanical constraints posed by the small CubeSat volume. We detail the critical aspects of this antenna design, including RF characterization, antenna fabrication, and measurement. We also describe a novel deployment mechanism that facilitates the packaging of such a large aperture in a small volume. The antenna demonstrated a measured efficiency of 60%, with a half-power beamwidth of 0.60 degrees at 35.75 GHz. The cost reduction afforded by CubeSats makes launching a constellation of such radar based CubeSats practical, allowing higher temporal sampling rates, which is essential for the observation of weather processes with a short-time evolution.

Results show a wide range of possible LSMP types over a 37-year period of study. LSMP type variability can be summarized as a spectrum from patterns dominated by positive SLP and Z500 anomalies with a poleward displacement of the strongest 250 hPa winds, to patterns dominated by similar structures but with anomalies of opposite sign. The LSMPs found are connected with lower tropospheric temperature and wind, precipitation, and the frequency of atmospheric rivers (ARs). This highlights LSMPs more closely associated with anomalous and potentially impactful surface meteorology. Results show ARs as primary drivers of heavy precipitation over some of the region and connect their occurrence to driving synoptic dynamics. Two important low frequency modes of climate variability, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), show some influence on the frequency of LSMP type, with the SAM more directly related to LSMP type modulation than ENSO. This comprehensive climatology of synoptic variability across southern South America has potential to aid in a mechanistic approach to studying climate change projections of temperature, precipitation, and AR frequency in climate models.

A superconducting thermal switch with ultrahigh impedance for interfacing superconductors to semiconductors	NATURE ELECTRONICS			English	Article								A number of current approaches to quantum and neuromorphic computing use superconductors as the basis of their platform or as a measurement component, and will need to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Semiconductor systems are typically proposed as a top-level control in these architectures, with low-temperature passive components and intermediary superconducting electronics acting as the direct interface to the lowest-temperature stages. The architectures, therefore, require a low-power superconductor/semiconductor interface, which is not currently available. Here we report a superconducting switch that is capable of translating low-voltage superconducting inputs directly into semiconductor-compatible (above 1,000 mV) outputs at kelvin-scale temperatures (1K or 4K). To illustrate the capabilities in interfacing superconductors and semiconductors, we use it to drive a light-emitting diode in a photonic integrated circuit, generating photons at 1K from a low-voltage input and detecting them with an on-chip superconducting single-photon detector. We also characterize our device's timing response (less than 300 ps turn-on, 15 ns turn-off), output impedance (greater than 1 MU) and energy requirements (0.180 m(-2), 3.24 mV nW(-1)).

Spectral Invariance Hypothesis Study of Polarized Reflectance With the Ground-Based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Angle of linear polarization (AoLP); diffuse scattering of vegetation; land surface reflection; Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI); polarized bidirectional reflectance distribution function (pBRDF); polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF); polarized reflection of vegetation	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; AEROSOL PROPERTIES; LAND SURFACES; LIGHT; SCATTERING; VEGETATION; RETRIEVAL; OCEAN; MODEL; CORN	Many models used to represent the boundary condition for the separation of atmospheric scattering from the surface reflection in polarized remote sensing measurements, assuming that the polarized surface reflectance is spectrally neutral. To test this hypothesis, referred to the spectral invariance hypothesis, JPL's Ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) was used to measure the polarized bidirectional reflectance factors (pBRFs) of different types of outdoor surfaces. GroundMSPI measures the linear polarization Stokes parameters ( I, Q, and U) at three wavebands centered at 470, 660, and 865 nm. Images of pBRF were acquired at the three wavelengths and the best-fitting slopes of pairwise spectral regressions were determined. The spectral invariance hypothesis predicts that these slopes should be unity. All region types, excluding grass, meet this criterion within 8% for all three wavelengths. Grass measurements show a large mean deviation of 31.1% from the expected slope when regressing 865-nm data against other wavelengths due to the differences in the spectral absorbance of chlorophyll. Angle of linear polarization (AoLP) analysis of cotton crops is presented as a method to isolate cases where the scattered light is dominated by single reflection within the plants from cases where multiple scattering plays a larger role. Spectral invariance is observed in those cases where specular reflection from the top surfaces of the leaves is primarily responsible for the measured polarization.

Ocean Surface Foam and Microwave Emission: Dependence on Frequency and Incidence Angle	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Foam; microwave remote sensing; wave breaking; whitecaps	L-BAND; SEA FOAM; WIND; SCATTERING; MODEL	Surface roughness and foam are two main components of ocean surface microwave thermal emission. Surface roughness provides scattering element and modifies local incidence angle. Air in foam alters the dielectric property of the surface layer. Bubbles in foam also alter the curvature of foam-water interface and modify emission and scattering properties of the water surface itself. Whitecap coverage W-c is the most accessible oceanographic information to represent surface foam. For emission analysis, it is necessary to establish a function relating to Wc and the effective air fraction Fa interacting with electromagnetic (EM) waves. An empirical relation is established through analyzing several microwave radiometer data sets in high winds covering a wide range of frequency, incidence angle, and vertical and horizontal polarizations. A physical interpretation of the proposed Fa (Wc) relationship is discussed. The relationship is used to quantify several important characteristics of surface foam relevant to microwave emission, including effective air fraction and skin depth as functions of wind speed, microwave frequency, and incidence angle.

DES Collaboration	Phenotypic redshifts with self-organizing maps: A novel method to characterize redshift distributions of source galaxies for weak lensing	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: distances and redshifts; dark energy	PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; PAU SURVEY; CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRAINTS; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION; COLORS; CAMERA; ERRORS; PDFS	Wide-field imaging surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) rely on coarse measurements of spectral energy distributions in a few filters to estimate the redshift distribution of source galaxies. In this regime, sample variance, shot noise, and selection effects limit the attainable accuracy of redshift calibration and thus of cosmological constraints. We present a new method to combine wide-field, few-filter measurements with catalogues from deep fields with additional filters and sufficiently low photometric noise to break degeneracies in photometric redshifts. The multiband deep field is used as an intermediary between wide-field observations and accurate redshifts, greatly reducing sample variance, shot noise, and selection effects. Our implementation of the method uses self-organizing maps to group galaxies into phenotypes based on their observed fluxes, and is tested using a mock DES catalogue created from N-body simulations. It yields a typical uncertainty on the mean redshift in each of five tomographic bins for an idealized simulation of the DES Year 3 weak-lensing tomographic analysis of sigma(Delta z) = 0.007, which is a 60 per cent improvement compared to the Year 1 analysis. Although the implementation of the method is tailored to DES, its formalism can be applied to other large photometric surveys with a similar observing strategy.

Nulling at short wavelengths: theoretical performance constraints and a demonstration of faint companion detection inside the diffraction limit with a rotating-baseline interferometer	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						instrumentation: high angular resolution; instrumentation: interferometers; (stars:) binaries: spectroscopic	OPTICAL INTERFEROMETER; HIGH-CONTRAST; LASER-LIGHT; TELESCOPE; PLANETS	The Palomar Fiber Nuller (PFN) is a rotating-baseline nulling interferometer that enables high-accuracy near-infrared (NIR) nulling observations with full azimuth coverage. To achieve NIR null-depth accuracies of several x 10(-4), the PFN uses a common-mode optical system to provide a high degree of symmetry, single-mode-fibre beam combination to reduce sensitivity to pointing and wavefront errors, extreme adaptive optics to stabilize the fibre coupling and the cross-aperture fringe phase, rapid signal calibration and camera readout to minimize temporal effects, and a statistical null-depth fluctuation analysis to relax the phase stabilization requirement. Here, we describe the PFN's final design and performance and provide a demonstration of faint-companion detection by means of nulling-baseline rotation, as originally envisioned for space-based nulling interferometry. Specifically, the K-s-band null-depth rotation curve measured on the spectroscopic binary eta Peg reflects both a secondary star 1.08 +/- 0.06 x 10(-2) as bright as the primary, and a null-depth contribution of 4.8 +/- 1.6 x 10(-4) due to the size of the primary star. With a 30 mas separation at the time, eta Peg B was well inside both the telescope's diffraction-limited beam diameter (88 mas) and typical coronagraphic inner working angles. Finally, we discuss potential improvements that can enable a number of small-angle nulling observations on larger telescopes.

Ramy			Post-rendezvous radar properties of comet 67P/CG from the Rosetta Mission: understanding future Earth-based radar observations and the dynamical evolution of comets	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: radar astronomy; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	WATER ICE; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; NUCLEUS; SURFACE; DUST; PERMITTIVITY; POROSITY; CONSERT; SIZE	Radar observations provide crucial insights into the formation and dynamical evolution of comets. This ability is constrained by our knowledge of the dielectric and textural properties of these small-bodies. Using several observations by Rosetta as well as results from the Earth-based Arecibo radio telescope, we provide an updated and comprehensive dielectric and roughness description of Comet 67P/CG, which can provide new constraints on the radar properties of other nuclei. Furthermore, contrary to previous assumptions of cometary surfaces being dielectrically homogeneous and smooth, we find that cometary surfaces are dielectrically heterogeneous ( epsilon (r) 'approximate to 1.6-3.2), and are rough at X - and S-band frequencies, which are widely used in characterization of small-bodies. We also investigate the lack of signal broadening in CONSERT observations through the comet head. Our results suggest that primordial building blocks in the subsurface are either absent, smaller than the radar wavelength, or have a weak dielectric contrast (Delta epsilon(r)'). To constrain this ambiguity, we use optical albedo measurements by the OSIRIS camera of the freshly exposed subsurface after the Aswan cliff collapse. We find that the hypothetical subsurface blocks should have vertical bar Delta epsilon(r)' vertical bar greater than or similar to 0.15, setting an upper limit of similar to 1 m on the size of 67P/CG's primordial building blocks if they exist. Our analysis is consistent with a purely thermal origin for the similar to 3 m surface bumps on pit walls and cliff-faces, hypothesized to be high-centred polygons formed from fracturing of the sintered shallow ice-bearing subsurface due to seasonal thermal expansion and contraction. Potential changes in 67P/CG's radar reflectivity at these at X- and S-bands can be associated with large-scale structural changes of the nucleus rather than small-scale textural ones. Monitoring changes in 67P/CG's radar properties during repeated close-approaches via Earth-based observations can constrain the dynamical evolution of its cometary nucleus.

Mass loss from the exoplanet WASP-12b inferred from Spitzer phase curves	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; techniques: photometric; planets and satellites: individual (WASP-12b); planet-star interactions	LIGHT CURVES; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; TRANSIT VARIABILITY; THERMAL INVERSION; HOT; ATMOSPHERE; INGRESS; OFFSET	The exoplanet WASP-12b is the prototype for the emerging class of ultrahot, Jupiter-mass exoplanets. Past models have predicted - and near-ultraviolet observations have shown - that this planet is losing mass. We present an analysis of two sets of 3.6 and 4.5 mu m Spitzer phase curve observations of the system which show clear evidence of infrared radiation from gas stripped from the planet, and the gas appears to be flowing directly toward or away from the host star. This accretion signature is only seen at 4.5 mu m, not at 3.6 mu m, which is indicative either of CO emission at the longer wavelength or blackbody emission from cool, less than or similar to 600 K gas. It is unclear why WASP-12b is the only ultrahot Jupiter to exhibit this mass-loss signature, but perhaps WASP-12b's orbit is decaying as some have claimed, while the orbits of other exoplanets may be more stable; alternatively, the high-energy irradiation from WASP-12A may be stronger than the other host stars. We also find evidence for phase offset variability at the level of 6.4 sigma (46.2 degrees) at 3.6 mu m.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: validation of weak lensing cluster member contamination estimates from P(z) decomposition	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations	MASSIVE GALAXY CLUSTERS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; CALIBRATION; GIANTS; SPT	Weak lensing source galaxy catalogues used in estimating the masses of galaxy clusters can be heavily contaminated by cluster members, prohibiting accurate mass calibration. In this study, we test the performance of an estimator for the extent of cluster member contamination based on decomposing the photometric redshift P(z) of source galaxies into contaminating and background components. We perform a full scale mock analysis on a simulated sky survey approximately mirroring the observational properties of the Dark Energy Survey Year One observations (DES Y1), and find excellent agreement between the true number profile of contaminating cluster member galaxies in the simulation and the estimated one. We further apply the method to estimate the cluster member contamination for the DES Y1 redMaPPer cluster mass calibration analysis, and compare the results to an alternative approach based on the angular correlation of weak lensing source galaxies. We find indications that the correlation based estimates are biased by the selection of the weak lensing sources in the cluster vicinity, which does not strongly impact the P(z) decomposition method. Collectively, these benchmarks demonstrate the strength of the P(z) decomposition method in alleviating membership contamination and enabling highly accurate cluster weak lensing studies without broad exclusion of source galaxies, thereby improving the total constraining power of cluster mass calibration via weak lensing.

MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planets and satellites: rings; planets and satellites: surfaces	SELF-GRAVITY WAKES; MAIN RINGS; STELLAR OCCULTATIONS; SOLAR-SYSTEM; PHASE CURVES; THERMAL OBSERVATIONS; RESONANCE STRUCTURES; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; RADIO OCCULTATION; EFFECT MORPHOLOGY	We focus on the thermal and optical opposition effects of Saturn's C ring seen by Cassini CIRS (Composite InfraRed Spectrometer) at 15.7 mu m and ISS (Imaging Science Subsystem) at 0.6 mu m. The opposition surge is a brightness peak observed at low phase angle (alpha -> 0 degrees). Saturn rings' opposition surge was recently observed in reflected light and thermal infrared emission by Cassini. There is debate on whether the C ring's thermal opposition surge width is narrow (less than or similar to 1 degrees) or broad (greater than or similar to 30 degrees). This surge is important because its width was used to define the scale of ring properties driving the thermal peak. We parametrize the CIRS and ISS phase curves with several morphological models to fit the surge shape. For five of the largest C ring's plateaus, we find that their thermal surge is 10 times wider than the optical surge and that the thermal surge width (similar to 4 degrees) is neither narrow, nor broad. We compare radial differences between CIRS and ISS surge morphologies with the optical depth tau (from UVIS, UltraViolet Imaging Spectrograph) and water ice band depth (from VIMS, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) profiles. We find that: water ice band depths (microscopic ring signatures) and tau (macroscopic ring signatures) show respectively little and large contrasts between the background and the plateaus. The thermal surge amplitude and tau are correlated, and we found no band depth dependence, contrary to the optical surge amplitude, which shows no correlation with tau. These correlations suggest a macroscopic scale dominance in controlling the C ring's thermal opposition effect.

DES Collaboration	Producing a BOSS CMASS sample with DES imaging	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; techniques: photometric; galaxies: general	OSCILLATION SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; DARK ENERGY SURVEY; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; CROSS-CORRELATIONS; SDSS; CFHTLENS; CONSTRAINTS; CALIBRATION	We present a sample of galaxies with theDark Energy Survey (DES) photometry that replicates the properties of the BOSS CMASS sample. The CMASS galaxy sample has been well characterized by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collaboration and was used to obtain the most powerful redshift-space galaxy clustering measurements to date. A joint analysis of redshift-space distortions (such as those probed by CMASS from SDSS) and a galaxy-galaxy lensing measurement for an equivalent sample from DES can provide powerful cosmological constraints. Unfortunately, the DES and SDSS-BOSS footprints have only minimal overlap, primarily on the celestial equator near the SDSS Stripe 82 region. Using this overlap, we build a robust Bayesian model to select CMASS-like galaxies in the remainder of the DES footprint. The newly defined DES-CMASS (DMASS) sample consists of 117 293 effective galaxies covering 1244 deg(2). Through various validation tests, we show that the DMASS sample selected by this model matches well with the BOSS CMASS sample, specifically in the South Galactic cap (SGC) region that includes Stripe 82. Combining measurements of the angular correlation function and the clustering-z distribution of DMASS, we constrain the difference in mean galaxy bias and mean redshift between the BOSS CMASS and DMASS samples to be Delta b = 0.010(-0.052)(+0.045) and Delta z = (3.46(-5.55)(+5.48)) x 10(-3) for the SGC portion of CMASS, and Delta b = 0.044(-0.043)(+0.044) and Delta z = (3.51(-5.91)(+4.93)) x 10(-3) for the full CMASS sample. These values indicate that the mean bias of galaxies and mean redshift in the DMASS sample are consistent with both CMASS samples within 1 sigma.	[Lee, S.; Ross, A.

Tropospheric corrections for InSAR: Statistical assessments and applications to the Central United States and Mexico	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						InSAR; Atmosphere; Tropospheric noise; Corrections; weather models; GACOS; GPS; MODIS; elevation dependence	SATELLITE RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; W 5.8 PAWNEE; SURFACE DEFORMATION; EARTHQUAKE; SUBSIDENCE; OKLAHOMA; MODEL; DISPLACEMENT; SCATTERERS; MITIGATION	The rapid expansion of SAR data availability and advancements in InSAR processing methods has enabled the formation of ground displacement time series for many parts of the world where such research was previously hindered by decorrelation due to sparse temporal sampling and SAR operating frequency. In particular, free and open data access from the European Sentinel-1 constellation and the future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission is encouraging the global community to move towards automated, cloud-based processing that can accommodate these rapidly growing data volumes and facilitate the use of a suite of corrections to the data. A key challenge is related to path delays introduced when the radar signal propagates through the troposphere. Tropospheric corrections estimated from empirical, phase-based methods and those using independent data from weather models, GPS, and radiometers have been included in open-source packages such as TRAIN, PyAPS and GACOS. Users within the InSAR community have reported varying degrees of success using these methods in a range of areas around the world. However, the various statistical metrics used to evaluate the reliability of tropospheric corrections are not consistently applied and often depend on the area and the spatial scale over which they are evaluated. Examination of a simple metric such as the overall reduction in phase variability within an interferogram does not allow the user to determine whether the improvement was at large or short length scales. We present a review of existing tropospheric correction methods and statistical performance metrics, providing guidelines for global assessment and verification of the efficacy of tropospheric correction methods. We summarize the assumptions and limitations for each correction method as well as each statistical performance metric. We examine two regions with different atmospheric characteristics - one Sentinel-1 swath covering the central United States and one swath covering south central Mexico, including part of the Pacific coast. As the SAR community moves towards reliance on global and automated InSAR processing platforms that incorporate tropospheric corrections, approaches such as those examined here can aid researchers in their efforts to evaluate such corrections and include their uncertainties in derived products such as surface displacement time series, coseismic offsets, processes that correlate with topography, and signals with smaller magnitude or larger spatial scales such as those associated with small earthquakes, aseismic creep and slow slip events. We found that the GACOS products (leveraging the operational high resolution ECMWF weather model) outperform the other correction methods explored here on average, but this result is highly dependent on location, acquisition time, and data availability. We found spatial structure functions to be most useful for performance assessment because of their ability to convey information about performance at discrete spatial scales.

Optimal estimation of spectral surface reflectance in challenging atmospheres	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Imaging spectroscopy; Atmospheric correction; Remote sensing; Optimal estimation	IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; AEROSOL PROPERTIES; WATER-VAPOR; ALGORITHM; TEMPERATURE; VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL; PROFILES; MISSION; LAND	Optimal Estimation (OE) methods can simultaneously estimate surface and atmospheric properties from remote Visible/Shortwave imaging spectroscopy. Simultaneous solutions can improve retrieval accuracy with principled uncertainty quantification for hypothesis testing. While OE has been validated under benign atmospheric conditions, future global missions will observe environments with high aerosol and water vapor loadings. This work addresses the gap with diverse scenes from NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) India campaign. We refine atmospheric models to represent variable aerosol optical depths and properties. We quantify retrieval accuracy and information content for both reflectance and aerosols over different surface types, comparing results to in situ and remote references. Additionally, we assess uncertainty of maximum a posteriori solutions using linearized estimates as well as sampling-based inversions that more completely characterize posterior uncertainties. Principled uncertainty quantification can combine multiple spacecraft data products while preventing local environmental biases in future global investigations.

Chenmingite, FeCr2O4 in the CaFe2O4-type structure, a shock-induced, high-pressure mineral in the Tissint martian meteorite	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						Chenmingite; FeCr2O4; high-pressure mineral; shock-induced phase; Tissint martian meteorite; shergottite	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SPINEL; INCLUSIONS; DISCOVERY; PROGRAM; EVENT	Chenmingite (FeCr2O4; IMA 2017-036) is a high-pressure mineral, occurring as micrometer- to submicrometer-sized lamellae within precursor chromite grains along with xieite and Fe,Cr-rich ulvospinel next to shock-induced melt pockets, from the Tissint martian meteorite. The composition of type chenmingite by electron probe analysis shows an empirical formula of (Fe0.752+Mg0.23Mn0.02) (Cr1.60Al0.29Fe0.063+Fe0.042+Ti0.02)(Sigma 2.01)O-4. The general and end-member formulas are (Fe,Mg)(Cr,Al)(2)O-4 and FeCr2O4. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals that chenmingite has an orthorhombic Pnma CaFe2O4-type (CF) structure with unit-cell dimensions: a = 9.715(6) angstrom, b = 2.87(1) angstrom, c = 9.49(7) angstrom, V = 264.6(4) A(3), and Z = 4. Both chenmingite and xieite formed by solid-state transformation of precursor chromite under high pressure and high temperature during the Tissint impact event on Mars. The xieite regions are always in contact with melt pockets, whereas chenmingite lamellae only occur within chromite, a few micrometers away from the melt pockets. This arrangement suggests that chenmingite formed under similar pressures as xieite but at lower temperatures, in agreement with experimental studies.

Enabling Martian habitability with silica aerogel via the solid-state greenhouse effect	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							MARS; SURFACE; ICE; SUBSURFACE; CLIMATE; MODEL	The low temperatures(1,)(2) and high ultraviolet radiation levels(3) at the surface of Mars today currently preclude the survival of life anywhere except perhaps in limited subsurface niches(4). Several ideas for making the Martian surface more habitable have been put forwards(5-)(8), but they all involve massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability for the foreseeable futures(9). Here, we present a new approach to this problem. We show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and modelling that under Martian environmental conditions, a 2-3 cm-thick layer of silica aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation and raise temperatures underneath it permanently to above the melting point of water, without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically, starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme environments on Earth today.

Birkeland currents in Jupiter's magnetosphere observed by the polar-orbiting Juno spacecraft	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							AZIMUTHAL MAGNETIC-FIELD; ALIGNED CURRENTS; ACCELERATION; ELECTRON	The exchange of energy and momentum between the Earth's upper atmosphere and ionosphere, and its space environment (magnetosphere) is regulated by electric currents (called Birkeland currents) flowing along magnetic field lines that connect these two regions of space(1). The associated electric currents flow towards and away from each pole primarily in two concentric conical sheets(2) . It has been expected that powerful sheets of magnetic-field-aligned electric currents would be found in association with the bright Jovian auroras(3). The Juno spacecraft is well positioned to explore Jupiter's polar magnetosphere and sample Birkeland or field-aligned currents and particle distributions. Since July 2016, Juno has maintained a near-polar orbit, passing over both polar regions every 53 days. From this vantage point, Juno's complement of science instruments gathers in situ observations of magnetospheric particles and fields while its remote-sensing infrared and ultraviolet spectrographs and imagers map auroral emissions(4). Here we present an extensive analysis of magnetic field perturbations measured during Juno's transits of Jupiter's polar regions, and thereby demonstrate Birkeland currents associated with Jupiter's auroral emissions. We characterize the magnitude and spatial extent of the currents and we find that they are weaker than anticipated and filamentary in nature. A significant asymmetry is observed between the field perturbations and the current associated with the northern and the southern auroras.	[Kotsiaros, Stavros; Connerney, John E.

This study documents cloud structure, precipitation frequency and intensity, and atmospheric stability for each flight during both field experiments. A larger cloud fraction was estimated for 2016, likely due to a larger estimated inversion strength (EIS) in the experiment area (between 6 and 10 K) compared to 2017 where EIS was on average 4-6 K lower. We used an optimal estimation retrieval to derive precipitation rates for all measurable clouds during both experiments. Over 30% of clouds observed during the 2016 experiment exhibited precipitation reaching the surface, but retrieved drizzle rates were below 0.01 mm h(-1) in all but 40% of these profiles. This is in sharp contrast to the 2017 campaign where over 53% of precipitating profiles had rainfall rates larger than 0.01 mm h(-1). The differences in cloud and rain fractions between the two years are most likely due to differences in the sampling environments; however, enough variations in cloud, virga, and rain fraction exist for similar environmental conditions such that additional analysis of cloud and aerosol interactions-specifically their effect on precipitation processes-needs further exploration. The extensive APR-3 sampling of drizzling stratocumulus under similar thermodynamic conditions provides a rich dataset for examining the influence of biomass burning aerosols on cloud fraction, morphology, and precipitation characteristics in this climatically important region.

Dome formation on Ceres by solid-state flow analogous to terrestrial salt tectonics	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; GROUND ICE; CRATER	The dwarf planet Ceres's outer crust is a complex, heterogeneous mixture of ice, clathrates, salts and silicates. Numerous large domes on Ceres's surface indicate a degree of geological activity. These domes have been attributed to cryovolcanism, but that is difficult to reconcile with Ceres's small size and lack of long-lived heat sources. Here we alternatively propose that Ceres's domes form by solid-state flow within the compositionally heterogeneous crust, a mechanism directly analogous to salt tectonics on Earth. We use numerical simulations to illustrate that differential loading of a crust with compositional heterogeneity on a scale of tens of kilometres can produce dome-like features of scale similar to those observed. The mechanism requires the presence of low-viscosity and low-density, possibly ice-rich, material in the upper 1-10 km of the subsurface. Such substantial regional heterogeneity in Ceres's crustal composition is consistent with observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dawn mission. We conclude that deformation analogous to that in terrestrial salt tectonics is a viable alternative explanation for the observed surface morphologies, and is consistent with Ceres being both cold and geologically active.

Here, we constrain the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon sink to eCO(2) over the temperate Northern Hemisphere for the past five decades, using 12 terrestrial ecosystem models and data from seven CO2 enrichment experiments. This constraint uses the heuristic finding that the northern temperate carbon sink sensitivity to eCO(2) is linearly related to the site-scale sensitivity across the models. The emerging data-constrained eCO(2) sensitivity is 0.64 +/- 0.28 PgC yr(-1) per hundred ppm of eCO(2). Extrapolating worldwide, this northern temperate sensitivity projects the global terrestrial carbon sink to increase by 3.5 +/- 1.9 PgC yr(-1) for an increase in CO2 of 100 ppm. This value suggests that CO2 fertilization alone explains most of the observed increase in global land carbon sink since the 1960s. More CO2 enrichment experiments, particularly in boreal, arctic and tropical ecosystems, are required to explain further the responsible processes.

From Scattered-light to Millimeter Emission: A Comprehensive View of the Gigayear-old System of HD 202628 and its Eccentric Debris Ring	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; planetary systems	CA-II H; SATURNS RINGS; BOLOMETRIC CORRECTIONS; EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURES; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; GIANT PLANETS; NEARBY STARS; COOL STARS; ORIGIN	We present here new observations of the eccentric debris ring surrounding the Gyr-old solar-type star HD 202628: at millimeter wavelengths with ALMA, at far-infrared wavelengths with Herschel, and in scattered light with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The ring inner edge is found to be consistent between ALMA and HST data. As radiation pressure affects small grains seen in scattered-light, the ring appears broader at optical than at millimeter wavelengths. The best fit to the ring seen with ALMA has inner and outer edges at 143.1 +/- 1.7 au and 165.5 +/- 1.4, respectively, and an inclination of 57 degrees.4 +/- 0.4 from face-on. The offset of the ring center of symmetry from the star allows us to quantify its eccentricity to be e = 0.09(-0.01)(+0.02). This eccentric feature is also detected in low resolution Herschel/PACS observations, under the form of a pericenter-glow. Combining the infrared and millimeter photometry, we retrieve a disk grain size distribution index of similar to-3.4, and therefore exclude in situ formation of the inferred belt-shaping perturber, for which we provide new dynamical constraints. Finally, ALMA images show four point-like sources that exceed 100 mu Jy, one of them being just interior to the ring. Although the presence of a background object cannot be excluded, we cannot exclude either that this source is circumplanetary material surrounding the belt-shaper, in which case degeneracies between its mass and orbital parameters could be lifted, allowing us to fully characterize such a distant planet in this mass and age regime for the very first time.

Our observations, probing below the ammonia cloud deck, show that the erupting plumes in the South Equatorial Belt bring up ammonia gas from the deep atmosphere. While models of plume eruptions that are triggered at the water condensation level explain data taken at uv-visible and mid-infrared wavelengths, our ALMA observations provide a crucial, hitherto missing, link in the moist convection theory by showing that ammonia gas from the deep atmosphere is indeed brought up in these plumes. Contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope data show that the plumes reach altitudes as high as the tropopause. We suggest that the plumes at 22 degrees.2-23 degrees.0N also rise up well above the ammonia cloud deck and that descending air may dry the neighboring belts even more than in quiescent times, which would explain our observations in the north.

While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. As a result of vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difficult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99% and 94% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in Wotan, an open-source Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/hippke/wotan).

A systems approach to routing global gridded runoff through local high-resolution stream networks for flood early warning systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Grid-to-vector mapping; RAPID; Vector-based river routing; Streamflow prediction; Flood early warning system	LAND-SURFACE; MODELS; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; PREDICTION; EVOLUTION; SCHEMES; GLOFAS	Global or national scale flood early warning systems (FEWS) can benefit developing countries and ungauged regions that lack observational data, computational infrastructure, and/or the human capacity for streamflow modelling. Existing land surface models (LSM) typically generate forecasts using coarse resolution grid cells which, at least for streamflow, have little value when used for flood warning at local scales. We present the design and development of a new automated computational system, using existing, well-established open source software tools that quickly downscales (or maps) the runoff generated from such coarse grid-based LSMs onto high-resolution vector-based stream networks then routes the results using a vector-based river routing model. We conducted experiments using the ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data - a 35-year retrospective gridded runoff data product from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) - to assess our fast downscaling system. The accuracy of our approach is comparable to the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) - a well-established gridded routing model using the same forcings - but our method provides streamflow predictions on significantly higher resolution stream networks. We found that the river network resolution has negligible effect on the simulated streamflow with our model routing. In other words, we can forecast streamflow for very small stream segments and potentially improve local flood awareness and response much more successfully than previously possible using readily available climate forcings from LSMs.	[Qiao, Xiaohui; Nelson, E.

DES Collaboration	Methods for cluster cosmology and application to the SDSS in preparation for DES Year 1 release	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	HALO MASS FUNCTION; BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; LARGE-SCALE BIAS; OCCUPATION DISTRIBUTION; PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; SHEAR CALIBRATION; GALAXY CLUSTERS; POWER-SPECTRUM; JOINT ANALYSIS; ASSEMBLY BIAS	We implement the first blind analysis of cluster abundance data to derive cosmological constraints from the abundance and weak lensing signal of redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We simultaneously fit for cosmological parameters and the richness-mass relation of the clusters. For a flat Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model with massive neutrinos, we find . This value is both consistent and competitive with that derived from cluster catalogues selected in different wavelengths. Our result is also consistent with the combined probes analyses by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies as measured by Planck. We demonstrate that the cosmological posteriors are robust against variation of the richness-mass relation model and to systematics associated with the calibration of the selection function. In combination with baryon acoustic oscillation data and big bang nucleosynthesis data (Cooke etal.), we constrain the Hubble rate to be h= 0.66 +/- 0.02, independent of the CMB. Future work aimed at improving our understanding of the scatter of the richness-mass relation has the potential to significantly improve the precision of our cosmological posteriors. The methods described in this work were developed for use in the forthcoming analysis of cluster abundances in the DES. Our SDSS analysis constitutes the first part of a staged-unblinding analysis of the full DES data set.

Quantifying the power spectrum of small-scale structure in semi-analytic galaxies	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; galaxies: structure; dark matter	DARK-MATTER SUBSTRUCTURE; EDGE-ON DISC; IDENTIFYING LENSES; REIONIZATION; STATISTICS; SATELLITES; ABUNDANCE; MODELS; SHARP	In the cold dark matter (CDM) picture of structure formation, galaxy mass distributions are predicted to have a considerable amount of structure on small scales. Strong gravitational lensing has proven to be a useful tool for studying this small-scale structure. Much of the attention has been given to detecting individual dark matter subhaloes through lens modelling, but recent work has suggested that the full population of subhaloes could be probed using a power spectrum analysis. In this paper, we quantify the power spectrum of small-scale structure in simulated galaxies, with the goal of understanding theoretical predictions and setting the stage for using measurements of the power spectrum to test dark matter models. We use a sample of simulated galaxies generated from the galacticus semi-analytic model to determine the power spectrum distribution first in the CDM paradigm and then in a warm dark matter scenario. We find that a measurement of the slope and amplitude of the power spectrum on galaxy strong lensing scales (k similar to 1kpc(-1)) could be used to distinguish between CDM and alternate dark matter models, especially if the most massive subhaloes can be directly detected via gravitational imaging.

From greenhouse to icehouse: Nitrogen biogeochemistry of an epeiric sea in the context of the oxygenation of the Late Devonian atmosphere/ocean system	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Nitrogen isotopes; Carbon isotopes; Nitrification; Biogeochemical cycles; Ocean acidification; Climate	CENTRAL APPALACHIAN BASIN; ISOTOPE RATIOS; MISSISSIPPIAN BLACK; NITRIFICATION RATES; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CARBON ISOTOPES; EARLY EVOLUTION; ORGANIC-MATTER; REDOX CONTROL; LAND PLANTS	The Late Devonian emergence of extensive arborescent terrestrial ecosystems produced changes in the Earth's atmosphere and climate that resulted in substantial changes to the biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems. The biogeochemistry of nitrogen in epeiric seas was particularly susceptible to alteration because of its dependence upon the series of redox-mediated reactions that comprise the marine N cycle. In order to explore the impact of climate change on N biogeochemistry in a Late Devonian epeiric sea, we sampled a core from the Appalachian Basin that spans the interval from the greenhouse climate at the base of the Famennian period to glacial conditions near its conclusion. Based upon stable isotope analysis of N, C, and S as well as elemental analysis of N, C, P, S, and Fe, we contend that two distinct biogeochemical regimes obtained during the contrasting climates. The greenhouse regime featured low seawater O-2 and pH that served to significantly curtail the oxidation of ammonia - i.e. nitrification - resulting in an ammonium-dominated water column and low sediment delta N-15 values. The greenhouse also featured more extensive recycling of C, N, and P. In contrast, the higher seawater O-2 and pH of the icehouse regime permitted nitrification in the water column resulting in a nitrate-dominated system and higher sediment delta N-15 values. We conclude that nitrification was the key component of the N cycle that differentiated the two climate/biogeochemical regimes.

However, accurately estimating epidemiological factors leading up to depression has remained challenging. Deep-learning algorithms can be applied to assess the factors leading up to prevalence and clinical manifestations of depression. Methods: Customized deep-neural-network and machine-learning classifiers were assessed using survey data from 19,725 participants from the NHANES database (from 1999 through 2014) and 4949 from the South Korea NHANES (K-NHANES) database in 2014. Results: A deep-learning algorithm showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91 and 0.89 for detecting depression in NHANES and K-NHANES, respectively. The deep-learning algorithm trained with serial datasets (NHANES, from 1999 to 2012), predicted the prevalence of depression in the following two years of data (NHANES, 2013 and 2014) with an AUC of 0.92. Machine learning classifiers trained with NHANES could further predict depression in K-NHANES. There, logistic regression had the highest performance (AUC, 0.77) followed by deep learning algorithm (AUC, 0.74). Conclusions: Deep neural-networks managed to identify depression well from other health and demographic factors in both the NHANES and K-NHANES datasets. The deep-learning algorithm was also able to predict depression relatively well on new data set-cross temporally and cross nationally. Further research can delineate the clinical implications of machine learning and deep learning in detecting disease prevalence and progress as well as other risk factors for depression and other mental illnesses.

The majority of future Mars rovers would be solar-powered, which would require energy-optimal driving to maximize the range with limited energy. The essential and arguably the most challenging technology for realizing energy-optimal driving is the capability to predict the driving energy, which is needed to construct an energy-aware cost function for path planning. In this letter, we propose vision-based algorithms to remotely predict the driving energy consumption using machine learning. Specifically, we develop and compare two machine-learning models in this letter, namely VeeGer-Energy Net and Veeger-TerramechanicsNet, respectively. The former is trained directly using recorded power, while the latter estimates terrain parameters from the images using a simplified-terramechanics model, and calculate the power based on the model. The two approaches are fully automated self-supervised learning algorithms. To combine RGB and depth images efficiently with high accuracy, we propose a new network architecture called Two-PNASNet-5, which is based on PNASNet-5. We collected a new dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Comparison of the two approaches showed that Veeger-TerramechanicsNet had better performance than VeeGer-EnergyNet.

MGS TES observations of the water vapor in the martian southern polar atmosphere during spring and summer	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Mars, atmosphere; Mars, polar caps; Mars, climate; Atmospheres, dynamics	THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SEASONAL CYCLE; ICE CAP; MARS; SURFACE; TEMPERATURES; SUBLIMATION; EVOLUTION; MODEL	We report retrievals of atmospheric water vapor abundances in and around the South Polar Region (SPR) of Mars during spring and summer of Mars Years (MY) 24-26 (1999-2003). The retrieval utilizes infrared spectra collected by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft. Modifications to the existing retrieval algorithm enable the first retrievals of water vapor abundances over regions covered by the seasonal CO2 frost during spring. We present polar maps of water vapor variability in the SPR for the time periods L-s = 195 degrees-345 degrees in MY24-26. Water vapor behavior in the SPR in MY24 and MY26 exhibits substantial similarity in spatial distribution for the same dates and in temporal variability. Water vapor behavior in MY25 is significantly different from that in MY24 and MY26 with abundances similar to 30% lower around summer solstice (L-s, = 270 degrees). We hypothesize that water vapor behavior in MY25 was affected by the Global Dust Storm (GDS) that started at L-s similar to 185 degrees of that year and significantly affected the atmosphere of the whole planet. We speculate that the reduction in the observed vapor abundances in MY25 could have resulted from disruption of the southward atmospheric vapor transport from mid-latitudes by the GDS or from reduction of the rate of desorption of vapor from thawed circumpolar terrains due to changes in surface temperature during the GDS. Through most of the spring, highest vapor abundances are observed just northward of the retreating edge of the seasonal CO2 cap, with generally low abundances over the seasonal cap. Repeated cycles of condensation and re-sublimation of water vapor on the edge of the retreating cap could be responsible for this build-up of vapor near the cap edge. Relatively high vapor abundances that are systematically observed over some regions of the cap in late spring could be associated with venting of the mixture of water vapor, CO2 gas and dust from underneath the seasonal cap through fractures in the frost. We explore the evolution of the water vapor in the SPR during spring and summer using two 1-dimenional models representing two limiting cases that attribute observed changes to either atmospheric transport or surface sources. The atmospheric transport model appears to be more consistent with observations, suggesting that atmospheric transport plays the dominant role in the water vapor cycle in the SPR. However, activity of surface processes such as desorption of vapor from the regolith cannot be excluded. Comparison of the water vapor cycle during spring and summer in the SPR and the Northern Polar Region (NPR) shows that, besides the difference in the highest observed abundances, the evolution of the vapor abundances shows remarkable qualitative similarity, despite the presence of a large source of vapor during summer in the north in the form of the North Polar Residual Cap (NPRC). This suggests that the processes shaping the water cycle in the polar regions are similar in nature and differ only in strength. The new data on water vapor in the SPR, together with our previous retrievals of water vapor in the NPR, constitute a new dataset that enables testing of Martian Global Circulation Models close to the planet's poles, and enables better understanding of the difference between the Martian polar regions.

Latitudinal variation in the abundance of methane (CH4) above the clouds in Neptune's atmosphere from VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode Observations	ICARUS			English	Article						Neptune; Neptune; Atmosphere; Atmospheres; Composition	INDUCED INFRARED-SPECTRA; IRTF/SPEX OBSERVATIONS; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; H-2-HE PAIRS; URANUS; TEMPERATURES; SCATTERING; ABSORPTION; RETRIEVAL; HYDROGEN	Observations of Neptune, made in 2018 using the new Narrow Field Adaptive Optics mode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) from 0,48 to 0.93 mu m, are analysed here to determine the latitudinal and vertical distribution of cloud opacity and methane abundance in Neptune's observable troposphere (0.1-similar to 3bar). Previous observations at these wavelengths in 2003 by HST/STIS (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011, Icarus 205, 674-694) found that the mole fraction of methane above the cloud tops (at similar to 2 bar) varied from similar to 4% at equatorial latitudes to similar to 2% at southern polar latitudes, by comparing the observed reflectivity at wavelengths near 825 nm controlled primarily by either methane absorption or H-2-H-2/H-2 He collision-induced absorption. We find a similar variation in cloud-top methane abundance in 2018, which suggests that this depletion of methane towards Neptune's pole is potentially a long-lived feature, indicative of long-term upwelling at mid-equatorial latitudes and subsidence near the poles. By analysing these MUSE observations along the central meridian with a retrieval model, we demonstrate that a broad boundary between the nominal and depleted methane abundances occurs at between 20 and 40 degrees S. We also find a small depletion of methane near the equator, perhaps indicating subsidence there, and a local enhancement near 60-70 degrees S, which we suggest may be associated with South Polar Features (SPFs) seen in Neptune's atmosphere at these latitudes. Finally, by the use of both a reflectivity analysis and a principal component analysis, we demonstrate that this depletion of methane towards the pole is apparent at all locations on Neptune's disc, and not just along its central meridian.

Sharp as the first planetary rover to collect and analyze rock and regolith samples. On this new mission, sampling operations were conceived to be executed serially and in situ, on a "sample chain" along which sample would be collected, then processed, then delivered to sample analysis instruments, analyzed there, and then discarded so the chain could be repeated. This paper describes the evolution of this relatively simple chain into a richer sampling network, responding to science and engineering desires that came into focus only as the mission matured, scientific discoveries were made, and anomalies were encountered. The rover flight and ground system architectures retained significant heritage from past missions, while extending capabilities in anticipation of the need for adaptation. As evolution occurred, the architecture permitted nimble extension of sampling behavior without time-consuming flight software updates or significant impact to daily operations. This paper presents the major components of this architecture and discusses some of the results of successful adaptation across thousands of Sols of Mars operations.

This study estimates. using carbon monoxide (CO) measurements jointly from the Microwave Limb Sounder and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer onboard the Aura satellite, associated with deep convective cases identified by CloudSat and CALIPSO observations. CO is treated as a conserved quantity over convective transport time scales, and a simple entraining-plume model is used to derive entrainment rates. The relationships of the observational estimates of lambda as a function of convective height, environmental relative humidity, and convective available potential energy (CAPE) derived from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder data are compared with those from Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS-5) simulations. Bulk statistics of lambda show that the values of lambda are predominately below 20%/km for deep convection and the occurrence frequency of any lambda decreases with increasing lambda. Composite lambda values are generally lower in the tropics compared to northern midlatitudes in both observations and the GEOS-5 model. A decrease of lambda with increasing convective height is found in both observations and model simulations. We also find that lambda tends to decrease with increasing CAPE in the observation-based lambda s and plume-based GEOS-5 lambda s, although the model given lambda s have a nonmonotonic relation with CAPE. The observed lambda s have a weak relation with lower-to-middle tropospheric relative humidity, while both GEOS-5 plume-based and given lambda increase with increasing relative humidity.

The IVS Working Group on Galactic Aberration (WG8) was established to investigate issues related to incorporating the effect of Galactic aberration in IVS analysis. The circular motion of the solar system barycenter around the Galactic center causes a change in aberration, which in the case of geodetic VLBI observing is over time scales of several decades. One of the specific goals was to recommend a Galactic aberration model to be applied by the IAU ICRF3 working group in the generation of ICRF3 as well as in other IVS analysis. Studies made by working group members have shown that the three-dimensional acceleration vector of the solar system barycenter can be estimated from VLBI delay observations. Methods. Among the working group members, three methods were used to estimate the acceleration vector. One is to directly estimate the acceleration vector as a global parameter. The second is to estimate the acceleration vector from source proper motions determined from estimated source position time series. A third method estimated a global reference frame scale parameter for each source and derived the acceleration vector from these estimates. The acceleration vector estimate consists of a galactocentric component along with the non-galactocentric components. Results. The geodetic reference frame VLBI estimates of the galactocentric aberration constant from the different working group members are in the range 5.1-6.4 mu as yr(-1). These estimates are relatively close to independent estimates of 4.8-5.4 mu as yr(-1) that can be derived from astrometric measurements of proper motions and parallaxes of masers in the Milky Way galaxy. Based on the most recent geodetic VLBI solutions, we find an upper bound of 0.8 mu as yr(-1) for the non-galactocentric component of the secular aberration. Conclusions. The working group made a recommendation only for the galactocentric component of the observed acceleration vector. For the recommended galactocentric aberration constant, the working group chose a geodetic value to be consistent with geodetic VLBI applications. The recommended value 5.8 mu as yr(-1) was estimated directly in a global solution that used the ICRF3 solution data set: 1979-May 2018.	[MacMillan, D. S.; Gipson, J.

The biomass production efficiency (BPE), defined as the ratio of BP to photosynthesis, and its variation across and within vegetation types is poorly understood, which hinders our capacity to accurately estimate carbon turnover times and carbon sinks. Here, we present a new global estimation of BPE obtained by combining field measurements from 113 sites with 14 carbon cycle models. Our best estimate of global BPE is 0.41 +/- 0.05, excluding cropland. The largest BPE is found in boreal forests (0.48 +/- 0.06) and the lowest in tropical forests (0.40 +/- 0.04). Carbon cycle models overestimate BPE, although models with carbon-nitrogen interactions tend to be more realistic. Using observation-based estimates of global photosynthesis, we quantify the global BP of non-cropland ecosystems of 41 +/- 6 Pg C/year. This flux is less than net primary production as it does not contain carbon allocated to symbionts, used for exudates or volatile carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere. Our study reveals a positive bias of 24 +/- 11% in the model-estimated BP (10 of 14 models). When correcting models for this bias while leaving modeled carbon turnover times unchanged, we found that the global ecosystem carbon storage change during the last century is decreased by 67% (or 58 Pg C).

Application usability levels: a framework for tracking project product progress	JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE			English	Article						Tracking Progress; Metrics and Validation; Applied Space Weather	COMMUNITY-WIDE VALIDATION; SUPPORT MODEL TRANSITION; LOW-ENERGY ELECTRONS; DATA ASSIMILATION; TECHNOLOGY READINESS; IONOSPHERIC ELECTRODYNAMICS; RADIATION BELT; TRANSPORT; PREDICTIONS; PERFORMANCE	The space physics community continues to grow and become both more interdisciplinary and more intertwined with commercial and government operations. This has created a need for a framework to easily identify what projects can be used for specific applications and how close the tool is to routine autonomous or on-demand implementation and operation. We propose the Application Usability Level (AUL) framework and publicizing AULs to help the community quantify the progress of successful applications, metrics, and validation efforts. This framework will also aid the scientific community by supplying the type of information needed to build off of previously published work and publicizing the applications and requirements needed by the user communities. In this paper, we define the AUL framework, outline the milestones required for progression to higher AULs, and provide example projects utilizing the AUL framework. This work has been completed as part of the activities of the Assessment of Understanding and Quantifying Progress working group which is part of the International Forum for Space Weather Capabilities Assessment.

Herschel map of Saturn's stratospheric water, delivered by the plumes of Enceladus	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planets and satellites: individual: Saturn; planets and satellites: individual: Enceladus; planets and satellites: atmospheres	ROTOTRANSLATIONAL ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; CARBON-MONOXIDE; GIANT PLANETS; MERIDIONAL DISTRIBUTION; MILLIMETER WAVELENGTHS; EQUATORIAL OSCILLATION; SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE; TITANS ATMOSPHERE; CIRS/CASSINI LIMB; JUPITER	Context. The origin of water in the stratospheres of giant planets has been an outstanding question ever since its first detection by the Infrared Space Observatory some 20 years ago. Water can originate from interplanetary dust particles, icy rings and satellites, and large comet impacts. Analyses of Herschel Space Observatory observations have proven that the bulk of Jupiter's stratospheric water was delivered by the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts in 1994. In 2006, the Cassini mission detected water plumes at the South Pole of Enceladus, which made the moon a serious candidate for Saturn's stratospheric water. Further evidence was found in 2011 when Herschel demonstrated the presence of a water torus at the orbital distance of Enceladus that was fed by the moon's plumes. Finally, water falling from the rings onto Saturn's uppermost atmospheric layers at low latitudes was detected during the final orbits of Cassini's end-of-mission plunge into the atmosphere. Aims. In this paper, we use Herschel mapping observations of water in Saturn's stratosphere to identify its source. Methods. We tested several empirical models against the Herschel-HIFI and -PACS observations, which were collected on December 30, 2010, and January 2, 2011, respectively. Results. We demonstrate that Saturn's stratospheric water is not uniformly mixed as a function of latitude, but peaks at the equator and decreases poleward with a Gaussian distribution. We obtain our best fit with an equatorial mole fraction 1.1 ppb and a half width at half maximum of 25 degrees, when accounting for a temperature increase in the two warm stratospheric vortices produced by Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011. Conclusions. This work demonstrates that Enceladus is the main source of Saturn's stratospheric water.

The Texas Soil Observation Network: A Comprehensive Soil Moisture Dataset for Remote Sensing and Land Surface Model Validation	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							L-BAND; MONITORING NETWORK; PRODUCT; SIZE; STABILITY; WATER; TIME; SASKATCHEWAN; CALIBRATION; RESOLUTION	The spatiotemporal variability of soil water content (SWC) at the remote sensing scale requires dense monitoring for calibration and validation. Here, we present an overview of the Texas Soil Observation Network (TxSON), an intensively monitored area in the semiarid rangelands of the central Texas Hill Country. TxSON is a dense network consisting of 40 in situ locations nested at 36, 9, and 3 km within the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid and serves as a Core Calibration and Validation Site for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The 4-yr dataset consists of hourly SWC measured at 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm. The SWC data are upscaled using arithmetic, Voronoi, and inverse distance weighting for 36-, (2) 9-, and (5) 3-km grid cells. We present the site selection, environmental characteristics, network design, quality assurance (QA), upscaling algorithms, and data structure. Ancillary data include bulk density, particle size, and carbon content for each site and depth. We also provide automated QA for each location and scripts to use our binary flagging in upscaling methods. To summarize, the 36-km grid cell has a mean bulk density of 1.34 +/- 0.18 g cm(-3) and a loam textural class. The in situ SWC has a root mean square error of 0.029 m(3) m(-3) against gravimetric data from 14 field campaigns. TxSON continues to add new locations with additional dense networks planned in other ecotones of the Edwards Plateau. The time series data along with scripts to import, plot, and upscaled SWC are available at https:// doi .org/10.18738/T8/JJ16CF.

The purpose of this paper is to review the findings of the SCATSAT-1 CalVal team regarding the stability and performance of version 1.1.3 of the SCATSAT-1 data. The international CalVal team organized by ISRO included participants from various institutions in India, ISRO's Space Applications Centre, KNMI from the Netherlands, and from the USA, NOAA, and NASA's JPL. To perform the evaluation, different centres processed the data independently using heritage processors and made comparisons against NASA's Ku-band QuikSCAT mission, in situ data, and NWP models. We also provide a preliminary assessment of the impact of the SCATSAT-1 data on operational forecasts in India and Europe. We conclude that the SCATSAT-1 data shows significantly improved performance relative to ISRO's OSCAT-1 on Oceansat-2, and that the instrument seems to be stable, given the limited period of observation. The CalVal team has also identified features in the data that could benefit from calibration and processing changes, potentially leading to further improvements on data quality.

Here we report a recent slow slip event on the southern San Andreas fault triggered by the 2017 M(w)8.2 Chiapas (Mexico) earthquake that occurred 3,000 km away. Geodetic and geologic observations indicate that surface slip on the order of 10 mm occurred on a 40-km-long section of the southern San Andreas fault between the Mecca Hills and Bombay Beach, starting minutes after the Chiapas earthquake and continuing for more than a year. Both the magnitude and the depth extent of creep vary along strike. We derive a high-resolution map of surface displacements by combining Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar acquisitions from different lines of sight. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar-derived displacements are in good agreement with the creepmeter data and field mapping of surface offsets. Inversions of surface displacement data using dislocation models indicate that the highest amplitudes of surface slip are associated with shallow (<1 km) transient slip. We performed 2-D simulations of shallow creep on a strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction to constrain frictional properties of the top few kilometers of the upper crust that can produce the observed behavior.

Spatially resolved spectroscopy of the debris disk HD 32297 Further evidence of small dust grains	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						techniques: image processing; stars: individual: HD 32297; techniques: high angular resolution; methods: data analysis; infrared: planetary systems	GAS; EVOLUTION; PROFILES; MODEL; SHARP	Context. Spectro-photometry of debris disks in total intensity and polarimetry can provide new insight into the properties of the dust grains therein (size distribution and optical properties). Aims. We aim to constrain the morphology of the highly inclined debris disk HD 32297. We also intend to obtain spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements to retrieve information on the particle size distribution within the disk for certain grain compositions. Methods. We observed HD 32297 with SPHERE in Y, J, and H bands in total intensity and in J band in polarimetry. The observations are compared to synthetic models of debris disks and we developed methods to extract the photometry in total intensity overcoming the data-reduction artifacts, namely the self-subtraction. The spectro-photometric measurements averaged along the disk mid-plane are then compared to model spectra of various grain compositions. Results. These new images reveal the very inner part of the system as close as 0.15 ''. The disk image is mostly dominated by the forward scattering making one side (half-ellipse) of the disk more visible, but observations in total intensity are deep enough to also detect the back side for the very first time. The images as well as the surface brightness profiles of the disk rule out the presence of a gap as previously proposed. We do not detect any significant asymmetry between the northeast and southwest sides of the disk. The spectral reflectance features a "gray to blue" color which is interpreted as the presence of grains far below the blowout size. Conclusions. The presence of sub-micron grains in the disk is suspected to be the result of gas drag and/or "avalanche mechanisms". The blue color of the disk could be further investigated with additional total intensity and polarimetric observations in K and H bands respectively to confirm the spectral slope and the fraction of polarization.

We focus on technology development during the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) project sponsored by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) and coincident studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Projects, Planning, and Analysis (OPPA). The CIRAS approach incorporates key instrument technologies, developed at the Microdevices Lab (MDL) at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), including a two-dimensional array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise, and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The second key technology is a mid-wavelength infrared grating spectrometer designed by Ball Aerospace with a JPL MDL slit and immersion grating to provide hyperspectral infrared imaging in a CubeSat volume. The third key technology is a blackbody calibration target fabricated with MDL' s black silicon to have very high emissivity in a flat plate construction. JPL has completed design and breadboard of the mechanical, electronic, and thermal subsystems for the CIRAS payload including a HOT-BIRD focal plane assembly, with filters in a dewar and a breadboard of the electronics and scan mirror assembly. Blue Canyon Technologies, developer of the CIRAS 6U CubeSat, completed the Final Design Review for the spacecraft. NOAA is sponsoring the continued development of the CIRAS Proto-Flight Model (PFM) instrument at JPL using many of the existing subsystems. Completion of the PFM is expected in mid 2021, with launch no earlier than 2022.

Identification of key parameters controlling demographically structured vegetation dynamics in a land surface model: CLM4.5(FATES)	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CARBON-CYCLE FEEDBACKS; EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; HYDROLOGY PARAMETERIZATION; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; PART I; UNCERTAINTIES; FRAMEWORK; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SIMULATION	Vegetation plays an important role in regulating global carbon cycles and is a key component of the Earth system models (ESMs) that aim to project Earth's future climate. In the last decade, the vegetation component within ESMs has witnessed great progress from simple "big-leaf" approaches to demographically structured approaches, which have a better representation of plant size, canopy structure, and disturbances. These demographically structured vegetation models typically have a large number of input parameters, and sensitivity analysis is needed to quantify the impact of each parameter on the model outputs for a better understanding of model behavior. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to diagnose the Community Land Model coupled to the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Simulator, or CLM4.5(FATES). Specifically, we quantified the first-and second-order sensitivities of the model parameters to outputs that represent simulated growth and mortality as well as carbon fluxes and stocks for a tropical site with an extent of 1 x 1 degrees. While the photosynthetic capacity parameter (V-c;max25) is found to be important for simulated carbon stocks and fluxes, we also show the importance of carbon storage and allometry parameters, which determine survival and growth strategies within the model. The parameter sensitivity changes with different sizes of trees and climate conditions. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the next generation of demographically enabled vegetation models within ESMs to improve model parameterization and structure for better model fidelity.

Characterizing the Mineral Assemblages of Hot Spring Environments and Applications to Mars Orbital Data	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Mars; Hot springs; CRISM; Opaline silica; Hydrated silica; Mineral assemblages	TAUPO VOLCANIC ZONE; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; ROCK COATINGS; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; MICROBIAL TEXTURES; NOCTIS LABYRINTHUS; TERRESTRIAL ANALOG; AQUEOUS ACTIVITY; KILAUEA VOLCANO; LOW-TEMPERATURE	Certain martian hydrated silica deposits have been hypothesized to represent ancient hot spring environments, but many environments can produce hydrated silica on Earth. This study compares the mineral assemblages produced in terrestrial hot springs to those observed in silica-producing volcanic fumarolic environments to determine which diagnostic features of hot springs could be remotely sensed on Mars. We find that hot spring environments are more likely to produce geochemically mature silica (i.e., opal-CT and microcrystalline quartz) in addition to opal-A, whereas volcanic fumarolic environments tend to produce only opal-A, potentially reflecting differences in water-to-rock ratios. Neutral/alkaline hot springs contain few accessory minerals (typically calcite and Fe/Mg clays), while acidic hot springs commonly contain accessory kaolinite. By comparison, mineral assemblages at volcanic fumaroles contain protolith igneous minerals and a diversity of alteration minerals indicative of acidic conditions. Based on these terrestrial observations, the presence of opal-CT and/or microcrystalline quartz could be more diagnostic of a hot spring origin rather than a fumarolic origin, and accessory mineralogy could provide information on formation pH. On Mars, we observe that most orbital opal detections in outcrop are opal-A, sometimes accompanied by Fe/Mg clays, suggestive of neutral/alkaline conditions. However, these observations do not uniquely distinguish between hot springs and fumarolic environments, as opal-A can occur in both environments. Many martian silica detections occur in regionally extensive units, and sometimes in association with fluvial landforms suggesting a detrital or lower temperature authigenic origin. Thus, only a few martian opal detections may be mineralogically, spatially, and morphologically consistent with a hot spring origin. However, although it is difficult to unambiguously identify martian hot spring environments from orbital data sets, the orbital data are still valuable for identifying siliceous sites that are consistent with higher biosignature preservation potential, that is, sites with opal-A (not opal-CT), for future in situ investigations.

We examine the magnetic field geometries and strengths in the northern, central, and southern regions of the filament. The overall field geometry is ordered and aligned closely perpendicular to the filament's main axis, particularly in regions containing the central clumps MM1 and MM2, whereas MM3 in the north has field orientations aligned with its major axis. The overall field orientations are uniform at large (POL-2 at 14 '' and SHARP at 10 '') to small scales (TADPOL at 2 ''.5 and SMA at 1 ''.5) in the MM1 and MM2 regions. SHARP/CSO observations in MM3 at 350 mu m from Tang et al. show a similar trend as seen in our POL-2 observations. TADPOL observations demonstrate a well-defined field geometry in MM1/MM2 consistent with MHD simulations of accreting filaments. We obtained a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength of 470 +/- 190 mu G, 100 +/- 40 mu G, and 60 +/- 34 mu G in the central, northern, and southern regions of G34, respectively, using the updated Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation. The estimated value of field strength, combined with column density and velocity dispersion values available in the literature, suggests G34 to be marginally critical with criticality parameter lambda values 0.8 +/- 0.4, 1.1 +/- 0.8, and 0.9 +/- 0.5 in the central, northern, and southern regions, respectively. The turbulent motions in G34 are sub-AlfvEnic with Alfvenic Mach numbers of 0.34 +/- 0.13, 0.53 +/- 0.30, and 0.49 +/- 0.26 in the three regions. The observed aligned B-fields in G34.43+0.24 are consistent with theoretical models suggesting that B-fields play an important role in guiding the contraction of the cloud driven by gravity.

Our high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring captures the appearance of a blue, featureless continuum, followed several weeks later by the appearance of broad Balmer emission lines. This timescale is generally consistent with the expected light travel time between the central engine and the broadline emission region in (persistent) broadline AGN. Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy reveals no evidence for broad UV emission lines (e. g., C IV lambda 1549, C III] lambda 1909, Mg II lambda 2798), probably owing to dust in the broadline emission region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where the lag between the change in continuum and in broadline emission of a "changing look" AGN has been temporally resolved. The nature and timescales of the photometric and spectral evolution disfavor both a change in line-of-sight obscuration and a change of the overall rate of gas inflow as driving the drastic spectral transformations seen in this AGN. Although the peak luminosity and timescales are consistent with those of tidal disruption events seen in inactive galaxies, the spectral properties are not. The X-ray emission displays a markedly different behavior, with frequent flares on timescales of hours to days, and will be presented in a companion publication.

New Spatially Resolved Imaging of the SR 21 Transition Disk and Constraints on the Small-grain Disk Geometry	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							INTERFEROMETRY; PLANET; DISTRIBUTIONS; LIKELIHOOD; STARS; GAP	We present new 0.6-4 mu m imaging of the SR 21 transition disk from Keck/NIRC2 and Magellan/MagAO. The protoplanetary disk around SR 21 has a large (similar to 30-40 au) clearing first inferred from its spectral energy distribution and later detected in submillimeter imaging. Both the gas and small dust grains are known to have a different morphology, with an inner truncation in CO at similar to 7 au, and micron-sized dust detected within the millimeter clearing. Previous near-infrared imaging could not distinguish between an inner dust disk with a truncation at similar to 7 au or one that extended to the sublimation radius. The imaging data presented here require an inner dust disk radius of a few au, and complex structure such as a warp or spiral. We present a parametric warped disk model that can reproduce the observations. Reconciling the images with the spectral energy distribution gathered from the literature suggests grain growth to greater than or similar to 2-5 mu m within the submillimeter clearing. The complex disk structure and possible grain growth can be connected to dynamical shaping by a giant-planet-mass companion, a scenario supported by previous observational and theoretical studies.

The host galaxies were classified as low-ionization nuclear emissionline region galaxies (LINERs) by weak narrow forbidden line emission in their archival SDSS spectra, and detected by ZTF as nuclear transients. In five of the cases, we found via follow-up spectroscopy that they had transformed into broad-line AGNs, reminiscent of the changing-look LINER iPTF16bco. In one case, ZTF18aajupnt/ AT2018dyk, follow-up Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and ground-based optical spectra revealed the transformation into a narrow-line Seyfert 1 with strong [Fe VII, X, XIV] and He II lambda 4686 coronal lines. Swift monitoring observations of this source reveal bright UV emission that tracks the optical flare, accompanied by a luminous soft X-ray flare that peaks similar to 60 days later. Spitzer follow-up observations also detect a luminous midinfrared flare, implying a large covering fraction of dust. Archival light curves of the entire sample from CRTS, ATLAS, and ASAS-SN constrain the onset of the optical nuclear flaring from a prolonged quiescent state. Here we present the systematic selection and follow-up of this new class of changing-look LINERs, compare their properties to previously reported changing-look Seyfert galaxies, and conclude that they are a unique class of transients well-suited to test the uncertain physical processes associated with the LINER accretion state.

J	Lenz, D; Dore, O; Lagache, G				Lenz, Daniel; Dore, Olivier; Lagache, Guilaine			Large-scale Maps of the Cosmic Infrared Background from Planck	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						large-scale structure of universe; infrared: diffuse background; infrared: ISM	POWER SPECTRUM; HI; ANISOTROPIES; GALAXIES; SPITZER	The cosmic infrared background (CIB) is a powerful probe of large-scale structure across a very large redshift range, and consists of unresolved redshifted infrared emission from dusty galaxies. It can be used to study the astrophysics of galaxies, the star formation history of the universe, and the connection between dark and luminous matter. It can furthermore be used as a tracer of the large-scale structure and thus assist in de-lensing of the cosmic microwave background. The major difficulty in its use lies in obtaining accurate and unbiased large-scale CIB images that are cleaned of the contamination by Galactic dust. We used data on neutral atomic hydrogen from the recently released HI4PI Survey to create template maps of Galactic dust, allowing us to remove this component from the Planck intensity maps from 353 to 857 GHz for approximately 25% of the sky. This allows us to constrain the CIB power spectrum down to l greater than or similar to 70. We present these CIB maps and the various processing and validation steps that we have performed to ensure their quality, as well as a comparison with previous studies. All our data products are made publicly available,(4) thereby enabling the community to investigate a wide range of questions related to the universe's large-scale structure.

Analysis of valley widths and river long profiles over similar to 19 km of Alameda Creek (185 km(2) drainage area) and Arroyo Hondo (200 km(2) drainage area) in central California shows a very consistent picture in which earthflows that intersect these channels force tens of meters of gravel aggradation for kilometers upstream, leading to apparently long-lived sediment storage and channel burial at these sites. In contrast, over a similar to 30 km section of the Eel River (5547 km(2) drainage area), there are no knickpoints or aggradation upstream of locations where earthflows impinge on its channel. Hydraulic and hydrologic data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) gages on Arroyo Hondo and the Eel River, combined with measured size distributions of boulders input by landslides for both locations, suggest that landslide derived boulders are not mobile at either site during the largest floods (> 2-year recurrence) with field-measured flow depths. We therefore argue that boulder transport capacity is an unlikely explanation for the observed difference in sensitivity to landslide inputs. At the same time, we find that earthflow fluxes per unit channel width are nearly identical for Oak Ridge earthflow on Arroyo Hondo, where evidence for blocking is clear, and for the Boulder Creek earthflow on the Eel River, where evidence for blocking is absent. These observations suggest that boulder supply is also an unlikely explanation for the observed morphological differences along the two rivers. Instead, we argue that the dramatically different sensitivity of the two locations to landslide blocking is related to differences in channel width relative to typical seasonal displacements of earthflows. A synthesis of seasonal earthflow displacements in the Franciscan melange shows that the channel width of the Eel River is similar to 5 times larger than the largest annual seasonal displacement. In contrast, during wet winters, earthflows are capable of crossing the entire channel width of Arroyo Hondo and Alameda Creek. In support of this interpretation, satellite imagery shows that immobile earthflow-derived boulders are generally confined to the edges of the channel on the Eel River. By contrast, immobile earthflow-derived boulders jam the entire channel on Arroyo Hondo. Our results imply that lower drainage area reaches of earthflow-dominated catchments may be particularly prone to blocking. By inhibiting the upstream propagation of base-level signals, valley-blocking earthflows may therefore promote the formation of so-called "relict topography".

MIRO Team	Long-term monitoring of the outgassing and composition of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with the Rosetta/MIRO instrument	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/churyumov-Gerasimenko; radio lines: planetary systems; submillimeter: planetary systems	ODIN; SIMULATION; OXYGEN; MASS; 67P	We present the analysis of approximate to 100 molecular maps of the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that were obtained with the MIRO submillimeter radiotelescope on board the Rosetta spacecraft. From the spectral line mapping of (H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-18, (H2O)-O-17, CH3OH, NH3, and CO and some fixed nadir pointings, we retrieved the outgassing pattern and total production rates for these species. The analysis covers the period from July 2014, inbound to perihelion, to June 2016, outbound, and heliocentric distances r(h) = 1.24-3.65 AU. A steep evolution of the outgassing rates with heliocentric distance is observed, typically in r(h)(-6), with significant differences between molecules (e.g. steeper variation for H2O post-perihelion than for methanol). As a consequence, the abundances relative to water in the coma vary. The CH3OH and CO abundances increase after perihelion, while the NH3 abundance peaks around perihelion and then decreases. Outgassing patterns have been modeled as 2D Gaussian jets. The width of these jets is maximum around the equinoxes when the bulk of the outgassing is located near the equator. From July 2014 to February 2015, the outgassing is mostly restricted to a narrower jet (full width at half-maximum approximate to 80 degrees) originating from high northern latitudes, while around perihelion, most of the gaseous production comes from the southernmost regions (-80 +/- 5 degrees cometocentric latitude) and forms a 100 degrees-130 degrees (full width at half-maximum) wide fan. We find a peak production of water of 0.8 x 10(28) molec. s(-1) , 2.5 times lower than measured by the ROSINA experiment, and place an upper limit to a 50% additional production that could come from the sublimation of icy grains. We estimate the total loss of ices during this perihelion passage to be 4.18 +/- 0.18 x 10(9) kg. We derive a dust-to-gas ratio in the lost material of 0.7-2.3 (including all sources of errors) based on the nucleus mass loss of 10.5 +/- 3.4 x 10(9) kg estimated by the RSI experiment. We also obtain an estimate of the (H2O)-O-18/(H2O)-O-17 ratio of 5.6 +/- 0.8.

We provide a detailed quantitative analysis of isolated boulder fields situated in three different regions of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko: Imhotep, Hapi, and Hatmehit. This is done to supply a useful method for analyzing the morphology of the boulders and to characterize the regions themselves. Methods. We used OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera images with a spatial scale smaller than 2 mpx(-1) and analyzed the size-frequency distribution and the cumulative fractional area per boulder population. In addition, we correlated shape parameters, such as circularity and solidity, with both the spatial and the size-frequency distribution of the three populations. Results. We identified 11 811 boulders in the Imhotep, Hapi, and Hatmehit regions. We found that the Hatmehit and Imhotep areas show power indices in the range of -2.3/-2.7. These values could represent a transition between gravitational events caused by thermal weathering and sublimation, and material formed during collapses that has undergone sublimation. The Hapi area is characterized by a lower power index (-1.2/-1.7), suggesting that those boulders have a different origin. They can be the result of material formed during gravitational events and collapses that has undergone continuous fragmentation. We calculated the cumulative fractional area (CFA) in order to investigate how the area is covered by boulders as a function of their sizes. The Hatmehit and Imhotep regions show a CFA that is well fit by a power law. In contrast, the Hapi area does not show the same trend. We analyzed the fractal distributions, finding that the populations seem to be fractal at all dimensions, except for the Hapi distribution, which shows a possible fractal behavior for small dimensions only. Finally, the average values of the shape parameters reveal solid and roundish boulders in all populations we studied.

Rosetta/OSIRIS observations of the 67P nucleus during the April 2016 flyby: high-resolution spectrophotometry	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						space vehicles; space vehicles: instruments; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; techniques: image processing; methods: data analysis	EXPOSED WATER ICE; COMET 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; OSIRIS; SURFACE; SPACE; SPECTROSCOPY; SIMULATIONS; WAVELENGTH	Context. From August 2014 to September 2016, the Rosetta spacecraft followed comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko along its orbit. After the comet passed perihelion, Rosetta performed a flyby manoeuvre over the Imhotep-Khepry transition in April 2016. The OSIRIS/Narrow-Angle-Camera (NAC) acquired 112 observations with mainly three broadband filters (centered at 480, 649, and 743 nm) at a resolution of up to 0.53 m/px and for phase angles between 0.095 degrees and 62 degrees. Aims. We have investigated the morphological and spectrophotometrical properties of this area using the OSIRIS/NAC high-resolution observations. Methods. We assembled the observations into coregistered color cubes. Using a 3D shape model, we produced the illumination conditions and georeference for each observation. We mapped the observations of the transition to investigate its geomorphology. Observations were photometrically corrected using the Lommel-Seeliger disk law. Spectrophotometric analyses were performed on the coregistered color cubes. These data were used to estimate the local phase reddening. Results. The Imhotep-Khepry transition hosts numerous and varied types of terrains and features. We observe an association between a feature's nature, its reflectance, and its spectral slopes. Fine material deposits exhibit an average reflectance and spectral slope, while terrains with diamictons, consolidated material, degraded outcrops, or features such as somber boulders present a lower-than-average reflectance and higher-than-average spectral slope. Bright surfaces present here a spectral behavior consistent with terrains enriched in water-ice. We find a phase-reddening slope of 0.064 +/- 0.001%/100 nm/degrees at 2.7 au outbound, similar to the one obtained at 2.3 au inbound during the February 2015 flyby. Conclusions. Identified as the source region of multiple jets and a host of water-ice material, the Imhotep-Khepry transition appeared in April 2016, close to the frost line, to further harbor several potential locations with exposed water-ice material among its numerous different morphological terrain units.

Linking surface morphology, composition, and activity on the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; techniques: photometric	EXPOSED WATER ICE; COMET 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; PHASE FUNCTION; OSIRIS; 67P; DUST; PERIHELION; OUTBURSTS; SHAPE	Aims. The Rosetta space probe accompanied comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for more than two years, obtaining an unprecedented amount of unique data of the comet nucleus and inner coma. This has enabled us to study its activity almost continuously from 4 au inbound to 3.6 au outbound, including the perihelion passage at 1.24 au. This work focuses identifying the source regions of faint jets and outbursts and on studying the spectrophotometric properties of some outbursts. We use observations acquired with the OSIRIS/NAC camera during July-October 2015, that is, close to perihelion. Methods. We analyzed more than 2000 images from NAC color sequences acquired with 7-11 filters covering the 250-1000 nm wavelength range. The OSIRIS images were processed with the OSIRIS standard pipeline up to level 3, that is, converted in radiance factor, then corrected for the illumination conditions. For each color sequence, color cubes were produced by stacking registered and illumination-corrected images. Results. More than 200 jets of different intensities were identified directly on the nucleus. Some of the more intense outbursts appear spectrally bluer than the comet dark terrain in the visible-to-near-infrared region. We attribute this spectral behavior to icy grains mixed with the ejected dust. Some of the jets have an extremely short lifetime. They appear on the cometary surface during the color sequence observations, and vanish in less than some few minutes after reaching their peak. We also report a resolved dust plume observed in May 2016 at a resolution of 55 cm pixel(-1), which allowed us to estimate an optical depth of similar to 0.65 and an ejected mass of similar to 2200 kg, assuming a grain bulk density of similar to 800 kg m(-3). We present the results on the location, duration, and colors of active sources on the nucleus of 67P from the medium-resolution (i.e., 6-10 m pixel(-1)) images acquired close to perihelion passage. The observed jets are mainly located close to boundaries between different morphological regions. Some of these active areas were observed and investigated at higher resolution (up to a few decimeter per pixel) during the last months of operations of the Rosetta mission. Conclusions. These observations allow us to investigate the link between morphology, composition, and activity of cometary nuclei. Jets depart not only from cliffs, but also from smooth and dust-covered areas, from fractures, pits, or cavities that cast shadows and favor the recondensation of volatiles. This study shows that faint jets or outbursts continuously contribute to the cometary activity close to perihelion passage, and that these events are triggered by illumination conditions. Faint jets or outbursts are not associated with a particular terrain type or morphology.	[Fornasier, S.; Hoang, V. H.; Hasselmann, P. H.; Feller, C.; Barucci, M. A.; Deshapriya, J. D.

Surface evolution of the Anhur region on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from high-resolution OSIRIS images	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; techniques: photometric; techniques: imaging spectroscopy	EXPOSED WATER ICE; NUCLEUS; SHAPE	Context. The southern hemisphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) became observable by the Rosetta mission in March 2015, a few months before cometary southern vernal equinox. The Anhur region in the southern part of the comet's larger lobe was found to be highly eroded, enriched in volatiles, and highly active. Aims. We analyze high-resolution images of the Anhur region pre- and post-perihelion acquired by the OSIRIS imaging system on board the Rosetta mission. The Narrow Angle Camera is particularly useful for studying the evolution in Anhur in terms of morphological changes and color variations. Methods. Radiance factor images processed by the OSIRIS pipeline were coregistered, reprojected onto the 3D shape model of the comet, and corrected for the illumination conditions. Results. We find a number of morphological changes in the Anhur region that are related to formation of new scarps; removal of dust coatings; localized resurfacing in some areas, including boulders displacements; and vanishing structures, which implies localized mass loss that we estimate to be higher than 50 million kg. The strongest changes took place in and nearby the Anhur canyon-like structure, where significant dust cover was removed, an entire structure vanished, and many boulders were rearranged. All such changes are potentially associated with one of the most intense outbursts registered by Rosetta during its observations, which occurred one day before perihelion passage. Moreover, in the niche at the foot of a new observed scarp, we also see evidence of water ice exposure that persisted for at least six months. The abundance of water ice, evaluated from a linear mixing model, is relatively high (>20%). Our results confirm that the Anhur region is volatile-rich and probably is the area on 67P with the most pristine exposures near perihelion.	[Fornasier, S.; Feller, C.; Hasselmann, P. H.; Barucci, M.

Unusually high magnetic fields in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its high-activity phase	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; plasmas; magnetic fields; methods: data analysis	DIAMAGNETIC CAVITY; ROSETTA MISSION; PLASMA; RPC; EVOLUTION; ENVIRONMENT; 67P; ION; BOUNDARIES; ORIGIN	Aims. On July 3, 2015, an unprecedented increase in the magnetic field magnitude was measured by the Rosetta spacecraft orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). This increase was accompanied by large variations in magnetic field and ion and electron density and energy. To our knowledge, this unusual event marks the highest magnetic field ever measured in the plasma environment of a comet. Our goal here is to examine possible physical causes for this event, and to explain this reaction of the cometary plasma and magnetic field and its trigger. Methods. We used observations from the entire Rosetta Plasma Consortium as well as energetic particle measurements from the Standard Radiation Monitor on board Rosetta to characterize the event. To provide context for the solar wind at the comet, observations at Earth were compared with simulations of the solar wind. Results. We find that the unusual behavior of the plasma around 67P is of solar wind origin and is caused by the impact of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection, combined with a corotating interaction region. This causes the magnetic field to pile up and increase by a factor of six to about 300 nT compared to normal values of the enhanced magnetic field at a comet. This increase is only partially accompanied by an increase in plasma density and energy, indicating that the magnetic field is connected to different regions of the coma.

Pronounced morphological changes in a southern active zone on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; methods: miscellaneous	WATER ICE; BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; OUTBURSTS; 67P; SURFACE; DISTRIBUTIONS; SPECTROSCOPY; EVOLUTION; TRANSPORT; NUCLEUS	A smooth deposit in the southern Khonsu region has been seen in ESA/Rosetta observations as active during the second half of 2015, when the southern summer coincided with the perihelion passage of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). Image color sequences acquired by the OSIRIS instrument in the period of January 2015 to July 2016, pre- and post-perihelion, show the occurrence of several small transient events as well as three massive outbursts (-10 to 1500 tons). High spatial resolution images taken one year and a half apart allowed us to track a variety of sources: the formation of cavities that are 1.3-14 m deep, ice-enriched patches, scarp retraction, and a second 50 m-wide boulder. We then estimated their masses and the dust mass of their corresponding plumes and outbursts. In particular, the deformation left by that boulder and its lack of talus may provide evidence for the lifting and subsequent falling back to the surface of large blocks. We calculate that a minimum vapor production rate of 1.4 x 10(24) m(-2) s(-1) is required to lift such an object. The comparison of the masses that are lost in the new cavities to the dust mass of outbursts gives indirect evidence of highly volatile ice pockets underneath. The spectrophotometric analysis and boulder counting also provides evidence for cavities that formed only 30 m apart with different spectral slopes, two long-standing ice patches, and local variations in the boulder-size frequency distribution. All this points to sub-surface ice pockets with different degrees of depth. Finally, the total mass of the morphological changes compared to most recent calculations of the total released mass by activity on 67P is estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.2%. This means that as many as about 25 similar active zones across the nucleus would be enough to sustain the entire cometary activity.	[Hasselmann, P. H.; Barucci, M.

The Rosetta-OSIRIS images acquired at small phase angles in three wavelengths during the fly-by of the spacecraft on 9-10 April 2016 provided a unique opportunity to study the opposition effect on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). Our goal is to study phase curves of the nucleus at small phase angles for a variety of surface structures to show the differences in their opposition effect and to determine which surface properties cause the differences. Methods. We used OSIRIS NAC images that cover the Ash-Khepry-Imhotep region to extract the phase curve, that is, the reflectance of the surface as a function of phase angle. We selected six regions of interest (ROIs) and derived the phase curves for each ROI. We fit a linear-exponential function to the phase curves. The resulting model parameters were then interpreted by spectrophotometric, geomorphological, and phase-ratio analyses, and by investigating the influence of structural and textural properties of the surface. Results. We find evidence for the opposition effect (deviation of the phase curve from linear behavior) in phase curves for all areas. We found an anticorrelation between the phase ratio and reflectance in a small phase angle range. This provides evidence for the shadow-hiding effect. We conclude that the decrease in the slope of the phase ratio versus reflectance indicates a decrease in the proportion of shadowed regions and reduces the contribution of the shadow-hiding effect. Large uncertainties in the determination of the opposition effect parameters with respect to wavelength do not allow us to conclusively claim coherent backscattering in the opposition effect phenomenon. Based on the two analyses, we conclude that the opposition effect of comet 67P in the Ash-Khepry-Imhotep region is mainly affected by shadow-hiding.

Spectrophotometric variegation of the layering in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as seen by OSIRIS	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; methods: data analysis	WATER ICE; NUCLEUS	Context. Between August 2014 and September 2016, the ESA space mission Rosetta escorted comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) during its perihelion passage. The onboard OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) acquired high-resolution multispectral images of the cometary surface. These datasets allowed a characterization of the spectrophotometric variegation of the layering of the large lobe, correlated with the layer structural elevation. Aims. We perform a spectrophotometric characterization of the outcropping stratification of the small lobe of 67P as a function of its structural elevation, and consequently, a spectrophotometric comparison of the layered outcrops of the two lobes. Methods. We selected two sequences of post-perihelion OSIRIS NAC images (similar to 2.4 au outbound to the Sun), from which we built up two multispectral images, framing an extended geological section of the onion-like stratification of the small lobe. Then we classified the consolidated areas of the outcropping and the relative coarse deposits that were identified in the multispectral data with a two-class maximum likelihood method. For this, we defined the classes as a function of the structural elevation of the surface. Results. As a result, we identified a brightness variegation of the surface reflectance that is correlated with the structural elevation. The outer class, which is located at higher elevations, appears darker than the inner class. This fits previously obtained results for the large lobe. The reflectance values of the nucleus of 67P tend to decrease with increasing structural elevation. Conclusions. The observed spectrophotometric variegation can be due to a different texture as well as to a different content of volatiles and refractories. We suggest that the outer outcrops appear darker because they have been exposed longer, and the inner outcrops appear brighter because the surface has been more effectively rejuvenated. We interpret this variegation as the result of an evolutionary process.

On 27 April 2015, when comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was at 1.76 au from the Sun and moving toward perihelion, the OSIRIS and VIRTIS-M instruments on board the Rosetta spacecraft simultaneously observed the evolving dust and gas coma during a complete rotation of the comet. Aims. We aim to characterize the spatial distribution of dust, H2O, and CO2 gas in the inner coma. To do this, we performed a quantitative analysis of the release of dust and gas and compared the observed H2O production rate with the rate we calculated using a thermophysical model. Methods. For this study we selected OSIRIS WAC images at 612 nm (dust) and VIRTIS-M image cubes at 612 nm, 2700 nm (H2O emission band), and 4200 nm (CO2 emission band). We measured the average signal in a circular annulus to study the spatial variation around the comet, and in a sector of the annulus to study temporal variation in the sunward direction with comet rotation, both at a fixed distance of 3.1 km from the comet center. Results. The spatial correlation between dust and water, both coming from the sunlit side of the comet, shows that water is the main driver of dust activity in this time period. The spatial distribution of CO2 is not correlated with water and dust. There is no strong temporal correlation between the dust brightness and water production rate as the comet rotates. The dust brightness shows a peak at 0 degrees subsolar longitude, which is not pronounced in the water production. At the same epoch, there is also a maximum in CO2 production. An excess of measured water production with respect to the value calculated using a simple thermophysical model is observed when the head lobe and regions of the southern hemisphere with strong seasonal variations are illuminated (subsolar longitude 270 degrees-50 degrees). A drastic decrease in dust production when the water production (both measured and from the model) displays a maximum occurs when typical northern consolidated regions are illuminated and the southern hemisphere regions with strong seasonal variations are instead in shadow (subsolar longitude 50 degrees-90 degrees). Possible explanations of these observations are presented and discussed.

LISA Pathfinder Collaboration; ST7-DRS Operations Team	Micrometeoroid Events in LISA Pathfinder	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: miscellaneous; meteorites, meteors, meteoroids	ORBITS	The zodiacal dust complex, a population of dust and small particles that pervades the solar system, provides important insight into the formation and dynamics of planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies. We present a new set of data obtained from direct measurements of momentum transfer to a spacecraft from individual particle impacts. This technique is made possible by the extreme precision of the instruments flown on the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft, a technology demonstrator for a future space-based gravitational wave observatory. Pathfinder employed a technique known as drag-free control that achieved rejection of external disturbances, including particle impacts, using a micropropulsion system. Using a simple model of the impacts and knowledge of the control system, we show that it is possible to detect impacts and measure properties such as the transferred momentum, direction of travel, and location of impact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for impacts during 4348 hr of Pathfinder data. We report a total of 54 candidates with transferred momenta ranging from 0.2 to 230 mu Ns. We furthermore make a comparison of these candidates with models of micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system, including those resulting from Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), Oort Cloud comets, Halley-type comets, and asteroids. We find that our measured population is consistent with a population dominated by JFCs, with some evidence for a smaller contribution from Halley-type comets, in agreement with consensus models of the zodiacal dust complex in the momentum range sampled by LISA Pathfinder.

J	Jennings, KS; Molotch, NP				Jennings, Keith S.; Molotch, Noah P.			The sensitivity of modeled snow accumulation and melt to precipitation phase methods across a climatic gradient	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RAIN-ON-SNOW; ENERGY-BALANCE; LAND-SURFACE; ELEVATION GRADIENT; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; WESTERN CASCADES; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; NIWOT RIDGE; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATIONS	A critical component of hydrologic modeling in cold and temperate regions is partitioning precipitation into snow and rain, yet little is known about how uncertainty in precipitation phase propagates into variability in simulated snow accumulation and melt. Given the wide variety of methods for distinguishing between snow and rain, it is imperative to evaluate the sensitivity of snowpack model output to precipitation phase determination methods, especially considering the potential of snow-to-rain shifts associated with climate warming to fundamentally change the hydrology of snow-dominated areas. To address these needs we quantified the sensitivity of simulated snow accumulation and melt to rain-snow partitioning methods at sites in the western United States using the SNOWPACK model without the canopy module activated. The methods in this study included different permutations of air, wet bulb and dew point temperature thresholds, air temperature ranges, and binary logistic regression models. Compared to observations of snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE), the binary logistic regression models produced the lowest mean biases, while high and low air temperature thresholds tended to overpredict and underpredict snow accumulation, respectively. Relative differences between the minimum and maximum annual snowfall fractions predicted by the different methods sometimes exceeded 100 % at elevations less than 2000 m in the Oregon Cascades and California's Sierra Nevada. This led to ranges in annual peak SWE typically greater than 200 mm, exceeding 400 mm in certain years. At the warmer sites, ranges in snowmelt timing predicted by the different methods were generally larger than 2 weeks, while ranges in snow cover duration approached 1 month and greater. Conversely, the three coldest sites in this work were relatively insensitive to the choice of a precipitation phase method, with average ranges in annual snowfall fraction, peak SWE, snowmelt timing, and snow cover duration of less than 18 %, 62 mm, 10 d, and 15 d, respectively. Average ranges in snowmelt rate were typically less than 4 mm d(-1) and exhibited a small relationship to seasonal climate. Overall, sites with a greater proportion of precipitation falling at air temperatures between 0 and 4 degrees C exhibited the greatest sensitivity to method selection, suggesting that the identification and use of an optimal precipitation phase method is most important at the warmer fringes of the seasonal snow zone.

Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in vegetation: 50 years of progress	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sun-induced fluorescence; Steady-state photosynthesis; Stress detection; Radiative transfer modelling; SIF retrieval methods; Satellite sensors; Airborne instruments; Applications; Terrestrial vegetation; Passive optical techniques; Review	SUN-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PHOTOCHEMICAL REFLECTANCE INDEX; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; MESOPHYLL DIFFUSION CONDUCTANCE; INDUCED ABSORBENCY CHANGES; RADIATION-USE-EFFICIENCY; LEAF OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; WATER-STRESS DETECTION; STEADY-STATE	Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a rapidly advancing front in terrestrial vegetation science, with emerging capability in space-based methodologies and diverse application prospects. Although remote sensing of SIF especially from space is seen as a contemporary new specialty for terrestrial plants, it is founded upon a multi-decadal history of research, applications, and sensor developments in active and passive sensing of chlorophyll fluorescence. Current technical capabilities allow SIF to be measured across a range of biological, spatial, and temporal scales. As an optical signal, SIF may be assessed remotely using high-resolution spectral sensors in tandem with state-of-the-art algorithms to distinguish the emission from reflected and/or scattered ambient light. Because the red to far-red SIF emission is detectable non-invasively, it may be sampled repeatedly to acquire spatio-temporally explicit information about photosynthetic light responses and steady-state behaviour in vegetation. Progress in this field is accelerating with innovative sensor developments, retrieval methods, and modelling advances. This review distills the historical and current developments spanning the last several decades. It highlights SIF heritage and complementarity within the broader field of fluorescence science, the maturation of physiological and radiative transfer modelling, SIF signal retrieval strategies, techniques for field and airborne sensing, advances in satellite-based systems, and applications of these capabilities in evaluation of photosynthesis and stress effects. Progress, challenges, and future directions are considered for this unique avenue of remote sensing.

This inversion is challenging due to the confounding effects of turbid backscatter, atmospheric aerosols, and sun glint. Simultaneous estimation of the surface and atmosphere can resolve the ambiguity enabling spectral reflectance maps with rigorous uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate a simultaneous retrieval method that adapts the Optimal Estimation (OE) formalism of Rodgers (2000) to the coastal domain. We compare two surface representations: a parametric bio-optical model based on Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs); and an expressive statistical model that estimates reflectance in every instrument channel. The latter is suited to both land and water reflectance, enabling a unified analysis of terrestrial and aquatic domains. We test these models with both vector and scalar Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs). We report field experiments by two airborne instruments: NASA's Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) in an overflight of Santa Monica, California; and NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) in an overflight of the Wax Lake Delta and lower Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. In both cases, in situ validation measurements match remote water-leaving reflectance estimates to high accuracy. Posterior error predictions demonstrate a closed account of uncertainty in these coastal observations.

Mars Science Laboratory Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons passive mode data and results from sols 753 to 1292: Pahrump Hills to Naukluft Plateau	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars, surface; Cosmic rays	DAN EXPERIMENT ONBOARD; GALE CRATER; YELLOWKNIFE BAY; WATER; ENVIRONMENT; INSTRUMENT; EVOLUTION; HYDROGEN; MSL/RAD	The Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons instrument (DAN) onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) uses He-3 proportional counters to detect neutrons escaping the martian surface. This neutron leakage flux can be used to estimate the amount of hydrogen in the shallow martian regolith. During sols 753 through 1292 of the MSL mission, the rover traversed from Pahrump Hills to the Naukluft Plateau and acquired slightly less than 2000 h of neutron count rate data covering similar to 3 km of traverse and 125 waypoints along that traverse. Here we present an analysis of these data, including new procedures to leverage the oversampling of the instrument within its own spatial footprint, water equivalent hydrogen (WEH) estimates, and DAN passive geochemical index (DPGI) values. The average water equivalent hydrogen estimate for this region of the traverse is 1.6 wt% with a standard deviation of 1.1 wt%. These results show that Curiosity transitioned into a relatively lower WEH-content region as it left the plains of Gale crater and began ascending the hills at the base of Mt. Sharp. We also show that the WEH populations of the geologic units investigated during this time (Murray and Stimson Formations) are statistically different both from each other and the previously studied Aeolis Palus sediments (Smooth Hummocky, Bedded Fractured, Eolian, Rugged, and Striated Light-toned). Additionally, DAN passive WEH estimates agree with measurements from other MSL instruments in this region and are consistent with decreasing phyllosilicate abundance with increasing elevation.

The visual spectrum of Jupiter's Great Red Spot accurately modeled with aerosols produced by photolyzed ammonia reacting with acetylene	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter, atmosphere; Atmospheres, composition; Atmospheres, dynamics; Atmospheres, chemistry; Spectrophotometry	INFRARED MAPPING SPECTROMETER; JOVIAN PLANETS; ATMOSPHERE; SCATTERING; C2H2; HCN; ANTICYCLONES; CONSTRAINTS; CHROMOPHORE; ABUNDANCES	We report results incorporating the optical properties of the red-tinted photochemically-generated aerosols of Carlson et al. (2016, Icarus 274, 106-115) in spectral models of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS). This material - created in laboratory GRS simulations from acetylene reacting with photolytic products of ammonia produced by -0.2-mu m radiation, similar to solar radiation on Jupiter within and above the upper troposphere, provides an excellent match to 0.35-1.05-pm spectra of the core of the Great Red Spot obtained by the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) during the 2000-2001 Cassini-Huygens flyby. Radiative transfer models of GRS spectra acquired near the central-meridian (CM) and limb by the visual channel of the Cassini/VIMS near closest approach on December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2001, respectively, show remarkable agreement for model morphologies where the following conditions all exist: (1) most of the optical depth of the Carlson et al. (2016) chromophore resides near the top or above the main cloud layer, rather than being uniformly distributed within it, (2) the chromophore consists of relatively small particles in the 0.1-0.2 mu m range, and (3) the 1-mu m optical depth of the chromophore layer is small, of the order of 0.1-0.2. For such models, the chromophore layer mass abundance is 32-40 mu gm cm(-2). Consideration of the availability of the acetylene and ammonia parent gas material near the observed chromophore layers gives powerful support for the chromophore residing at the top of the main cloud in the upper troposphere rather than residing as a detached layer in the stratosphere. Under steady-state formation/loss conditions, consideration of plausible eddy diffusion coefficients pertaining to the relatively quiescent Jovian upper atmosphere yield untenable vertical transport times of more than several centuries required to supply the acetylene needed to form the chromophore layer, with stratospheric chromophore models requiring more than half a millennium. Consideration of the convective nature of the GRS and possible presence of acetylene-generating thunderstorms yields upper-troposphere chromophore layer formation times ranging from 11 years to 1.5 months for (1) plausible eddy diffusion coefficients ranging from 10(4) to 10(6) cm(2) s(-1) and (2) efficient conversion of C2H2 and NH3 into the Carlson et al. (2016) chromophore. Thus, the enhanced red coloring of the GRS may be due to the combined effects of (1) the relatively high, 0.2-bar cloudtop where ammonia ice and gas are delivered to prime photo-dissociation altitudes, by (2) powerful convection, which also delivers acetylene from depth created by (3) lightning, which is itself a by-product and indicator of powerful convection, and aided by (4) the vortex nature of the GRS, which helps to confine and concentrate the chromophore as it forms over time within the GRS anticyclone.

Photochemical oxidation of alcohols: Simple derivatization strategy for their analysis by capillary electrophoresis	FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Alcoholic beverages; Capillary electrophoresis; Indirect detection; Photochemical derivatization	ELECTROCHEMICAL DERIVATIZATION; ETHANOL; QUANTIFICATION; CATALYST; METHANOL	The determination of ethanol is one of the most important parameters in the fermentation industry, influencing not only the production yield and the quality of the product, but also its commercial value. In addition to the traditional approach based on distillation/density, procedure that is considered laborious and time-consuming, methods based on chromatography are widely used. Alternatives using electrochemical, spectroscopic and colorimetric techniques have been also proposed for alcohol analysis. In general, these methods not only offer limited throughput, but also require harsh reaction conditions and/or complex instrumentation. Aiming to address these shortcomings, we propose a fast, simple and clean analytical approach for the determination of primary alcohols based on the photochemical oxidation under UV-LED irradiation in the presence of H2O2. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 12 different types of alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content ranging from 5% v/v (beer) to 53% v/v (whiskey).

Our study is based on line intercept sampling for fallen coarse dead wood conducted along 103 transects with a total length of 48 km matched with forest inventory plots where standing coarse dead wood was measured in the footprints of larger areas of airborne lidar acquisitions. We developed models to relate lidar metrics and Landsat time series variables to coarse dead wood stocks for intact, logged, burned, or logged and burned forests. Canopy characteristics such as gap area produced significant individual relations for logged forests. For total fallen plus standing coarse dead wood (hereafter defined as total coarse dead wood), the relative root mean square error for models with only lidar metrics ranged from 33% in logged forest to up to 36% in burned forests. The addition of historical information improved model performance slightly for intact forests (31% against 35% relative root mean square error), not justifying the use of a number of disturbance events from historical satellite images (Landsat) with airborne lidar data. Lidar-derived estimates of total coarse dead wood compared favorably with independent ground-based sampling for areas up to several hundred hectares. The relations found between total coarse dead wood and variables quantifying forest structure derived from airborne lidar highlight the opportunity to quantify this important but rarely measured component of forest carbon over large areas in tropical forests.

AIM-North would consist of two satellites in a highly elliptical orbit formation, observing over land from similar to 40 degrees N to 80 degrees N multiple times per day. Each satellite would carry a near-infrared to shortwave infrared imaging spectrometer for CO2, CH4, and CO, and an ultraviolet-visible imaging spectrometer for air quality. Both instruments would measure solar-induced fluorescence from vegetation. A cloud imager would make near-real-time observations, which could inform the pointing of the other instruments to focus only on the clearest regions. Multiple geostationary (GEO) AQ and GHG satellites are planned for the 2020s, but they will lack coverage of northern regions like the Arctic. AIM-North would address this gap with quasi-geostationary observations of the North and overlap with GEO coverage to facilitate intercomparison and fusion of these datasets. The resulting data would improve our ability to forecast northern air quality and quantify fluxes of GHG and AQ species from forests, permafrost, biomass burning and anthropogenic activity, furthering our scientific understanding of these processes and supporting environmental policy.

However, no single vegetation model takes into account this growth form, although such efforts could greatly improve the predictions of carbon dynamics in tropical forests. In this study, we incorporated a novel mechanistic representation of lianas in a dynamic global vegetation model (the Ecosystem Demography Model). We developed a liana-specific plant functional type and mechanisms representing liana-tree interactions (such as light competition, liana-specific allometries, and attachment to host trees) and parameterized them according to a comprehensive literature meta-analysis. We tested the model for an old-growth forest (Paracou, French Guiana) and a secondary forest (Gigante Peninsula, Panama). The resulting model simulations captured many features of the two forests characterized by different levels of liana infestation as revealed by a systematic comparison of the model outputs with empirical data, including local census data from forest inventories, eddy flux tower data, and terrestrial laser scanner-derived forest vertical structure. The inclusion of lianas in the simulations reduced the secondary forest net productivity by up to 0.46 t(C) ha(-1) year(-1), which corresponds to a limited relative reduction of 2.6% in comparison with a reference simulation without lianas. However, this resulted in significantly reduced accumulated above-ground biomass after 70 years of regrowth by up to 20 t(C)/ha (19% of the reference simulation). Ultimately, the simulated negative impact of lianas on the total biomass was almost completely cancelled out when the forest reached an old-growth successional stage. Our findings suggest that lianas negatively influence the forest potential carbon sink strength, especially for young, disturbed, liana-rich sites. In light of the critical role that lianas play in the profound changes currently experienced by tropical forests, this new model provides a robust numerical tool to forecast the impact of lianas on tropical forest carbon sinks.

DES Collaboration	Chemical Abundance Analysis of Tucana III, the Second r-process Enhanced Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							METAL-POOR STARS; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; EVOLUTION; ELEMENTS; DISK	We present a chemical abundance analysis of four additional confirmed member stars of Tucana III, a Milky Way satellite galaxy candidate in the process of being tidally disrupted as it is accreted by the Galaxy. Two of these stars are centrally located in the core of the galaxy while the other two stars are located in the eastern and western tidal tails. The four stars have chemical abundance patterns consistent with the one previously studied star in Tucana III: they are moderately enhanced in r-process elements, i.e., they have <[Eu/Fe]> approximate to +0.4 dex. The non-neutron-capture elements generally follow trends seen in other dwarf galaxies, including a metallicity range of 0.44 dex and the expected trend in alpha-elements, i.e., the lower metallicity stars have higher Ca and Ti abundances. Overall, the chemical abundance patterns of these stars suggest that Tucana III was an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, and not a globular cluster, before being tidally disturbed. As is the case for the one other galaxy dominated by r-process enhanced stars, Reticulum II, Tucana III's stellar chemical abundances are consistent with pollution from ejecta produced by a binary neutron star merger, although a different r-process element or dilution gas mass is required to explain the abundances in these two galaxies if a neutron star merger is the sole source of r-process enhancement.

V23 has seen many updates to the retrieval process, most notably over dark water (DW), which applies over the global oceans and other deep bodies of water. Here the quality of the new MISR DW retrievals is assessed using surface-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and island/coastal sites within the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). About 406 MISR/MAN and 11,015 MISR/AERONET collocated observations were identified. Comparison against MAN reveals the unparalleled accuracy of the V23 AOD retrievals: the correlation coefficient is 0.98, the root-mean-square error is 0.041, and the mean bias is -0.002. Aerosol spatial heterogeneity negatively affects comparison statistics against AERONET observations-applying stricter collocation criteria drastically improves agreement between MISR and AERONET. The reported AOD uncertainties realistically represent retrieval errors as they exhibit behavior similar to that of the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution. Over the 18 years of MISR data analyzed, the global area-weighted average AOD over oceans is 0.103; it becomes 0.151 when the averaging is restricted to locations where MAN observations are available. The AOD uncertainties are generally higher than average in offshore areas dominated by anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols and lower than average in regions with mineral dust outflows. These results suggest future directions for improving the predefined aerosol mixtures used in the MISR aerosol retrieval look-up tables.

The Far-infrared Polarization Spectrum of rho Ophiuchi A from HAWC plus /SOFIA Observations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dust, extinction; ISM: magnetic fields; ISM: individual objects (Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud); techniques: polarimetric	TAURUS MOLECULAR CLOUD; MAGNETIC-B-STAR; RADIATIVE TORQUES; GRAIN ALIGNMENT; INTERSTELLAR GRAINS; POLARIMETRY; FIELDS; SPECTROPOLARIMETRY; FRAGMENTATION; CONSTRAINTS	We report on polarimetric maps made with HAWC+/SOFIA toward rho Oph A, the densest portion of the rho Ophiuchi molecular complex. We employed HAWC+ bands C (89 mu m) and D (154 mu m). The slope of the polarization spectrum was investigated by defining the quantity R-DC = P-D/P-C, where p(C) and p(D) represent polarization degrees in bands C and D, respectively. We find a clear correlation between R-DC and the molecular hydrogen column density across the cloud. A positive slope (R-DC > 1) dominates the lower-density and wellilluminated portions of the cloud, which are heated by the high-mass star Oph S1, whereas a transition to a negative slope (R-DC < 1) is observed toward the denser and less evenly illuminated cloud core. We interpret the trends as due to a combination of (1) warm grains at the cloud outskirts, which are efficiently aligned by the abundant exposure to radiation from Oph S1, as proposed in the radiative torques theory; and (2) cold grains deep in the cloud core, which are poorly aligned owing to shielding from external radiation. To assess this interpretation, we developed a very simple toy model using a spherically symmetric cloud core based on Herschel data and verified that the predicted variation of R-DC is consistent with the observations. This result introduces a new method that can be used to probe the grain alignment efficiency in molecular clouds, based on the analysis of trends in the far-infrared polarization spectrum.

Observations and hypotheses related to low to middle free tropospheric aerosol, water vapor and altocumulus cloud layers within convective weather regimes: a SEAC(4)RS case study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MARINE STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS; MIXED-PHASE ALTOCUMULUS; DIODE-LASER HYGROMETER; DROPLET CONCENTRATION; EFFECTIVE RADIUS; GROWTH-RATES; CIRRUS; LIDAR; TRANSPORT; PARTICLES	The NASA Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS) project included goals related to aerosol particle life cycle in convective regimes. Using the University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar system at Huntsville, Alabama, USA, and the NASA DC-8 research aircraft, we investigate the altitude dependence of aerosol, water vapor and Altocumulus (Ac) properties in the free troposphere from a canonical 12 August 2013 convective storm case as a segue to a presentation of a mission-wide analysis. It stands to reason that any moisture detrainment from convection must have an associated aerosol layer. Modes of covariability between aerosol, water vapor and Ac are examined relative to the boundary layer entrainment zone, 0 degrees C level, and anvil, a region known to contain Ac clouds and a complex aerosol layering structure (Reid et al., 2017). Multiple aerosol layers in regions warmer than 0 degrees C were observed within the planetary boundary layer entrainment zone. At 0 degrees C there is a proclivity for aerosol and water vapor detrainment from storms, in association with melting level Ac shelves. Finally, at temperatures colder than 0 degrees C, weak aerosol layers were identified above Cumulus congestus tops (similar to 0 and similar to -20 degrees C). Stronger aerosol signals return in association with anvil outflow. In situ data suggest that detraining particles undergo aqueous-phase or heterogeneous chemical or microphysical transformations, while at the same time larger particles are being scavenged at higher altitudes leading to enhanced nucleation. We conclude by discussing hypotheses regarding links to aerosol emissions and potential indirect effects on Ac clouds.

GNSS tomography is a technique that takes advantage of these parameters, especially of slant troposphere observations between GNSS receivers and satellites, traces these signals through a 3-D grid of voxels, and estimates by an inversion process the refractivity of the water vapour content within each voxel. In the last years, the GNSS tomography development focused on numerical methods to stabilize the solution, which has been achieved to a great extent. Currently, we are facing new challenges and possibilities in the application of GNSS tomography in numerical weather forecasting, the main research objective of this paper. In the first instance, refractivity fields were estimated using two different GNSS tomography models (TUW, WUELS), which cover the area of central Europe during the period of 29 May-14 June 2013, when heavy-precipitation events were observed. For both models, slant wet delays (SWDs) were calculated based on estimates of zenith total delay (ZTD) and horizontal gradients, provided for 88 GNSS sites by Geodetic Observatory Pecny (GOP). In total, three sets of SWD observations were tested (set0 without compensation for hydrostatic anisotropic effects, set1 with compensation of this effect, set2 cleaned by wet delays outside the inner voxel model), in order to assess the impact of different factors on the tomographic solution. The GNSS tomography outputs have been assimilated into the nested (12 and 36 km horizontal resolution) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, using its three-dimensional variational data assimilation (WRFDA 3D-Var) system, in particular, its radio occultation observation operator (GPSREF). As only total refractivity is assimilated in GPSREF, it was calculated as the sum of the hydrostatic part derived from the ALADIN-CZ model and the wet part from the GNSS tomography. We compared the results of the GNSS tomography data assimilation to the radiosonde (RS) observations. The validation shows the improvement in the weather forecasting of relative humidity (bias, standard deviation) and temperature (standard deviation) during heavy-precipitation events. Future improvements to the assimilation method are also discussed.

Interpretation of the Top-of-Atmosphere Energy Flux for Future Arctic Warming	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HEAT-TRANSPORT; SEA-ICE; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; TEMPERATURE FEEDBACKS; AMPLIFICATION; RADIATION	With the trend of amplified warming in the Arctic, we examine the observed and modeled top-ofatmosphere (TOA) radiative responses to surface air-temperature changes over the Arctic by using TOA energy fluxes from NASA's CERES observations and those from twelve climate models in CMIP5. Considerable inter-model spreads in the radiative responses suggest that future Arctic warming may be determined by the compensation between the radiative imbalance and poleward energy transport (mainly via transient eddy activities). The poleward energy transport tends to prevent excessive Arctic warming: the transient eddy activities are weakened because of the reduced meridional temperature gradient under polar amplification. However, the models that predict rapid Arctic warming do not realistically simulate the compensation effect. This role of energy compensation in future Arctic warming is found only when the inter-model differences in cloud radiative effects are considered. Thus, the dynamical response can act as a buffer to prevent excessive Arctic warming against the radiative response of 0.11W m(-2) K-1 as measured from satellites, which helps the Arctic climate system retain an Arctic climate sensitivity of 4.61K. Therefore, if quantitative analyses of the observations identify contribution of atmospheric dynamics and cloud effects to radiative imbalance, the satellite-measured radiative response will be a crucial indicator of future Arctic warming.

Detection of Crystalline and Fine-grained Calcic Plagioclases on Vesta	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article							REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; SPECTROSCOPY; ASTEROIDS; OLIVINE; SPECTROMETER; MINERALOGY; PYROXENES; REGOLITH; CAMERA; DAWN	Plagioclase feldspars are among the most prevalent minerals in the solar system, and are present in many chondritic and achondritic meteorite families. Nevertheless, spectral features of plagioclases have never been unambiguously and directly observed in remote observations of asteroids. We report here the detection of an absorption band at 12.2 mu m on Vesta spectra provided by ground-based spectral observations at the Subaru Telescope. This signature represents the first direct evidence of a widespread presence of crystalline Ca-rich plagioclase on Vesta and reveals that its regolith is comminuted to a very fine grain size, smaller than a few tens of microns, indicating that the mechanical brecciation process has been very effective. The crystalline nature of plagioclase strongly suggests that impacts alone cannot be the sole mechanism for regolith formation on Vesta and a milder process, such as thermal fatigue, should be invoked as an important and concomitant process Thermal fatigue should be considered a very effective process in regolith production and rejuvenation not only for near-Earth asteroids but even for large asteroids located in the main belt.

The operationally produced weekly reports are based on survey information. The surveys are based on visual assessments and-in the case of soil moisture-report soil moisture levels in one of four categories (Very Short, Short, Adequate, and Surplus). In this study, we show that these reports have remarkable correspondence with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 Soil Moisture (L4SM) product. This consistency allows for combining the two different types of data to produce a value-added assessment, which enables cropland soil moisture mapping and state-level statistics. Moreover, it enables daily assessment rather than weekly. In this study classification thresholds are derived for L4SM by mapping cumulative distribution functions of L4SM surface and root zone SM to the categorical NASS SM conditions. The results show that, year over year, the SMAP cumulative SM distributions are consistent with the NASS SM conditions and, furthermore, that the temporal evolution of the SMAP-derived thresholds is consistent with the seasonal crop growth cycles from year to year. The results signify that the SMAP SM retrievals are relatable to SM estimation conducted in agricultural crop land by land managers and farmers, which underlines the general applicability of the SMAP data.

Theoretical models predict that these planets are more vulnerable to atmospheric loss than their counterparts orbiting Sun-like stars(3-6). To determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one approach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its thermal phase curve(7-10). Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the substellar point (latitude and longitude of 0 degrees)-possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation(11). Here we report a phase curve measurement for the smaller, cooler exoplanet LHS 3844b, a 1.3-Earth-radii world in an 11-hour orbit around the small nearby star LHS 3844. The observed phase variation is symmetric and has a large amplitude, implying a dayside brightness temperature of 1,040 +/- 40 kelvin and a nightside temperature consistent with zero kelvin (at one standard deviation). Thick atmospheres with surface pressures above 10 bar are ruled out by the data (at three standard deviations), and less-massive atmospheres are susceptible to erosion by stellar wind. The data are well fitted by a bare-rock model with a low Bond albedo (lower than 0.2 at two standard deviations). These results support theoretical predictions that hot terrestrial planets orbiting small stars may not retain substantial atmospheres.

The Hubble PanCET program: an extensive search for metallic ions in the exosphere of GJ 436 b	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars individual GJ 436; stars activity; stars chromospheres; planets and satellites atmospheres	EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET SPECTRUM; ACTIVE LONGITUDES; GIANT PLANETS; WATER-LOSS; X-RAY; EXOPLANET; HYDROGEN; ATMOSPHERE; REGION; TIME	Context. The quiet M2.5 star GJ 436 hosts a warm Neptune that displays an extended atmosphere that dwarfs its own host star. Predictions of atmospheric escape in such planets state that H atoms escape from the upper atmosphere in a collisional regime and that the flow can drag heavier atoms to the upper atmosphere. It is unclear, however, what astrophysical mechanisms drive the process. Aims. Our objective is to leverage the extensive coverage of observations of the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of GJ 436 obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) to search for signals of metallic ions in the upper atmosphere of GJ 436 b, as well as study the activity-induced variability of the star. Methods. We analyzed flux time-series of species present in the FUV spectrum of GJ 436 and successfully performed geocoronal contamination removal in the COS Lyman-alpha profiles obtained near the Earth's night-side. Results. GJ 436 displays flaring events with a rate of similar to 10 d(-1). There is evidence for a possibly long-lived active region or longitude that modulates the FUV metallic lines of the star with amplitudes up to 20%. Despite the strong geocoronal contamination in the COS spectra, we detected in-transit excess absorption signals of similar to 50 and similar to 30% in the blue and red wings, respectively, of the Lyman-alpha line. We rule out a wide range of excess absorption levels in the metallic lines of the star during transit. Conclusions. The large atmospheric loss of GJ 436 b observed in Lyman-alpha transmission spectra is stable over the timescale of a few years, and the red wing signal supports the presence of a variable hydrogen absorption source besides the stable exosphere. The previously claimed in-transit absorption in the Si III line is likely an artifact resulting from the stellar magnetic cycle. The non-detection of metallic ions in absorption could indicate that the escape is not hydrodynamic or that the atmospheric mixing is not efficient in dragging metals high enough for sublimation to produce a detectable escape rate of ions to the exosphere.

J	Heinrich, C; Schmittfull, M				Heinrich, Chen; Schmittfull, Marcel			BAO modulation as a probe of compensated isocurvature perturbations	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; RECONSTRUCTION; GALAXIES; DISTANCE	Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) are opposite spatial fluctuations in the baryon and dark matter density. They can be generated for example in the curvaton model in the early Universe but are difficult to observe because their gravitational imprint nearly cancels. We therefore propose a new measurement method by searching for a spatial modulation of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that CIPs induce. We find that for a Euclid-like survey the sensitivity is marginally better than the WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraint, which exploits the CIP-induced modulation of the CMB sound horizon. For a cosmic-variance limited BAO survey using emission-line galaxies up to z similar to 7 the sensitivity is between stage 3 and stage 4 CMB experiments. These results include using CIP-galaxy cross-correlations, which improves the sensitivity by a factor of similar to 2-3 for correlated CIPs. The method could be further improved with an optimal estimator, similarly to the CMB, and could provide a useful cross-check of other CIP probes. Finally, if CIPs exist, they can bias cosmological measurements made assuming no CIPs. In particular, they can act as a supersample fluctuation of the baryon density and bias measurements of the BAO scale. For modem BAO surveys, the largest 2 sigma CIP fluctuation allowed by Planck's 95% bound could bias BAO measurements of H(z) by 2.2%, partially reducing the tension with the local H-0 measurements from 3.1 sigma to 2.3 sigma.

Proglacial freshwaters are significant and previously unrecognized sinks of atmospheric CO2	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						glacial meltwaters; carbon; biogeochemistry; freshwater	CARBON-DIOXIDE; CHEMICAL DENUDATION; GAS-EXCHANGE; GLACIER; EMISSIONS; LAKES; FLUX; FINSTERWALDERBREEN; DISSOLUTION; DRAWDOWN	Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater ecosystems are almost universally predicted to increase with climate warming. Glacier-fed rivers and lakes, however, differ critically from those in nonglacierized catchments in that they receive little terrestrial input of organic matter for decomposition and CO2 production, and transport large quantities of easily mobilized comminuted sediments available for carbonate and silicate weathering reactions that can consume atmospheric CO2. We used a whole-watershed approach, integrating concepts from glaciology and limnology, to conclusively show that certain glacier-fed freshwater ecosystems are important and previously overlooked annual CO2 sinks due to the overwhelming influence of these weathering reactions. Using the glacierized Lake Hazen watershed (Nunavut, Canada, 82 degrees N) as a model system, we found that weathering reactions in the glacial rivers actively consumed CO2 up to 42 km downstream of glaciers, and cumulatively transformed the High Arctic's most voluminous lake into an important CO2 sink. In conjunction with data collected at other proglacial freshwater sites in Greenland and the Canadian Rockies, we suggest that CO2 consumption in proglacial freshwaters due to glacial melt-enhanced weathering is likely a globally relevant phenomenon, with potentially important implications for regional annual carbon budgets in glacierized watersheds.

Improved Mars Helicopter Aerodynamic Rotor Model for Comprehensive Analyses	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	44th European Rotorcraft Forum	SEP 18-21, 2018	Delft, NETHERLANDS				TURBULENCE MODEL; NUMBER; AIRFOIL; TRANSITION; SEPARATION; WINGS; RATIO; FLOW	The Mars Helicopter is part of the NASA Mars 2020 rover mission scheduled to launch in July of 2020. Its goal is to demonstrate the viability and potential of heavier-than-air vehicles in the Martian atmosphere. The low density of the Martian atmosphere and the relatively small-scale rotor result in flows with very low Reynolds number, reducing the lifting force and lifting efficiency, respectively. This paper describes the generation of the improved Mars Helicopter aerodynamic rotor model. The goal is to generate a performance model for the Mars Helicopter rotor using a free wake analysis in CAMRADII. The improvements in the analysis are twofold and are expanded on from two prior publications. First, the fidelity of the simulations is increased by performing higher-order time-accurate OVERFLOW simulations allowing for higher-accuracy aerodynamic coefficients and a better understanding of the boundary-layer behavior. Second, a model is generated for the testing conditions in the 25-ft-diam Space Simulator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, allowing for better correlation of rotor performance figures. The higher temperatures in the experiment are expected to give conservative performance estimates, as they give rise to an increase in speed of sound and decrease in observed Reynolds numbers.

ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Giant planets; Ice giant planets; Entry probes; Formation and evolution; Thermochemistry; Ionic ocean	DEEP ATMOSPHERE; URANUS; SATURN	"Flyby, orbit, land" has been the guiding philosophy of planetary exploration. This systematic approach has been highly successful in addressing the most fundamental questions of the origin, evolution, and habitability of the solar system. For the giant planets, entry probes take the place of ganders", since the "land" of the gas and icy giant planets, their solid core, lies some tens of thousands of kilometers beneath their cloud tops, hence impractical to reach. On the other hand, during a planet's accretionary heating phase the volatiles trapped in the core material would have been released, forming the atmosphere, together with the most volatile of the gases, hydrogen, helium and neon, that were captured gravitationally when the core became massive enough. Those atmospheric volatiles would thus be accessible by entry probes deployed to relatively shallow depths in the upper troposphere, allowing the determination of the abundances and isotopes of at least the most critical of the "heavy elements" (mass greater than helium). The heavy elements are key constraints to planetary formation and evolution models [1]. Entry probes are essential to retrieve their abundances, which are feasible only in situ at probe depths. That was the rationale behind NASA's 1995 Galileo probe mission at Jupiter and the Saturn Probe mission in NASA's New Frontier 4 candidate list of science themes. Saturn probe proposals to ESA's Cosmic Vision Program are similarly inspired. In 2015, NASA commissioned an Ice Giant Planets Study to recommend a comprehensive set of science goals and objectives, and further to develop potential mission architectures for accomplishing them in the 2023-2033 decade. The most highly rated mission from that study is an orbiter with probe to either Uranus or Neptune [2]. While remote sensing observations from the orbiter will yield the composition, structure and the distribution of neutral and charged particles in the magnetosphere and the upper atmosphere, the entry probe will determine the abundances and isotopic ratios of the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), H, C, and possibly N and S. The noble gases, in particular, are key to discriminating among formation models, and their values from the probe entry location would represent global values as they are unaffected by meteorology, dynamics or chemistry. We will elaborate on these issues and then briefly discuss possible scenario/s for a mission to the icy giant planets, with particular focus on entry probes.

Parametric Controls on Vegetation Responses to Biogeochemical Forcing in the CLM5	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						biogeochemistry; carbon; CLM5; parameter; sensitivity; nitrogen	COMMUNITY LAND MODEL; EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; CARBON ALLOCATION; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES; NITROGEN-CYCLE; FOREST; CO2; UNCERTAINTIES	Future projections of land carbon uptake in Earth System Models are affected by land surface model responses to both CO2 and nitrogen fertilization. The Community Land Model, Version 5 (CLM5), contains a suite of modifications to carbon and nitrogen cycle representation. Globally, the CLM5 has a larger CO2 response and smaller nitrogen response than its predecessors. To improve our understanding of the controls over the fertilization responses of the new model, we assess sensitivity to eight parameters pertinent to the cycling of carbon and nitrogen by vegetation, both under present-day conditions and with CO2 and nitrogen fertilization. The impact of fertilization varies with both model parameters and with the balance of limiting factors (water, temperature, nutrients, and light) in the pre-fertilization model state. The model parameters that impact the pre-fertilization state are in general not the same as those that control fertilization responses, meaning that goodness of fit to present-day conditions does not necessarily imply a constraint on future transient projections. Where pre-fertilization state has low leaf area, fertilization-induced increases in leaf production amplify the model response to the initial fertilization via further increases in photosynthesis. Model responses to CO2 and N fertilization are strongly impacted by how much plant communities can increase their rates of nitrogen fixation and also directly affected by costs of N extraction from soil and stoichiometric flexibility. Illustration of how parametric flexibility impacts model outputs should help inform the interpretation of carbon-climate feedbacks estimated by in fully coupled Earth system model simulations.

A promising alternative, the eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux approach (EDMF), has the potential for unifying the existing formulations into a consistent scheme and improving some of the long-standing issues. This study documents a step towards developing such a unified approach by implementing a stochastic multi-plume EDMF scheme into the Community Atmosphere Model (Version 5.0). Its performance in single-column mode is evaluated against the control parameterization and large-eddy simulation (LES) for two benchmark cases: marine and continental shallow convection. Overall, the results for the two parameterizations agree well with each other and with LES in terms of mean profiles of moist conserved variables and their vertical fluxes, as well as the updraft properties. However, systematic differences between the two schemes, especially for transient continental convection, are also documented. Using EDMF helps improve some of the parameterized features of shallow convection. In particular, for the highest tested vertical resolution, the EDMF cloud base and top heights and the vertical fluxes of energy and water are remarkably close to LES.

Geometric Approach for Analytical Approximations of Satellite Coverage Statistics	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article								The analysis and optimization of satellite coverage statistics have been ongoing for several decades. Designing an orbit or a constellation of orbits to meet specific coverage statistics (such as the mean pass duration, mean passes per day, and maximum gap time) can help maximize coverage time and meet mission goals for ground-based assets. In the past, most coverage optimization research has used numerical orbit propagators to generate the statistics. Although they result in very accurate numerical simulations, they are computationally expensive. Were analytical approximations for these orbit statistics available, the time required for optimization could be greatly reduced. This paper provides a geometrical derivation for approximating the maximum gap time and mean passes per day for nonrepeating, circular orbits. Furthermore, it links this derivation with the station view ratio to derive approximations for mean pass duration. The error in these approximations is analyzed with numerical orbit propagation simulations. The analytical solutions are then used to explore the relationship between the orbit parameters and the resulting coverage statistics for selected cases. The derivations for the coverage statistics presented in this paper have been, and continue to be, used for constellation design and loading analyses for Mars missions.

J	Broschart, SB; Bradley, N; Bhaskaran, S				Broschart, Stephen B.; Bradley, Nicholas; Bhaskaran, Shyam			Kinematic Approximation of Position Accuracy Achieved Using Optical Observations of Distant Asteroids	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION; DEEP; PERFORMANCE	NASA's Deep Space 1 mission demonstrated that a spacecraft can be navigated autonomously during deep-space cruise operations using only optical navigation measurements. A methodology is developed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the Deep Space 1 orbit determination approach throughout the solar system as a function of a spacecraft's imaging capabilities. Feasibility can be addressed by comparing the apparent magnitudes of the known population of asteroids against the imaging system capabilities. An upper limit on the accuracy of the spacecraft position estimate at a given location can be formulated by assuming observations of at least two asteroids simultaneously. Example results are presented for three camera implementations that span the range of capabilities flown in deep space to date using orbit and absolute magnitude data for 50,129 of the brightest known asteroids. Broadly speaking, achievable accuracies range from approximately 200 to 12,000 km (1 - sigma) interior to the main asteroid belt and from 50 to 2000 km within the main belt, depending strongly on the chosen camera implementation. Between the main belt and Jupiter, only a current state-of-the-art imaging system is consistently capable of kinematic positioning using only asteroids. Beyond Jupiter, there are insufficient known asteroids to support this approach without including images of planets and moons. Although these levels of accuracy are far inferior to those achievable with radiometric navigation, they may yet be sufficient to satisfy cruise-phase requirements for many deep-space missions.

By employing both statistically rigorous analysis and utilizing in situ data to inform calibration procedures and parameter estimation, we can dramatically reduce undesirable artifacts and minimize uncertainties of calibration parameters notoriously difficult to characterize in the laboratory. We describe a novel approach for destriping imaging spectrometer data through minimizing a Markov Random Field model. We then detail statistical methodology for bad pixel correction of the instrument, followed by the laboratory and field protocols involved in the corrections and evaluate their effectiveness on historical data. Finally, we review the geometric processing procedure used in production of the radiometrically calibrated image data.

Comparison of Methods for Modeling Fractional Cover Using Simulated Satellite Hyperspectral Imager Spectra	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						fractional cover mapping; field spectroscopy; PRISMA; HISUI; EnMAP; HyspIRI; Surface Biology and Geology (SBG)	CROP RESIDUE COVER; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; MIXTURE ANALYSIS; ENDMEMBER SELECTION; VEGETATION COVER; NONPHOTOSYNTHETIC VEGETATION; GREEN VEGETATION; PLANT LITTER; SOIL; REGRESSION	Remotely sensed data can be used to model the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil in natural and agricultural ecosystems. NPV and soil cover are difficult to estimate accurately since absorption by lignin, cellulose, and other organic molecules cannot be resolved by broadband multispectral data. A new generation of satellite hyperspectral imagers will provide contiguous narrowband coverage, enabling new, more accurate, and potentially global fractional cover products. We used six field spectroscopy datasets collected in prior experiments from sites with partial crop, grass, shrub, and low-stature resprouting tree cover to simulate satellite hyperspectral data, including sensor noise and atmospheric correction artifacts. The combined dataset was used to compare hyperspectral index-based and spectroscopic methods for estimating GV, NPV, and soil fractional cover. GV fractional cover was estimated most accurately. NPV and soil fractions were more difficult to estimate, with spectroscopic methods like partial least squares (PLS) regression, spectral feature analysis (SFA), and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) typically outperforming hyperspectral indices. Using an independent validation dataset, the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values were 0.115 for GV using either normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or SFA, 0.164 for NPV using PLS, and 0.126 for soil using PLS. PLS also had the lowest RMSE averaged across all three cover types. This work highlights the need for more extensive and diverse fine spatial scale measurements of fractional cover, to improve methodologies for estimating cover in preparation for future hyperspectral global monitoring missions.

In Los Angeles (LA), increasing trends in extreme heat are expected to intensify and exacerbate the urban heat island effect, leading to greater health risks for vulnerable populations. Partnerships between city policymakers and scientists are becoming more important as the need to provide data-driven recommendations for sustainability and mitigation efforts becomes critical. Here we present a model to produce heat vulnerability index (HVI) maps driven by surface temperature data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) new Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared sensor. ECOSTRESS was launched in June 2018 with the capability to image fine-scale urban temperatures at a 70 m resolution throughout different times of the day and night. The HVI model further includes information on socio-demographic data, green vegetation abundance, and historical heatwave temperatures from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Aqua spacecraft since 2002. During a period of high heat in July 2018, we identified the five most vulnerable communities at a sub-city block scale in the LA region. The persistence of high HVI throughout the day and night in these areas indicates a clear and urgent need for implementing cooling technologies and green infrastructure to curb future warming.

The instrument is a wide-field imaging spectrometer operated in the 4.05-5.75 mu m range, with the spectral resolution, sampling, radiometric sensitivity, and stability needed to provide temperature and water vapor soundings of the atmosphere, with 1 km vertical resolution in the troposphere-comparable to those of NASA's atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS). These instruments have much higher spatial resolution (<3 km at nadir) and finer spatial sampling than current hyperspectral sounders, allowing a sequence of such observations from several micro-satellites in an orbital plane with short time separation, from which atmospheric motion vector (AMV) winds are derived. AMVs for both cloud-motion and water vapor-motion, derived from hyperspectral imagery, will have improved velocity resolution relative to AMVs obtained from multi-spectral instruments operating in GEO. MISTiC's extraordinarily small size, low mass (<15 kg), and minimal cooling requirements can be accommodated aboard an ESPA-class microsatellite. Low fabrication and launch costs enable this constellation to provide more frequent atmospheric observations than current-generation sounders provide, at much lower mission cost. Key technology and observation method risks have been reduced through recent laboratory and airborne (NASA ER2) testing funded under NASA's Instrument Incubator Program and BAE Systems IR&D, and through an observing system simulation experiment performed by NASA GMAO. This approach would provide a valuable new capability for the study of the processes driving high-impact weather events, and critical high-resolution observations needed for future numerical weather prediction.

We investigate different techniques for estimating of geocenter motion from combinations of time-variable gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On missions, and bottom pressure outputs from ocean models. Here, we provide self-consistent estimates of geocenter variability incorporating the effects of self-attraction and loading, and investigate the effect of uncertainties in atmospheric and oceanic variation. The effects of self-attraction and loading from changes in land water storage and ice mass change affect both the seasonality and long-term trend in geocenter position. Omitting the redistribution of sea level affects the average annual amplitudes of the x, y, and z components by 0.2, 0.1, and 0.3 mm, respectively, and affects geocenter trend estimates by 0.02, 0.04 and 0.05 mm/yr for the the x, y, and z components, respectively. Geocenter estimates from the GRACE Follow-On mission are consistent with estimates from the original GRACE mission.

We present the first validation results of the operational sensor, collected in 2013 over glaciers in Alaska and followed by more exhaustive collections from Greenland in 2016 and 2017. In Alaska, overlapping flight-tracks were mosaicked to mitigate potential residual trends across-track and the resultant maps are validated with lidar. Furthermore, repeat acquisitions of Columbia Glacier collected with a three day separation indicate excellent stability and repeatability. Commencing 2016, GLISTIN-A has circumnavigated Greenland for 4 consecutive years. Due to flight hour limitations, overlapping swaths were not flown. In 2016, comparison with airborne lidar data finds that residual systematic errors exhibit evenly distributed small slopes (all less than 10 millidegrees) and nadir biases were typically less than 1 m. Similarly 2017 data exhibited up to meter-scale nadir biases and evenly distributed residual slopes with a standard deviation of similar to 10 millidegrees). All satisfied the science accuracy requirements of the Greenland campaigns (3 m accuracy across an 8 km swath).

Nanofluidic chromatography using a vibrating atomic force microscope tip	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							SPECTROSCOPY	The separation of liquid mixtures is demonstrated using the vibrating tip of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Fluid is collected onto the tip from a liquid surface while under tapping mode operation. This suppresses bulk capillary flow and enhances partitioning based on molecular affinity to the tip. AFM tapping mode separation was tested on liquid films consisting of binary and complex mixtures. The separated components were analyzed using tip enhanced infrared spectroscopy and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate nanometer scale chemical separation for ultratrace analysis and nanofluidic applications.

Previous research in comparing MCMC and Optimal Estimation (OE) for the OCO-2 retrieval has highlighted the issues of slow convergence of MCMC, and furthermore OE and MCMC not necessarily agreeing with the simulated ground truth. In this work, we exploit the inherent low information content of the OCO-2 measurement and use the Likelihood-Informed Subspace (LIS) dimension reduction to significantly speed up the convergence of MCMC. We demonstrate the strength of this analysis method by assessing the non-Gaussian shape of the retrieval's posterior distribution, and the effect of operational OCO-2 prior covariance's aerosol parameters on the retrieval. We further show that in our test cases we can use this analysis to improve the retrieval to retrieve the simulated true state significantly more accurately and to characterize the non-Gaussian form of the posterior distribution of the retrieval problem.

We present the validation of remotely sensed SST and SSS data against the unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-called Saildrone-measurements from the 60 day 2018 Baja California campaign. More specifically, biases and root mean square differences (RMSDs) were calculated between USV-derived SST and SSS values, and six satellite-derived SST (MUR, OSTIA, CMC, K10, REMSS, and DMI) and three SSS (JPLSMAP, RSS40, RSS70) products. Biases between the USV SST and OSTIA/CMC/DMI were approximately zero, while MUR showed a bias of 0.3 degrees C. The OSTIA showed the smallest RMSD of 0.39 degrees C, while DMI had the largest RMSD of 0.5 degrees C. An RMSD of 0.4 degrees C between Saildrone SST and the satellite-derived products could be explained by the diurnal and sub-daily variability in USV SST, which currently cannot be resolved by remote sensing measurements. SSS showed fresh biases of 0.1 PSU for JPLSMAP and 0.2 PSU and 0.3 PSU for RMSS40 and RSS70 respectively. SST and SSS showed peaks in coherence at 100 km, most likely associated with the variability of the California Current System.

We identify two spatial components: a ring resembling the Kuiper Belt in radial extent (FWHM similar to 25 au, centered at similar to 46 au) and a halo extending to similar to 640 au. We find that the halo is significantly bluer than the ring, consistent with the scenario that the ring serves as the "birth ring" for the smaller dust in the halo. We measure the scattering phase functions in the 30 degrees -150 degrees scattering-angle range and find that the halo dust is more forward- and backward-scattering than the ring dust. We measure a surface density power-law index of -0.68 +/- 0.04 for the halo, which indicates the slowdown of the radial outward motion of the dust. Using radiative transfer modeling, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the (visible) total and (near-infrared) polarized intensity images of the birth ring. Our modeling leads to mutually inconsistent results, indicating that more complex models, such as the inclusion of more realistic aggregate particles, are needed.

Bright Southern Variable Stars in the bRing Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							DELTA-SCUTI STARS; REFINED MK CLASSIFICATION; A-TYPE STARS; STROMGREN PHOTOMETRY; THETA TUCANAE; CATALOG; ROTATION; BINARIES; SAMPLE; CONFRONTATION	In addition to monitoring the bright star beta Pic during the near-transit event for its giant exoplanet, the beta Pictoris b Ring (bRing) observatories at Siding Springs Observatory, Australia and Sutherland, South Africa have monitored the brightnesses of bright stars (V similar or equal to 4-8 mag) centered on the south celestial pole (delta <= -30 degrees) for approximately two years. Here we present a comprehensive study of the bRing time-series photometry for bright southern stars monitored between 2017 June and 2019 January. Of the 16,762 stars monitored by bRing, 353 were found to be variable. Of the variable stars, 80% had previously known variability and 20% were new variables. Each of the new variables was classified, including three new eclipsing binaries (HD 77669, HD 142049, HD 155781), 26 delta Scutis, 4 slowly pulsating B stars, and others. This survey also reclassified four stars based on their period of pulsation, light curve, spectral classification, and color-magnitude information. The survey data were searched for new examples of transiting circumsecondary disk systems, but no candidates were found.

However, while FRD is a function of many fiber properties such as stresses, microbending, and surface imperfections, angular misalignments between the incoming light and the face of the fiber also affect the light pro file and complicate this measurement. A compact experimental setup and a model separating FRD from angular misalignment was applied to a fiber subjected to varying stresses or angular misalignments to determine the magnitude of these effects. The FRD was then determined for a fiber in a fiber positioner that will be used in the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The analysis we carried out for the PFS positioner suggests that effects of angular misalignment dominate and no significant FRD increase due to stress should occur.

FTS measurements of O-2 collision-induced absorption in the 565-700 nm region using a high pressure gas absorption cell	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							MOLECULAR-OXYGEN O-2; SPECTRAL-LINE SHAPES; SOLAR-RADIATION; CROSS-SECTIONS; SPEED DEPENDENCE; A-BAND; INFORMATION-CONTENT; CLOUD INFORMATION; GASEOUS OXYGEN; B-BANDS	The collision-induced absorption (CIA) spectra of oxygen and dry air have been measured in the near infrared and visible regions, covering the O-2(B) band at 687 nm and double transitions in the 630 nm and 577 nm regions. A custom-design 1 m path length high-pressure cell was developed and configured to a Bruker 125HR Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A super-luminous Laser Driven Light Source (LDLS) was also used to improve the photon flux incident upon the spectrometer. A series of spectra of pure O-2 and dry air were obtained at various high pressures up to 131 bars at room temperature. For the measurement of O-2-O-2 CIA in the B band region, the monomer resonance absorption contribution has been subtracted from the observed spectra by simulating the O-2(B) band absorption with a speed-dependent Voigt line shape profile with line mixing effects taken into account. The remaining absorption component was regarded as the CIA in the region. The integrated absorption coefficient was measured to be 3.2(6) x 10(-6) cm(-2)/Amagat(2) for the O-2(B) band region, which is significantly lower than literature values. For the two double transition bands in the 630 and 577nm regions, the integrated CIA bands from the present work were measured to be 2.50(14) and 3.26(18) x 10(-4) cm(-2)/Amagat(2), respectively. The present measurements are significantly higher than prior measurements for the 630 nm band region, while they are slightly lower than prior measurements for the 577 nm band region. For dry air, the integrated CIA bands were measured to be 0.10(2) and 0.15(2) x 10(-4) cm(-2)/Amagat(2), respectively, for the 630 and 577 nm regions, no appreciable contribution from O-2-N-2 pairs was observed.

In this paper we report the results of assignment and modelling of the line positions and intensities of (CH4)-C-13 in the range between 5471 and 5852 cm(-1), corresponding to the middle part of Tetradecad. The analysis was performed using a non-empirical effective Hamiltonian (EH) derived from the ab initio potential energy surface (PES) by high-order Contact Transformations (CT). The EH parameters were empirically optimized during the treatment of experimental data. In total, 3297 lines belonging to nine cold bands of the Tetradecad of (CH4)-C-13 were assigned in the 5471-5852 cm(-1) range up to j(max) = 11. The 3297 lines included correspond to 91% of the total line number in the region. Among them, 3251 line positions were fitted with an rms deviation of 1.33 x 10(-3) cm(-1). Measured line intensities for 1624 transitions were modeled using the effective dipole transition moments approach with an rms deviation of about 9%. Finally, the observed transitions were incorporated to fit simultaneously the (CH4)-C-13 Hamiltonian parameters for the {Ground state/Dyad/Pentad/Octad/Tetradecad} system and the dipole moment parameters for the {Ground state - Tetradecad} system.

However, current observational tools do not allow accurate and large-scale monitoring of the spatial distribution and dynamics of carbon stocks'. Here, we used low-frequency L-band passive microwave observations to compute a direct and spatially explicit quantification of annual aboveground carbon (AGC) fluxes and show that the tropical net AGC budget was approximately in balance during 2010 to 2017, the net budget being composed of gross losses of -2.86 PgC yr(-1) offset by gross gains of -2.97 PgC yr(-1) between continents. Large interannual and spatial fluctuations of tropical AGC were quantified during the wet 2011 La Nina year and throughout the extreme dry and warm 2015-2016 El Nino episode. These interannual fluctuations, controlled predominantly by semiarid biomes, were shown to be closely related to independent global atmospheric CO2 growth-rate anomalies (Pearson's r = 0.86), highlighting the pivotal role of tropical AGC in the global carbon budget.

J	Michel, S; Gualandi, A; Avouac, JP				Michel, Sylvain; Gualandi, Adriano; Avouac, Jean-Philippe			Interseismic Coupling and Slow Slip Events on the Cascadia Megathrust	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Cascadia megathrust; slow slip events; interseismic coupling; variational bayesian independent component analysis	SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; SUBDUCTION ZONE; DEFORMATION MODEL; SEISMOGENIC ZONE; EPISODIC TREMOR; EARTHQUAKE; HIMALAYA; SUBSIDENCE; REVEALS; LOCKING	In this study, we model geodetic strain accumulation along the Cascadia subduction zone between 2007.0 and 2017.632 using position time series from 352 continuous GPS stations. First, we use the secular linear motion to determine interseismic locking along the megathrust. We determine two end member models, assuming that the megathrust is either a priori locked or creeping, which differ essentially along the trench where the inversion is poorly constrained by the data. In either case, significant locking of the megathrust updip of the coastline is needed. The downdip limit of the locked portion lies similar to 20-80 km updip from the coast assuming a locked a priori, but very close to the coast for a creeping a priori. Second, we use a variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (vbICA) decomposition to model geodetic strain time variations, an approach which is effective to separate the geodetic strain signal due to non-tectonic and tectonic sources. The Slow Slip Events (SSEs) kinematics is retrieved by linearly inverting for slip on the megathrust the Independent Components related to these transient phenomena. The procedure allows the detection and modelling of 64 SSEs which spatially and temporally match with the tremors activity. SEEs and tremors occur well inland from the coastline and follow closely the estimated location of the mantle wedge corner. The transition zone, between the locked portion of the megathrust and the zone of tremors, is creeping rather steadily at the long-term slip rate and probably buffers the effect of SSEs on the megathrust seismogenic portion.

J	Balakrishnan, K; Bellan, J				Balakrishnan, Kaushik; Bellan, Josette			A multi-species modeling framework for describing supersonic jet-induced cratering in a granular bed: Cratering on Titan case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW			English	Article						Granular flow; Large eddy simulation (LES); Kinetic theory; Crater; Multiphase flow	MASS DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; TURBULENT; SIMULATION; COMBUSTION; HELICITY; REYNOLDS; FLOWS	The dynamics of cratering caused by a multi-component supersonic jet due to its interaction with the granular soil on the surface of Titan is investigated using a two-phase model and numerical simulations. Both fluid and particles are mathematically described in an Eulerian framework. The fluid is modeled using multi-species Large Eddy Simulation accounting for the details of diffusion among species, and the solid phase is described by a Kinetic-Theory-based model. The general framework is that of a recent model that successfully predicted specific details of Mars/Earth cratering observed by the Mars Science Laboratory (Balakrishnan and Bellan, International Journal of Multiphase Flow, 99, 1-29, 2018), however the distinctive differences between the present and previous model allows new physics to be uncovered that is peculiar to cratering in the presence of a dense atmosphere. Unsteady, three-dimensional simulations are performed to elucidate the morphological features of the crater and the dynamics of its evolution with time. Parametric variations of the initial conditions are conducted to understand the effect of the surface evenness, jet Mach number, particle size in the granular bed, jet composition, and the inter-granular stress coefficient. The new observation of crater-in-a-crater formation at early times is discussed and explained; this phenomenon is transient and the subsequent consumption of the inner crater by the surrounding crater walls is explained in detail. The jet exhibits complex morphological features revealed by vorticity and helicity analysis. The primary-crater walls display ripples along their surface that are traced to the interaction with the dense jet fluid which, having reached the crater bottom, changes direction to exit the crater using the spaces unoccupied by the jet and rubs the crater walls. Detailed analyses of the particle volume fraction and the particle momentum revealed the detailed morphology of the craters and the ejections from the craters, and related them to the initial conditions. A larger jet Mach number results in increased erosion due to the higher momentum content of the jet. A smaller increase in the jet momentum obtained by increasing the jet-fluid molar mass jet results in a crater that is more angled at the top, this feature being due to the increased jet expansion rate. The inter-granular stress coefficient does not affect the large-scale features of the crater, but does affect the peak compaction values. Species diffusion is investigated and it is found that both regular and uphill diffusion occur, the latter being primarily concentrated in the vicinity of the jet and the depths of the crater. The presented detailed formulation and numerical methodology for investigating supersonic jet-induced cratering on granular soil are sufficiently robust to accommodate plume-induced cratering on a variety of planetary bodies having an atmosphere.

Photochemical and photocatalytic degradation of 1-propanol using UV/H2O2: Identification of malonate as byproduct	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						Alcohol; Capillary electrophoresis; Contactless conductivity detection; Malonic acid; Photochemistry; Photodegradation	CONTACTLESS CONDUCTIVITY DETECTION; CAPILLARY-ELECTROPHORESIS; ELECTROCHEMICAL DERIVATIZATION; MICROCHIP ELECTROPHORESIS; OXIDATION; WATER; ALCOHOLS; TIO2; MECHANISMS; ETHANOL	1-propanol is a primary alcohol extensively used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries. It has been also found as a contaminant in the atmosphere and is considered a model compound to mimic the behavior and fate of aliphatic alcohols exposed to environmental conditions. In order to understand that role of relevant variables, this paper presents results obtained with a simple experimental set-up to investigate the reactivity of 1-propanol under mild oxidizing conditions. Coupling this system with CE-(CD)-D-4 allowed the quantification of the carboxylic acids formed. For the described experiments, aqueous solutions of 1-propanol were placed inside a photoreactor and oxidized upon the addition of TiO2 and/or H2O2. According to the described results, the addition of H2O2 (0.1% w/w) was the most significant variable, roughly tripled the amount of carboxylic acids generated and led to the conversion of up to 70% of the initially available 1-propanol (1 mmol/L). More importantly, the reaction yielded the formation (within 10 min) of propionate (50 mu mol/L), acetate (400 mu mol/L), formate (50 mu mol/L), and malonate (200 mu mol/L). The latter is critically important because it represents the first example of the photochemical oxidation of both terminal carbons of the C-3-chain of 1-propanol under mild conditions, and opens new avenues for the production of this important chemical building block.

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling of the red-sequence galaxy luminosity function	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution	COLOR-MAGNITUDE RELATION; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; HALO OCCUPATION DISTRIBUTION; STAR-FORMATION; MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION; SKY SURVEY; MASS; PHOTOMETRY; ORIGIN; MATTER	Using similar to 100 X-ray selected clusters in the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data, we constrain the luminosity function ( LF) of cluster red-sequence galaxies as a function of redshift. This is the first homogeneous optical/X-ray sample large enough to constrain the evolution of the LF simultaneously in redshift ( 0.1 < z < 1.05) and cluster mass ( 13.5 <= log(10)( M-200crit) similar to< 15.0). We pay particular attention to completeness issues and the detection limit of the galaxy sample. We then apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to fit the cluster galaxy LFs via a Schechter function, including its characteristic break ( m*) to a faint end power-law slope ( alpha). Our method enables us to avoid known issues in similar analyses based on stacking or binning the clusters. We find weak and statistically insignificant (similar to 1.9 sigma) evolution in the faint end slope alpha versus redshift. We also find no dependence in alpha or m* with the X-ray inferred cluster masses. However, the amplitude of the LF as a function of cluster mass is constrained to similar to 20 per cent precision. As a by-product of our algorithm, we utilize the correlation between the LF and cluster mass to provide an improved estimate of the individual cluster masses as well as the scatter in true mass given the X-ray inferred masses. This technique can be applied to a larger sample of X-ray or optically selected clusters from the Dark Energy Survey, significantly improving the sensitivity of the analysis.

DES Collaboration	A new RASS galaxy cluster catalogue with low contamination extending to z similar to 1 in the DES overlap region	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium; galaxies: distances and redshifts	LENSING MASS CALIBRATION; DARK ENERGY SURVEY; OBSERVED GROWTH; CONSTRAINTS; SUBSTRUCTURE; COSMOLOGY; EROSITA; MODELS; AGN	We present the MARD-Y3 catalogue of between 1086 and 2171 galaxy clusters (52 per cent and 65 per cent new) produced using multicomponent matched filter (MCMF) follow-up in 5000 deg(2) of DES-Y3 optical data of the similar to 20 000 overlapping ROSAT All-Sky Survey source catalogue (2RXS) X-ray sources. Optical counterparts are identified as peaks in galaxy richness as a function of redshift along the line of sight towards each 2RXS source within a search region informed by an X-ray prior. All peaks are assigned a probability f(cont) of being a random superposition. The clusters lie at 0.02 < z < 1.1 with more than 100 clusters at z > 0.5. Residual contamination is 2.6 per cent and 9.6 per cent for the cuts adopted here. For each cluster we present the optical centre, redshift, rest frame X-ray luminosity, M-500 mass, coincidence with NWAY infrared sources, and estimators of dynamical state. About 2 per cent of MARD-Y3 clusters have multiple possible counterparts, the photo-z's are high quality with sigma(Delta z/(1 + z)) = 0.0046, and similar to 1 per cent of clusters exhibit evidence of X-ray luminosity boosting from emission by cluster active galactic nuclei. Comparison with other catalogues (MCXC, RM, SPT-SZ, Planck) is performed to test consistency of richness, luminosity, and mass estimates. We measure the MARD-Y3 X-ray luminosity function and compare it to the expectation from a fiducial cosmology and externally calibrated luminosity-and richness-mass relations. Agreement is good, providing evidence that MARD-Y3 has low contamination and can be understood as a simple two step selection - X-ray and then optical - of an underlying cluster population described by the halo mass function.

OGLE-2017-BLG-1186: first application of asteroseismology and Gaussian processes to microlensing	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						asteroseismology; gravitational lensing: micro; stars: fundamental parameters; stars: oscillations	SURFACE BRIGHTNESS RELATIONS; STELLAR OSCILLATIONS; PLANET PHOTOMETRY; ANGULAR SIZES; DWARF STARS; SYSTEMS; SUBGIANTS; DISTANCES; STANDARD; PROGRAM	We present the analysis of the event OGLE-2017-B1,G-1186 from the 2017.Spitzer microlensing campaign. This is a remarkable microlensing event because its source is photometrically bright and variable, which makes it possible to perform an asteroseismic analysis using ground-based data. We find that the source star is an oscillating red giant with average time scale of similar to 9 d. The asteroseismic analysis also provides us source properties including the source angular size (similar to 27 as) and distance (similar to 11.5 kpc), which are essential for inferring the properties of the lens. When fitting the light curve, we test the feasibility of Gaussian processes (GPs) in handling the correlated noise caused by the variable source. We find that the parameters from the GP model are generally more loosely constrained than those from the traditional chi(2) minimization method. We note that this event is the first microlensing system for which asteroseismology and GPs have been used to account for the variable source. With both finite-source effect and microlens parallax measured, we find that the lens is likely a similar to 0,045 M-circle dot brown dwarf at distance similar to 9.0 kpc, or a similar to 0.073 M-circle dot ultracool dwarf at distance similar to 9.8 kpc. Combining the estimated lens properties with a Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model, we find a similar to 35 per cent probability for the lens to be a bulge object and similar to 65 per cent to be a background disc object.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: the effect of intracluster light on photometric redshifts for weak gravitational lensing	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: distances and redshifts; cosmology: observations	DIFFUSE OPTICAL LIGHT; GALAXY CLUSTERS; MASS CALIBRATION; HALO MASS; EVOLUTION; II.; SPT	We study the effect of diffuse intracluster light on the critical surface mass density estimated from photometric redshifts of lensing source galaxies, and the resulting bias in a weak lensing measurement of galaxy cluster mass. Under conservative assumptions, we find the bias to he negligible for imaging surveys like the Dark Energy Survey with a recommended scale cut of >= 200 kpc distance from cluster centres. For significantly deeper lensing source galaxy catalogues from present and future surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope program, more conservative scale and source magnitude cuts or a correction of the effect may be necessary to achieve percent level lensing measurement accuracy, especially at the massive end of the cluster population.

Testing Early Solar System Dynamical Models Using OSSOS Centaur Detections	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Kuiper belt: general	SIZE DISTRIBUTION; KUIPER-BELT; SCATTERED-DISK; FAMILY; ORIGIN	We use published models of the early solar system evolution with a slow, long-range and grainy migration of Neptune to predict the orbital element distributions and the number of modern-day Centaurs. The model distributions are biased by the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) simulator and compared with the OSSOS Centaur detections. We find an excellent match to the observed orbital distribution, including the wide range of orbital inclinations which was the most troublesome characteristic to fit in previous models. A dynamical model, in which the original population of outer disk planetesimals was calibrated from Jupiter trojans, is used to predict that OSSOS should detect 11 +/- 4 Centaurs with semimajor axes of a < 30 au, perihelion distances of q > 7.5 au, and diameter of D > 10km (absolute magnitude H-r < 13.7 for a 6% albedo). This is consistent with 15 actual OSSOS Centaur detections with H-r < 13.7. The population of Centaurs is estimated to be 21,000 +/- 8000 for D > 10 km. The inner scattered disk at 50 < a < 200 au should contain (2.0 +/- 0.8) x 10(7) D > 10km bodies and the Oort cloud should contain (5.0 +/- 1.9) x 10(8) D > 10 km comets. Population estimates for different diameter cutoffs can be obtained from the size distribution of Jupiter trojans (N(>D) proportional to D-2.1 for 5 < D < 100 km). We discuss model predictions for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope observations of Centaurs.

J	Hensley, S				Hensley, Scott			An Analytic Expression for the Phase Noise of the Goldstein-Werner Filter	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Filtering; Goldstein-Werner (GW) filter; interferogram; phase noise		Interferogram filtering for noise reduction is a key to many radar interferometric applications. Repeat pass radar interferometry often uses data with less than ideal correlation levels resulting from either long spatial or temporal baselines or changes between observations leading to high levels of temporal correlation. To maximize the utility of such pairs filtering the interferogram to get maximal noise reduction is often needed. One technique that has proved quite useful in the geophysical community is power spectral or Goldstein-Werner filtering of the interferogram whereby a power-weighted version of the Fourier transform is used to enhance fringe visibility. Although this paper defining the filter briefly touched upon the spatial resolution and noise reduction induced by the filter, it did not provide a useful formula for predicting the phase noise after filtering. This paper derives a formula for the phase noise obtained from power spectral filtering albeit under the restriction of several simplifying assumptions to make the problem analytically tractable. In particular, it is assumed that the interferometric phase is locally well approximated by a linear phase ramp with nonlinear phase perturbations small in a spectral energy sense compared to the linear term.

Ionospheric Correction of InSAR Time Series Analysis of C-band Sentinel-1 TOPS Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Ionosphere; range split-spectrum method; Sentinel-1; synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR); tectonic motion; time series analysis; terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS)	MONOCHROMATIC RADIATION; SAR IMAGES; RADAR; INTERFEROMETRY; DECORRELATION; ABSORPTION; ATMOSPHERE	The Copernicus Sentinel-1A/B satellites operating at C-band in terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode bring unprecedented opportunities for measuring large-scale tectonic motions using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Although the ionospheric effects are only about one-sixteenth of those at L-band, the measurement accuracy might still be degraded by long-wavelength signals due to the ionosphere. We implement the range split-spectrum method for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR with C-band Sentinel-1 TOPS data. We perform InSAR time series analysis and evaluate these ionospheric effects using data acquired on both ascending (dusk-side of the Sentinel-1 dawn-dusk orbit) and descending (dawn-side) tracks over representative midlatitude and low-latitude (geomagnetic latitude) areas. We find that the ionospheric effects are very strong for data acquired at low latitudes on ascending tracks. For other cases, ionospheric effects are not strong or even negligible. The application of the range split-spectrum method, despite some implementation challenges, largely removes ionospheric effects, and thus improves the InSAR time series analysis results.

Detection of Radio Frequency Interference in Microwave Radiometers Operating in Shared Spectrum	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Microwave radiometry; radio frequency interference (RFI)	MITIGATION; RFI	Microwave radiometers measure weak thermal emission from the Earth, which is broadband in nature. Radio frequency interference (RFI) originates from active transmitters and is typically narrow band, directional, and continuous or intermittent. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) has seen RFI caused by ocean reflections from direct broadcast and communication satellites in the shared 18.7-GHz allocated band. This paper focuses on the use of a complex signal kurtosis algorithm to detect direct broadcast satellite (DBS) signals at 18.7 GHz. An experiment was conducted in August 2017 at the Harvest oil platform, located about 10 km off the coast of central California. Data were collected for direct and ocean reflected DBS transmissions in the K-and Ku-bands from a commercial geostationary satellite. Results are presented for the complex kurtosis performance for a five-channel quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signal versus the seven-channel case. As the spectrum becomes more occupied, detector performance decreases. Filtering of RFI in the fully occupied spectrum is very difficult, and detection using the complex kurtosis detector is only possible for very large interference-to-noise ratio (INR) values at -5 dB and higher. This corresponds to over 100 K in a real system such as GMI; therefore, other detection approaches might be more appropriate.

J	Zhu, F; Peck, M; Jones-Wilson, L				Zhu, Frances; Peck, Mason; Jones-Wilson, Laura			Flux-Pinned Dynamics Model Parameterization and Sensitivity Study	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							LEVITATION FORCE; MAGNETIC-LEVITATION; COOLING PROCESSES; GRAIN-ALIGNMENT; YBACUO BULK; SUPERCONDUCTORS; RECONFIGURATION; SPACECRAFT; LOOPS	Flux-pinned interfaces maintain a passively stable equilibrium between two spacecraft in close proximity. Although flux-pinning physics has been studied from a materials science perspective and at the system level, the sensitivities and implications of system-level designs on the dynamics need to be better understood, especially in interfaces with multiple magnets and superconductors. These interfaces have highly nonlinear coupled dynamics that are influenced by physical parameters, including strength of magnetic-field sources, field-cooled position, and superconductor geometry. Kordyuk's frozen-image model ("Magnetic Levitation for Hard Superconductors," Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 83, No. 1, Jan. 1998, pp. 610-612) successfully approximates the characteristics of flux-pinning dynamics, but could provide a more precise state prediction with the addition of these physical parameter refinements. This paper addresses that gap by offering parametric terms to improve the dynamics model, which may better simulate the behavior of a multiple-magnet-and-multiple-superconductor interface. The sensitivity of the general flux-pinned dynamics model is studied by varying the physical parameters and simulating the system-level dynamics. This work represents a critical step in the development of a model suited to spacecraft performance verification.

A good agreement is found between time series of the SMAP and ELBARA-III measured T-B(P) resulting in a Pearson product-moment coefficient (R) larger than 0.87. Differences noted between the two data sets can be associated with discrepancies in theta(liq) measured in the specific footprints, whereby the SMAP measurements are best explained by the in situ theta(liq). Furthermore, the in situ theta(liq) has a better agreement with the horizontally polarized SMAP and ELBARA-III measurements (T-B(H)) in the cold season, whereas the vertically polarized measurements (T-B(V)) are better correlated with liq in the warm season. With the implementation of new vegetation and surface roughness parameterizations for the tau-omega model, the dynamics of in situ theta(liq) is better reproduced by corresponding retrievals for both frozen and thawed soil conditions, leading to the reduction in the unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) by more than 31% in comparison with these retrievals using SMAP default parameterizations. Notably, the single-channel algorithm configured with the new parameterizations using SMAP T-B(V) measured during the ascending overpass provides the best theta(liq) retrievals with a ubRMSE of 0.035 m(3).m(-3) that is well within the SMAP mission requirements.

In this study, we use ground-based 5-mu m infrared data captured between 1984 and 2018 by eight different instruments mounted on the Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawai'i and on the Very Large Telescope in Chile to analyze and characterize the long-term variability of Jupiter's cloud-forming region at the 1-4 bar pressure level. The data show a large temporal variability mainly at the equatorial and tropical latitudes, with a smaller temporal variability at mid-latitudes. We also compare the 5-mu m-bright and -dark regions with the locations of the visible zones and belts, and we find that these regions are not always colocated, especially in the southern hemisphere. We also present Lomb-Scargle and Wavelet Transform analyses in order to look for possible periodicities of the brightness changes that could help us understand their origin and predict future events. We see that some of these variations occur periodically in time intervals of 4-8 yr. The reasons for these time intervals are not understood, and we explore potential connections to both convective processes in the deeper weather layer and dynamical processes in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Finally, we perform a Principal Component analysis to reveal a clear anticorrelation on the 5 mu m brightness changes between the North Equatorial Belt and the South Equatorial Belt, suggesting a possible connection between the changes in these belts.

The chromaticity of the instrument creates a boundary in the Fourier transform of frequency (proportional to k(parallel to)) between spectrally smooth emission, characteristic of the strong synchrotron foreground (the "wedge"), and the spectrally structured emission from H I in the EoR (the "EoR window"). Faraday rotation can inject spectral structure into otherwise smooth polarized foreground emission, which through instrument effects or miscalibration could possibly pollute the EoR window. For instruments pursuing a "foreground avoidance" strategy of simply measuring in the EoR window, and not attempting to model and remove foregrounds, as is the plan for the first stage of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), characterizing the intrinsic instrument polarization response is particularly important. Using data from the HERA 19-element commissioning array, we investigate the polarization response of this new instrument in the power-spectrum domain We perform a simple image-based calibration based on the unpolarized diffuse emission of the Global Sky Model, and show that it achieves qualitative redundancy between the nominally redundant baselines of the array and reasonable amplitude accuracy. We construct power spectra of all fully polarized coherencies in all pseudo-Stokes parameters, and discuss the achieved isolation of foreground power due to the intrinsic spectral smoothness of the foregrounds, the instrument chromaticity, and the calibration. We compare to simulations based on an unpolarized diffuse sky model and detailed electromagnetic simulations of the dish and feed, confirming that in Stokes I, the calibration does not add significant spectral structure beyond that expected from the interferometer array configuration and the modeled primary beam response. Furthermore, this calibration is stable over the 8 days of observations considered. Excess power is seen in the power spectra of the linear polarization Stokes parameters, which is not easily attributable to leakage via the primary beam, and results from some combination of residual calibration errors and actual polarized emission. Stokes V is found to be highly discrepant from the expectation of zero power, strongly pointing to the need for more accurate polarized calibration.

A comparison between submm continuum and near-infrared extinction shows a continuum core detection threshold of A(v) similar to 5-10 mag. The threshold is similar to the star formation extinction threshold of A(v) similar to 7 mag proposed by recent work, suggesting a universal star formation extinction threshold among clouds within 500 pc to the Sun. A comparison between the Orion A cloud and a massive infrared dark cloud G28.37 +0.07 indicates that Orion A produces more dense gas within the extinction range 15 mag less than or similar to A(v) less than or similar to 60 mag. Using data from the CARMA-NRO Orion Survey, we find that dense cores in the integral-shaped filament (ISF) show subsonic core-to-envelope velocity dispersion that is significantly less than the local envelope line dispersion, similar to what has been found in nearby clouds. Dynamical analysis indicates that the cores are bound to the ISF. An oscillatory core-to-envelope motion is detected along the ISF. Its origin is to be further explored.

For accelerations above 10(10) m s(-2), g(obs), traces g(bar),asymptoting to the 1:1 line. Below this scale, there is a break in the relation such that g(obs) similar to g(bar)(1/2). We show that the RAR slope, scatter, and the acceleration scale are all natural consequences of the well-known baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). We further demonstrate that galaxies with a variety of baryonic and dark matter (DM) profiles and a wide range of dark halo and galaxy properties (well beyond those expected in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory) lie on the RAR if we simply require that their rotation curves satisfy the BTFR. We explore conditions needed to break this degeneracy: subkiloparsec resolved rotation curves inside of cored DM-dominated profiles and/or outside >> 100 kpc could lie on BTFR but deviate in the RAR, providing new constraints on DM.

These ice cloud properties are used as inputs for the NASA Langley modified Fu-Liou radiative transfer model to calculate cloud radiative heating rate profiles and are compared with the NASA CERES observed top-of-atmosphere fluxes. The radiative heating rate profiles calculated in the CloudSat/CALIPSO 2B-FLXHR-LIDAR and CCCM_CC products are also examined to assess consistency and uncertainty of their properties using independent methods. Based on the methods and definitions used herein, single-layered ice clouds have a global occurrence frequency of similar to 18%, with most of them occurring in the tropics above 12 km. Zonal mean cloud radiative heating rate profiles from the three datasets are similar in their patterns of SW warming and LW cooling with small differences in magnitude; nevertheless, all three datasets show that the strongest net heating (> + 1.0 K day(-1)) occurs in the tropics (latitude < 30 degrees) near the cloud-base while cooling occurs at higher latitudes (> similar to 50 degrees). Differences in radiative heating rates are also assessed based on composites of the 2C-ICE ice water path (IWP) and total column water vapor (TCWV) mixing ratio to facilitate model evaluation and guide ice cloud parameterization improvement. Positive net cloud radiative heating rates are maximized in the upper troposphere for large IWPs and large TCWV, with an uncertainty of 10-25% in the magnitude and vertical structure of this heating.

Carbon stocks in central African forests enhanced by elephant disturbance	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							LOPE RESERVE; BIOMASS; MEGAFAUNA; PLEISTOCENE; EXTINCTIONS; MORTALITY; IMPACTS; MAMMALS; TRAITS; TRADE	Large herbivores, such as elephants, can have important effects on ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Yet, the influence of elephants on the structure, productivity and carbon stocks in Africa's rainforests remain largely unknown. Here, we quantify those effects by incorporating elephant disturbance in the Ecosystem Demography model, and verify the modelled effects by comparing them with forest inventory data from two lowland primary forests in Africa. We find that the reduction of forest stem density due to the presence of elephants leads to changes in the competition for light, water and space among trees. These changes favour the emergence of fewer and larger trees with higher wood density. Such a shift in African's rainforest structure and species composition increases the long-term equilibrium of aboveground biomass. The shift also reduces the forest net primary productivity, given the trade-off between productivity and wood density. At a typical density of 0.5 to 1 animals per km(2), elephant disturbances increase aboveground biomass by 26-60 t ha(-1). Conversely, the extinction of forest elephants would result in a 7% decrease in the aboveground biomass in central African rainforests. These modelled results are confirmed by field inventory data. We speculate that the presence of forest elephants may have shaped the structure of Africa's rainforests, which probably plays an important role in differentiating them from Amazonian rainforests.

A framework for quantifying sustainable yield under California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable yield; California's Central Valley; Sustainable Groundwater Management Act; Groundwater Sustainability Plans; Undesirable results	WATER; FUTURE	In California, new groundwater legislation-the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)-mandates that groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) employ the concept of sustainable yield as their primary management goal. However, SGMA's current definition of sustainable yield does not offer clear guidance for new agencies and lacks grounding in physics. This study presents a novel hydrologically based framework for quantifying sustainable yield under SGMA that is derived from a synthesis of scientific inquiry and analysis. We introduce a flexible three-step approach that basin managers can rely on to quantify sustainable yield values, incorporate the impact of "undesirable results", and analyze groundwater sustainability over SGMA's implementation horizon. Our framework is illustrated through a case study of the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, a proposed GSA in one of California's critically overdrafted groundwater basins. We calculate sustainable yield for three different management scenarios and assess the impact of each scenario on future groundwater sustainability by performing an annual water groundwater balance through 2040. Our sustainable yield framework can be used as a basis for the development of SGMA's groundwater management plans throughout California.

Wayne; Franklin, Oskar			Nitrogen and phosphorus constrain the CO2 fertilization of global plant biomass	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							ELEVATED CO2; FOREST PRODUCTIVITY; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; MOJAVE DESERT; CARBON; RESPONSES; METAANALYSIS; CLIMATE; GROWTH; ENHANCEMENT	Elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) experiments provide critical information to quantify the effects of rising CO2 on vegetation 1-6 . Many eCO(2) experiments suggest that nutrient limitations modulate the local magnitude of the eCO(2) effect on plant biomass(1,3,5), but the global extent of these limitations has not been empirically quantified, complicating projections of the capacity of plants to take up CO27,9. Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO(2) effect on biomass based on 138 eCO(2) experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in similar to 65% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in similar to 25% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 +/- 3% above current values, equivalent to 59 +/- 13 PgC. The globalscale response to eCO(2) we derive from experiments is similar to past changes in greenness(9) and bio-mass(10) with rising CO2, suggesting that CO2 will continue to stimulate plant biomass in the future despite the constraining effect of soil nutrients. Our research reconciles conflicting evidence on CO2 fertilization across scales and provides an empirical estimate of the biomass sensitivity to eCO(2) that may help to constrain climate projections.

The torsional fundamental band and high-J rotational spectra of the ground, first and second excited torsional states of acetone	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Acetone; Microwave spectrum; Torsional fundamental band; Methyl top internal rotation	MILLIMETER; MOLECULES; MICROWAVE; CH3COCH3	We present a new global study of the millimeter, submillimeter and far-infrared (FIR) spectra involving the three lowest torsional states of acetone ((CH3)(2)CO). New microwave measurements have been carried out between 34 and 940 GHz using spectrometers in IRA NASU (Ukraine), and PhLAM Lille (France). The FIR spectrum of acetone has been recorded on the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. The new data involving torsion-rotation transitions with J up to 90 and K-a up to 52 were combined with previously published measurements and analyzed using a model developed recently to study the high resolution spectra of molecules with two equivalent methyl rotors and C-2v symmetry at equilibrium (PAM_C2v_2tops program). The final fit included 117 parameters to give an overall weighted root-mean-square deviation of 0.85 for the dataset consisting of 29,584 microwave and 1116 FIR line frequencies belonging, respectively, to the three lowest torsional states (v(12), v(17)) = (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and to the observed fundamental band associated with the methyl-top torsion mode (v(12), v(17)) = (0,1) <- (0,0). The high values of rotational quantum numbers involved in this study provide an opportunity to test the performance of the PAM_C2v_2tops program approach for the case of highly excited rotational states.

Whitecap and Wind Stress Observations by Microwave Radiometers: Global Coverage and Extreme Conditions	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Wave breaking; Wind stress; Wind waves; Severe storms; Microwave observations; Satellite observations	OCEAN SURFACE; DIELECTRIC-CONSTANT; MODEL FUNCTION; SEA-WATER; FRACTION; EMISSIVITY; DEPENDENCE; SCATTERING; ALGORITHM; ROUGHNESS	Whitecaps manifest surface wave breaking that impacts many ocean processes, of which surface wind stress is the driving force. For close to a half century of quantitative whitecap reporting, only a small number of observations are obtained under conditions with wind speed exceeding 25 m s(-1). Whitecap contribution is a critical component of ocean surface microwave thermal emission. In the forward solution of microwave thermal emission, the input forcing parameter is wind speed, which is used to generate the modeled surface wind stress, surface wave spectrum, and whitecap coverage necessary for the subsequent electromagnetic (EM) computation. In this respect, microwave radiometer data can be used to evaluate various formulations of the drag coefficient, whitecap coverage, and surface wave spectrum. In reverse, whitecap coverage and surface wind stress can be retrieved from microwave radiometer data by employing precalculated solutions of an analytical microwave thermal emission model that yields good agreement with field measurements. There are many published microwave radiometer datasets covering a wide range of frequency, incidence angle, and both vertical and horizontal polarizations, with maximum wind speed exceeding 90 m s(-1). These datasets provide information of whitecap coverage and surface wind stress from global oceans and in extreme wind conditions. Breaking wave energy dissipation rate per unit surface area can be estimated also by making use of its linear relationship with whitecap coverage derived from earlier studies.

H2O2 within Chaos Terrain on Europa's Leading Hemisphere	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: composition; planets and satellites: individual (Europa); planets and satellites: surfaces	HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; WATER ICE; SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; SURFACE; TEMPERATURE; RADIOLYSIS; ENERGY	Hydrogen peroxide is part of an important radiolytic cycle on Europa and may be a critical source of oxidants to the putative subsurface ocean. The surface geographic distribution of hydrogen peroxide may constrain the processes governing its abundance as well as its potential relevance to the subsurface chemistry. However, maps of Europa's hydrogen peroxide beyond hemispherical averages have never been published. Here, we present spatially resolved L-band (3.16-4 mu m) observations of Europa's 3.5 mu m hydrogen peroxide absorption, which we obtained using the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) and the adaptive optics system on the Keck II telescope. Using these data, we map the strength of the 3.5 mu m absorption across the surface at a nominal spatial resolution of similar to 300 km. Though previous disk-integrated data seemed consistent with the laboratory expectation that Europa's hydrogen peroxide exists primarily in its coldest and iciest regions, we find nearly the exact opposite at this finer spatial scale. Instead, we observe the largest hydrogen peroxide absorptions at low latitudes on the leading and anti-Jovian hemispheres, correlated with chaos terrain, and relative depletions toward the cold, icy high latitudes. This distribution may reflect the effects of decreased hydrogen peroxide destruction due to efficient electron scavenging by CO2 within chaos terrain.

Earth as an Exoplanet: A Two-dimensional Alien Map	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article							PLANETS; SEARCH	Resolving spatially varying exoplanet features from single-point light curves is essential for determining whether Earth-like worlds harbor geological features and/or climate systems that influence habitability. To evaluate the feasibility and requirements of this spatial-feature resolving problem, we present an analysis of multi-wavelength single-point light curves of Earth, where it plays the role of a proxy exoplanet. Here, similar to 10,000 Deep Space Climate Observatory/Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera frames collected over a two-year period were integrated over the Earth's disk to yield a spectrally dependent point source and analyzed using singular value decomposition. We found that, between the two dominant principal components (PCs), the second PC contains surface-related features of the planet, while the first PC mainly includes cloud information. We present the first two-dimensional (2D) surface map of Earth reconstructed from light curve observations without any assumptions of its spectral properties. This study serves as a baseline for reconstructing the surface features of Earth-like exoplanets in the future.

European Gravity Service for Improved Emergency Management (EGSIEM)-from concept to implementation	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Hydrology; Global change from geodesy; Satellite gravity; Time variable gravity	RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL; FIELD SOLUTIONS; MASS VARIABILITY; GRACE; MODEL; GPS; RELEASE; SCIENCE; TRENDS; OCEAN	Earth observation satellites yield a wealth of data for scientific, operational and commercial exploitation. However, the redistribution of mass in the system Earth is not yet part of the standard inventory of Earth Observation (EO) data products to date. It is derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO). Among many other applications, mass redistribution provides fundamental insights into the global water cycle. Changes in continental water storage impact the regional water budget and can, in extreme cases, result in floods and droughts that often claim a high toll on infrastructure, economy and human lives. The initiative for a European Gravity Service for Improved Emergency Management (EGSIEM) established three different prototype services to promote the unique value of mass redistribution products for Earth Observation in general and for early-warning systems in particular. The first prototype service is a scientific combination service to derive improved mass redistribution products from the combined knowledge of the European GRACE analysis centres. Second, the timeliness and reliability of such products is a primary concern for any early-warning system and therefore EGSIEM established a prototype for a near real-time service that provides dedicated gravity field information with a maximum latency of 5 d. Third, EGSIEM established a prototype of a hydrological/early warning service that derives wetness indices as indicators of hydrological extremes and assessed their potential for timely scheduling of high-resolution optical/radar satellites for follow-up observations in case of evolving hydrological extreme events.

Different types of vegetation, however, have unique signatures that evolve throughout the growing season. Without additional information, signals corresponding to individual vegetation types are unidentifiable from satellite measurements. In this paper, we propose a parametric mixture model to describe satellite data monitoring crop development in the US Corn Belt. The ground cover of each satellite footprint is primarily a mixture of corn and soybean. Using auxiliary data from multiple sources, we model the aggregate satellite signal, and identify the signatures of individual crop types, using nonlinear parametric functions. Estimation is performed using a Bayesian approach, and information from auxiliary data is incorporated into the prior distributions to identify distinct crop types. We demonstrate our parametric unmixing approach using data from the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. Lastly, we compare our model estimates for the timing of key crop phenological stages to USDA ground-based estimates. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

Multielement Separated Representations for Orbit Uncertainty Propagation	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							GENERALIZED POLYNOMIAL CHAOS; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS ANALYSIS; LEAST-SQUARES; APPROXIMATION; FLYBYS; MODEL	Uncertainty quantification is a valuable methodology in the field of astrodynamics, but approaches are often computationally expensive or rely on assumptions that do not account for non-Gaussian posteriors or the nonlinear evolution of the a priori uncertainty. Separated representations accurately estimate posterior distributions when using a sampling-based approach. Multimodal distributions, diffuse posteriors, or discontinuities pose convergence issues for the polynomial surrogate method of separated representations. Therefore, this paper presents the technique of multielement separated representations in order to overcome potential problems, such as the assumption of smooth and continuous behavior, present in unmodified separated representations. The decomposition of the input space as well as the construction of multielement surrogates are explained. This paper provides equations for determining if an input space split is necessary and where it should occur. The resulting algorithm is applied to four test cases in order to compare performance against unmodified separated representations. The first case considers a two-dimensional iteration of the Kraichnan-Orszag problem. Next, a Molniya case is examined with 6 and 10 input directions. Lastly, a multielement surrogate is created to estimate the posterior distribution of a third-body orbit over a continuous time span.

New Horizons Sci Team	Phase Curves from the Kuiper Belt: Photometric Properties of Distant Kuiper Belt Objects Observed by New Horizons	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Kuiper Belt objects: individual	DISK-INTEGRATED PHOTOMETRY; SCATTERING PROPERTIES; IRREGULAR SATELLITES; ICY BODIES; SURFACE; OPPOSITION; PHOEBE; URANUS; ALBEDO; IMAGER	Prior to its close encounter with the Kuiper Belt object (KBO) (486958) 2014 MU69 on 2019 January 1, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft observed other KBOs from distances greater than 0.1 au at solar phase angles far larger than those attainable from Earth. The expanded range in phase angle afforded by these distant KBO (DKBO) observations enables comparisons between their phase functions and those of other solar system objects. Here we present extended New Horizons phase angle coverage of plutino (15810) Arawn (1994 JR1) to 131 degrees, resonant KBO 2012 HE85 to 64 degrees, scattered disk KBO 2011 HK103 to 124 degrees, hot classical (515977) 2012 HZ(84) to 73 degrees, and cold classical KBOs 2011 HJ(103) and 2011 JY(31) to 27 degrees and 122 degrees, respectively. In general, DKBO solar phase curves have slopes (i. e., phase coefficients) and shapes (with corresponding phase integrals q) similar to those of other dark, small solar system objects including comet nuclei, asteroids, and satellites. Until stellar occultations by these DKBOs provide information about their size, geometric albedos p (and Bond albedos A = pq) must be inferred from the median albedos measured by thermal radiometry for each dynamical class. Bond albedos for these DKBOs range from 0.01 to 0.04. Cold classical JY(31) has a slightly lower slope and higher phase integral than the other DKBOs, and its slope and phase integral come closest to matching those of cold classical MU69, suggesting that cold classical KBOs share surface scattering characteristics that are distinct from those of other KBOs.

J	Huang, HJ; Eifler, T; Mandelbaum, R; Dodelson, S				Huang, Hung-Jin; Eifler, Tim; Mandelbaum, Rachel; Dodelson, Scott			Modelling baryonic physics in future weak lensing surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmological parameters; cosmology: theory; large-scale structure of Universe	LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; GALACTIC NUCLEUS FEEDBACK; ACCURATE HALO-MODEL; GALAXY FORMATION; COSMIC SHEAR; DARK ENERGY; HYDRODYNAMICAL SIMULATIONS; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS	Modifications of the matter power spectrum due to baryonic physics are one of the major theoretical uncertainties in cosmological weak lensing measurements. Developing robust mitigation schemes for this source of systematic uncertainty increases the robustness of cosmological constraints, and may increase their precision if they enable the use of information from smaller scales. Here we explore the performance of two mitigation schemes for baryonic effects in weak lensing cosmic shear: the principal component analysis (PCA) method and the halo-model approach in HMCODE. We construct mock tomographic shear power spectra from four hydrodynamical simulations, and run simulated likelihood analyses with COSMOLIKE assuming LSST-like survey statistics. With an angular scale cut of l(max) < 2000, both methods successfully remove the biases in cosmological parameters due to the various baryonic physics scenarios, with the PCA method causing less degradation in the parameter constraints than HMCODE. For a more aggressive l(max) = 5000, the PCA method performs well for all but one baryonic physics scenario, requiring additional training simulations to account for the extreme baryonic physics scenario of Illustris; HMCODE exhibits tensions in the 2D posterior distributions of cosmological parameters due to lack of freedom in describing the power spectrum for k > 10 h(-1) Mpc. We investigate variants of the PCA method and improve the bias mitigation through PCA by accounting for the noise properties in the data via Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. Our improved PCA method allows us to retain more statistical constraining power while effectively mitigating baryonic uncertainties even for a broad range of baryonic physics scenarios.

An emission spectrum forWASP-121b measured across the 0.8-1.1 mu m wavelength range using the Hubble Space Telescope	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: spectroscopic; planets and satellites: atmospheres	THERMAL EMISSION; EXOPLANET; HOT; ATMOSPHERES; WATER	WASP-121b is a transiting gas giant exoplanet orbiting close to its Roche limit, with an inflated radius nearly double that of Jupiter and a dayside temperature comparable to a late M dwarf photosphere. Secondary eclipse observations covering the 1.1-1.6 mu m wavelength range have revealed an atmospheric thermal inversion on the dayside hemisphere, likely caused by high-altitude absorption at optical wavelengths. Here we present secondary eclipse observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrograph that extend the wavelength coverage from 1.1 mu m down to 0.8 mu m. To determine the atmospheric properties from the measured eclipse spectrum, we performed a retrieval analysis assuming chemical equilibrium, with the effects of thermal dissociation and ionization included. Our best-fitting model provides a good fit to the data with reduced chi(2)(nu) = 1.04. The data diverge from a blackbody spectrum and instead exhibit emission due to H- shortward of 1.1 mu m. The best-fitting model does not reproduce a previously reported bump in the spectrum at 1.25 mu m, possibly indicating this feature is a statistical fluctuation in the data rather than a VO emission band as had been tentatively suggested. We estimate an atmospheric metallicity of [M/H] = 1.09(-0.69)(+0.57), and fit for the carbon and oxygen abundances separately, obtaining [C/H] = -0.29(-0.48)(+0.61) and [O/H] = 0.18(-0.60)(+0.64). The corresponding carbon-to-oxygen ratio is C/O = 0.49(-0.37)(+0.65), which encompasses the solar value of 0.54, but has a large uncertainty.

This constitutes the longest available uninterrupted oceanographic time series in the Mediterranean Sea. The present contribution focuses on observed climatic trends in temperature (degrees C/year) of air (AT; 0.05), sea surface (SST; 0.03), sea at 80 m depth (S80T; 0.02) and sea level (SL; 3.1 mm/year) as well as comparison with trends estimated from coincident high-resolution satellite data. The trending evolution is not uniform across seasons, being significantly higher in spring for both AT and SST, while in autumn for S80T. Other climatological results are a stratification increase (0.02 degrees C/year in summer temperature difference between 20 m (S20T) and S80T), trends in summer conditions at sea (when S20T > 18 degrees C), estimated as 0.5 and 0.9 days/year for the starting day and period respectively, and a decreasing trend of nearly 2 days/year in the period of conditions favourable for marine evaporation (when AT < SST). This last trend may be related to the observed decrease of coastal precipitation in spring. The long-term consistency in the in situ SST measurements presents an opportunity to validate the multi-decadal trends. The good agreement for 2013-2018 (RMS 0.5-0.6, bias - 0.1 to - 0.2; trends of 0.09 degrees C/year in situ vs. 0.06 to 0.08 degrees C/year from satellite) allows considering this observational site as ground truth for satellite observations and a monitoring site for climate change.

Representing and perceiving these areas to reason about potential contact between a robot and its surrounding environment, is still largely an open problem. This paper introduces a new framework to model and map local rough terrain surfaces, for tasks such as bipedal robot foot placement. The system operates in real-time, on data from an RGB-D and an IMU sensor. We introduce a set of parametrized patch models and an algorithm to fit them in the environment. Potential contacts are identified as bounded curved patches of approximately the same size as the robot's foot sole. This includes sparse seed point sampling, point cloud neighborhood search, and patch fitting and validation. We also present a mapping and tracking system, where patches are maintained in a local spatial map around the robot as it moves. A bio-inspired sampling algorithm is introduced for finding salient contacts. We include a dense volumetric fusion layer for spatiotemporally tracking, using multiple depth data to reconstruct a local point cloud. We present experimental results on a mini-biped robot that performs foot placements on rocks, implementing a 3D foothold perception system, that uses the developed patch mapping and tracking framework.

KMTNet Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration; MOA Collaboration; CFHT Collaboration; UKIRT Microlensing Team	OGLE-2018-BLG-1011Lb,c: Microlensing Planetary System with Two Giant Planets Orbiting a Low-mass Star	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems	JUPITER/SATURN ANALOG; BINARY-SOURCE; PHOTOMETRY; EVENTS; DISCOVERY; MIGRATION; ROTATION; LENS	We report a multiplanetary system found from the analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2018-BLG-1011, for which the light curve exhibits a double-bump anomaly around the peak. We find that the anomaly cannot be fully explained by the binary-lens or binary-source interpretations and its description requires the introduction of an additional lens component. The 3L1S (three lens components and a single source) modeling yields three sets of solutions, in which one set of solutions indicates that the lens is a planetary system in a binary, while the other two sets imply that the lens is a multiplanetary system. By investigating the fits of the individual models to the detailed light curve structure, we find that the multiple-planet solution with planet-to-host mass ratios similar to 9.5 x 10(-3) and similar to 15 x 10(-3) are favored over the other solutions. From the Bayesian analysis, we find that the lens is composed of two planets with masses 1.8(-1.1)(+3.4) M-J and 2.8(-1.7)(+5.1) MJ around a host with a mass -0.18(-0.33)(+0.10) M-circle dot and located at a distance 7.1(-1.5)(+1.1)kpc. The estimated distance indicates that the lens is the farthest system among the known multiplanetary systems. The projected planet-host separations are a perpendicular to,2 = 1.8(-1.5)(+2.1) au (0.8(-0.6)(+0.9)au) and = a perpendicular to, 3 =0.8(-0.6)(+0.9) au, where the values of a perpendicular to, 2 inside and outside the parenthesis are the separations corresponding to the two degenerate solutions, indicating that both planets are located beyond the snow line of the host, as with the other four multiplanetary systems previously found by microlensing.

J	Devaud, C; Bushe, WK; Bellan, J				Devaud, Cecile; Bushe, W. Kendal; Bellan, Josette			The modeling of the turbulent reaction rate under high-pressure conditions: A priori evaluation of the Conditional Source-term Estimation concept	COMBUSTION AND FLAME			English	Article						High-pressure combustion; Modeling; CSE; Chemical source term; DNS	MASS DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; MOMENT CLOSURE; EXTINCTION; REIGNITION	With the goal of obtaining an accurate model of the turbulent reaction rate for Large Eddy Simulations (LESS), the modeling of turbulence-chemistry-thermodynamic interaction is addressed through an a priori study of a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database representing high-pressure turbulent combustion. The DNS database consists of simulations of a temporal mixing layer in which a single-step chemical reaction occurs. The potential of the single-conditioned Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) approach to model the filtered turbulent reaction rate needed for conducting LES is examined. Evaluations conducted with the mixture fraction as a conditioning variable at two filter widths and with the probability density function (PDF) extracted from the DNS database that represents the mixture fraction, show that the deviation between the model and template is large and substantially increases with filter width. To address this deviation, the Double-conditioned CSE (DCSE) approach is explored with two different second conditioning variables, the first conditioning variable still being the mixture fraction; four filter widths are considered. The first choice of the second conditioning variable is a normalized progress variable based on the CO2 mass fraction and the second choice of the second conditioning variable is a normalized temperature. With each second conditional variable, the DCSE results represent a substantial improvement over CSE, by as much as an order of magnitude when measured by the relative error from the DNS-extracted filtered reaction rate. A quantitative test based on a root mean square identifies the reason for the DCSE success compared to CSE: unlike in CSE, the DCSE is able to substantially reduce the fluctuations of the modeled reaction rate from the filtered reaction rate over the entire range of the filtered reaction rate values, and particularly at the larger reaction rate values for which the DCSE model has higher fidelity. The results are shown to be equally favorable for the two conditioning variables. Consideration of DNS realizations at higher free-stream pressure or larger Reynolds number shows that the results are essentially equally successful at other pressure or Reynolds number values.

J	Smalley, M; Suselj, K; Lebsock, M; Teixeira, J				Smalley, Mark; Suselj, Kay; Lebsock, Matthew; Teixeira, Joao			A Novel Framework for Evaluating and Improving Parameterized Subtropical Marine Boundary Layer Cloudiness	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article						Marine boundary layer; Remote sensing; Satellite observations; Cloud parameterizations; Model evaluation; performance; Subgrid-scale processes	EDDY-DIFFUSIVITY PARAMETERIZATION; PART I; CUMULUS; MODEL; STRATOCUMULUS; CLOUDS; ENERGY; FLUX; TRANSITIONS; FORMULATION	A single-column model (SCM) is used to simulate a variety of environmental conditions between Los Angeles, California, and Hawaii in order to identify physical elements of parameterizations that are required to reproduce the observed behavior of marine boundary layer (MBL) cloudiness. The SCM is composed of the JPL eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux (EDMF) mixing formulation and the RRTMG radiation model. Model forcings are provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2). Simulated low cloud cover (LCC), rain rate, albedo, and liquid water path are compared to collocated pixel-level observations from A-Train satellites. This framework ensures that the JPL EDMF is able to simulate a continuum of real-world conditions. First, the JPL EDMF is shown to reproduce the observed mean LCC as a function of lower-tropospheric stability. Joint probability distributions of lower-tropospheric cloud fraction, height, and lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) show that the JPL EDMF improves upon its MERRA2 input but struggles to match the frequency of observed intermediate-range LCC. We then illustrate the physical roles of plume lateral entrainment and eddy-diffusivity mixing length in producing a realistic behavior of LCC as a function of LTS. In low-LTS conditions, LCC is mostly sensitive to the ability of convection to mix moist air out of the MBL. In high-LTS conditions, LCC is also sensitive to the turbulent mixing of free-tropospheric air into the MBL. In the intermediate LTS regime typical of stratocumulus-cumulus transition there is proportional sensitivity to both mixing mechanisms, emphasizing the utility of a combined eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux approach for representing mixing processes.

With continuous 0.5-7.8 mu m coverage from both FGS (0.5-0.6, 0.6-0.81, and 0.81-1.1 mu m photometry; 1.1-1.95 mu m spectroscopy) and AIRS (1.95-7.80 mu m spectroscopy), ARIEL will determine atmospheric compositions and probe planetary formation histories during its 3.5 yr mission. NASA's proposed Contribution to ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets (CASE) would be a subsystem of ARIEL' s Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) instrument consisting of two visible-to-infrared detectors, associated readout electronics, and thermal control hardware. FGS, to be built by the Polish Academy of Sciences Space Research Centre, will provide both fine guiding and visible to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, providing powerful diagnostics of atmospheric aerosol contribution and planetary albedo, which play a crucial role in establishing planetary energy balance. The CASE team presents here an independent study of the capabilities of ARIEL to measure exoplanetary metallicities, which probe the conditions of planet formation, and FGS to measure scattering spectral slopes, which indicate if an exoplanet has atmospheric aerosols (clouds and hazes), and geometric albedos, which help establish planetary climate. Our simulations assume that ARIEL's performance will be 1.3 x the photon-noise limit. This value is motivated by current transiting exoplanet observations: Spitzer/IRAC and Hubble/WFC3 have empirically achieved 1.15 x the photon-noise limit. One could expect similar performance from ARIEL, JWST, and other proposed future missions such as HabEx, LUVOIR, and Origins. Our design reference mission simulations show that ARIEL could measure the mass-metallicity relationship of its 1000-planet single-visit sample to >7.5 sigma and that FGS could distinguish between clear, cloudy, and hazy skies and constrain an exoplanet's atmospheric aerosol composition to greater than or similar to 5 sigma for hundreds of targets, providing statistically transformative science for exoplanet atmospheres.

Modification of fumarolic gases by the ice-covered edifice of Erebus volcano, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Fumarolic ice caves; Volcanic degassing; Carbon dioxide; Erebus volcano	CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; RIFT SYSTEM; ERUPTIVE HISTORY; MANTLE PLUME; ROSS ISLAND; LONG-TERM; SOIL CO2; NITROGEN; DIOXIDE; WATER	The chemistry of gases measured in ice caves and from warm geothermal ground at Erebus volcano, Antarctica, shows that gas emissions are dominated by air, with varying amounts of added volcanic CO2. This suggests widespread circulation of air through the volcanic edifice, as well as spatially or temporally varying contributions from magmatic degassing. The resulting gases are further modified by two processes. The first is CO2 dissolution in water, resulting in fractionation from magmatic delta C-13-CO2 values, which are estimated to be around -4%., to heavier values, up to 1%.. Assuming all magmatic CO2 is dissolved in neutral water as HCOi', this requires hydrothermal temperatures of over 120 degrees C. However, other phases such as calcite may be present, implying even higher temperatures, while lower water pH values could result in similar isotope ratios at much lower temperatures, such as 60 degrees C at pH of 53. A large proportion of magmatic CO2 must be lost to this hydrothermal system or to mixing with air. The hydrothermal influence is localized to certain areas on the volcano, which may be associated with high velocity zones identified in previous studies by seismic tomography. Two sites with stronger magmatic signatures, by contrast, are above low velocity zones representing possible shallow magma storage. The second modification is the removal of oxygen from both deeply-sourced and air-derived gases. This is likely due to prevailing conditions in the subsurface, as it is independent of the original source of the gases and of hydrothermal modifications; and thus may affect sites with magmatic, air-like, or hydrothermal signatures.

Thermophysical Modeling of NEOWISE Observations of DESTINY+ Targets Phaethon and 2005 UD	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets; asteroids: individual (Phaethon, 2005 UD)	ASTEROIDS	Thermophysical models allow for improved constraints on the physical and thermal surface properties of asteroids beyond what can be inferred from more simple thermal modeling, provided that a sufficient number of observations is available. We present thermophysical modeling results of observations from the Near-Earth Object WISE (NEOWISE) mission for two near-Earth asteroids which are the targets of the DESTINY+ flyby mission: (3200) Phaethon and (155140) 2005 UD. Our model assumes a rotating, cratered, spherical surface, and employs a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to explore the multidimensional parameter space of the fit. We find an effective spherical diameter for Phaethon of 4.6(-0.3)(+0.2) km, a geometric albedo of p(v) = 0.16 +/- 0.02, and a thermal inertia Gamma = 880(-330)(+580), using five epochs of NEOWISE observations. The best model fit for (155140) 2005 UD was less well constrained due to only having two NEOWISE observation epochs, giving a diameter of 1.2 +/- 0.4 km and a geometric albedo of p(v) = 0.14 +/- 0.09.

Background: Prior research on procedural work that directly compared augmented reality instructions to traditional instruction methods (e.g., paper) showed that augmented reality instructions can enhance procedural work, but this was not true for simple tasks in an operational setting. Method: Participants completed simple procedural tasks on spaceflight hardware using an augmented reality instruction method and a paper instruction method. Results: Our results showed that the augmented reality instruction method resulted in faster task completion times and lower levels of mental and temporal demand compared with paper instructions. When participants used the augmented reality instruction method before the paper instruction method, there was a transfer of training that improved a subsequent procedure using the paper instruction method. Conclusion: An off-the-shelf augmented reality head-mounted display (HoloLens) can enhance procedural work for simple tasks in an operational setting. Application: The ability of augmented reality to enhance procedural work for simple tasks in an operational setting can help in reducing costs and mitigating risks that could ultimately lead to accidents and critical failures.

Satellite remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous information that can be used for global ET estimation. The NASA MODIS MOD16A2 operational product provides 500-m 8-day global ET estimates extending from 2001 to present. However, reliable estimates for delineating field level cropland ET patterns are lacking. In this investigation, we modified the MOD16 global algorithm to better represent cropland ET by calibrating model parameters according to C3 and C4 crop types, and incorporating finer scale satellite vegetation inputs to derive 30-m cropland ET estimates over the continental USA (CONUS). Similar overlapping enhanced vegetation index (EVI) records from Landsat and MODIS were used to generate a continuous 30-m 8-day fused EVI and ET record extending from 2008 to 2017 over CONUS croplands. The satellite-based ET estimates were compared with tower based ET observations over different crop types, and more traditional cropland actual ET (AET) estimates derived from reference ET and crop-specific coefficients. The new satellite based 30-m cropland ET estimates (ET30m) corresponded favorably with both tower ET observations (ETflux; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.70 mm d(-1), bias = 0.04 mm d(-1)) and the baseline global MOD16A2 ET product (ETMOD16). The ET30m results also showed better performance against the ETflux observations than ETMOD16 (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.82 mm d(-1)) or AET (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 2.47 mm d(-1)) for monitoring CONUS croplands. The spatial and temporal patterns of the ET3m results show enhanced delineation of agricultural water use, including impacts from variable climate, cropland area and diversity. The resulting ET30m record is suitable for operational applications promoting more effective agricultural water management and food security.

The ECOSTRESS spectral library version 1.0	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Spectroscopy; Visible shortwave infrared (VIS/SWIR); Thermal infrared (TIR); Spectral library; Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV); Vegetation	LEAF WATER-CONTENT; MU-M; INFRARED REFLECTANCE; EMISSIVITY; VEGETATION; CANOPY; TEMPERATURE; RETRIEVAL; SCIENCE; MODELS	In June 2018, the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission was launched to measure plant temperatures and better understand how they respond to stress. While the ECOSTRESS mission delivers imagery with similar to 60 m spatial resolution, it is often useful to have spectra at the leaf level in order to explain variability seen at the pixel level. As it was originally titled, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spectral library version 2.0 has been expanded to support ECOSTRESS studies by including major additions of laboratory measured vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) spectra. The library now contains 541 leaf visible shortwave infrared (VIS/SWIR) spectra, 472 leaf thermal infrared (TIR) spectra, and 51 NPV VIS/SWIR and TIR spectra. Previously, the library primarily contained VSWIR and TIR laboratory spectra of minerals, rocks, and man-made materials. This new library, containing over 3000 spectra, was renamed the ECOSTRESS spectral library version 1.0 and is publicly available (http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov). It should be noted that as with the prior versions of the library, the VSWIR and TIR measurements were made with separate instruments with different calibration sources. Care should be taken when combining the data into a seamless spectrum to cover the entire spectral range. The ECOSTRESS spectral library provides a comprehensive collection of natural and man-made laboratory collected spectra covering the wavelength range of 0.35-15.4 mu m.

An Arctic sea ice multi-step classification based on GNSS-R data from the TDS-1 mission	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Bistatic radar; GNSS-reflectometry; TDS-1; Sea ice; Open water ice classification; Ice type classification	SENTINEL-1 SAR; RADAR; MICROWAVE; REFLECTOMETRY; BACKSCATTER; RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHM; BEAUFORT; SIGNALS; IMAGERY	This study examines the potential of using bistatic radar reflections from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to classify sea ice types in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice formation period. For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against SAR-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice-open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types. With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors. In order to determine the use of GNSS-R measurements on an operational basis, further studies are needed over a year-long period of sea ice growth and melt to determine the full benefit of GNSS for improving and providing complementary information to that generated by both microwave and optical sensors.

Zuccaro			Ultra-violet imaging of the night-time earth by EUSO-Balloon towards space-based ultra-high energy cosmic ray observations	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						EUSO-Balloon; JEM-EUSO; Ultra-high energy cosmic ray; Extensive air shower; Airglow	DETECTOR; FLUORESCENCE; NIGHTGLOW; ARRAY	The JEM-EUSO (Joint Experiment Missions for the Extreme Universe Space Observatory) program aims at developing Ultra-Violet (UV) fluorescence telescopes for efficient detections of Extensive Air Showers (EASs) induced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) from satellite orbit. In order to demonstrate key technologies for JEM-EUSO, we constructed the EUSO-Balloon instrument that consists of a similar to 1 m(2) refractive telescope with two Fresnel lenses and an array of multi-anode photo-multiplier tubes at the focus. Distinguishing it from the former balloon-borne experiments, EUSO-Balloon has the capabilities of single photon counting with a gate time of 2.3 mu s and of imaging with a total of 2304 pixels. As a pathfinder mission, the instrument was launched for an 8 h stratospheric flight on a moonless night in August 2014 over Timmins, Canada. In this work, we analyze the count rates over similar to 2.5 h intervals. The measurements are of diffuse light, e.g. of airglow emission, back-scattered from the Earth's atmosphere as well as artificial light sources. Count rates from such diffuse light are a background for EAS detections in future missions and relevant factor for the analysis of EAS events. We also obtain the geographical distribution of the count rates over a similar to 780 km(2) area along the balloon trajectory. In developed areas, light sources such as the airport, mines, and factories are clearly identified. This demonstrates the correct location of signals that will be required for the EAS analysis in future missions. Although a precise determination of count rates is relevant for the existing instruments, the absolute intensity of diffuse light is deduced for the limited conditions by assuming spectra models and considering simulations of the instrument response. Based on the study of diffuse light by EUSO-Balloon, we also discuss the implications for coming pathfinders and future space-based UHECR observation missions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

H-3(+) characteristics in the Jupiter atmosphere as observed at limb with Juno/JIRAM	ICARUS			English	Article							AURORAL EMISSION; MODEL; IONOSPHERE; TEMPERATURE; DENSITY; INFLUX; WATER; ION	NASA's Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since August 2016, providing unprecedented insights into the giant planet's atmosphere. The Jupiter Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) experiment on board Juno has made spectroscopic observations of the trihydrogen cation (H-3(+)) emissions in both northern and southern auroral regions (Dinelli et al., 2017; Adriani et al., 2017; Mura et al., 2017) and at mid-to-low latitudes (this paper). Observations targeting the limb of the planet from 60 North to 60 South latitudes were acquired with JIRAM's spectrometer in August 2016 and March 2017. We use these observations to characterize, for the first time, the vertical distribution of the H-3(+) emissions as a function of latitude across Jupiter's dayside. H-3(+) emission features in the 3-4 mu m spectral band were used to retrieve the H-3(+) volume mixing ratio (VMR) and atmospheric temperatures as a function of altitude. The H-3(+) density profile has a quasi-symmetric distribution with latitude, decreasing from 5 x 10(4) cm(-3) at 300 km to 2 x 10(3) cm(-3) at 650 km altitude above the 1-bar level (column densities of 3.5 x 10(12) cm(-2) to 1.4 x 10(11) cm(-2), assuming a 700 km column depth). The H-3(+) VMR is higher in the Southern hemisphere than in the North with values at 500 km of similar to 4 x 10(-4) ppmv at 40 degrees N and similar to 8 x 10(-4) ppmv at 40 degrees S. Retrieved temperatures increase almost monotonically with increasing altitude, hovering around 400 K at 300 km and > 900 K at about 700 km.

Most aerosol studies to date have used low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), with a maximum of one or two overpass daylight times per day from midlatitudes to low latitudes. Thus, the demand for new GEO observations with high temporal resolution and improved accuracy has been significant. In this study the latest versions of aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from three LEO sensors - MODIS (Dark Target, Deep Blue, and MAIAC), MISR, and the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), along with two GEO sensors (GOCI and AHI), are validated, compared, and integrated for a period during the Korea-United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ) field campaign from 1 May to 12 June 2016 over East Asia. The AOD products analyzed here generally have high accuracy with high R (0.84-0.93) and low RMSE (0.12-0.17), but their error characteristics differ according to the use of several different surface-reflectance estimation methods. High-accuracy near-real-time GOCI and AHI measurements facilitate the detection of rapid AOD changes, such as smoke aerosol transport from Russia to Japan on 18-21 May 2016, heavy pollution transport from China to the Korean Peninsula on 25 May 2016, and local emission transport from the Seoul Metropolitan Area to the Yellow Sea in South Korea on 5 June 2016. These high-temporal-resolution GEO measurements result in more representative daily AOD values and make a greater contribution to a combined daily AOD product assembled by median value selection with a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid resolution. The combined AOD is spatially continuous and has a greater number of pixels with high accuracy (fraction within expected error range of 0.61) than individual products. This study characterizes aerosol measurements from LEO and GEO satellites currently in operation over East Asia, and the results presented here can be used to evaluate satellite measurement bias and air quality models.

Landscape-level validation of allometric relationships for carbon stock estimation reveals bias driven by soil type	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						aboveground biomass; allometric equation; carbon stocks; central African rainforest; Michaelis-Menten model; Weibull model	HEIGHT-DIAMETER MODELS; TROPICAL FORESTS; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; TREE ALLOMETRY; NUTRIENTS; LIANAS; SPRUCE; COVER	Mitigation of climate change depends on accurate estimation and mapping of terrestrial carbon stocks, particularly in carbon dense tropical forests. Allometric equations can be used to robustly estimate biomass of tropical trees, but often require tree height, which is frequently unknown. Researchers and practitioners must, therefore, decide whether to directly measure a subset of tree heights to develop diameter : height (D:H) equations or rely on previously published generic equations. To date, studies comparing the two approaches have been spatially restricted and/or not randomly allocated across the landscape of interest, making the implications of deciding whether or not to measure tree heights difficult to determine. To address this issue, we use inventory data from a systematic-random forest inventory across Gabon (102 forest sites; 42,627 trees, including 7,036 height-measured trees). Using plot-specific models of D:H as a benchmark, we compare the performance of a suite of locally fitted and commonly used generic models (parameterized national, georegional, and pantropical equations) across a variety of scales, and assess which abiotic, anthropogenic, and topographical covariates contribute the most to bias in height estimation. We reveal marked spatial structure in the magnitude and direction of bias in tree height estimation using all generic models, due at least in part to soil type, which compounded to substantial error in site-level AGB estimates (of up to 38% or 150 Mg/ha). However, two generic pantropical models (Chave 2014; Feldpausch 2012) converged to within 2.5% of mean AGB at the landscape scale. Our results suggest that some (not all) pantropical equations can extrapolate AGB across large spatial scales with minimal bias in estimated mean AGB. However, extreme caution must be taken when interpreting the AGB estimates from generic models at the site-level as they fail to capture substantial spatial variation in D:H relationships, which could lead to dramatic under- or over-estimation of site-level carbon stocks. Validated allometric models derived at site- or soil-type-levels may be the best way to reduce such biases arising from landscape-level heterogeneity in D:H model fit in the Afrotropics.

The discussion briefly touches on the important post-war contributions of three key individuals who were instrumental in developing cloud physics into a global science. These contributions came on the heels of the post-war weather modification efforts that influenced much of the early development of cloud physics. The review is centred on the properties of warm clouds primarily to limit the scope of the article and the connection between the early contributions to cloud physics and the current vexing problem of aerosol effects on cloud albedo is underlined. Progress toward estimating cloud properties from space and insights on warm cloud processes are described. Measurements of selected cloud properties, such as cloud liquid water path are now mature enough that multi-decadal time series of these properties exist and this climatology is used to compare to analogous low-cloud properties taken from global climate models. The too-wet (and thus too bright) and the too-dreary biases of models are called out underscoring the challenges we still face in representing warm clouds in Earth system models. We also provide strategies for using observations to constrain the indirect radiative forcing of the climate system.

Determining the depairing current in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article								We estimate the depairing current of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) by studying the dependence of the nanowires' kinetic inductance on their bias current. The kinetic inductance is determined by measuring the resonance frequency of resonator-style nanowire coplanar waveguides both in transmission and reflection configurations. Bias current dependent shifts in the measured resonant frequency correspond to the change in the kinetic inductance, which can be compared with theoretical predictions. We demonstrate that the fast relaxation model described in the literature accurately matches our experimental data and provides a valuable tool for determination of the depairing current. Accurate measurement of the depairing current is critical for nanowire quality analysis, as well as modeling efforts aimed at understanding the detection mechanism in SNSPDs.

Using an approximate numerical scheme, we model the complete spasing system as an open quantum system under the Lindblad dissipator formalism. We show that while in general the longitudinal dimer setups display higher intensity spasing as compared with transverse dimers, the latter actually consistently lead to output with higher coherence. Intriguingly, and somewhat counterintuitively, we find that transverse dimers only reach peak output at an intermediate dimer separation at which field confinement is not the strongest. We show that this is due to low radiative decay rates of transverse dimers with significant dimer gaps. We also find that transverse dimers outperform longitudinal dimers in terms of output intensity in a weakly pumped sparse gain medium made of dimers with relatively large separations. Moreover, in all the configurations considered, we find that the second-order coherence of the spasing output shows a peaked behavior just before the threshold, suggesting that the coherence is a useful indicator of spasing. Even though the scheme we describe is focused on dimers, owing to the generic form of the analysis presented, it can be easily extended to investigate spasing in the bright modes of multiple coupled plasmon sources.

Jovian Injections Observed at High Latitude	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MAGNETIC-FIELD; ELECTRON; JUPITER; MAGNETOSPHERE; ACCELERATION; SIGNATURES; AURORA; INNER	The polar orbit of Juno at Jupiter provides a unique opportunity to observe high-latitude energetic particle injections. We measure energy-dispersed impulsive injections of protons and electrons. Ion injection signatures are just as prevalent as electron signatures, contrary to previous equatorial observations. Included are previously unreported observations of high-energy banded structures believed to be remnants of much earlier injections, where the particles have had time to disperse around Jupiter. A model fit of the injections used to estimate timing fits the shape of the proton signatures better than it does the electron shapes, suggesting that electrons and protons are different in their abilities to escape the injection region. We present ultaviolet observations of Jupiter's aurora and discuss the relationship between auroral injection features and in situ injection events. We find, unexpectedly, that the presence of in situ particle injections does not necessarily result in auroral injection signatures.	[Haggerty, D. K.; Mauk, B. H.; Paranicas, C.

Visibility and Line-of-Sight Extinction Estimates in Gale Crates During the 2018/MY34 Global Dust Storm	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							OPTICAL DEPTH; MARS; AEROSOL; NAVCAM	Northern line-of-sight extinction within Gale Crater during the 2018 global dust storm was monitored daily using Mars Science Laboratory's Navcam. Additional observations with Mastcam (north) and Navcam (all directions) were obtained at a lower cadence. Using feature identification and georeferencing, extinction was estimated in all possible directions. Peak extinction of >1.1 km(-1) was measured between sols 2086 and 2090, an order of magnitude higher than previous maxima. Northern and western directions show an initial decrease, followed by a secondary peak in extinction, not seen in column opacity measurements. Due to foreground topography, eastern direction results are provided only as limits, and southern results were indeterminable. Mastcam red and green filter results agree well, but blue filter results show higher extinctions, likely due to low signal-to-noise. Morning results are systematically higher than afternoon results, potentially indicative of atmospheric mixing. Plain Language Summary Once roughly every 3 Mars Years (5.5 Earth Years), Mars undergoes a dust storm so large it wraps around the planet, called a global dust storm. One of these storms occurred in 2018. The Curiosity Rover was able to operate throughout the storm and provided a unique view from the surface. During the 2018 storm, Curiosity obtained daily images which were used to measure how far the rover could see in one or more directions and, from that, monitor the dust within Gale Crater. At the peak of the storm, visibility was reduced to less than 3 km-for comparison, the crater rim, which sits approximately 30 km away, is visible at most times of year. In northern and western directions, visibility improved temporarily 15-20 Mars Days after the peak of the storm before worsening again and then slowly improving through to the end of the storm. Foreground features blocked sections in the east and south from view so only constraints could be placed on the eastern directions and nothing could be determined for the south. Morning visibility was worse than afternoon/evening visibility, which might be caused by atmospheric mixing processes.

The Methane Diurnal Variation and Microseepage Flux at Gale Crater, Mars as Constrained by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Curiosity Observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MARTIAN DUST DEVILS; OXIDANT ENHANCEMENT; SURFACE; ROVER; STORMS; LIFE; REMS	The upper bound of 50 parts per trillion by volume for Mars methane above 5 km established by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, substantially lower than the 410 parts per trillion by volume average measured overnight by the Curiosity Rover, places a strong constraint on the daytime methane flux at the Gale crater. We propose that these measurements may be largely reconciled by the inhibition of mixing near the surface overnight, whereby methane emitted from the subsurface accumulates within meters of the surface before being mixed below detection limits at dawn. A model of this scenario allows the first precise calculation of microseepage fluxes at Gale to be derived, consistent with a constant 1.5 x 10(-10) kg.m(-2).sol(-1) (5.4 x 10(-5) tonnes.km(-2).year(-1)) source at depth. Under this scenario, only 2.7 x 10(4) km(2) of Mars's surface may be emitting methane, unless a fast destruction mechanism exists. Plain Language Summary The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Curiosity Rover have recorded different amounts of methane in the atmosphere on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter measured very little methane (<50 parts per trillion by volume) above 5 km in the sunlit atmosphere, while Curiosity measured substantially more (410 parts per trillion by volume) near the surface at night. In this paper we describe a framework which explains both measurements by suggesting that a small amount of methane seeps out of the ground constantly. During the day, this small amount of methane is rapidly mixed and diluted by vigorous convection, leading to low overall levels within the atmosphere. During the night, convection lessens, allowing methane to build up near the surface. At dawn, convection intensifies and the near-surface methane is mixed and diluted with much more atmosphere. Using this model and methane concentrations from both approaches, we are able-for the first time-to place a single number on the rate of seepage of methane at Gale crater which we find equivalent to 2.8 kg per Martian day. Future spacecraft measuring methane near the surface of Mars could determine how much methane seeps out of the ground in different locations, providing insight into what processes create that methane in the subsurface.

Topographic Changes During the 2018 Kilauea Eruption From Single-Pass Airborne InSAR	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							LAVA FLOW-VOLUME; TANDEM-X; DISCHARGE; VOLCANO	The 2018 eruption of Kilauea volcano, Hawai'i, was its most effusive in over 200 years. We apply the airborne Glacier and Ice Surface Topography Interferometer (GLISTIN-A) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) instrument to measure topographic change associated with the eruption. The GLISTIN-A radar flew in response to the eruption, acquiring observations of Kilauea on 7 days between 18 May and 15 September 2018. Topography differences were computed relative to GLISTIN-A observations in 2017. Bare-Earth topography and offshore bathymetry were used to correct for vegetation and creation of new coastal land within the lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) lava flow field. We estimate that the LERZ subaerial flows total bulk volume is 0.593 +/- 0.011 km(3) and that the summit collapse volume is -0.836 +/- 0.002 km(3). Within the temporal sampling and uncertainty from submarine flow volumes, we find that both the LERZ and caldera volume changes were approximately linear. Plain Language Summary Large volcanic eruptions can produce large changes in topography, whether due to loss of topography caused by explosive eruptions or collapse of a caldera due to magma withdrawal or topography gain from lava flows or debris deposition.

Quantification of Surface Forcing Requirements for a Greenland Ice Sheet Model using Uncertainty Analyses	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; MASS-BALANCE; NORTHEAST GREENLAND; CLIMATE; FLOW; GLACIER; ISSM; ALTIMETRY; CLOUD	The Greenland Ice Sheet is a substantial reservoir of almost 7 m of sea level equivalent, and on average, climate dictates 60% of its sea level contribution. Changes in ice discharge, driven by perturbations in outlet glacier ice dynamics, constitute the rest. Climate also affects ice discharge, since the flow of interior ice feeding the outlet glaciers evolves in response to surface changes over time. Here, using an ice sheet model and uncertainty quantification, we explore ice flow sensitivity to climate-driven changes in ice surface topography on multidecadal timescales. We find that changes in surface forcing near large outlet glaciers can influence region-wide ice flow. Improvements to climate products should be prioritized in these areas, especially in the Central West and Southeast. Results also suggest that over most of Greenland, surface forcing should be supplied at a spatial resolution of 21 km or finer to accurately simulate ice response to climate change.

Continent-Wide, Interferometric SAR Phase, Mapping of Antarctic Ice Velocity	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; SATELLITE RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; GLACIER SURFACE; WEST ANTARCTICA; FLOW; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; MOTION; MODEL	Surface ice velocity is a fundamental characteristic of glaciers and ice sheets that quantifies the transport of ice. Changes in ice dynamics have a major impact on ice sheet mass balance and its contribution to sea level rise. Prior comprehensive mappings employed speckle and feature tracking techniques, optimized for fast-flow areas, with precision of 2-5 m/year, hence limiting our ability to describe ice flow in the slow interior. We present a vector map of ice velocity using the interferometric phase from multiple satellite synthetic aperture radars resulting in 10 times higher precision in speed (20 cm/year) and direction (5 degrees) over 80% of Antarctica. Precision mapping over areas of slow motion (<1 m/year) improves from 20 to 93%, which helps better constrain drainage boundaries, improve mass balance assessment, evaluate regional atmospheric climate models, reconstruct ice thickness, and inform ice sheet numerical models. Plain Language Summary We present a new map of Antarctic ice velocity that is 10 times more precise than prior maps and reveals ice motion at a high precision over 80% of the continent versus 20% in the past. The ice motion vector map provides novel constrains on interior ice motion and its connection with the glaciers and ice stream that control the stability and mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.

These distributions follow similar patterns with a dominant low-frequency component and well-defined tidal and near-inertial peaks globally. Quantitative differences are identified with deficits of low-frequency energy near the equator (factor 2) and at near-inertial frequencies (factor 3) and an excess of energy at semidiurnal frequencies (factor 4) for the model. Owing to its hourly resolution and its near-global spatial coverage, the array of surface drifters is an invaluable tool to evaluate the realism of tide-resolving high-resolution ocean simulations used in observing system simulation experiments. Sources of bias between model and drifter data are discussed, and associated leads for future work highlighted. Plain Language Summary Ocean currents predominately control the transport and distribution of physical properties (such as heat and momentum) and biochemical tracers (such as carbon, oxygen, and nutrients) in the global oceans. These currents are generally most energetic at the ocean surface and distributed across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. Global ocean models simulate ocean variability from large-scale circulations to tidal motions and are used to provide guidance for new global oceanographic observations, especially for future high-resolution satellite missions. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the realism of global ocean models. In this study, we use drifter observations of global surface currents to compare with the output from a 1/48 degrees global ocean simulation. Our results show that the model exhibits a broad qualitative consistency with the surface drifter data but also displays some key differences at high-frequency dynamics. The model shows a 3 times deficit of near-inertial variance and a 4 times excess of semidiurnal variance when compared with surface drifter data. Our findings demonstrate that the global drifter data set with hourly temporal resolution provides a resource for assessment of the surface circulation predicted by state-of-the-art global ocean models.

Perturbing deep convective parameters in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) results in a similar spread and correlation between HCF and A(a) responses to interannual warming compared to the CMIP5 ensemble, with a narrower A(a) corresponding to greater HCF reduction. Perturbing cloud physics parameters produces a comparatively smaller range of A a responses to warming and a dissimilar HCF-A(a) relation to that in CMIP5; a narrower A(a) corresponds to less HCF reduction, likely due to cloud radiative effects. A narrowing of A(a) corresponds to a regime shift toward stronger precipitation in both experiments. We infer that model differences in deep convection parameterization likely play a greater role than differing cloud physics in determining the diverse responses of A(a) and HCF to warming in CMIP5.

While the wheels were designed to accumulate considerable damage, the unexpected damage rate raised concerns regarding wheel lifetime. In response, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed and deployed mobility flight software on Curiosity that reduces the forces on the wheels. The new algorithm adapts each wheel's speed to fit the terrain topography in real time, by leveraging the rover's measured attitude rates and rocker/bogie suspension angles and rates. Together with a rigid-body kinematics model, it estimates the real-time wheel-terrain contact angles and commands idealized, no-slip wheel angular rates. In addition, free-floating "wheelies" are detected and autonomously corrected. Ground test data indicate that the forces on the wheels are reduced by 19% for leading wheels and 11% for middle leading wheels. On the ground, the required data volume increased by up to 129%, and drive duration increased by up to 25%. In flight, data collected over 3.6 km and 149 drives confirmed a reduction in wheel current, correlated with wheel torque, of 18.7%. The new algorithm proved to use fewer resources in flight than ground estimates suggested, as only a 10% increase in drive duration and double the drive data volume were experienced. These data indicate the promise of the new algorithm to extend the life of the wheels for the Curiosity rover. This paper describes the algorithm, its ground testing campaign and associated challenges, and its validation, implementation, and performance in flight.

As a critical constraint to urban atmospheric CO2 inversion studies, bottom-up spatiotemporally explicit emissions data products are also necessary to construct comprehensive urban CO2 emission information systems useful for trend detection and emissions verification. The "Hestia Project" is an effort to provide bottom-up granular fossil fuel (FFCO2) emissions for the urban domain with building/street and hourly space-time resolution. Here, we report on the latest urban area for which a Hestia estimate has been completed - the Los Angeles megacity, encompassing five counties: Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County and Ventura County. We provide a complete description of the methods used to build the Hestia FFCO2 emissions data product for the years 2010-2015. We find that the LA Basin emits 48.06 (+/- 5.3) MtC yr(-1), dominated by the on-road sector. Because of the uneven spatial distribution of emissions, 10% of the largest-emitting grid cells account for 93.6 %, 73.4 %, 66.2 %, and 45.3% of the industrial, commercial, on-road, and residential sector emissions, respectively. Hestia FFCO2 emissions are 10.7% larger than the inventory estimate generated by the local metropolitan planning agency, a difference that is driven by the industrial and electricity production sectors. The detail of the Hestia-LA FFCO2 emissions data product offers the potential for highly targeted, efficient urban greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policy.

A reanalysis represents the best estimate of the state of the atmosphere by combining observations that are sparse in space and time with a dynamical model and weighting them by their uncertainties. EMARS uses the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) for data assimilation with the GFDL/NASA Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM). Observations that are assimilated include the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) temperature retrievals. The dataset includes gridded fields of temperature, wind, surface pressure, as well as dust, water ice, CO2 surface ice and other atmospheric quantities. Reanalyses are useful for both science and engineering studies, including investigations of transient eddies, the polar vortex, thermal tides and dust storms, and during spacecraft operations.

In-situ isoprene measurements are sparse, and satellite-based constraints have employed an indirect approach using its oxidation product formaldehyde, which is affected by non-isoprene sources plus uncertainty and spatial smearing in the isoprene-formaldehyde relationship. Direct global isoprene measurements are therefore needed to better understand its sources, sinks, and atmospheric impacts. Here we show that the isoprene spectral signatures are detectable from space using the satellite-borne Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), develop a full-physics retrieval methodology for quantifying isoprene abundances from these spectral features, and apply the algorithm to CrIS measurements over Amazonia. The results are consistent with model output and in-situ data, and establish the feasibility of direct global space-based isoprene measurements. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for combining space-based measurements of isoprene and formaldehyde to constrain atmospheric oxidation over isoprene source regions.

Close-in giant-planet formation via in-situ gas accretion and their natal disk properties	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; magnetic fields; turbulence; protoplanetary disks; planets and satellites: formation; planets and satellites: gaseous planets	EVOLUTION; COMPANION; STARS	Aims. The origin of close-in Jovian planets is still elusive. We examine the in-situ gas accretion scenario as a formation mechanism of these planets. Methods. We reconstruct natal disk properties from the occurrence rate distribution of close-in giant planets, under the assumption that the occurrence rate may reflect the gas accretion efficiency onto cores of these planets. Results. We find that the resulting gas surface density profile becomes an increasing function of the distance from the central star with some structure at r similar or equal to 0.1 au. This profile is quite different from the standard minimum-mass solar nebula model, while our profile leads to better reproduction of the population of observed close-in super-Earths based on previous studies. We compute the resulting magnetic field profiles and find that our profiles can be fitted by stellar dipole fields (proportional to r(-3)) in the vicinity of the central star and large-scale fields (proportional to r(-2)) at the inner disk regions, either if the isothermal assumption breaks down or if nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects become important. For both cases, the transition between these two profiles occurs at r similar or equal to 0.1 au, which corresponds to the period valley of giant exoplanets. Conclusions. Our work provides an opportunity to test the in-situ gas accretion scenario against disk quantities, which may constrain the gas distribution of the minimum-mass extrasolar nebula.

Spatio-kinematical model of the collimated molecular outflow in the water-fountain nebula IRAS 16342-3814	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: AGB and post-AGB; stars: jets; stars: mass-loss; stars: winds, outflows; submillimeter: stars	PREPLANETARY NEBULA; BIPOLAR OUTFLOW; MASS; JET; MOMENTUM	Context. Water-fountain nebulae are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB objects that exhibit high-velocity outflows traced by water-maser emission. Their study is important for understanding the interaction between collimated jets and the circumstellar material that leads to the formation of bipolar and/or multi-polar morphologies in evolved stars. Aims. The aim of this paper is to describe the three-dimensional morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas of the water-fountain nebula IRAS 16342-3814. Methods. Data was retrieved from the ALMA archive for analysis using a simple spatio-kinematical model. The software SHAPE was employed to construct a three-dimensional, spatio-kinematical model of the molecular gas in IRAS 16342-3814, and to then reproduce the intensity distribution and position-velocity diagram of the CO emission from the ALMA observations to derive the morphology and velocity field of the gas. Data from CO(J = 1 -> 0) supported the physical interpretation of the model. Results. A spatio-kinematical model that includes a high-velocity collimated outflow embedded within material expanding at relatively lower velocity reproduces the images and position-velocity diagrams from the observations. The derived morphology is in good agreement with previous results from IR and water-maser emission observations. The high-velocity collimated outflow exhibits deceleration across its length, while the velocity of the surrounding component increases with distance. The morphology of the emitting region, the velocity field, and the mass of the gas as function of velocity are in excellent agreement with the properties predicted for a molecular outflow driven by a jet. The timescale of the molecular outflow is estimated to be similar to 70-100 yr. The scalar momentum carried by the outflow is much larger than it can be provided by the radiation of the central star. An oscillating pattern was found associated with the high-velocity collimated outflow. The oscillation period of the pattern is T approximate to 60-90 yr and its opening angle is theta(op) approximate to 2 degrees. Conclusions. The CO (J= 3 -> 2) emission in IRAS 16342-3814 is interpreted in terms of a jet-driven molecular outflow expanding along an elongated region. The position-velocity diagram and the mass spectrum reveal a feature due to entrained material that is associated with the driving jet. This feature is not seen in other more evolved objects that exhibit more developed bipolar morphologies. It is likely that the jet in those objects has already disappeared since it is expected to last only for a couple hundred years. This strengthens the idea that water fountain nebulae are undergoing a very short transition during which they develop the collimated outflows that shape the circumstellar envelopes. The oscillating pattern seen in the CO high-velocity outflow is interpreted as due to precession with a relatively small opening angle. The precession period is compatible with the period of the corkscrew pattern seen at IR wavelengths. We propose that the high-velocity molecular outflow traces the underlying primary jet that produces such a pattern.

Ozone Measurements Using the Refurbished Eureka Stratospheric Differential Absorption Lidar	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							PROPOSED STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS; GRAVITY-WAVE ACTIVITY; TEMPERATURE ALGORITHMS; VERTICAL RESOLUTION; VALIDATION; ACE; UNCERTAINTY; INSTRUMENT; EVOLUTION; PROFILE	The Stratospheric Ozone Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) located at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) in Eureka, Nunavut (80 degrees N, 86 degrees W) has been a powerful tool for the measurement of stratospheric ozone vertical profiles in the Canadian High Arctic since 1993. The lidar ozone profiles measured during the 2017 Canadian Arctic Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) and Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS) Validation Campaign were compared to coincident ozonesonde, ACE-FTS, ACE-MAESTRO and OSIRIS profiles. The results show the lidar overestimates the ozone by similar to 10% in the 10 km-20 km altitude range on average in comparison with the ozonesonde. Above 20 km the profiles agree within 10%. The OSIRIS ozone agrees within 10% with DIAL ozone between 15 km and 41 km. A strong stratospheric ozone depletion event was seen on March 3, 2017, during which the ozone concentration dropped below 10(12) molecules cm(-3) at the 15.5 km and below 6 x 10(12) molecules cm(-3) at 16 km as measured by the ozonesonde and the lidar correspondingly. Laminated structures were observed in the ozonesonde profiles near the polar vortex edge regions. This together with non-optimal temporal and spatial coincidences between the measurements conducted by different instruments can affect validation accuracy.

Effective quantum error correcting codes require a high fidelity readout of ancilla qubits from which the error syndrome can be determined without affecting data qubits. Here, we present a detection scheme for Yb-171(+) qubits, where we use superconducting nanowire single photon detectors and utilize photon time-of-arrival statistics to improve the fidelity and speed. Qubit shuttling allows for creating a separate detection region where an ancilla qubit can be measured without disrupting a data qubit. We achieve an average qubit state detection time of 11 mu s with a fidelity of 99.931(6). The detection crosstalk error, defined as the probability that the data qubit coherence is lost due to the process of detecting an ancilla qubit, is reduced to similar to 2 x 10(-5) by creating a separation of 370 mu m between them.

Generalized Fourier's law for nondiffusive thermal transport: Theory and experiment	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							PHONON BOLTZMANN-EQUATION; SECOND SOUND; CONDUCTIVITY; SOLVER	Phonon heat conduction over length scales comparable to their mean free paths is a topic of considerable interest for basic science and thermal management technologies. However, debate exists over the appropriate constitutive law that defines thermal conductivity in the nondiffusive regime. Here, we derive a generalized Fourier's law that links the heat flux and temperature fields, valid from ballistic to diffusive regimes and for general geometries, using the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation. This generalized Fourier's law predicts that thermal conductivity not only becomes nonlocal at length scales smaller than phonon mean free paths but also requires the inclusion of an inhomogeneous nonlocal source term that has been previously neglected. We provide evidence for the validity of this generalized Fourier's law through direct comparison with time-domain thermoreflectance measurements in the nondiffusive regime without adjustable parameters. Furthermore, we show that interpreting experimental data without the generalized Fourier's law can lead to inaccurate measurement of thermal transport properties.

We used backward trajectory simulations and a mesoscale Bayesian inverse model, Mbring ratios (VI ' initialized by three inventories, to achieve the emission quantification. Results show total statewide CH4 emissions of 2.05 +/- 0.26 (at 95% confidence) Tg/yr, which is 1.14 to 1.47 times greater than the anthropogenic emission estimates by California Air Resource Board (GARB). Some of differences could be biogenic emissions, superemitter point sources, and other episodic emissions which may not be completely included in the CARB inventory. San Joaquin Valley (SJV) has the largest CH4 emissions (0.94 +/- 0.18 Tg/yr), followed by the South Coast Air Basin, the Sacramento Valley, and the San Francisco Bay Area at 0.39 +/- 0.18, 0.21 +/- 0.04, and 0.16 +/- 0.05 Tg/yr, respectively. The dairy and oil/gas production sources in the SJV contribute 0.44 +/- 0.36 and 0.22 +/- 0.23 Tg CH4/yr, respectively. This study has important policy implications for regulatory programs, as it provides a thorough multiyear evaluation of the emissions inventory using independent atmospheric measurements and investigates the utility of a complementary multiplatform approach in understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of CH4 emissions in the state and identifies opportunities for the expansion and applications of the monitoring network.

Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project. VIII. Time Variability of Emission and Absorption in NGC 5548 Based on Modeling the Ultraviolet Spectrum	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (NGC 5548); galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert	BROAD-LINE REGION; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DRIVEN DISK WINDS; X-RAY; BLACK-HOLE; FE-II; NGC-5548; DYNAMICS; STEPS; SIZE	We model the ultraviolet spectra of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope during the 6 month reverberation mapping campaign in 2014. Our model of the emission from NGC 5548 corrects for overlying absorption and deblends the individual emission lines. Using the modeled spectra, we measure the response to continuum variations for the deblended and absorption-corrected individual broad emission lines, the velocity-dependent profiles of Ly alpha and C IV, and the narrow and broad intrinsic absorption features. We find that the time lags for the corrected emission lines are comparable to those for the original data. The velocity-binned lag profiles of Ly alpha and C IV have a double-peaked structure indicative of a truncated Keplerian disk. The narrow absorption lines show a delayed response to continuum variations corresponding to recombination in gas with a density of similar to 10(5) cm(-3). The high-ionization narrow absorption lines decorrelate from continuum variations during the same period as the broad emission lines. Analyzing the response of these absorption lines during this period shows that the ionizing flux is diminished in strength relative to the far-ultraviolet continuum. The broad absorption lines associated with the X-ray obscurer decrease in strength during this same time interval. The appearance of X-ray obscuration in similar to 2012 corresponds with an increase in the luminosity of NGC 5548 following an extended low state. We suggest that the obscurer is a disk wind triggered by the brightening of NGC 5548 following the decrease in size of the broad-line region during the preceding low-luminosity state.	[Kriss, G.

General Physical Characteristics of BAT Blazars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: jets	BLACK-HOLE MASS; BL-LAC OBJECTS; GAMMA-RAY; COMPLETE SAMPLE; RADIO-SOURCES; POWER; TELESCOPE; JETS	The recently released 105-month Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) all-sky hard X-ray survey catalog presents an opportunity to study astrophysical objects detected in the deepest look at the entire hard X-ray (14-195 keV) sky. Here we report the results of a multifrequency study of 146 blazars from this catalog, quadrupling the number compared to past studies, by utilizing recent data from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), Swift-BAT, and archival measurements. In our gamma-ray analysis of similar to 10 yr of the LAT data, 101 are found as gamma-ray emitters, whereas, 45 remains LAT undetected. We model the broadband spectral energy distributions with a synchrotron-inverse Compton radiative model. On average, BAT detected sources host massive black holes (M-bh similar to 10(9) M-circle dot) and luminous accretion disks (L-d similar to 10(46) erg s(-1)). At high redshifts (z > 2), BAT blazars host more powerful jets with luminous accretion disks compared to those detected only with Fermi-LAT. We find good agreement in the black hole masses derived from the single-epoch optical spectroscopic measurements and standard accretion disk modeling approaches. Other physical properties of BAT blazars are similar to those known for Fermi-LAT detected objects.

DES Collaboration	The Morphology and Structure of Stellar Populations in the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy from Dark Energy Survey Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: individual (Fornax); Local Group	STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS; DSPH; EVOLUTION; DISTANCE; CARINA; CLUMP; TIP	Using deep wide-field photometry 3 yr data (Y3) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present a panoramic study of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The data presented here-a small subset of the full survey-uniformly cover a region of 25 deg(2) centered on the galaxy to a depth of g similar to 23.5. We use these data to study the structural properties of Fornax, overall stellar population, and its member stars in different evolutionary phases. We also search for possible signs of tidal disturbance. Fornax is found to be significantly more spatially extended than what early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of similar to 32.1 mag arcsec(-2). However, there are hints of shell-like features located similar to 20'-40' from the center of Fornax that may be stellar debris from past merger events. We also find that intermediate-age and young main-sequence populations show different orientation at the galaxy center and have many substructures. The deep DES Y3 data allow us to characterize the age of those young stellar substructures with great accuracy, both those previously known and those newly identified as possible overdensities in this work, on the basis of their color-magnitude diagram morphology. We find that the youngest overdensities are all found on the eastern side of Fornax, where the Fornax field population itself is slightly younger than in the west. In summary, the high-quality DES Y3 data reveal that Fornax has many rich structures and provide insights into its complex formation history.	[Wang, M. Y.; Koposov, S.

Two Terrestrial Planet Families with Different Origins	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: composition; planets and satellites: formation; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets	ATMOSPHERIC MASS; GIANT-IMPACT; DISRUPTION; VALLEY; RADII; SHAPE; SIZE	The potentially important role of stellar irradiation in envelope removal for planets with diameters of less than or similar to 2 R-circle plus has been inferred both through theoretical work and the observed bimodal distribution of small planet occurrence as a function of radius. We examined the trends for small planets in the three-dimensional radius-insolation-density space and found that the terrestrial planets divide into two distinct families based on insolation. The lower insolation family merges with terrestrial planets and small bodies in the solar system and is thus Earth-like. The higher insolation terrestrial planet family forms a bulk-density continuum with the sub-Neptunes, and is thus likely to be composed of remnant cores produced by photoevaporation. Based on the density-radius relationships, we suggest that both terrestrial families show evidence of density enhancement through collisions. Our findings highlight the important role that both photoevaporation and collisions have in determining the density of small planets.

Measurements of the Cross-spectra of the Cosmic Infrared and Microwave Backgrounds from 95 to 1200 GHz	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; galaxies: evolution; infrared: galaxies; large-scale structure of universe; submillimeter: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; MULTIBAND IMAGING PHOTOMETER; POWER SPECTRUM; STATISTICAL PROPERTIES; GALACTIC CIRRUS; HERSCHEL-ATLAS; SUBMILLIMETER; ANISOTROPY; FLUCTUATIONS; CONFUSION	We present measurements of the power spectra of cosmic infrared background (CIB) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations in six frequency bands. Maps at the lower three frequency bands, 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3330, 2000, and 1360 mu m) are from the South Pole Telescope, while the upper three frequency bands, 600, 857, and 1200 GHz (500, 350, 250 mu m) are observed with Herschel/SPIRE. From these data, we produce 21 angular power spectra (6 auto- and 15 cross-frequency) spanning the multipole range 600 <= l <= 11,000. Our measurements are the first to cross-correlate measurements near the peak of the CIB spectrum with maps at 95 GHz, complementing and extending the measurements from Planck Collaboration et al. at 143-857 GHz. The observed fluctuations originate largely from clustered, infrared-emitting, dusty star-forming galaxies, the CMB, and to a lesser extent radio galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

Galactic Cosmic-Ray Bombardment of Europa's Surface	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						cosmic rays; planetary systems; planets and satellites: surfaces; planets and satellites: magnetic fields	RADIAL INTENSITY GRADIENTS; ELECTRON-BOMBARDMENT; SUBSURFACE OCEAN; ENERGETIC ION; SOLAR; ACCELERATION; SIMULATION; PLUME	Jupiter's moon Europa is exposed to Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), highly energetic particles from deep space that constantly bombard its surface. Here we have investigated the effect of GCRs on Europa's surface by carrying out particle physics simulations of secondary particle cascades that occur within surface ice due to incident GCR ions. We find that shielding by the Jovian magnetosphere prevents a significant fraction of the GCR spectrum from reaching Europa. Furthermore, we find that while GCRs are capable of affecting the surface down to depths of at least 10 m, the radiation dose due to these particles is small. Within the uppermost meter of Europa's surface, radiation due to magnetospheric particle bombardment dominates over the GCR dose except for surface locations at high latitudes, where the magnetospheric radiation flux is small.

J	Porcacchia, L; Kirstetter, PE; Maggioni, V; Tanelli, S				Porcacchia, Leonardo; Kirstetter, Pierre-Emmanuel; Maggioni, Viviana; Tanelli, Simone			Investigating the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar signatures of low-level precipitation enhancement	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						collision-coalescence; DPR; GPM; microphysics; precipitation enhancement; radar	FLASH-FLOOD; MELTING LAYER; COMPLEX TERRAIN; WARM-RAIN; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; REFLECTIVITY; TROPICS; IMPACT	High-intensity precipitation represents a threat for several regions of the world because of the related risk of natural disasters (e.g. floods and landslides). This work focuses on low-level precipitation enhancement that occurs in the cloud warm layer and has been observed in relation to collision-coalescence (CC) leading to flash floods and extreme rainfall events in tropical and temperate latitudes. Specifically, signatures of precipitation enhancement (referred to as CC-dominant precipitation) are investigated in the observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core mission Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) over the central/eastern Contiguous United States (CONUS) during June 2014-May 2018. A classification scheme for CC-dominant precipitation, developed for dual-polarization S-band radar measurements and applied in a previous work to X-band radar observations in complex terrain, is used as a benchmark. The scheme is here applied to the GPM ground validation dataset that matches ground-based radar observations across CONUS to space-borne DPR retrievals. The occurrence of CC-dominant precipitation is documented and the corresponding signatures of CC-dominant precipitation at Ku- and Ka-band are studied. CC-dominant profiles show distinguishing features when compared to profiles not dominated by CC, e.g. characteristic vertical slopes of reflectivity at Ku- and Ka-band in the liquid layer, lower freezing-level height, and shallower ice layer, which are linked to environmental conditions driving the peculiar CC microphysics. This work aims at improving satellite quantitative precipitation estimation, particularly GPM retrievals, by targeting CC development in precipitation columns.

Jovian High-Latitude Ionospheric Ions: Juno In Situ Observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							JUPITERS IONOSPHERE; CARBON FOILS	The low-altitude, high-velocity trajectory of the Juno spacecraft enables the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment to make the first in situ observations of the high-latitude ionospheric plasma. Ions are observed to energies below 1 eV. The high-latitude ionospheric ions are observed simultaneously with a loss cone in the magnetospheric ions, suggesting precipitating magnetospheric ions contribute to the heating of the upper ionosphere, raising the scale height, and pushing ionospheric ions to altitudes of 0.5 R-J above the planet where they are observed by Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment. The source of the magnetospheric ions is tied to the Io torus and plasma sheet, indicated by the cutoff seen in both the magnetospheric and ionospheric plasma at the Io M-shells. Equatorward of the Io M-shell boundary, the ionospheric ions are not observed, indicating a drop in the scale height of the ionospheric ions at those latitudes. Plain Language Summary The Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) ion sensor has made the first in situ observations of the upper, high-latitude ionosphere of Jupiter. Flown on the Juno spacecraft, JADE observes the ionosphere at altitudes of approximately half a Jovian radii, with the spacecraft traveling at the high speed of similar to 50 km/s. For comparison, a proton traveling at 50 km/s has an energy of approximately 10 eV. The combination of the low-altitude and high ram velocity enables JADE to measure ionospheric ions to energies below 1 eV. These observations reveal a cold ionospheric population of protons at high latitudes, seen coincident with precipitating magnetospheric ions. This indicates that the precipitating magnetospheric ions heat the upper ionosphere, raising the height where these protons can be observed. The ionospheric protons are seen in bands in the northern and southern latitudes, bounded on the equator edge by the field lines that connect to Io, and inside the auroral oval to the poleward side.

Results from these studies have never been confirmed by observations in regional or basin-scale domains. Here we show that internal gravity waves have a spectral signature on sea surface height during summer that significantly differs from that of balanced motions. These spectral differences lead us to propose a new dynamical framework that quantifies the interactions between internal gravity waves and balanced motions in physical space from sea surface height snapshots, and in particular the energy exchanges between them. Our results, using this dynamical framework, highlight the strong potential of future satellite altimeter missions to make critical advances in assessing the ocean's kinetic energy budget from observations in large domains.

We evaluate the impact of slow forest recovery after the 2005 Amazonian drought on local evapotranspiration (ET) and wet season onset (WSO) using remotely sensed precipitation, deuterium retrievals, reanalysis data, and a new ET product. A comparison to the 2009 rainy season, which exhibits similar large-scale moisture flux convergence, shows that 2006 experienced a 25% ET reduction and 20 days of postponed WSO in the dry-to-wet transition. Our results imply that ET reduction due to drought-driven legacy effect on the Amazon rainforest could be a crucial factor triggering WSO delay in the transitional season following drought events. Plain Language Summary Drought legacy effect, observed as reduced growth and incomplete forest recovery after severe drought events, impacts the carbon and water cycles of Amazonia. Satellite observations showed a reduction of canopy carbon during and after the 2005 Amazonian drought. To understand the impact of local evapotranspiration (ET) changes associated with this canopy carbon reduction on the timing of wet season onset (WSO) over southern Amazonia, we study the precipitation and ET changes in the 2006 dry-to-wet transition by using space-based remote sensing of precipitation, deuterium retrievals, reanalysis data, and a new ET product. A comparison to the 2009 rainy season, which has a similar large-scale moisture flux convergence amount, shows a 25% reduction in ET and 20 days of postponed WSO during the dry-to-wet transition of 2006. Our results indicate that drought legacy effects could be a crucial factor triggering WSO delay following drought events and imply the importance of accurately representing biogeochemical processes and land-atmosphere feedbacks when predicting precipitation over Amazon in Earth system models.

AIRS retrieved profiles are fed into a radiative transfer model to generate synthetic clear-sky spectral OLR. Trends are derived from the simulated clear-sky spectral OLR and GHE and then compared with their counterparts derived from collocated observations. Spectral trends in different seasons are distinctively different. March and September exhibit positive trends in spectral OLR over the far-IR dirty window and mid-IR window region for most of the Arctic. In contrast, spectral OLR trends in July are negative over the far-IR dirty window and can be positive or negative in the mid-IR window depending on the latitude. Sensitivity studies reveal that surface temperature contributes much more than atmospheric temperature and humidity to the spectral OLR and GHE trends, while the contributions from the latter two are also discernible over many spectral regions (e.g., trends in the far-IR dirty window in March). The largest increase of spectral GHE is seen north of 80 degrees N in March across the water vapor v(2) band and far-IR. When the secular fractional change of spectral OLR is less than that of surface spectral emission, an increase of spectral GHE can be expected. Spectral trend analyses reveal more information than broadband trend analyses alone.

J	Sullivan, SC; Schiro, KA; Stubenrauch, C; Gentine, P				Sullivan, Sylvia C.; Schiro, Kathleen A.; Stubenrauch, Claudia; Gentine, Pierre			The Response of Tropical Organized Convection to El Nino Warming	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						convective organization; El Nino; precipitation extremes	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; LOW-LEVEL JETS; LIFE-CYCLE; STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS; GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; CLIMATE MODEL; SYSTEMS; CLOUD; SATELLITE	Convective organization has a large impact on precipitation and feeds back on larger-scale circulations in the tropics. The degree of this convective organization changes with modes of climate variability like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but because organization is not represented in current climate models, a quantitative assessment of these shifts has not been possible. Here, we construct multidecade satellite climatologies of occurrence of tropical convective organization and its properties and assess changes with ENSO phase. The occurrence of organized deep convection becomes more concentrated, increasing threefold in the eastern and central Pacific during El Nino and decreasing twofold outside of these regions. Both horizontal extent of the cold cloud shield and convective depth increase in regions of positive sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTa); however, the regions of greatest convective deepening are those of large-scale ascent, rather than those of warmest SSTa. Extent decreases with SSTa at a rate of about 20 km/K, while the SSTa dependence of depth is only about 0.2 K/K. We introduce two values to describe convective changes with ENSO more succinctly: (1) an information entropy metric to quantify the clustering of convective system occurrences and (2) a growth metric to quantify deepening relative to spreading over the system lifetime. Finally, with collocated precipitation data, we see that rainfall attributable to convective organization jumps up to 5% with warming. Rain intensity and amount increase for a given system size during El Nino, but a given rain amount may actually fall with higher intensity during La Nina. Plain Language Summary Tropical storms at an intermediate scale between individual thunderstorms and cyclones or hurricanes are not represented by climate models. As the satellite data record now spans several decades, we can use these observations to understand how large storms change during El Nino periods. Here, we find that warmer waters in the central and eastern Pacific during El Nino cause a dramatic increase in storm occurrence. Storms are more likely to occur near to other storms and to become larger in both the vertical and horizontal. Changes to large-scale winds are more influential on these structural factors than locally warmer ocean water. The hydrological impact of these storms is also important because they bring the majority of precipitation in some regions. We see that a storm of a certain extent brings larger volume and intensity of rain during El Nino. But a certain rain volume may actually fall with greater intensity during La Nino.

The Microphysics of Stratiform Precipitation During OLYMPEX: Compatibility Between Triple-Frequency Radar and Airborne In Situ Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						solid and liquid precipitation; multifrequency radar; riming versus aggregation; snowfall and rainfall; scattering models; optimal estimation	ICE WATER-CONTENT; RAYLEIGH-GANS APPROXIMATION; DROP SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; DOPPLER SPECTRA; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; CROSS-SECTIONS; CLOUD CLUSTERS; MELTING LAYER; PARTICLE	The link between stratiform precipitation microphysics and multifrequency radar observables is thoroughly investigated by exploiting simultaneous airborne radar and in situ observations collected from two aircraft during the OLYMPEX/RADEX (Olympic Mountain Experiment/Radar Definition Experiment 2015) field campaign. Above the melting level, in situ images and triple-frequency radar signatures both indicate the presence of moderately rimed aggregates. Various mass-size relationships of ice particles and snow scattering databases are used to compute the radar reflectivity from the in situ particle size distribution. At Ku and Ka band, the best agreement with radar observations is found when using the self-similar Rayleigh-Gans approximation for moderately rimed aggregates. At W band, a direct comparison is challenging because of the non-Rayleigh effects and of the probable attenuation due to ice aggregates and supercooled liquid water between the two aircraft. A variational method enables the retrieval of the full precipitation profile above and below the melting layer, by combining the observations from the three radars. Even with three radar frequencies, the retrieval of rain properties is challenging over land, where the integrated attenuation is not available. Otherwise, retrieved mean volume diameters and water contents of both solid and liquid precipitation are in agreement with in situ observations and indicate local changes of the degree of riming of ice aggregates, on the scale of 5 km. Finally, retrieval results are analyzed to explore the validity of using continuity constraints on the water mass flux and diameter within the melting layer in order to improve retrievals of ice properties.

Observation residuals obtained during the gravity field recovery contain most of the measurement and modeling errors and thus can be considered a realization of actual errors. In this work, we investigate the ability of wavelets to help in identifying specific error sources in GRACE range-rate residuals. The multiresolution analysis (MRA) using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to decompose the residual signal into different scales with corresponding frequency bands. Temporal, spatial, and orbit-related features of each scale are then extracted for further investigations. The wavelet analysis has proven to be a practical tool to find the main error contributors. Besides the previously known sources such as K-band ranging (KBR) system noise and systematic attitude variations, this method clearly shows effects which the classic spectral analysis is hardly able or unable to represent. These effects include long-term signatures due to satellite eclipse crossings and dominant ocean tide errors.

The most diagnostic features are at 1966 for v(2) and 3353 cm(-1) for v(1), respectively, and are assigned to acetylene trapped in the large 5(12)6(2) cages. In addition, the v(2) mode for acetylene occupying the small 5(12) cages is observed at 1972.5 cm(-1), a red shift of 1.5 cm(-1) from its gas phase frequency. Unit cell parameters and thermal expansion coefficients are determined via powder X-ray diffraction between 195 and 225 K and are found to be in good correlation with previous single crystal data at 143 K. The calculated density for acetylene clathrate is also reported, with values ranging from 0.985 g/cm(3) at 195 K to 0.976 g/cm(3) at 225 K. These results are relevant for spectral detection of acetylene-containing compounds on planetary bodies, as well as providing additional insights on the thermal behavior and physical properties of acetylene clathrate.

Terrestrial seismology is influenced by the presence of the ocean-generated microseismic signal, which sets a lower limit on the earthquake detection capabilities but also provides a strong energy source to infer the interior structure on scales from local to continental. Titan is the only other place in the solar system with permanent surface liquids and future lander missions there might carry a seismic package. Therefore, the presence of microseisms would be of great benefit for interior studies, but also for detecting storm-generated waves on the lakes remotely. We estimated the strength of microseismic signals on Titan, based on wind speeds predicted from modeled global circulation models interior structure. We find that storms of more than 2 m/s wind speed, would create a signal that is globally observable with a high-quality broadband sensor and observable to a thousand kilometer distance with a space-ready seismometer, such as the InSight instruments currently operating on the surface of Mars.

The scale dependence of the cloud scenes is quantified. For spatial scales at 45 km (15 km), only 18 (10) out of 256 possible cloud scenes account for 90% of all observations and contain one, two, or three cloud types. The number of possible cloud scenes is shown to depend on spatial scale with a maximum number of 210 out of 256 possible scenes at a scale of 105 km and fewer cloud scenes at smaller and larger scales. The cloud scenes are used to assess the characteristics of spatially collocated Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) thermodynamic-phase and ice cloud property retrievals within scenes of varying cloud type complexity. The likelihood of ice and liquid-phase detection strongly depends on the CloudSat-identified cloud scene type collocated with the AIRS footprint. Cloud scenes primarily consisting of cirrus, nimbostratus, altostratus, and deep convection are dominated by ice-phase detection, while stratocumulus, cumulus, and altocumulus are dominated by liquid- and undetermined-phase detection. Ice cloud particle size and optical thickness are largest for cloud scenes containing deep convection and cumulus and are smallest for cirrus. Cloud scenes with multiple cloud types have small reductions in information content and slightly higher residuals of observed and modeled radiance compared to cloud scenes with single cloud types. These results will help advance the development of temperature, specific humidity, and cloud property retrievals from hyperspectral infrared sounders that include cloud microphysics in forward radiative transfer models.

However, further enhancement of the field requires operation over long periods of time, for example, days or weeks. This has so far been impractical due to the limited flight times of such platforms and the requirement of humans in the loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated flights for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy to enable mission execution independently from human operators and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. High-level autonomous decision making is implemented as a hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision-based precision landing is enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag fiducials configured for detection from a wide range of altitudes. We provide an extensive evaluation of the landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a function of the bundle's geometry. The functionality of the complete system is demonstrated through two indoor experiments with duration of 11 and 10.6 hr, and one outdoor experiment with a duration of 4 hr. The UAS executed 16, 48, and 22 flights, respectively, during these experiments. In the outdoor experiment, the ratio between flying to collect data and charging was 1-10, which is similar to past work in this domain. All flights were fully autonomous with no human in the loop. To our best knowledge, this is the first research publication about the long-term outdoor operation of a quadrotor system with no human interaction.

J	Hapuarachchi, H; Gunapala, SD; Premaratne, M				Hapuarachchi, Harini; Gunapala, Sarath D.; Premaratne, Malin			Plasmonic metaresonances: harnessing nonlocal effects for prospective biomedical applications	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						metal nanoparticle; quantum dot; nanoplasmonics; nonlocal response	PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY PPTT; QUANTUM-DOT; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; CANCER; BLUESHIFT; RESONANCE; TISSUE; WATER	Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) possess optical concentration capabilities that can amplify and localize electromagnetic fields into nanometer length scales. The near-fields of MNPs can be used to tailor optical response of luminescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), resulting in fascinating optical phenomena. Plasmonic metaresonances (PMRs) form a class of such optical events gaining increasing popularity due to their promising prospects in sensing and switching applications. Unlike the basic excitonic and plasmonic resonances in MNP-QD nanohybrids, PMRs occur in the space/time domain. A nanohybrid experiences PMR when system parameters such as QD dipole moment, MNP-QD centre separation or submerging medium permittivity reach critical values, resulting in the plasmonically induced time delay of the effective Rabi frequency experienced by the QD asymptotically tending to infinity. Theoretical analyses of PMRs available in the literature utilize the local response approximation (LRA) which does not account for the nonlocal effects of the MNP, and neglect the MNP dependence of the QD decay and dephasing rates which hinder their applicability to QDs in the close vicinity of small MNPs. Here, we address these limitations using an approach based on the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory which has proven to yield successful theoretical explanations of experimentally observed plasmonic phenomena. Our results indicate that, omission of the MNP nonlocal response and the associated decay/dephasing rate modifications of the QD tend to raise implications such as significant overestimation of the QD dipole moment required to achieve PMR, under-estimation of the critical centre separation and prediction of significantly lower near-PMR QD absorption rates, in comparison to the improved GNOR based predictions. In light of our observations, we finally suggest two prospective applications of PMR based nanoswitches, namely, aptamer based in vitro cancer screening and thermoresponsive polymer based temperature sensing. To demonstrate the latter application, we develop and utilize a proof of concept (two dimensional) skin tumor model homogeneously populated by MNP-QD nanohybrids. Our simulations reveal a novel near-PMR physical phenomenon observable under perpendicular illumination, which we like to call the margin pattern reversal, where the spatial absorption pattern reverses when the near-PMR QDs switch from the bright to dark state.

Frequency stability analysis of pulsar-aided clocks	NAVIGATION-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION			English	Article							TIME; MODEL	This paper discusses the use of apulsar signal in clock calibration. The analysis method is presented from the perspective of filtering theory, where Hadamard variance is used to analyze the frequency stability of both the stand-alone and the pulsar-aided clock systems. The aided clock is constructed using a steady state Kalman filter and accounts for the fractional power spectral density of the pulsar timing noise. The results of this simplified analysis indicate that the frequency stability of the aided clock has noticeable improvement at large averaging time due to the suppression of the random walk frequency noise in the stand-alone clock.

DES Collaboration; SPT Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Cross-correlation between Dark Energy Survey Y1 galaxy weak lensing and South Pole Telescope plus Planck CMB weak lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							COSMIC SHEAR; CFHTLENS; CONSTRAINTS; COSMOLOGY; MATTER; MODEL	We cross-correlate galaxy weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) year-one data with a cosmic microwave background (CMB) weak lensing map derived from South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck data, with an effective overlapping area of 1289 deg(2). With the combined measurements from four source galaxy redshift bins, we obtain a detection significance of 5.8 sigma. We fit the amplitude of the correlation functions while fixing the cosmological parameters to a fiducial Lambda CDM model, finding A = 0.99 +/- 0.17. We additionally use the correlation function measurements to constrain shear calibration bias, obtaining constraints that are consistent with previous DES analyses. Finally, when performing a cosmological analysis under the Lambda CDM model, we obtain the marginalized constraints of Omega(m) = 0.261(-0.051)(+0.070) and S-8 = sigma(8)root Omega(m)/0.3 = 0.660(-0.100)(+0.085). These measurements are used in a companion work that presents cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of two-point functions among galaxies, galaxy shears, and CMB lensing using DES, SPT, and Planck data.

A Broadband Look at the Old and New ULXs of NGC 6946	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; stars: black holes; stars: neutron; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: general	X-RAY SOURCE; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; BLACK-HOLE; TIDAL DISRUPTION; TERM VARIABILITY; SPIRAL GALAXIES; NEARBY GALAXIES; ACCRETION FLOW; OUTBURST; CHANDRA	Two recent observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 6946 with NuSTAR, one simultaneous with an XMM-Newton observation, provide an opportunity to examine its population of bright accreting sources from a broadband perspective. We study the three known ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the galaxy, and find that ULX-1 and ULX-2 have very steep power-law spectra with Gamma = 3.6(-0.3)(+0.4) in both cases. Their properties are consistent with being super-Eddington accreting sources with the majority of their hard emission obscured and down-scattered. ULX-3 (NGC 6946 X-1) is significantly detected by both XMM-Newton and NuSTAR at L-X = (6.5 +/- 0.1) x 10(39) erg s(-1), and has a power-law spectrum with Gamma = 2.51 +/- 0.05. We are unable to identify a high-energy break in its spectrum like that found in other ULXs, but the soft spectrum likely hinders our ability to detect one. We also characterize the new source, ULX-4, which is only detected in the joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation, at L-X = (2.27 +/- 0.07) x 10(39) erg s(-1), and is absent in a Chandra observation 10 days later. It has a very hard cutoff power-law spectrum with Gamma = 0.7 +/- 0.1 and E-cut = 11(-4)(+9) keV. We do not detect pulsations from ULX-4, but its transient nature can be explained either as a neutron star ULX briefly leaving the propeller regime or as a micro-tidal disruption event induced by a stellar-mass compact object.

Photometric follow-up with Spitzer reveals that the object, CWISEP. J193518.59-154620.3, has ch1-ch2 = 3.24 +/- 0.31 mag, making it one of the reddest brown dwarfs known. Using the Spitzer photometry and the polynomial relations from Kirkpatrick et al. we estimate an effective temperature in the similar to 270-360 K range, and a distance estimate in the 5.6-10.9 pc range. We combined the WISE, NEOWISE, and Spitzer data to measure a proper motion of mu(alpha) cos delta = 337 +/- 69 mas yr(-1), mu(delta) = -50 +/- 97 mas yr(-1), which implies a relatively low tangential velocity in the range 7-22 km s(-1).

Long-duration experiments were performed with exposures of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and organic compounds (glycine and ribose) to D2O and D2O + NH3 ices and vapors at temperatures of -17 degrees C and -27 degrees C for 10-120 days; and with exposure of amorphous silicates to H2O vapor/liquid at >25 degrees C for 10 days. The amorphous silicates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and recovery of organic molecules was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. No hydration of amorphous silicates or organic compounds was observed after exposure at temperatures below -17 degrees C for 120 days to ices with or without NH3, whereas hydration of the amorphous silicates was observed in experiments above room temperature. The estimated thermal history of the nucleus of the short-period comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko indicates that the surface temperature does not exceed -45 degrees C, even in a region exposed to strong solar illumination during the perihelion passage. Assuming hydration is controlled by the collision frequency between H2O molecules and dust particles, the present results indicate that cometary dust does not hydrate for more than 25-510 periods of comet 67P. This is consistent with the absence of phyllosilicates on 67P and suggests that amino acids and sugars have not been altered.

As a proof of concept, we use self-organizing maps (SOMs) to visualize a spectral energy distribution (SED) model library in the observed photometry space. The resulting visual maps allow for a better understanding of how the observed data maps to physical properties and allows for better optimization of the model libraries for a given set of observational data. Next, the SOMs are used to estimate the physical parameters of 14,000 z similar to 1 galaxies in the COSMOS field and are found to be in agreement with those measured with SED fitting. However, the SOM method is able to estimate the full probability distribution functions for each galaxy up to similar to 10(6) times faster than direct model fitting. We conclude by discussing how this acceleration, as well as learning how the galaxy data manifold maps to physical parameter space and visualizing this mapping in lower dimensions, helps overcome other challenges in galaxy formation and evolution.

We use the state-of-the-art ECHAM6-HAMMOZ global chemistry-climate model to investigate the seasonal transport of anthropogenic Asian sulfate aerosols and their impact on the UTLS. Sensitivity simulations for SO2 emission perturbation over India (48% increase) and China (70% decrease) are performed based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite-observed trend, rising over India by similar to 4.8% per year and decreasing over China by similar to 7.0% per year during 2006-2017. The enhanced Indian emissions result in an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD) loading in the UTLS by 0.61 to 4.17% over India. These aerosols are transported to the Arctic during all seasons by the lower branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation enhancing AOD by 0.017% to 4.8 %. Interestingly, a reduction in SO2 emission over China inhibits the transport of Indian sulfate aerosols to the Arctic in summer-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons due to subsidence over northern India. The region of sulfate aerosol enhancement shows significant warming in the UTLS over northern India, south China (0.2 +/- 0.15 to 0.8 +/- 0.72 K) and the Arctic (similar to 1 +/- 0.62 to 1.6 +/- 1.07 K). The estimated seasonal mean direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) induced by the increase in Indian SO2 emission is -0.2 to -1.5 W m(-2) over northern India. The Chinese SO2 emission reduction leads to a positive radiative forcing of similar to 0.6 to 6 W m(-2) over China. The decrease in vertical velocity and the associated enhanced stability of the upper troposphere in response to increased Indian SO2 emissions will likely decrease rainfall over India.

Planetary encounter analysis on the B-plane: a comprehensive formulation	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Planetary encounters; Impact hazard; Orbital dynamics		The B-plane is a fundamental tool to analyze planetary encounters of small bodies and spacecraft flybys. In this paper, we review the B-plane formulation with a full derivation of its coordinates and their partial derivatives, which allow the mapping of orbital uncertainties onto the B-plane. We find that this mapping can be sensitive to variations in the inbound asymptote, especially for low-velocity encounters, and to non-Keplerian dynamics for distant encounters. Under linearity assumptions, we show how to derive close approach boundaries and impact probabilities from the orbital uncertainty mapped onto the B-plane.

Using GRACE in a streamflow recession to determine drainable water storage in the Mississippi River basin	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							BASEFLOW RECESSION; SEPARATION METHODS; CLIMATE EXPERIMENT; GRAVITY RECOVERY; FLOW SEPARATION; HIGH-PLAINS; RECHARGE; AQUIFER; MODELS	The study of the relationship between water storage and runoff generation has long been a focus of the hydrological sciences. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides monthly depth-integrated information on terrestrial water storage anomalies derived from time-variable gravity observations. As the first basin-scale storage measurement technique, these data offer potentially novel insight into the storage-discharge relationship. Here, we apply GRACE data in a streamflow recession analysis with river discharge measurements across several subdomains of the Mississippi River basin. Nonlinear regression analysis was used for 12 watersheds to determine that the fraction of baseflow in streams during non-winter months varies from 52% to 75% regionally. Additionally, the first quantitative estimate of absolute drainable water storage was estimated. For the 2002-2014 period, the drainable storage in the Mississippi River basin ranged from 2900 +/- 400 to 3600 +/- 400 km(3).

Interannual variations of water vapor in the tropical upper troposphere and the lower and middle stratosphere and their connections to ENSO and QBO	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MOIST THERMODYNAMIC STRUCTURE; CLIMATE FEEDBACKS; TROPOPAUSE LAYER; EL-NINO; VARIABILITY; ICE; OSCILLATION; TEMPERATURE; DISRUPTION; CONVECTION	In this study, we analyze the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder water vapor data in the tropical upper troposphere and the lower and middle stratosphere (UTLMS) (from 215 to 6 hPa) for the period from August 2004 to September 2017 using time-lag regression analysis and composite analysis to explore the interannual variations of tropical UTLMS water vapor and their connections to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Our analysis shows that the interannual tropical UTLMS water vapor anomalies are strongly related to ENSO and QBO which together can explain more than half (similar to 50%-60%) but not all variance of the interannual tropical water vapor anomalies. We find that ENSO's impact is strong in the upper troposphere (similar to 215-similar to 120 hPa) and near the tropopause (similar to 110-similar to 90 hPa), with a similar to 3-month lag but weak in the lower and middle stratosphere (similar to 80 to similar to 6 hPa). In contrast, QBO's role is large in the lower and middle stratosphere, with an upward-propagating signal starting at the tropopause (100 hPa) with a similar to 2-month lag, peaking in the middle stratosphere near 15 hPa with a similar to 21-month lag. The phase lag is based on the 50 hPa QBO index used by many previous studies. This observational evidence supports that the QBO's impact on the tropical stratospheric water vapor is from its modulation on the tropical tropopause temperature and then transported upward with the tape recorder as suggested by many previous studies. In the upper troposphere, ENSO is more important than QBO for the interannual tropical water vapor anomalies that are positive during the warm ENSO phases but negative during the cold ENSO phases. Near the tropopause, both ENSO and QBO are important for the interannual tropical water vapor anomalies. Warm ENSO phase and westerly QBO phase tend to cause positive water vapor anomalies, while cold ENSO phase and easterly QBO phase tend to cause negative water vapor anomalies. As a result, the interannual tropical water vapor anomalies near the tropopause are different depending on different ENSO and QBO phase combinations. In the lower and middle stratosphere, QBO is more important than ENSO for the interannual tropical water vapor anomalies. For the westerly QBO phases, interannual tropical water vapor anomalies are positive near the tropopause and in the lower stratosphere but negative in the middle stratosphere and positive again above. Vice versa for the easterly QBO phases.

Here, we present the observation of one up-link sodium laser beam acquired with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at a resolution lambda/Delta lambda similar to 140 000. In 900 s on source, we detect the pure rotational Raman lines of O-16(2), N-14(2), and (NN)-N-14-N-15 (tentatively) up to rotational quantum numbers J of 27, 24, and 9, respectively. We detect the O-16(2) fine-structure lines induced by the interaction of the electronic spin S and end-over-end rotational angular momentum N in the electronic ground state of this molecule up to N = 9. The same spectrum also reveals the nu(1 <- 0) rotational-vibrational Q-branch for O-16(2) and N-14(2). These observations demonstrate the potential of using laser guide-star systems as accurate calibration sources for characterizing new astronomical spectrographs.	[Vogt, Frederic P.

Key to the understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system is the study of ocean and sea-ice physical processes, including its interactions with the atmosphere, cryosphere, land, and biosphere. These processes include those linked to ocean circulation; the storage and redistribution of heat, carbon, salt and other water properties; and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, freshwater, carbon, and other gasses. Measurements of ocean physics variables are fundamental to reliable earth prediction systems for a range of applications and users. In addition, knowledge of the physical environment is fundamental to growing understanding of the ocean's biogeochemistry and biological/ecosystem variability and function. Through the progress from OceanObs'99 to OceanObs'09, the ocean observing system has evolved from a platform centric perspective to an integrated observing system. The challenge now is for the observing system to evolve to respond to an increasingly diverse end user group. The Ocean Observations Physics and Climate panel (OOPC), formed in 1995, has undertaken many activities that led to observing system-related agreements. Here, OOPC will explore the opportunities and challenges for the development of a fit-for-purpose, sustained and prioritized ocean observing system, focusing on physical variables that maximize support for fundamental research, climate monitoring, forecasting on different timescales, and society. OOPC recommendations are guided by the Framework for Ocean Observing which emphasizes identifying user requirements by considering time and space scales of the Essential Ocean Variables. This approach provides a framework for reviewing the adequacy of the observing system, looking for synergies in delivering an integrated observing system for a range of applications and focusing innovation in areas where existing technologies do not meet these requirements.

The 2015-2016 carbon cycle as seen from OCO-2 and the global in situ network	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTROMETER; VARIATIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; TRANSPORT MODEL; XCO2 RETRIEVALS; FIRE EMISSIONS; NORTH-AMERICA; COLUMN CO2; SURFACE	The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 has been on orbit since 2014, and its global coverage holds the potential to reveal new information about the carbon cycle through the use of top-down atmospheric inversion methods combined with column average CO2 retrievals. We employ a large ensemble of atmospheric inversions utilizing different transport models, data assimilation techniques, and prior flux distributions in order to quantify the satellite-informed fluxes from OCO-2 Version 7r land observations and their uncertainties at continental scales. Additionally, we use in situ measurements to provide a baseline against which to compare the satellite-constrained results. We find that within the ensemble spread, in situ observations, and satellite retrievals constrain a similar global total carbon sink of 3.7 +/- 0.5 PgC yr(-1), and 1.5 +/- 0.6 PgC yr(-1) for global land, for the 2015-2016 annual mean. This agreement breaks down in smaller regions, and we discuss the differences between the experiments. Of particular interest is the difference between the different assimilation constraints in the tropics, with the largest differences occurring in tropical Africa, which could be an indication of the global perturbation from the 2015-2016 El Nino. Evaluation of posterior concentrations using TCCON and aircraft observations gives some limited insight into the quality of the different assimilation constraints, but the lack of such data in the tropics inhibits our ability to make strong conclusions there.

Multiple official and research-grade retrievals provide a means for cross validation across sensors and algorithms, but produces substantial variation across products due to differences in instrument characteristics and retrieval algorithm. The lack of a consistent, calibrated SIF data set hampers scientific interpretation of planetary photosynthesis. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) offers small sampling footprints, high data acquisition, and repeating spatially resolved targets at bioclimatically diverse locations, providing a unique benchmark for spaceborne sensors traceable to ground data. We leverage overlap between the longer running Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument version 2 (GOME-2) SIF time series, and more recent state-of-the-art OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data, in a first attempt to reconcile inconsistencies in the long-term record. After screening and correcting for key instrument differences (time of day, wavelength, Sun-sensor geometry, cloud effects, footprint area), we find that Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument version 2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument perform exceedingly well in capturing spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability across OCO-2 targets. However, Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument version 2 retrieval methods differ by up to a factor of 2 in signal-to-noise and magnitude. Magnitude differences are largely attributed to retrieval window choice, with wider windows producing higher magnitudes. The assumed SIF spectral shape has negligible effect. Substantial research is needed to understand remaining sensitivities to atmospheric absorption and reflectance. We conclude that OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument have opened up the possibility to produce a multidecadal SIF record with well-characterized uncertainty and error quantification for overlapping instruments, enabling back-calibration of previous instruments and production of a consistent, research-grade, harmonized time series.

MESSENGER Observations of Disappearing Dayside Magnetosphere Events at Mercury	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Mercury; magnetosphere; exosphere; reconnection; induction; coronal mass ejections	FLUX-TRANSFER EVENTS; INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; BOW SHOCK; HYBRID SIMULATION; WIND; MAGNETOPAUSE; PLASMA; SURFACE; FLOW; INSTRUMENT	MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) measurements taken during passes over Mercury's dayside hemisphere indicate that on four occasions the spacecraft remained in the magnetosheath even though it reached altitudes below 300 km. During these disappearing dayside magnetosphere (DDM) events, the spacecraft did not encounter the magnetopause until it was at very high magnetic latitudes, similar to 66 to 80 degrees. These DDM events stand out with respect to their extremely high solar wind dynamic pressures, P-sw similar to 140 to 290 nPa, and intense southward magnetic fields, B-z similar to -100 to -400 nT, measured in the magnetosheath. In addition, the bow shock was observed very close to the surface during these events with a subsolar altitude of similar to 1,200 km. It is suggested that DDM events, which are closely associated with coronal mass ejections, are due to solar wind compression and/or reconnection-driven erosion of the dayside magnetosphere. The very low altitude of the bow shock during these events strongly suggests that the solar wind impacts much of Mercury's sunlit hemisphere during these events. More study of these disappearing dayside events is required, but it is likely that solar wind sputtering of neutrals from the surface into the exosphere maximizes during these intervals.	[Slavin, J.

A PCA-Based Framework for Determining Remotely Sensed Geological Surface Orientations and Their Statistical Quality	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						PCA; structural geology; orientation; unmanned aerial vehicle; photogrammetry; statistics	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; VALLES-MARINERIS; MELAS-CHASMA; ERRORS; MARS; REGRESSION; CRATER; ACCURACY; ORIGIN	The orientations of planar rock layers are fundamental to our understanding of structural geology and stratigraphy. Remote sensing platforms including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and Light Detection and Ranging scanners are increasingly used to build three-dimensional models of structural features on Earth and other planets. Remotely gathered orientation measurements are straightforward to calculate but subject to uncertainty inherited from input data, differences in viewing geometry, and the plane-fitting process, complicating geological interpretation. Here, we improve upon the present state of the art by developing a generalized means for computing and reporting errors in strike-dip measurements from remotely sensed data. We outline a general framework for representing the error space of uncertain orientations in Cartesian and spherical coordinates and develop a principal component analysis (PCA) regression method, which captures statistical errors independent of viewing geometry and input data structure. We also introduce graphical techniques to visualize the uniqueness and quality of orientation measurements and a process to increase statistical power by jointly fitting bedding planes under the assumption of parallel stratigraphy. These new techniques are validated by comparison of field-gathered orientation measurements with those derived from minimally processed satellite imagery of the San Rafael Swell, Utah, and unmanned aerial vehicle imagery from the Naukluft Mountains, Namibia. We provide software packages supporting planar fitting and visualization of error distributions. This method increases the precision and comparability of structural measurements gathered using a new generation of remote sensing techniques.	[Quinn, D. P.; Ehlmann, B.

Global Reconstruction of Naturalized River Flows at 2.94 Million Reaches	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SATELLITE-BASED PRECIPITATION; LAND-SURFACE; UNGAUGED BASINS; RUNOFF; DISCHARGE; NETWORK; WATER; STREAMFLOW; MODEL; HYDROLOGY	Spatiotemporally continuous global river discharge estimates across the full spectrum of stream orders are vital to a range of hydrologic applications, yet they remain poorly constrained. Here we present a carefully designed modeling effort (Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model and Routing Application for Parallel computation of Discharge river routing model) to estimate global river discharge at very high resolutions. The precipitation forcing is from a recently published 0.1 degrees global product that optimally merged gauge-, reanalysis-, and satellite-based data. To constrain runoff simulations, we use a set of machine learning-derived, global runoff characteristics maps (i.e., runoff at various exceedance probability percentiles) for grid-by-grid model calibration and bias correction. To support spaceborne discharge studies, the river flowlines are defined at their true geometry and location as much as possible -approximately 2.94 million vector flowlines (median length 6.8 km) and unit catchments are derived from a high-accuracy global digital elevation model at 3-arcsec resolution (similar to 90 m), which serves as the underlying hydrography for river routing. Our 35-year daily and monthly model simulations are evaluated against over 14,000 gauges globally. Among them, 35% (64%) have a percentage bias within +/- 20% (+/- 50%), and 29% (62%) have a monthly Kling-Gupta Efficiency >= 0.6 (0.2), showing data robustness at the scale the model is assessed. This reconstructed discharge record can be used as a priori information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission's discharge product, thus named "Global Reach-level A priori Discharge Estimates for Surface Water and Ocean Topography". It can also be used in other hydrologic applications requiring spatially explicit estimates of global river flows.

J	Ruddell, BL; Drewry, DT; Nearing, GS				Ruddell, Benjamin L.; Drewry, Darren T.; Nearing, Grey S.			Information Theory for Model Diagnostics: Structural Error is Indicated Trade-Off Between Functional and Predictive Performance	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; HYDROLOGIC-MODELS; DATA ASSIMILATION; LAND; UNCERTAINTY; BENCHMARKING; CALIBRATION; CLIMATE; CARBON; FRAMEWORK	Because of the possibility of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, the predictive performance of a complex systems model is not by itself a reliable indicator of hypothesis quality for the purposes of scientific learning about processes. The predictive performance of a structurally adequate model should be an emergent property of its functional performance. In this context, any Pareto trade-off between measures of predictive performance versus functional performance indicates process-level error in the model; this trade-off, if it exists, indicates that the model's predictions are right for the wrong functional reasons. This paper demonstrates a novel concept based on information theory that is capable of attributing observed errors to specific processes. To demonstrate that the concept and method hold true for models and observations of real systems, we employ a minimal single-parameter-variation sensitivity analysis using a sophisticated ecohydrology model, MLCan, for a well-monitored field site (Bondville IL Ameriflux Soybean). We identify both functional and predictive error in MLCan, and also evidence of the hypothesized tradeoffs between the two. This trade-off indicates structural error within MLCan. For example, the sensible heat flux process can be calibrated to achieve good predictive performance at the cost of poor functional performance. In contrast, we find little structural error for processes driven by solar radiation, which appear "right for the right reasons." This method could be applied broadly to pinpoint process error and structural error in a wide range of system models, beyond the ecohydrological scope demonstrated here.

We used a land surface model integrated with a river routing scheme to analyze the hydrological alterations expected in the Tapajos River basin, a large portion of the Brazilian Amazon, caused by two environmental drivers: climate and land use. The model was forced with two future climate scenarios (years 2026-2045) from the Earth System Model HadGem2-ES with moderate (+4.5 W/m(2) radiative forcing value in the year 2100 with respect to preindustrial levels) and severe (+8.5 W/m(2)) representative atmospheric carbon dioxide pathways (Representative Concentration Pathways). We tested the sensitivity of our results to the uncertainty in future climate projections by running simulations with IPSL-CM5 (wettest scenarios) and GISS-E2 (driest scenarios). Human land use effects on vegetation were evaluated using a limited and an extreme deforestation scenario. Our analysis indicates that climate change is predicted to reduce river flows across seasons (up to 20%) and bring a considerable shift in flow seasonality toward a later onset (nearly 1.5 months) and increase in interannual variability. While land use change partially counteracts the climate-driven diminishing trend in river flows, it is expected to contribute to a further increase in interannual and intraannual variability. From a water management perspective, the overall reduction of river flows and their increased variability, combined with the shift and the shortening of the wet season, could potentially affect the productivity of the large hydropower systems planned for the region and the growing demand for agricultural and transport expansion. Plain Language Summary Climate and land use change are expected to heavily modify the water cycle. This is particularly true in tropical areas, where human-driven changes may completely alter river discharge. The Amazon is the largest of the remaining tropical forests. Increasing agriculture and livestock production have significantly altered land cover in the region. This pattern is projected to continue in the coming decades. The change in the Amazon's future is highly uncertain: the direct effects of climate and land use change are not well understood and the response also depends on complex Earth-atmosphere exchanges. We used computer models representing water and energy cycles over time to understand how environmental changes are likely to alter the discharge of the Tapajos River system in southeastern Amazon. By combining two climate and two land use scenarios, we found that climate change is expected to reduce the river flows in the basin, bringing a delay in the flow seasonality and increasing the overall variability. Land use change, conversely, is expected to cause an increase in flow magnitude and variability. Besides the serious environmental consequences, these findings have important implications for the management and development of water in this strategic area for Brazil's energy and food production.

Since discharge of subglacial sediment will evolve in response to glacier retreat, estimating future subglacial sediment dynamics is of great relevance. To develop tools and methods to better constrain the responsible processes, we present a till dynamics model that accounts for limited sediment access coupled to a subglacial hydrology model to describe the evolution of a subglacial till layer over a glacier's longitudinal profile in one dimension. Synthetic simulations examining the effects of changing hydrology highlight the importance of properly constraining both the erosion of underlying bedrock and the subglacial sediment connectivity. This is because changes in hydrology alter the timing of peak sediment discharge but only marginally affect total sediment discharge once the subglacial sediment reservoir is exhausted. Model simulations for real-world glaciers yield insights into the distribution of sediment along the glacier bed, including locations where sediments are deposited or exhausted. Comparison between model results and field data shows that total and peak sediment discharge, as well as interannual variability, can be captured with acceptable skill for periods ranging from hours to decades. The results from this model show that modeling subglacial sediment transport on decadal to subdaily scales is possible but requires processes such as bedrock erosion and sediment connectivity to be considered.

Here we examine the wind work in a pair of global, very high-resolution (1/48 degrees and 1/24 degrees) MIT general circulation model simulations in Latitude-Longitude-polar Cap (LLC) configuration that provide hourly output at spatial resolutions of a few kilometers and include tidal forcing. A cospectrum analysis of wind stress and ocean surface currents shows positive contribution at large scales (>300 km) and near-inertial frequency and negative contribution from mesoscales, tidal frequencies, and internal gravity waves. Larger surface kinetic energy fluxes are in the Kuroshio in winter at large scales (40 mW/m(2)) and mesoscales (-30 mW/m(2)). The Kerguelen region is dominated by large scale (similar to 20 mW/m(2)), followed by inertial oscillations in summer (13 mW/m(2)) and mesoscale in winter (-12 mW/m(2)). Kinetic energy fluxes from internal gravity waves (-0.1 to -9.9 mW/m(2)) are generally stronger in summer. Surface kinetic energy fluxes in the LLC simulations are 4.71 TW, which is 25-85% higher than previous global estimates from coarser (1/6-1/10 degrees) general ocean circulation models; this is likely due to improved representation of wind variability (6-hourly, 0.14 degrees, operational European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). However, the low wind power input to the near-inertial frequency band obtained with LLC (0.16 TW) compared to global slab models suggests that wind variability on time scales less than 6 hr and spatial scales less than 15 km are critical to better representing the wind power input in ocean circulation models.

Retrieving Sea Ice Drag Coefficients and Turning Angles From In Situ and Satellite Observations Using an Inverse Modeling Framework	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						sea ice drift; observations; inverse modeling; drag coefficients	WESTERN ARCTIC-OCEAN; FRESH-WATER; NEIGHBORHOOD ALGORITHM; GEOPHYSICAL INVERSION; INTERNAL WAVES; SURFACE STRESS; FORM DRAG; IMPACT; HEAT; SIMULATIONS	For ice concentrations less than 85%, internal ice stresses in the sea ice pack are small and sea ice is said to be in free drift. The sea ice drift is then the result of a balance between Coriolis acceleration and stresses from the ocean and atmosphere. We investigate sea ice drift using data from individual drifting buoys as well as Arctic-wide gridded fields of wind, sea ice, and ocean velocity. We perform probabilistic inverse modeling of the momentum balance of free-drifting sea ice, implemented to retrieve the Nansen number, scaled Rossby number, and stress turning angles. Since this problem involves a nonlinear, underconstrained system, we used a Monte Carlo guided search scheme-the Neighborhood Algorithm-to seek optimal parameter values for multiple observation points. We retrieve optimal drag coefficients of C-A = 1.2 x 10(-3) and C-O = 2.4 x 10(-3) from 10-day averaged Arctic-wide data from July 2014 that agree with the AIDJEX standard, with clear temporal and spatial variations. Inverting daily averaged buoy data give parameters that, while more accurately resolved, suggest that the forward model oversimplifies the physical system at these spatial and temporal scales. Our results show the importance of the correct representation of geostrophic currents. Both atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients are found to decrease with shorter temporal averaging period, informing the selection of drag coefficient for short timescale climate models.

Although these datasets individually provide valuable information, in aggregate they provide additional opportunities to discover meaningful patterns on a large scale. However, the ability to combine and analyze disparate datasets is challenged by the potentially vast parameter space that results from aggregation. Each dataset in itself requires instrument-specific and dataset-specific knowledge. If the intention is to use multiple, diverse datasets, one needs an understanding of how to translate and combine these parameters in an efficient and effective manner. While there are established techniques for combining datasets from specific domains or platforms, there is no generic, automated method that can address the problem in general. Here, we discuss the application of deep learning to track objects across different image-like data-modalities, given data in a similar spatio-temporal range, and automatically co-register these images. Using deep belief networks combined with unsupervised learning methods, we are able to recognize and separate different objects within image-like data in a structured manner, thus making progress toward the ultimate goal of a generic tracking and fusion pipeline requiring minimal human intervention.

J	Kupinski, M; Bradley, C; Diner, D; Xu, F; Chipman, R				Kupinski, Meredith; Bradley, Christine; Diner, David; Xu, Feng; Chipman, Russell			Angle of linear polarization images of outdoor scenes	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						angle of linear polarization; polarimetric imaging; polarized light scattering; multiangle spectropolarimetric imager	SCATTERING; REFLECTANCE; LIGHT; MODEL; SKYLIGHT; CLEAR	Observations from the Ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) are used to relate angle of linear polarization (AoLP) measurements to material properties and illumination conditions in sunlit outdoor environments. GroundMSPI is a push-broom spectropolarimetric camera with an uncertainty in degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of +/- 0.005. This polarimetric accuracy yields useful AoLP images even when the DoLP is less than 0.02. AoLP images are reported with respect to dependency on surface texture, surface orientation, albedo, and illumination conditions. Agreement with well-known principles of polarized light scattering is illustrated, and several special cases are described. Expected observations of AoLP tangential to surface orientation and AoLP perpendicular to the scattering plane are reported. Significant changes in the AoLP are observed from common variations in outdoor illumination conditions. Also, simple variants in material properties change the dominant polarized light scattering process and thus the AoLP. Measurement examples that isolate a 90 deg AoLP flip are shown for a sunny and cloudy day as well as an object of high and low albedo. (C) The Authors.

J	Kupinski, M; Bradley, C; Diner, D; Xu, F; Chipman, R				Kupinski, Meredith; Bradley, Christine; Diner, David; Xu, Feng; Chipman, Russell			Estimating surface orientation from microfacet Mueller matrix bidirectional reflectance distribution function models in outdoor passive imaging polarimetry	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						land surface; reflection models; polarized light scattering; Mueller matrix bidirectional reflectance distribution function; bidirectional reflectance distribution matrix; bidirectional polarized reflectance distribution function; multiangle spectropolarimetric imager	AEROSOL PROPERTIES; POLARIZED REFLECTANCE; LAND SURFACES; RETRIEVAL; SCATTERING; LIGHT; OCEAN; VEGETATION; INTENSITY	Representative examples from 3 years of measurements from JPL's ground-based multiangle spectropolarimetric imager (GroundMSPI) are compared to a Mueller matrix bidirectional reflectance distribution function (mmBRDF). This mmBRDF is used to model polarized light scattering from solar illuminated surfaces. The camera uses a photoelastic-modulator-based polarimetric imaging technique to measure linear Stokes parameters in three wavebands (470, 660, and 865 nm) with a +/- 0.005 uncertainty in degree of linear polarization. GroundMSPI measurements are made over a range of scattering angles determined from a fixed viewing geometry and varying sun positions over time. This microfacet mmBRDF model predicts an angle of the linear polarization that is consistently perpendicular to the scattering plane and therefore is only appropriate for rough surface types. The model is comprised of a volumetric reflection term plus a specular reflection term of Fresnel-reflecting microfacets. The following modifications to this mmBRDF model are evaluated: an apodizing shadowing function, a Breon or Gaussian microfacet scattering density function, and treating the surface orientation as an additional model parameter in the specular reflection term. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the GroundMSPI measurements and these various forms of the microfacet mmBRDF model is reported. Four example scenes for which a shadowed-Breon microfacet mmBRDF model yields realistic estimates of surface orientation, and the lowest RMSE among other model options are shown. (C) The Authors.

The comparison relies on the unique UAVSAR Jet propulsion Laboratory (JPL)/NASA L-band data, P-band data acquired by ONERA airborne system (SETHI), Small Footprint LiDAR (SFL), and NASA Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) LiDAR datasets acquired in 2015 and 2016 in the frame of the AfriSAR campaign. Prior to multi-baseline data processing, a phase residual correction methodology based on phase calibration via phase center double localization has been implemented to improve the phase measurements and compensate for the phase perturbations, and disturbances originated from uncertainties in allocating flight trajectories. First, the vertical structure was estimated from L- and P-band corrected Tomography SAR data measurements, then compared with the canopy height model from SFL data. After that, the SAR and LiDAR three-dimensional (3D) datasets are compared and discussed at a qualitative basis at the region of interest. The L- and P-band's performance for canopy penetration was assessed to determine the underlying ground locations. Additionally, the 3D records for each configuration were compared with their ability to derive forest vertical structure. Finally, the vertical structure extracted from the 3D radar reflectivity from L- and P-band are compared with SFL data, resulting in a root mean square error of 3.02 m and 3.68 m, where the coefficient of determination shows a value of 0.95 and 0.93 for P- and L-band, respectively. The results demonstrate that TomoSAR holds promise for a scientific basis in forest management activities.

Urban Flood Detection with Sentinel-1 Multi-Temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Observations in a Bayesian Framework: A Case Study for Hurricane Matthew	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						SAR intensity time series; urban flood mapping; double bounce effect; Hurricane Matthew	ALGORITHM; AREAS	In this study we explored the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity time series for urban flood detection. Our test case was the flood in Lumberton, North Carolina, USA, caused by the landfall of Hurricane Matthew on 8 October 2016, for which airborne imagery-taken on the same day as the SAR overpass-is available for validation of our technique. To map the flood, we first carried out normalization of the SAR intensity observations, based on the statistics from the time series, and then construct a Bayesian probability function for intensity decrease (due to specular reflection of the signal) and intensity increase (due to double bounce) cases separately. We then formed a flood probability map, which we used to create our preferred flood extent map using a global cutoff probability of 0.5. Our flood map in the urban area showed a complicated mosaicking pattern of pixels showing SAR intensity decrease, pixels showing intensity increase, and pixels without significant intensity changes. Our approach shows improved performance when compared with global thresholding on log intensity ratios, as the time series-based normalization has accounted for a certain level of spatial variation by considering the different history for each pixel. This resulted in improved performance for urban and vegetated regions. We identified smooth surfaces, like asphalt roads, and SAR shadows as the major sources of underprediction, and aquatic plants and soil moisture changes were the major sources of overprediction.

Nevertheless, studies on collective cell migration have largely focused on epithelial growth and repair mechanisms and have only recently expanded to explore coordinated metastatic cancer and smooth muscle cell behaviors. The regulatory mechanisms of smooth muscle cell collective migration, such as leader-follower organization and mechanosensitivity, remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of leader cells during collective smooth muscle cell migration using dynamic cell tracking and single cell gene expression analysis. Engineered wound models, including ingrowth, outgrowth, and straight edge geometries, along with traction force microscopy and finite element stress mapping reveal that smooth muscle leader cells are enhanced at the wound edge when the intercellular tension near the cell wound boundary is reduced. Pharmacological perturbation further supports the notion that mechanical force negatively regulates the formation of leader cells. The mechanical regulation of collective smooth muscle cell migration via the formation of leader cells may lead to novel treatment strategies for pathogenic smooth muscle cell conditions in the future.

J	Yin, Y; Bowman, K; Bloom, AA; Worden, J				Yin, Yi; Bowman, Kevin; Bloom, A. Anthony; Worden, John			Detection of fossil fuel emission trends in the presence of natural carbon cycle variability	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						fossil fuel emissions; trend detection; CO2 monitor; carbon cycle	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; URBAN CO2 EMISSIONS; ATMOSPHERIC INVERSION; VERIFICATION; DIOXIDE; GEOCARB; MISSION; CMIP5; CH4	Atmospheric CO2 observations have the potential to monitor regional fossil fuel emission (FFCO2) changes to support carbon mitigation efforts such as the Paris Accord, but they must contend with the confounding impacts of the natural carbon cycle. Here, we quantify trend detection time and magnitude in gridded total CO2 fluxes-the sum of FFCO2 and natural carbon fluxes-under an idealized assumption that monthly total CO2 fluxes can be perfectly resolved at a 2 degrees x 2 degrees resolution. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) 'business-as-usual' emission scenarios to represent FFCO2 and simulated net biome exchange (NBE) to represent natural carbon fluxes, we find that trend detection time for the total CO2 fluxes at such a resolution has a median of 10 years across the globe, with significant spatial variability depending on FFCO2 magnitude and NBE variability. Differences between trends in the total CO2 fluxes and the underlying FFCO2 component highlight the role of natural carbon cycle variability in modulating regional detection of FFCO2 emission trends using CO2 observations alone, particularly in the tropics and subtropics where mega-cities with large populations are developing rapidly. Using CO2 estimates alone at such a spatiotemporal resolution can only quantify fossil fuel trends in a few places-mostly limited to arid regions. For instance, in the Middle East, FFCO2 can explain more than 75% of the total CO2 trends in similar to 70% of the grids, but only similar to 20% of grids in China can meet such criteria. Only a third of the 25 megacities we analyze here show total CO2 trends that are primarily explained (>75%) by FFCO2. Our analysis provides a theoretical baseline at a global scale for the design of regional FFCO2 monitoring networks and underscores the importance of estimating biospheric interannual variability to improve the accuracy of FFCO2 trend monitoring. We envision that this can be achieved with a fully integrated carbon cycle assimilation system with explicit constraints on FFCO2 and NBE, respectively.	[Yin, Yi; Bowman, Kevin; Bloom, A.

From the start, the process includes balancing conflicting needs. Thermal control paints must have the ability to either absorb or emit heat as desired and this property cannot change beyond a set point over the life of the mission. When the mission involves operating in a heavy charging environment, the control coating must be static dissipative enough to bleed away absorbed energetic electrons to minimize induced electric fields and the risk of electrostatic discharges (ESDs). Finding the right balance of thermal performance and electrical performance can be difficult for spacecraft designers. In an effort to aid in spacecraft design, a number of white and black thermal control coatings were tested at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using a two-part test campaign. These tests involved an initial screening test to determine the bulk resistivity of the material using a traditional parallel-plate test, but placed in a vacuum chamber immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen to obtain data over a range of temperatures. The most promising materials were then exposed to a stream of energetic electrons and monitored for the production of ESDs. Results from these tests indicated that only a few of the common thermal control coatings have a resistivity below 10(9)Omega cm as suggested in NASA-HDBK-4002A. Of those that meet this criterion, most will still produce ESDs when exposed to electrons with energies from 20 to 60 keV while held at cryogenic temperatures. Additional testing is required to characterize additional coatings to create a database that designers may use when selecting an appropriate coating for their application.

Wireless Antenna Detection of Electrostatic Discharge Events	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article						Antenna; arcing; breakdown; electrostatic discharge (ESD); polymers; space environment effects; spacecraft charging; standards	ENVIRONMENT	Wireless intraspacecraft communication technology is being developed for signal transfer on space missions to save weight and simplify the design. One consideration for this new technology is its interaction with space environment-induced electrostatic discharges (ESDs). The short time scales of spacecraft ESD events result in broad frequency band signals that can interact with high-frequency wireless antennas. These interactions present a source of signal noise. However, they also present a possibility of in-flight wireless ESD monitoring. We present laboratory measurements of arcing on common spacecraft insulators using commercially available single-band 2.4-GHz and dual-band 2.4-/5.8-GHz Wi-Fi antennas. These wireless detections are shown to coincide with direct simultaneous measurements of discharge event currents. The amplitudes of the wireless signals are shown to provide a measure of the relative magnitude of the arcs, although the narrow frequency ranges of Wi-Fi antennas make absolute measures of the discharge intensity impractical. The wireless signals are shown to provide very accurate nanosecond timing of ESD events, which presents the potential of identifying arc location on a spacecraft with the use of time-of-flight detection from multiple antennas.

The low-energy 1-50-keV environment measured by the Galileo PLS has previously been at best poorly defined as the PLS electron data were found to have been contaminated by high-energy electrons. To address this issue, the raw PLS data have been reanalyzed orbit by orbit and detector by detector. The results indicate that the Voyager and the Galileo spectra, previously fit by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, may be better fit by a more complex combination of Maxwell-Boltzmann plus kappa or a polynomial. The new spectra derived from the Voyager and Galileo PLS instruments are presented for a range of applicability from similar to 8 to similar to 40 Rj.

Trapped Particle Environments of the Outer Planets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article						Jupiter; magnetosphere; Neptune; particle charging; radiation; Saturn; Uranus	MODEL; JUPITER	High-energy, trapped electron and proton environments around the outer planets can pose a serious threat to spacecraft operations. For example, high-energy electrons are a critical source for a phenomenon called internal electrostatic discharge (IESD) which is believed to be the number one cause of spacecraft anomalies in the space radiation environment. Several missions are being considered by NASA that will go to the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Indeed, NASA currently has plans to send two spacecraft to Jupiter: one as an orbiter that will perform multiple flybys of Europa and another as a Europa Lander. Of the mission concepts selected for the latest New Frontier Competition, one is to visit Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Similarly, NASA also has identified missions to Uranus and/or Neptune as potential flagship missions in the last decadal survey. For all of these missions, radiation dose and IESD are potentially critical design parameters. Understanding the trapped election and proton environments at these planets to be able to specify the radiation and IESD design environments for them is an important prerequisite in mitigating these potential hazards. In this paper, we will compare the trapped high-energy electron (E > 1 MeV) and proton (E > 5-10 MeV) environments at Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to that at the earth using the latest trapped particle models developed at JPL: GIRE3 for Jupiter, SATRAD for Saturn, UMOD for Uranus, and NMOD for Neptune. The global structure of the electron and proton belts and the dose profiles for possible mission scenarios will be presented and compared.

Based on the properties of anisotropy of eddies in magnetized turbulence, the velocity gradient technique is a method synergistic to dust polarimetry that is capable of tracing plane-of-the-sky magnetic fields, measuring the magnetization of interstellar media and estimating the fraction of gravitational collapsing gas in molecular clouds using spectral line observations. Here, we apply this technique to five low-mass star-forming molecular clouds in the Gould Belt and compare the results to the magnetic field orientation obtained from polarized dust emission. We find that the estimates of magnetic field orientations and magnetization for both methods are statistically similar. We estimate the fraction of collapsing gas in the selected clouds. By using the velocity gradient technique, we also present the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation and magnetization of the Smith Cloud, for which dust polarimetry data are unavailable.

DES Collaboration; SPT Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Tomographic cross-correlations between Dark Energy Survey galaxies and CMB lensing from South Pole Telescope plus Planck	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DES; SDSS; COSMOLOGY; EFFICIENT	We measure the cross-correlation between REDMAGIC galaxies selected from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) year 1 data and gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) reconstructed from South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck data over 1289 deg(2). When combining measurements across multiple galaxy redshift bins spanning the redshift range of 0.15 < z < 0.90, we reject the hypothesis of no correlation at 19.9 sigma significance. When removing small-scale data points where thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal and nonlinear galaxy bias could potentially bias our results, the detection significance is reduced to 9.9 sigma. We perform a joint analysis of galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlations and galaxy clustering to constrain cosmology, finding Omega m = 0.276(-0.030)(+0.029) and S-8 = sigma(8) root Omega(m)/0.3 = 0.800(-0.094)(+0.090). we also perform two alternate analyses aimed at constraining only the growth rate of cosmic structure as a function of redshift, finding consistency with predictions from the concordance Lambda CDM model. The measurements presented here are part of a joint cosmological analysis that combines galaxy clustering, galaxy lensing and CMB lensing using data from DES, SPT and Planck.

NANOGrav Collaboration	The NANOGrav 11 yr Data Set: Limits on Gravitational Waves from Individual Supermassive Black Hole Binaries	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational waves; pulsars: general; quasars: supermassive black holes	PULSAR TIMING ARRAY; SINGLE SOURCES; CONSTRAINTS	Observations indicate that nearly all galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers. When galaxies merge, their component black holes form SMBH binaries (SMBHBs), which emit low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) that can be detected by pulsar timing arrays. We have searched the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 11 yr data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits. As we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95% upper limits on the strength of GWs from such sources. At f(gw) = 8 nHz, we placed a sky-averaged upper limit of h(0) < 7.3(3) x 10(-15). We also developed a technique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar using "dropout" parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals. From these upper limits, we ruled out SMBHBs emitting GWs with f(gw) = 8 nHz within 120 Mpc for M = 10(9) M-circle dot, and within 5.5 Gpc for M = 10(10) M-circle dot at our most sensitive sky location. We also determined that there are no SMBHBs with > 1.6 x 10(9) M-circle dot emitting GWs with f(gw) = 2.8-317.8 nHz in the Virgo Cluster. Finally, we compared our strain upper limits to simulated populations of SMBHBs, based on galaxies in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and merger rates from the Illustris cosmological simulation project, and found that only 34 out of 75,000 realizations of the local universe contained a detectable source.

Different heterostructures of LE resonators having Al/AlN/Si, Al/AlN, AlN/Si, and Si are designed and fabricated using standard MEMS processes. Experimental Qs along with resonances are obtained using electrical and optical readout and are compared with the modeled and analytically obtained Qs. The results show that the thermoelastic damping (TED) in metal electrode, anchor loss, and charge redistribution loss are not the dominant loss mechanisms. With the help of Mason's network modeling, we investigated the dielectric loss, which is also observed to be negligible for these resonators. An internal mechanical loss, originating from the columnar growth of AlN and observed using Mason's model, is proved to be the dominant loss mechanism. This observation is confirmed and reinforced by the COMOSL's FEM analysis of TED in AlN, having columnar growth effect and by experimental results.

J	Jiang, JH; Ji, X; Cowan, N; Hui, RY; Zhu, ZH				Jiang, Jonathan H.; Ji, Xuan; Cowan, Nicolas; Hui, Renyu; Zhu, Zonghong			Empirical Predictions for the Period Distribution of Planets to Be Discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; planetary systems; surveys; telescopes		Launched in 2018 April, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been performing a wide-field survey for exoplanets orbiting bright stars with a goal of producing a rich database for follow-on studies. Here we present estimates of the detected exoplanet orbital periods in the 2 minute cadence mode during the TESS mission. For a two-transit detection criterion, the expected mean value of the most frequently detected orbital period is 5.01 days, with the most frequently detected range of 2.12-11.82 days in the region with observation of 27 days. Near the poles where the observational duration is 351 days, the expected mean orbital period is 10.93 days, with the most frequently detected range being from 3.35 to 35.65 days. For one transit, the most frequently detected orbital period is 8.17 days in the region with observation of 27 days and 11.25 days in the region near the poles. For the entire TESS mission containing several sectors, we estimate that the mean value of orbital period is 8.47 days for two-transit detection criterion and 10.09 days for one-transit detection criterion. If TESS yields a planet population substantially different from what is predicted here, the underlying planet occurrence rates are likely different between the stellar sample probed by TESS and that by Kepler.

PanCET Collaboration	The Hubble Space Telescope PanCET Program: Exospheric Mg II and Fe II in the Near-ultraviolet Transmission Spectrum of WASP-121b Using Jitter Decorrelation	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; stars: individual (WASP-121); techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic	ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE; GIANT EXOPLANET; MASS EXOPLANET; HOT; PLANET; TRANSIT; WATER; UV; SPECTROSCOPY; EVAPORATION	We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-ultraviolet (NUV) transits of the hot Jupiter WASP-121b, acquired as part of the PanCET program. Time-series spectra during two transit events were used to measure the transmission spectra between 2280 and 3070 angstrom at a resolution of 30,000. Using HST data from 61 Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph visits, we show that data from HST s Pointing Control System can be used to decorrelate the instrument systematic errors (jitter decorrelation), which we used to fit the WASP-121b light curves. The NUV spectra show very strong absorption features, with the NUV white light curve found to be larger than the average optical and near-infrared value at 6 sigma confidence. We identify and spectrally resolve absorption from the Mg II doublet in the planetary exosphere at a 5.9 sigma confidence level. The Mg II doublet is observed to reach altitudes of R-p1/R-star, = 0.284 +/- 0.037 for the 2796 angstrom line and 0.242 +/- 0.0431 for the 2804 A line, which exceeds the Roche lobe size as viewed in transit geometry (R-eq(RL)/R-star = 0.158). We also detect and resolve strong features of the Fe II UV1 and UV2 multiplets, and observe the lines reaching altitudes of R-p1/R-star approximate to 0.3. At these high altitudes, the atmospheric Mg II and Fe II gas is not gravitationally bound to the planet, and these ionized species may be hydrodynamically escaping or could be magnetically confined. Refractory Mg and Fe atoms at high altitudes also indicate that these species are not trapped into condensate clouds at depth, which places constraints on the deep interior temperature.

J	Suselj, K; Kurowski, MJ; Teixeira, J				Suselj, Kay; Kurowski, Marcin J.; Teixeira, Joao			A Unified Eddy-Diffusivity/Mass-Flux Approach for Modeling Atmospheric Convection	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Convective parameterization; Cumulus clouds; Parameterization; Single column models; Subgrid-scale processes	SURFACE-GENERATED CONVECTION; HIGH-RESOLUTION SIMULATION; SCALE ELIMINATION MODEL; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; PDF-BASED MODEL; SHALLOW CUMULUS; PART I; DEEP CONVECTION; COLD POOLS; PARAMETERIZATION	A fully unified parameterization of boundary layer and moist convection (shallow and deep) is presented. The new parameterization is based on the stochastic multiplume eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux (EDMF) approach, which distinguishes between convective plumes and nonconvective mixing. The convective plumes represent both surface-forced updrafts and evaporatively driven downdrafts. The type of convection (i.e., dry, shallow, or deep) represented by the updrafts is not defined a priori, but rather depends on the near-surface updraft properties and the stochastic interactions between the plumes and the environment through lateral entrainment. Consequently, some updrafts may contribute only to the nonlocal transport within the subcloud layer, while others may condense and form shallow or even deep convection. Such a formulation is void of trigger functions and additional closures typical of modular parameterizations. The updrafts are coupled to relatively simple warm-, mixed-, and ice-phase microphysics. Each precipitating updraft forms a downdraft driven by the evaporation of detrained precipitation. The downdrafts control the development of cold pools near the surface that can invigorate convection. The new parameterization is tested in a single-column model against large-eddy simulations (LESs) for cases representing weakly precipitating marine convection and the diurnal cycle of continental deep convection. The results of these EDMF experiments compare well with the LES reference simulations. In particular, the transitions between the different dominant convection regimes are realistically simulated.

J	Wang, HC; Taylor, SR; Vallisneri, M				Wang, Haochen; Taylor, Stephen R.; Vallisneri, Michele			Bayesian cross validation for gravitational-wave searches in pulsar-timing array data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational waves; methods: statistical; pulsars: general	NOISE	Gravitational-wave data analysis demands sophisticated statistical noise models in a bid to extract highly obscured signals from data. In Bayesian model comparison, we choose among a landscape of models by comparing their marginal likelihoods. However, this computation is numerically fraught and can be sensitive to arbitrary choices in the specification of parameter priors. In Bayesian cross validation, we characterize the fit and predictive power of a model by computing the Bayesian posterior of its parameters in a training data set, and then use that posterior to compute the averaged likelihood of a different testing data set. The resulting cross-validation scores are straightforward to compute; they are insensitive to prior tuning; and they penalize unnecessarily complex models that overfit the training data at the expense of predictive performance. In this article, we discuss cross validation in the context of pulsar timing-array data analysis, and we exemplify its application to simulated pulsar data (where it successfully selects the correct spectral index of a stochastic gravitational-wave background), and to a pulsar data set from the NANOGrav 11-yr release (where it convincingly favours a model that represents a transient feature in the interstellar medium). We argue that cross validation offers a promising alternative to Bayesian model comparison, and we discuss its use for gravitational-wave detection, by selecting or refuting models that include a gravitational wave component.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: measurement of the galaxy angular power spectrum	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; REDSHIFT SURVEY; CENT DISTANCE; SAMPLE; SCALE; MICE; BAO; I.	We use data from the first-year observations of the DES collaboration to measure the galaxy angular power spectrum (APS), and search for its BAO feature. We test our methodology in a sample of 1800 DES Y1-like mock catalogues. We use the pseudo-C-l, method to estimate the APS and the mock catalogues to estimate its covariance matrix. We use templates to model the measured spectra and estimate template parameters firstly from the G's of the mocks using two different methods, a maximum likelihood estimator and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, finding consistent results with a good reduced chi(2). Robustness tests are performed to estimate the impact of different choices of settings used in our analysis. Finally, we apply our method to a galaxy sample constructed from DES Y1 data specifically for LSS studies. This catalogue comprises galaxies within an effective area of 1318 deg(2) and 0.6 < z < 1.0. We find that the DES Y1 data favour a model with BAO at the 2.6 sigma C.L. However, the goodness of fit is somewhat poor, with chi(2)/(d.o.f.) = 1.49. We identify a possible cause showing that using a theoretical covariance matrix obtained from C-l's that are better adjusted to data results in an improved value of chi(2)/(dof) = 1.36 which is similar to the value obtained with the real-space analysis. Our results correspond to a distance measurement of D-A (Z(eff) = 0.81)/r(d) = 10.65 +/- 0.49, consistent with the main DES BAO findings. This is a companion paper to the main DES BAO article showing the details of the harmonic space analysis.

Due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of the existing salinity measurements, previous studies of global salinity changes focused mostly on the surface and upper oceans. Here, we examine global ocean salinity changes and ocean vertical salt fluxes over the full depth in a dynamically consistent and data-constrained ocean state estimate. The changes of the horizontally averaged salinity display a vertically layered structure, consistent with the profiles of the ocean vertical salt fluxes. For salinity changes in the relatively well-observed upper ocean, the contribution of vertical exchange of salt can be on the same order of the net surface freshwater input. The vertical redistribution of salt thus should be considered in inferring changes in global ocean salinity and the hydrological cycle from the surface and upper ocean measurements.

Ice nucleation by aerosols from anthropogenic pollution	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							CLOUD CONDENSATION NUCLEI; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS; PARTICULATE MATTER; CONVECTIVE CLOUDS; OPTICAL DEPTH; PRECIPITATION; SATELLITE; IMPACTS; PARAMETERIZATION; MODEL	The formation of ice particles in the atmosphere strongly affects cloud properties and the climate. While mineral dust is known to be an effective ice nucleating particle, the role of aerosols from anthropogenic pollution in ice nucleation is still under debate. Here we probe the ice nucleation ability of different aerosol types by combining 11-year observations from multiple satellites and cloud-resolving model simulations. We find that, for strong convective systems, the ice particle effective radius near cloud top decreases with increasing loading of polluted continental aerosols, because the ice formation is dominated by homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets, which are smaller under more polluted conditions. By contrast, an increase in ice particle effective radius with polluted continental aerosols is found for moderate convection. Our model simulations suggest that this positive correlation is explained by enhanced heterogeneous ice nucleation and prolonged ice particle growth at higher aerosol loading, indicating that polluted continental aerosols contain a considerable fraction of ice nucleating particles. Similar aerosol-ice relationships are observed for dust aerosols, further corroborating the ice nucleation ability of polluted continental aerosols. By catalysing ice formation, aerosols from anthropogenic pollution could have profound impacts on cloud lifetime and radiative effect as well as precipitation efficiency.

Since the Curiosity rover landed in Gale crater in August 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory Science Team has explored the origins and habitability of ancient fluvial, deltaic, lacustrine and aeolian deposits preserved within the crater. This study describes the sedimentology of a ca 13 m thick succession named the Pahrump Hills member of the Murray formation, the first thick fine-grained deposit discovered in situ on Mars. This work evaluates the depositional processes responsible for its formation and reconstructs its palaeoenvironmental setting. The Pahrump Hills succession can be sub-divided into four distinct sedimentary facies: (i) thinly laminated mudstone; (ii) low-angle cross-stratified mudstone; (iii) cross-stratified sandstone; and (iv) thickly laminated mudstone-sandstone. The very fine grain size of the mudstone facies and abundant millimetre-scale and sub-millimetre-scale laminations exhibiting quasi-uniform thickness throughout the Pahrump Hills succession are most consistent with lacustrine deposition. Low-angle geometric discordances in the mudstone facies are interpreted as 'scour and drape' structures and suggest the action of currents, such as those associated with hyperpycnal river-generated plumes plunging into a lake. Observation of an overall upward coarsening in grain size and thickening of laminae throughout the Pahrump Hills succession is consistent with deposition from basinward progradation of a fluvial-deltaic system derived from the northern crater rim into the Gale crater lake. Palaeohydraulic modelling constrains the salinity of the ancient lake in Gale crater: assuming river sediment concentrations typical of floods on Earth, plunging river plumes and sedimentary structures like those observed at Pahrump Hills would have required lake densities near freshwater to form. The depositional model for the Pahrump Hills member presented here implies the presence of an ancient sustained, habitable freshwater lake in Gale crater for at least ca 10(3) to 10(7) Earth years.

The stream was claimed to be approximate to 1. Gyr old, which would make it an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples. We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to those of well-studied open clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the notable stars. lambda Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD. 1160 (host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct an isochronal analysis of the color-magnitude data for these highestmass members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e., approximate to 120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star clusters.

The star and its planet belong to Group 29, a young association in the foreground of the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. While hot Jupiters have been previously reported around young stars, those planets are non-transiting and near-term atmospheric characterization is not feasible. The V1298 Tau system is a compelling target for follow-up study through transmission spectroscopy and Doppler tomography owing to the transit depth (0.5%), host star brightness (K-s = 8.1 mag), and rapid stellar rotation (v sin i = 23 km s(-1)). Although the planet is Jupiter-sized, its mass is currently unknown due to high-amplitude radial velocity jitter. Nevertheless, V1298 Tau b may help constrain formation scenarios for at least one class of close-in exoplanets, providing a window into the nascent evolution of planetary interiors and atmospheres.

A Deep Learning Approach for Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Radiometer Calibration	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Calibration; CubeSats; deep learning; microwave radiometer; millimeter-wave radiometer; neural network; noise-wave model	SATELLITES	Deep learning artificial neural network techniques can be applied for on-orbit calibration of microwave and millimeter-wave radiometer spaceborne instruments, including those for small satellites. The noise-wave model has been employed for noise characterization and validation of the proposed deep learning calibration technique for a synthetically generated Dicke-switching radiometer. The developed deep learning neural network radiometer calibrator produces high accuracy estimates of antenna temperatures from the measurements of radiometer output voltage and thermistor readings. Tests with noise-free and noisy samples of the developed model have shown that the proposed calibration method does not add any significant noise to the radiometer calibration. The performance of the proposed method does not degrade with increased nonlinearity for a radiometer, while nonlinearity is a challenging issue for conventional calibration techniques. The deep learning calibration model learns the radiometer noise characteristics from radiometer prelaunch measurements during thermal vacuum chamber testing. The neural network calibrator proposed in this paper has self-learning capability during the on-orbit operation of a radiometer that can be used to improve the performance of on-orbit calibration. The proposed technique is demonstrated by comparing the residual uncertainty of the deep learning calibration with the theoretical value. No numerical study is presented to compare the performance with conventional calibration techniques. The new method may be solely applied to calibrate the radiometer or applied along with conventional calibration techniques.

Uncertainty of Reference Pixel Soil Moisture Averages Sampled at SMAP Core Validation Sites	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Remote sensing; Bias; Error analysis	STATISTICAL PROPERTIES; TEMPORAL STABILITY; BOOTSTRAP; PRODUCTS; NETWORK; PRECIPITATION; PERSISTENCE; HYDROLOGY; ERRORS; SPACE	Despite extensive efforts to maximize ground coverage and improve upscaling functions within core validation sites (CVS) of the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, spatial averages of point-scale soil moisture observations often fail to accurately capture the true average of the reference pixels. Therefore, some level of pixel-scale sampling error from in situ observations must be considered during the validation of SMAP soil moisture retrievals. Here, uncertainties in the SMAP core site average soil moisture (CSASM) due to spatial sampling errors are examined and their impact on CSASM-based SMAP calibration and validation metrics is discussed. The estimated uncertainty (due to spatial sampling limitations) of mean CSASM over time is found to be large, translating into relatively large sampling uncertainty levels for SMAP retrieval bias when calculated against CSASM. As a result, CSASM-based SMAP bias estimates are statistically insignificant at nearly all SMAP CVS. In addition, observations from temporary networks suggest that these (already large) bias uncertainties may be underestimated due to undersampled spatial variability. The unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of CSASM is estimated via two approaches: classical sampling theory and triple collocation, both of which suggest that CSASM ubRMSE is generally within the range of 0.01-0.02 m(3) m(-3). Although limitations in both methods likely lead to underestimation of ubRMSE, the results suggest that CSASM captures the temporal dynamics of the footprint-scale soil moisture relatively well and is thus a reliable reference for SMAP ubRMSE calculations. Therefore, spatial sampling errors are revealed to have very different impacts on efforts to estimate SMAP bias and ubRMSE metrics using CVS data.

J	Stewart, AL; Klocker, A; Menemenlis, D				Stewart, Andrew L.; Klocker, Andreas; Menemenlis, Dimitris			Acceleration and Overturning of the Antarctic Slope Current by Winds, Eddies, and Tides	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Antarctica; Continental shelf; slope; Sea ice; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Eddies; Tides	CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; ICE SHELF; TOPOGRAPHIC RECTIFICATION; TIDAL RECTIFICATION; OCEAN; EDDY; SEA; CIRCULATION; TRANSPORT	All exchanges between the open ocean and the Antarctic continental shelf must cross the Antarctic Slope Current (ASC). Previous studies indicate that these exchanges are strongly influenced by mesoscale and tidal variability, yet the mechanisms responsible for setting the ASC's transport and structure have received relatively little attention. In this study the roles of winds, eddies, and tides in accelerating the ASC are investigated using a global ocean-sea ice simulation with very high resolution (1/48 degrees grid spacing). It is found that the circulation along the continental slope is accelerated both by surface stresses, ultimately sourced from the easterly winds, and by mesoscale eddy vorticity fluxes. At the continental shelf break, the ASC exhibits a narrow (similar to 30-50 km), swift (>0.2 m s(-1)) jet, consistent with in situ observations. In this jet the surface stress is substantially reduced, and may even vanish or be directed eastward, because the ocean surface speed matches or exceeds that of the sea ice. The shelfbreak jet is shown to be accelerated by tidal momentum advection, consistent with the phenomenon of tidal rectification. Consequently, the shoreward Ekman transport vanishes and thus the mean overturning circulation that steepens the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) is primarily due to tidal acceleration. These findings imply that the circulation and mean overturning of the ASC are not only determined by near-Antarctic winds, but also depend crucially on sea ice cover, regionally-dependent mesoscale eddy activity over the continental slope, and the amplitude of tidal flows across the continental shelf break.

The variances and covariances that define distribution width may be specified or diagnosed. The correlation rho of cloud and rain mass mixing ratio/liquid water content (LWC) is a key input for accurate prediction of the accretion rate and a constant value is typically assumed. In this study, high-frequency aircraft measurements with a spatial resolution of approximate to 22 cm are used to evaluate the scaling behavior of cloud and rain LWC (q(c) and q(r), respectively) and to demonstrate how and why covariability varies with length scale l. It is shown that power spectral densities of both q(c) and q(r) exhibit scale invariance across a wide range of scales (2.04-142 m for q(c); 33-1.45 x 10(4) m for q(r)). Because the cloud-rain cospectrum is also scale invariant, rho is therefore expected to vary with l. Direct calculation of rho shows that it generally increases with l, but there is significant variability in the rho-l relationship that primarily depends on cloud drop number concentration N and cloud cellular organization, suggesting that rho may also vary with cloud regime. A parameterization of rho as a function of l and N is developed from aircraft observations and implications for diagnosis of rho from limited-area model output are also discussed.

Observable scattered light features from inclined and non-inclined planets embedded in protoplanetary discs	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						hydrodynamics; radiative transfer; planet-disc interactions; protoplanetary discs	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; T-TAURI STARS; ACCRETION DISKS; MASSIVE PLANETS; GIANT PLANET; GAP; EVOLUTION	Over the last few years instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Subaru/HiCIAO have been able to take detailed scattered light images of protoplanetary discs. Many of the features observed in these discs are generally suspected to be caused by an embedded planet, and understanding the cause of these features requires detailed theoretical models. In this work we investigate disc-planet interactions using the pluto code to run 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary discs with embedded 30 and 300M(circle plus) planets on both an inclined (i= 2.86(degrees)) and non-inclined orbit, using an alpha-viscosity of 4x10(-3). We produce synthetic scattered light images of these discs at H-band wavelengths using the radiative transfer code radmc3d. We find that while the surface density evolution in 2D and 3D simulations of inclined and non-inclined planets remain fairly similar, their observational appearance is remarkably different. Most of the features seen in the synthetic H-band images are connected to density variations of the disc at around 3.3 scale heights above and below the mid-plane, which emphasizes the need for 3D simulations. Planets on sustained orbital inclinations disrupt the disc's upper atmosphere and produce radically different observable features and intensity profiles, including shadowing effects and intensity variation of the order of 10-20times the surrounding background. The vertical optical depth to the disc mid-plane for H-band wavelengths is tau approximate to 20 in the disc gap created by the high-mass planet. We conclude that direct imaging of planets embedded in the disc remains difficult to observe, even for massive planets in the gap.

We present an extension of a forward modelling framework that uses flux ratios from quadruply imaged quasars (quads) to measure the shape and amplitude of the halo mass function, including line-of-sight (LOS) haloes and main deflector subhaloes. We apply this machinery to 50 mock lenses - roughly the number of known quads - with warm dark matter (WDM) mass functions exhibiting free-streaming cut-offs parametrized by the half-mode mass m(hm). Assuming cold dark matter (CDM), we forecast bounds on m(hm) and the corresponding thermal relic particle masses over a range of tidal destruction severity, assuming a particular WDM mass function and mass-concentration relation. With significant tidal destruction, at 2 sigma we constrain , or a 4.4 (3.1) keV thermal relic, with image flux uncertainties from measurements and lens modelling of . With less severe tidal destruction we constrain , or an 8.2 (6.2) keV thermal relic. If dark matter is warm, with (5.1keV), we would favour WDM with over CDM with relative likelihoods of 22:1 and 8:1 with flux uncertainties of and , respectively. These bounds improve over those obtained by modelling only main deflector subhaloes because LOS objects produce additional flux perturbations, especially for high-redshift systems. These results indicate that similar to 50 quads can conclusively differentiate between WDM and CDM.

They are the outcomes of thermodynamic modeling based on the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach. The accuracy of CALPHAD predictions vary widely in X-T-P space due to experimental error, model inadequacy and unequal data coverage. In response, researchers have developed frameworks to quantify the uncertainty of thermodynamic property model parameters and propagate it to phase diagram predictions. In most previous studies, uncertainty was represented as intervals on phase boundaries (with respect to composition or temperature) and was unable to represent the uncertainty in invariant reactions or in the stability of phase regions. In this work, we propose a suite of tools that leverages samples from the multivariate model parameter distribution to represent uncertainty in forms that surpass previous limitations and are well suited to materials design. These representations include the distribution of phase diagrams and their features, as well as the dependence of phase stability and the distributions of phase fraction, composition, activity and Gibbs energy on X-T-P location - irrespective of the total number of components. Most critically, the new methodology allows the material designer to interrogate a certain composition and temperature domain and get in return the probability of different phases to be stable, which can positively impact materials design.

In order to compute a gravity field model for these months, a data processing strategy was developed to retrieve the missing information, the so called Accelerometer data transplant. The ACC data transplant uses linear accelerations as measured by the GRACE-A accelerometer to generate the missing GRACE-B ACC data. A simple method of ACC data transplant was presented by Save et al. (2006), which only applies attitude and time correction due to orbit separation. In this paper we present an improved method of the ACC data transplant, which also includes thruster spike correction. The thruster spikes are residual linear accelerations occurring at each thruster firing caused by thruster imperfections and misbalance. We provide detailed description of the thruster spike model, which was derived analytically based on the ACC transfer function and 10 Hz ACC data. Using the transplanted ACC data we computed the gravity field models for the months with missing GRACE-B ACC data (November 2016 June 2017). We show that the gravity field model based on in the improved ACC data transplant has significantly reduced noise, especially for degrees beyond the first orbital resonance, when compared to the simple transplant method. The improved ACC transplant became therefore a part of the processing standards for the upcoming JPL RLO6 gravity solution. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a result, dispersal is considered a key process contributing to a species' long-term persistence. For many passive dispersers, fluid dynamics of wind and water fuel these movements and different species have developed remarkable adaptations for utilizing this energy to reach and colonize suitable habitats. The seafaring propagules (fruits and seeds) of mangroves represent an excellent example of such passive dispersal. Mangroves are halophytic woody plants that grow in the intertidal zones along tropical and subtropical shorelines and produce hydrochorous propagules with high dispersal potential. This results in exceptionally large coastal ranges across vast expanses of ocean and allows species to shift geographically and track the conditions to which they are adapted. This is particularly relevant given the challenges presented by rapid sea-level rise, higher frequency and intensity of storms, and changes in regional precipitation and temperature regimes. However, despite its importance, the underlying drivers of mangrove dispersal have typically been studied in isolation, and a conceptual synthesis of mangrove oceanic dispersal across spatial scales is lacking. Here, we review current knowledge on mangrove propagule dispersal across the various stages of the dispersal process. Using a general framework, we outline the mechanisms and ecological processes that are known to modulate the spatial patterns of mangrove dispersal. We show that important dispersal factors remain understudied and that adequate empirical data on the determinants of dispersal are missing for most mangrove species. This review particularly aims to provide a baseline for developing future research agendas and field campaigns, filling current knowledge gaps and increasing our understanding of the processes that shape global mangrove distributions.

Three new VHS-DES quasars at 6.7 < z < 6.9 and emission line properties at z > 6.5	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: formation; galaxies: high-redshift; dark ages, reionization, first stars; quasars: individual: VDES J0224-4711; quasars: individual: VDES J0244-5008; quasars: individual: VDES J0020-3653; quasars: individual: VDES J0246-5219	TO 6 QUASARS; BLACK-HOLE; REDSHIFT; VISTA; WISE; SELECTION; WINDS	We report the results from a search for z > 6.5 quasars using the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data set combined with the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and WISE All-Sky Survey. Our photometric selection method is shown to be highly efficient in identifying clean samples of high-redshift quasars, leading to spectroscopic confirmation of three new quasars -VDES J0244-5008 (z = 6,724), VDES J0020-3653 (z = 6.834), and VDES J0246-5219 (z = 6.90) - which were selected as the highest priority candidates in the survey data without any need for additional follow-up observations. We have obtained spectroscopic observations in the near-infrared for VDES J0244-5008 and VDES J0020-3653 as well as our previously identified quasar, VDES J0224-471 1 at z = 6.50 from Reed et al, We use the near-infrared spectra to derive virial black hole masses from the full width at half-maximum of the Mg II line. These black hole masses are similar or equal to 1-2 x 10(9) M-circle dot. Combined with the bolometric luminosities of these quasars of L-bot similar or equal to 1-3 x 10(47), these imply that the Eddington ratios are high, similar or equal to 0.6-1.1. We consider the C iv emission line properties of the sample and demonstrate that our highredshift quasars do not have unusual C iv line properties when compared to carefully matched low-redshift samples. Our new DES + VHS z > 6.5 quasars now add to the growing census of luminous, rapidly accreting supermassive black holes seen well into the epoch of reionization.	[Reed, S.

Using simulated data, we show that modelling a cluster halo with ellipticity in the gravitational potential can bias the inferred mass and concentration, which may bias the inferred central density when weak lensing or X-ray data are added. We also highlight the possibility for spurious constraints on the core size if the radial density profile is different from the assumed model. These systematics can be ameliorated if central images are present in the data. Applying our methodology to Abell 611 and imposing a reasonable prior on the stellar mass-to-light ratio restricts the core size to be less than about 4 kpc, with a minimum reduced chi(2) of 0.28, and with RMS error of 0.'' 12 in image positions. Such small cores imply a constraint on the dark matter self-interaction cross section of the order of 0.1 cm(2) g(-1) at relative velocities of about 1500 km s(-1). In addition, our results imply a bottom-heavy (super-Salpeter) initial mass function for the central galaxy in the Abell 611.

DES Collaboration	Superluminous supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general	LIGHT CURVES; IA SUPERNOVAE; BREAK-OUT; MASS; EVOLUTION; GALAXIES; SPECTROSCOPY; REDSHIFTS; ORIGIN; PEGASE	We present a sample of 21 hydrogen-free superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and one hydrogen-rich SLSN (SLSN-II) detected during the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES). These SNe, located in the redshift range 0.220 < z < 1.998, represent the largest homogeneously selected sample of SLSN events at high redshift. We present the observed g, r, i, z light curves for these SNe, which we interpolate using Gaussian processes. The resulting light curves are analysed to determine the luminosity function of SLSNe-I, and their evolutionary time-scales. The DES SLSN-I sample significantly broadens the distribution of SLSN-I light-curve properties when combined with existing samples from the literature. We fit a magnetar model to our SLSNe, and find that this model alone is unable to replicate the behaviour of many of the bolometric light curves. We search theDES SLSN-I light curves for the presence of initial peaks prior to the main light-curve peak. Using a shock breakout model, our Monte Carlo search finds that 3 of our 14 eventswith pre-max data display such initial peaks. However, 10 events showno evidence for such peaks, in some cases downto an absolutemagnitude of <-16, suggesting that such features are not ubiquitous to all SLSN-I events. We also identify a red pre-peak feature within the light curve of one SLSN, which is comparable to that observed within SN2018bsz.	[Angus, C.

DES Collaboration	On the relative bias of void tracers in the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; large-scale structure of Universe; cosmology: observations	CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; REDSHIFT-SPACE DISTORTIONS; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; COSMIC VOIDS; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATION; GALAXY BIAS; HALO BIAS; MASS; EVOLUTION; MATTER	Luminous tracers of large-scale structure are not entirely representative of the distribution of mass in our Universe. As they arise from the highest peaks in the matter density field, the spatial distribution of luminous objects is biased towards those peaks. On large scales, where density fluctuations are mild, this bias simply amounts to a constant offset in the clustering amplitude of the tracer, known as linear bias. In this work we focus on the relative bias between galaxies and galaxy clusters that are located inside and in the vicinity of cosmic voids, extended regions of relatively low density in the large-scale structure of the Universe. With the help of mock data we verify that the relation between galaxy and cluster overdensity around voids remains linear. Hence, the void-centric density profiles of different tracers can be linked by a single multiplicative constant. This amounts to the same value as the relative linear bias between tracers for the largest voids in the sample. For voids of small sizes, which typically arise in higher density regions, this constant has a higher value, possibly showing an environmental dependence similar to that observed for the linear bias itself. We confirm our findings by analysing data obtained during the first year of observations by the Dark Energy Survey. As a side product, we present the first catalogue of three-dimensional voids extracted from a photometric survey with a controlled photo-z uncertainty. Our results will be relevant in forthcoming analyses that attempt to use voids as cosmological probes.

Measurement of the splashback feature around SZ-selected Galaxy clusters with DES, SPT, and ACT	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; cosmology: observations	STAR-FORMATION HISTORIES; QUENCHING TIME-SCALES; ASSEMBLY BIAS; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; COSMOLOGY; ORIGIN; IMPACT; MATTER; INFALL	We present a detection of the splashback feature around galaxy clusters selected using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal. Recent measurements of the splashback feature around optically selected galaxy clusters have found that the splashback radius, rsp, is smaller than predicted by N-body simulations. Apossible explanation for this discrepancy is that rsp inferred from the observed radial distribution of galaxies is affected by selection effects related to the optical cluster-finding algorithms. We test this possibility by measuring the splashback feature in clusters selected via the SZ effect in data from the South Pole Telescope SZ survey and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter survey. The measurement is accomplished by correlating these cluster samples with galaxies detected in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data. The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is expected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to projection effects and aperture-induced biases, potentially ameliorating causes of systematic error for optically selected clusters. We find that the measured r(sp) for SZ-selected clusters is consistent with the expectations from simulations, although the small number of SZ-selected clusters makes a precise comparison difficult. In agreement with previous work, when using optically selected redMaPPer clusters with similar mass and redshift distributions, r(sp) is similar to 2 sigma smaller than in the simulations. These results motivate detailed investigations of selection biases in optically selected cluster catalogues and exploration of the splashback feature around larger samples of SZ-selected clusters. Additionally, we investigate trends in the galaxy profile and splashback feature as a function of galaxy colour, finding that blue galaxies have profiles close to a power law with no discernible splashback feature, which is consistent with them being on their first infall into the cluster.

A congestion control framework for delay- and disruption tolerant networks	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Delay and disruption tolerant networks; Interplanetary networks; Congestion control; Intermittent connectivity	REINFORCEMENT; STRATEGIES; MOBILITY	Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are networks that experience frequent and long-lived connectivity disruptions. Unlike traditional networks, such as TCP/IP Internet, DTNs are often subject to high latency caused by very long propagation delays (e.g., interplanetary communication) and/or intermittent connectivity. In DTNs there is no guarantee of end-to-end connectivity between source and destination. Such distinct features pose a number of technical challenges in designing core network functions such as routing and congestion control mechanisms. Detecting and dealing with congestion in DTNs is an important problem since congestion can significantly deteriorate DTN performance. Most existing DTN congestion control mechanisms have been designed for a specific DTN application domain and have been shown to exhibit inadequate performance when used in different DTN scenarios and conditions. In this paper, we introduce Smart-DTN-CC, a novel DTN congestion control framework that adjusts its operation automatically based on the dynamics of the underlying network and its nodes. Smart-DTN-CC is an adaptive and distributed congestion aware framework that mitigates congestion using reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique known to be well suited to problems where: (1) the environment, in this case the network, plays a crucial role; and (2) yet, no prior knowledge about the target environment can be assumed, i.e., the only way to acquire information about the environment is to interact with it through continuous online learning. Smart-DTN-CC nodes receive input from the environment (e.g., buffer occupancy, neighborhood membership, etc), and, based on that information, choose an action to take from a set of possible actions. Depending on the selected action's effectiveness in controlling congestion, a reward will be given. Smart-DTN-CC's goal is to maximize the overall reward which translates to minimizing congestion. To our knowledge, Smart-DTN-CC is the first DTN congestion control framework that has the ability to automatically and continuously adapt to the dynamics of the target environment. As demonstrated by our experimental evaluation, Smart-DTN-CC is able to consistently outperform existing DTN congestion control mechanisms under a wide range of network conditions and characteristics.

Our system avoids custom FPGA-based readouts and instead uses commercially available software radio hardware for analog to digital converter chip/digital to analog converter chip and a GPU to handle real-time signal processing. Because this system is written in common C++/CUDA, the range of different algorithms that can be quickly implemented make it suitable for the readout of many others cryogenic detectors and for the testing of different and possibly more effective data acquisition schemes.

J	Hu, RY				Hu, Renyu			Predicted diurnal variation of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water at the surface of Mars caused by mass exchange with the regolith	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Mars, atmosphere; Mars, surface; atmospheres, chemistry; atmospheres, composition; regoliths	BOUNDARY-LAYER MODEL; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; VIKING LANDER; GALE CRATER; THERMAL INERTIA; VAPOR; CYCLE; ICE; ADSORPTION; H2O	Regolith on Mars exchanges water with the atmosphere on a diurnal basis and this process causes significant variation in the abundance of water vapor at the surface. While previous studies of regolith-atmosphere exchange focus on the abundance, recent in-situ experiments and remote sensing observations measure the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water. We are therefore motivated to investigate isotopic water exchange between the atmosphere and the regolith and determine its effect on the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of the atmosphere. We model transport of water in the regolith and regolith-atmosphere exchange by solving a transport equation including regolith adsorption, condensation, and diffusion. The model calculates equilibrium fractionation between HDO and H2O in each of these processes. The fractionation in adsorption is caused by the difference in the latent heat of adsorption, and that of condensation is caused by the difference in the vapor pressure. Together with a simple, bulk-aerodynamic boundary layer model, we simulate the diurnal variation of the D/H near the planetary surface. We find that the D/H can vary by 300-1400 parts per thousand diurnally in the equatorial and mid latitude locations, and the magnitude is greater at a colder location or season. The variability is mainly driven by adsorption and desorption of regolith particles, and its diurnal trend features a drop in the early morning, a rise to the peak value during the daytime, and a second drop in the late afternoon and evening, tracing the water vapor flow into and out from the regolith. The predicted D/H variation can be tested with in-situ measurements. As such, our calculations suggest stable isotope analysis to be a powerful tool in pinpointing regolith-atmosphere exchange of water on Mars. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It divided the contributions to the Seebeck coefficient into two contributions: the effect of thermal electronic excitations due to Fermi distribution and the effect of charge carrier gradient due to thermal expansion. The procedure is illustrated within the rigid band approximation in terms of the electronic density-of-states and the quasiharmonic approximation in terms of the phonon density-of-states.

This paper studies the sensitivity of several established and experimental SM retrieval products from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission to these choices at 11 reference sites, located in 7 watersheds across the United States (US). Different RTM parameter sets cause large biases between retrievals. Whereas typical RTM parameter sets are calibrated for SM retrievals, it is shown that a parameter set carefully optimized for TB forward modeling can also be used for retrieving SM. It is also shown that the inclusion of dynamic prior SM estimates in a Bayesian retrieval scheme can strongly improve SM retrievals, regardless of the choice of RTM parameters. The second part of this paper evaluates the ensemble uncertainty metrics for SM retrievals obtained by propagating a wide range of RTM parameters through the RTM, and the relationship with time series metrics obtained by comparing SM retrievals with in situ data. As expected for bounded variables, the total spread in the ensemble SM retrievals is smallest for wet and dry SM values and highest for intermediate SM values. After removal of the strong long-term SM bias associated with the RTM parameter values for individual ensemble members, the remaining anomaly ensemble SM spread shows higher values when SM deviates further from its long-term mean SM. This reveals higher-order biases (e.g. differences in variances) in the retrieval error, which should be considered when characterizing retrieval error. The time-average anomaly ensemble SM spread of 0.037 m(3)/m(3) approximates the actual time series unbiased root-mean-square-difference of 0.042 m(3)/m(3) between ensemble mean retrievals and in situ data across the reference sites.

J	Khati, U; Lavalle, M; Singh, G				Khati, Unmesh; Lavalle, Marco; Singh, Gulab			Spaceborne tomography of multi-species Indian tropical forests	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Tomography; TanDEM-X; TerraSAR-X; Tropical; Forest; India	TANDEM-X DATA; SAR TOMOGRAPHY; TEMPORAL DECORRELATION; BIOMASS; HEIGHT; RETRIEVAL; INVERSION; MODEL	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter is the coherent combination of the scattering from multiple individual scatterers within the radar resolution cell, which results into a 2-D radar image. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) takes advantage of multiple SAR acquisitions to provide 3-D vertical structure of the imaged target. Over forests, parameters such as canopy structure, canopy density, leaf area and phenology contribute to different SAR scattering mechanisms along the vertical dimension of the trees. Tomography has been demonstrated in various earlier works for forest bio-physical parameter estimation using airborne data. In this research work, multi-polarimetric space-borne TanDEM-X tomograms are examined for the first time over a multi-species Indian tropical forest. Multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions are focused using Capon beamforming at five polarimetric channels - HH, HV, VV, HH - VV and HH + VV. Four distinct forest species compartments are selected representing different canopy structure and density. The tomograms obtained in different polarizations for these species are analyzed in detail to understand the scattering patterns across different forest species. Field surveys carried out in several forest locations provide in situ observations of forest height and vertical structure. It was observed that canopy gaps and leaf density play a crucial role for X-band SAR signal penetration through ground. For dense canopy species the backscatter contributions are spread through the canopy, while in case of sparse canopy species, the ground scattering is dominant. Vertical profiles obtained at surveyed plot locations are plotted in all polarizations, and provide a good agreement with field observations. Further, the obtained TomoSAR backscatter layers have a good correlation with field measured above-ground biomass (AGB). The AGB is modeled from TomoSAR with the HH-pol TomoSAR backscatter layer at 27 m canopy height leading to an AGB estimation with correlation r = 0.76 and RMSE of 50.4 t/ha.

The widely-used Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method is tested on a sample of around 12,600 satellite images for statistical analysis. The core of the new water classification method is the use of a water probability algorithm based on the stacking of repeat measurements, which can mitigate the effects of translational offsets of images and the classification errors caused by clouds and cloud shadows. By integrating QuickBird, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral images, the final data product provides a 2 m resolution coastline, as well as a 2 m water probability map and a repeat-count measurement map. Improvements on the existing coastline (GSHHS-the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database, 50 m-5000 m) in terms of resolution (2 m) is substantial, thanks to the combination of multiple data sources.

A rover - similar in scale to that of rover planned for NASA's Mars 2020 mission - was deployed to a scientifically relevant Mars-analogue sedimentary field site with remote mission operations conducted at the University of Western Ontario, Canada; the mission aim was to inform on best practices and optimal approaches for sample acquisition modeled on the Mars 2020 rover mission. The daily operational procedures of the CanMars Science Team were modeled on those of current missions (i.e., Mars Science Laboratory tactical operations), serving as a study of known operational workflows and as a testbed for new approaches. This paper reports on the operational results of CanMars with best-practice recommendations. CanMars was designed as a Mars 2020 mock mission and thus carried similar science objectives; these included (1) advancing the understanding of the habitability potential of a subaqueous sedimentary environment through identifying, characterizing, and caching drilled samples containing high organic carbon (as a proxy for preserved ancient biosignatures) and (2) advancing the understanding of the history of water at the site. The in situ science investigations needed to address these science objectives were guided by the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group goals. Effective and efficient Science Team operational procedures were developed - and many lessons were documented - through daily tactical planning and science investigations employed to meet the sample acquisition goals. In addition to the documentation of the CanMars operational procedures, this paper provides a brief summary of the science results from CanMars with a focus on recommendations for future analogue missions and planetary sample return flight missions, providing specific value to operational procedures for the Mars 2020 rover mission.

Due to the fixed orientation of the spacecraft spin axis and orbital plane placed along terminator, Europa is observed at approximately 90 degrees phase angle from distances > 3.35E5 km resulting in a best spatial resolution of 80 km/px. The one thousand spectra dataset returned to the ground offers a limited coverage in longitude but an almost complete excursion in latitude from poles to equator. With a 2 to 5 mu m spectral range and a sampling of about 10 nm/band, JIRAM reflectance spectra allow extraction of different spectral indicators suitable to characterize surface composition, grain size distribution and temperature: the 2 mu m water ice band center appears on average centered at 2.038 mu m as a result of the presence of both amorphous and crystalline ice phases and non-ice materials. The reflectance level on the 2.4 mu m inflection shoulder is comparable to the maximum absorption on the 2 mu m band pointing to the presence of non-ice materials, like magnesium chlorinated or hydrated magnesium salts, mixed with water ice. Assuming water ice as the principal endmember, weestimate the surface regolith grain size by comparing the 2 mu m band depth and the ratio between I/F at 3.63 and 2.27 mu m (Filacchione et al., 2012). On average, we measure values of 0.6 for the first and 0.1 for the latter: such values are compatible with grain sizes in the range of tens to hundreds of microns. Despite the low signal-to-noise beyond 2.7 mu m, due to the intrinsic low-reflectance of Europa's surface and very high phase angle values occurring during the observations, JIRAM is able to measure the wavelength of the reflectance peak around 3.6 mu m, which is a proxy of water ice temperature (Filacchione et al., 2016a). In the dataset JIRAM has obtained the peak's maximum wavelength occurs at 3.64 mu m corresponding to a maximum diurnal temperature of 132 K.

Dark halos produced by current impact cratering on Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Mars atmosphere; Mars surface; Impact processes	VENUS; FEATURES; EJECTA; MOON; ORIGIN	Hundreds of new impact craters have been observed to form on Mars since spacecraft began imaging that planet. New impact craters produced visible ejecta deposits and many of them also have visible rays, similar to lunar and mercurian craters. However, some of the new martian impact craters have a circular feature of relatively low reflectance that we call a "halo." This feature is distinct from the usual visible ejecta deposits or ray patterns. In this paper we present an observational study of this halo feature and we discuss the results of this study with respect to the nature of the halos: what they are and how they may have formed. To address these questions, we measured diameters of both halos and their central craters. We found a strong correlation between halo diameter and crater diameter, which indicates that the nature of the halos is fundamentally governed by the amount of impact energy available at their formation. Specifically, halo size is controlled by impact energy according to the non-linear relationship D-H proportional to E-2/3, where D-H is the diameter of the halo and E is the impact energy. We also found that certain factors may influence the formation of the halos: a thicker dust layer and lower elevations are both correlated with larger halos. From these correlations we conclude that the local surface characteristics as well as local atmospheric pressure influence the formation of the halos. Our description and analysis of the martian halo features provide a framework upon which specific halo formation mechanisms can be developed and tested in the future.

Update of the HITRAN collision-induced absorption section	ICARUS			English	Article							FAR-INFRARED SPECTRA; 6.4 MU-M; ATMOSPHERIC APPLICATIONS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; BAND; PAIRS; O-2; N-2; CO2; OXYGEN	Correct parameterization of the Collision-induced Absorption (CIA) phenomena is essential for accurate modeling of planetary atmospheres. The HITRAN spectroscopic database provides these parameters in a dedicated section. Here, we significantly revise and extend the HITRAN CIA data with respect to the original effort described in Richard et al. [JQSRT 113, 1276 (2012)]. The extension concerns new collisional pairs as well as wider spectral and temperature ranges for the existing pairs.

Jupiter's auroral-related stratospheric heating and chemistry III: Abundances of C2H4, CH3C2H, C4H2 and C6H6 from Voyager-IRIS and Cassini-CIRS	ICARUS			English	Article						Atmospheres, chemistry; Aurorae Infrared observations; Jupiter, atmosphere; Jupiter, magnetosphere	MERIDIONAL DISTRIBUTION; SATURNS STRATOSPHERE; CIRS/CASSINI LIMB; HAZE FORMATION; NU(7) BAND; ATMOSPHERE; ETHANE; ACETYLENE; BENZENE; TEMPERATURE	We present an analysis of Voyager-1-IRIS and Cassini-CIRS spectra of Jupiter's high latitudes acquired during the spacecrafts' respective flybys in November 1979 and January 2001. We performed a forward-model analysis in order to derive the abundances of ethylene (C2H4), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), diacetylene (C4H2) and benzene (C6H6) in Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions. We also compared these abundances to: 1) lower latitude abundances predicted by the Moses et al. (2005) 'Model A' photochemical model, henceforth 'Moses 2005A', and 2) abundances derived at non-auroral longitudes in the same latitude band. This paper serves as an extension of Sinclair et al. (2017b), where we retrieved the vertical profiles of temperature, C2H2 and C2H6 from similar datasets. We find that an enrichment of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 with respect to lower-latitude abundances is required to fit the spectra of Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions. For example, for CIRS 0.5 cm(-1) spectra of Jupiter's southern auroral region, scale factor enrichments of 6.40(-1.15)(+1.30) and 9.60(-3.67)(+3.98) are required with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profiles of C2H4 and C6H6, respectively, in order to fit the spectral emission features of these species at similar to 950 and similar to 674 cm(-1). Similarly, in order to fit the CIRS 2.5 cm(-1) spectra of Jupiter's northern auroral region, scale factor enrichments of 1.60(-0.21)(+0.37), 3.40(-1.69)(+1.89) and 15.00(-4.02)(+4.01) with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profiles of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 were required, respectively. Outside of Jupiter's auroral region in the same latitude bands, only upper-limit abundances of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 could be determined due to the limited sensitivity of the measurements, the weaker emission features combined with cooler stratospheric temperatures (and therefore decreased thermal emission) of these regions. Nevertheless, for a subset of the observations, derived abundances of C2H4 and C6H6 in Jupiter's auroral regions were higher (by 1 sigma) with respect to upper-limit abundances derived outside the auroral region in the same latitude band. This is suggestive that the influx of energetic ions and electrons from the Jovian magnetosphere and external solar-wind environment into the neutral atmosphere in Jupiter's auroral regions drives enhanced ion-related chemistry, as has also been inferred from Cassini observations of Saturn's high latitudes (Fletcher et al., 2018; Guerlet et al., 2015; Koskinen et al., 2016). We were not able to constrain the abundance of C4H2 in either Jupiter's auroral regions or non-auroral regions due to its lower (predicted) abundance and weaker emission feature. Thus, only upper-limit abundances were derived in both locations. From CIRS 2.5 cm(-1) spectra, the upper limit abundance of C4H2 corresponds to a scale factor enhancement of 45.6 and 23.8 with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profile in Jupiter's non-auroral and auroral regions.

During the traverse, the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) acquired a continuous imaging record of primary and secondary sedimentary features throughout the outcrop. The characteristics of the features (laminae, resistant features, fractures, gray clasts) and their spatial distribution provide insight into the processes that contributed to the formation of Pahrump Hills. Thin, regular laminae (mm-scale) are ubiquitous in the bedrock, implying that depositional processes at that scale did not change appreciably during deposition of the mudstone succession at Pahrump Hills. Higher bedrock slopes correlate with undulatory bedrock surfaces, bedrock with elevated Mg contents, and fractures exhibiting wide, raised edges. These collective features are consistent with increased erosional resistance caused by greater quantities of erosionally-resistant, Mg-bearing cement within the bedrock permitted by coarser grain sizes. Resistant features exhibit a range of morphologies, elevated Mg contents, and do not deflect laminae within the bedrock. Their characteristics implicate the involvement of Mg-enriched fluids in a late diagenetic overprint affecting the bedrock. The variations of fracture fill and edge morphologies and chemistries further suggest repeated fracturing and fluid interaction events within the strata exposed at Pahrump Hills. Gray clasts strongly resemble fragments eroded from sandstone horizons interspersed throughout the Pahrump Hills outcrop.

The distribution, composition, and particle properties of Mars mesospheric aerosols: An analysis of CRISM visible/near-IR limb spectra with context from near-coincident MCS and MARCI observations	ICARUS			English	Article							CO2 ICE CLOUDS; BIMODAL SIZE DISTRIBUTION; DETACHED DUST LAYERS; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; MGS TES; MU-M; SCATTERING; IRIDESCENCE; VARIABILITY	The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectral Mapper (CRISM) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) obtains pole-to-pole observations (i.e., full MRO orbits) of vertical profiles for visible/near-IR spectra (lambda = 0.4-4.0 mu m), which are ideally suited to identifying the composition and particle sizes of Mars ice and dust aerosols over 50-100 km altitudes in the Mars mesosphere. Within the coverage limitations of the CRISM limb data set, a distinct compositional dichotomy is found in Mars mesospheric ice aerosols. CO2 ice clouds appear during the aphelion period of Mars orbit (Solar Longitudes, L-s similar to 0-160 degrees) at low latitudes (similar to 20S-10N) over specific longitude regions (Meridiani, Valles Marineris) and at typical altitudes of 55-75 km. Apart from faint water ice hazes below 55 km, mesospheric H2O ice clouds are primarily restricted to the perihelion orbital range (L-s similar to 160 - 350 degrees) at northern and southern mid-to-low latitudes with less apparent longitudinal dependences. Mars mesospheric CO2 clouds are presented in CRISM spectra with a surprisingly large range of particle sizes (cross section weighted radii, R-eff = 0.3 to 2.2 mu m). The smaller particle sizes (R-eff <= 1 mu m) appear concentrated near the spatial (latitude and altitude) boundaries of their global occurrences. CRISM spectra of mesospheric CO2 clouds also show evidence of iridescence, indicating very narrow particle size distributions (effective variance, V-eff similar to 0.03) and so very abrupt CO2 cloud nucleation. Furthermore, these clouds are sometimes accompanied by altitude coincident peaks in 1.27 mu m O-2 dayglow, which indicates very dry, cold regions of formation. Mesospheric water ice clouds generally exhibit small particle sizes (R-eff = 0.1-0.3 mu m), although larger particle sizes (R-eff = 0.4-0.7 mu m) appear infrequently. On average, water ice cloud particle sizes decrease with altitude over 50-80 km in the perihelion mesosphere. Water ice mass appears similar in clouds over a large range of observed cloud particle sizes, with particle number densities increasing to similar to 10 cm(-3) for R-eff = 0.2 mu m. Near coincident Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) temperature and aerosol profile measurements for a subset of CRISM mesospheric aerosol measurements indicate near saturation (H2O and CO2) conditions for ice clouds and distinct mesospheric temperature increases associated with mesospheric dust loading. Dayside (3 pm) mesospheric CO2 clouds with larger particle sizes (R-eff >= 0.5 mu m) scatter surface infrared emission in MCS limb infrared radiances, as well as solar irradiance in the MCS solar band channel. Scattering of surface infrared emission is most strikingly presented in nighttime (3 am) MCS observations at 55-60 km altitudes, indicating extensive mesospheric nighttime CO2 clouds with considerably larger particle sizes (R-eff similar to 7 mu m). Mesospheric CO2 ice clouds present cirrus-like waveforms over extensive latitude and longitude regions (10 degrees x 10 degrees), as revealed in coincident Mars Color Imager (MARCI) nadir imaging. Solar tides, gravity waves, and the large orbital variation of the extended thermal structure of the Mars atmosphere influence all of these behaviors. Mesospheric dust aerosols appear infrequently over the non-global (planet encircling) dust storm era of the CRISM limb data set (2009-2016), and exhibit smaller particle sizes (R-eff = 0.2-0.7 mu m) relative to dust in the lower atmosphere. One isolated case of an aphelion (L-s = 96 degrees) mesospheric dust layer with large dust particle sizes (R-eff similar to 2 mu m) over Syria Planum may reflect high altitude, non-local transport of dust over elevated regions.

Composition of Amazonian volcanic materials in Tharsis and Elysium, Mars, from MRO/CRISM reflectance spectra	ICARUS			English	Article							RAY SPECTROMETER; SURFACE; DIVERSITY; CRUST; MORPHOLOGY; MINERALOGY; PYROXENES; CRATERS; OLIVINE; THEMIS	Compositions of the Amazonian-aged Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces of Mars have been largely obscured in Mars-orbital remote sensing data by windblown dust. Fresh impact craters formed within the last few years have disturbed surface dust, providing unique windows to explore these regions' relatively dust-free mineralogic compositions. Such fresh craters, plus other small exposures of less dusty materials, are resolved spatially in high-resolution targeted observations of visible/short-wave infrared spectral reflectance by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM). Analysis of CRISM observations of small, relatively dust-free locations in the Tharsis and Elysium regions shows that these provinces are dominated by high-Ca pyroxene and olivine, similar to volcanic materials of Hesperian age. Thus, the mafic mineral compositions of Hesperian and Amazonian volcanic materials appear similar to each other, but distinct from the olivine- and low-Ca pyroxene-rich compositions that dominate Noachian rocks. In the core regions of both provinces, where thermal infrared data indicate the thickest dust cover, the dust is sufficiently thick that few fresh craters penetrate to expose the underlying volcanics. These results may be consistent with low Si contents of surface materials in Elysium and western Tharsis measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy resulting from a thick cover of dust depleted in Si-rich phases, possibly due to eolian sorting.

Tuning Y-Ba-Cu-O Focused Helium Ion Beam Josephson Junctions for Use as THz Mixers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY			English	Article						Heterodyne detector; Josephson junction; mixer; THz; YBCO	LOW-NOISE	We present Josephson junctions fabricated from high transition temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 coupled to spiral THz antennas. The fabrication process involves creating a Josephson junction at the center of a superconducting bridge embedded into a THz spiral antenna using irradiation from a focused helium ion beam. For low doses of helium irradiation, the junctions have metallic barriers and operate at temperatures as high as 67 K. For higher doses of irradiation, insulator barriers are created. These devices have higher resistance but require cooling to lower temperatures (similar to 10 K) due to smaller critical currents. Through optimization of the dose and by trimming the width of the junctions, we have created high resistance devices to improve the impedance match to a spiral antenna. Under 90-GHz radiation, we observe up to 17 Shapiro steps in the I-V curve out to approximately 3 mV at a temperature of 10 K.

Search for water outgassing of (1) Ceres near perihelion	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: (1) Ceres	CONSTRAINTS; ICE; VAPOR; TELESCOPE; EXOSPHERE; SURFACES	Context. (1) Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt and one of the most intriguing objects in the solar system, in part because of the discovery of water outgassing by the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) and its still-debated origin. Ceres was the target of NASA's Dawn spacecraft for 3.5 yr, which achieved a detailed characterization of the dwarf planet. The possible influence of the local flux of solar energetic particles (SEP) on the production of a Cerean exosphere and water vapor has been suggested, in addition to the sublimation of water ice that depends on the temperature, meaning the heliocentric distance. Aims. We used the opportunity of both the perihelion passage of (1) Ceres in April 2018, and the presence of Dawn in its vicinity (for measuring the SEP flux in real time) to check the influence of heliocentric distance and SEP flux on water outgassing. Methods. We searched for OH emission lines near the limb of Ceres in the near-UV with the UVES spectrograph mounted on the 8-m ESO Very Large Telescope. Two spectra were recorded when Ceres was close to its perihelion, in February 2018, and with Dawn spacecraft orbiting Ceres. It was possible to simultaneously measure energetic particles around Ceres at the time of our observations. Results. Our observations did not permit detection of OH emission lines to a very high sensitivity level. This level is estimated to correspond to a global water production rate of Q(H2O) similar to 2 x 10(26) molecules s(-1), similar to the water production rate derived from HSO observations. The solar energetic particles flux measured around Ceres was negligible at the time of these observations. Conclusions. Our observations support the idea that heliocentric distance (i.e., the sublimation of water ice) does not play a major role in the water emission from Ceres. This production rate could be either related to SEP events or to other mechanisms, possibly of endogenic origin.

The resulting clusters reveal patterns of temperature variability, referred to as temperature variability states. Analysis is performed over summer and winter months separately using data covering the period 1980-2015. Results for both seasons show four primary temperature variability states. In both seasons, one state is primarily characterized by warm temperature anomalies across the domain while another is characterized by cold anomalies. The other two patterns tend to be characterized by a warm north-cold south and cold north-warm south feature. This suggests two primary modes of temperature variability over the region. Composites of synoptic-scale meteorological patterns (wind, geopotential height, and moisture fields) are computed for months assigned to each cluster to diagnose the driving meteorology associated with these variability states. Results suggest that low-level temperature advection promoted by anomalies in atmospheric circulation patterns is a key process for driving these variability states. Moisture-related processes also are shown to play a role, especially in summer. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode exhibit some relationship with temperature variability state frequency, with some states more common during amplified phases of these two modes than others. However, the climate modes are not a primary driver of the temperature variability states.

Keck/LRIS spectroscopic confirmation of GRAL 113100-441959 and model prediction of time delays	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; quasars: general; astrometry	DARK-MATTER; GALAXY; SUBSTRUCTURE; I.	We report the spectroscopic confirmation and modeling of the quadruply imaged quasar GRAL 113100-441959, the first gravitational lens (GL) to be discovered from a machine learning technique that only relies on the relative positions and fluxes of the observed images without considering colour informations. Follow-up spectra obtained with Keck/LRIS reveal the lensing nature of this quadruply imaged quasar with redshift z(s) = 1.090 +/- 0.002, but show no evidence of the central lens galaxy. Using the image positions and G-band flux ratios provided by Gaia Data Release 2 as constraints, we modeled the system with a singular power-law elliptical mass distribution (SPEMD) plus external shear, to different levels of complexity. We show that relaxing the isothermal constraint of the SPEMD does not lead to statistically significant different results in terms of fitting the lensing data. We thus simplified the SPEMD to a singular isothermal ellipsoid to estimate the Einstein radius of the main lens galaxy theta(E) = 0 ''.851, the intensity and position angle of the external shear (gamma, theta(gamma)) = (0.044, 11 degrees.5), and we predict the lensing galaxy position to be (theta(gal,1), theta(gal,2)) = (-0 ''.424, -0 ''.744) with respect to image A. We provide time delay predictions for pairs of images, assuming a plausible range of lens redshift values z(l) between 0.5 and 0.9. Finally, we examine the impact on time delays of the so-called source position transformation, a family of degeneracies existing between different mass density profiles that reproduce most of the lensing observables equally well. We show that this effect contributes significantly to the time delay error budget and cannot be ignored during the modeling. This has implications for robust cosmography applications of lensed systems. GRAL 113100-441959 is the first in a series of seven new spectroscopically confirmed GLs discovered from Gaia Data Release 2.

Analytical Propagation of Runoff Uncertainty Into Discharge Uncertainty Through a Large River Network	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						land; runoff; river; discharge; uncertainty; propagation	WATER-BALANCE MODEL; LAND-SURFACE; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; STREAMFLOW SIMULATION; MUSKINGUM METHOD; ETA-MODEL; RAINFALL; PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION; OPTIMIZATION	The transport of freshwater from continents to oceans through rivers has traditionally been estimated by routing runoff from land surface models within river models to obtain discharge. This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						SWOT; temporal sampling; river discharge; Mississippi River Basin; remote sensing	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; WATER-RESOURCES; SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; INFERENCE; MODIS	The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will, for the first time, provide simultaneous, high-resolution measurements of water surface elevation and extent. Here we explore the applicability of SWOT's unique sampling to capture discharge frequency behavior throughout the Mississippi River Basin. Our findings suggest the mission may capture key variability in river discharge series. SWOT orbit specifications, US Geological Survey (USGS) discharge measurements, and potential uncertainty estimates are used to generate SWOT-like river discharges. Frequency distributions and specific quantiles derived from synthetic SWOT discharge series are compared to those derived from daily USGS discharge series. Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, SWOT temporal sampling has essentially no impact on derived frequency distributions. When including potential uncertainty, 78% of derived distributions are statistically identical. The combined effects of temporal sampling and discharge uncertainty mitigates the negative bias used for SWOT discharge uncertainty at larger discharge quantiles (i.e., >= 75% quantiles).

A Large Source of Atomic Chlorine From ClNO2 Photolysis at a UK Landfill Site	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						ClNO2; CIMS; landfill	IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETER; NITRYL CHLORIDE; BOUNDARY-LAYER; N2O5; GAS; CHEMISTRY; ENVIRONMENT; EMISSIONS; SUMMER; LONDON	Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) acts as a source of highly reactive chlorine atoms as well as an important NOx reservoir. Measurements of ClNO2 at an operational U.K. landfill site are reported here for the first time. A peak concentration of 4 ppb of ClNO2 was found with a peak mean nighttime maximum of 0.9 ppb. Using models based upon the photolysis of observed ClNO2 and atmospheric chlorine chemistry, chlorine atom concentrations reaching in excess of 1.20 x 10(5) molecules/cm(3) in the early morning following sunrise are calculated. These concentrations are approximately 10 times higher than previously reported in the United Kingdom, suggesting a significant impact on the oxidizing capacity around such sites. Given the ubiquity of landfill sites regionally and globally, and the large abundances of Cl atoms from the photolysis of ClNO2, chlorine chemistry has a significant impact on ozone formation and volatile organic compounds oxidation as shown by WRF-Chem modeling. Plain Language Summary Landfill sites are a known source of traces gases into the atmosphere, but measurements often focus predominately on methane and carbon dioxide. A small subsection of trace gas measurements at landfill sites have shown, however, that these sites may be important halogen sources that could have subsequent impacts on air quality and climate. Spatially limited field measurements have previously been reported of a halogen species, ClNO2, showing that this species is consistently formed during nighttime hours, but no such measurements before now have been made at any landfill site. ClNO2 undergoes photolysis upon sunrise, releasing the extremely reactive Cl as well as NO2 into the atmosphere and therefore plays an important part in the total budget and distribution of tropospheric oxidants, halogens, and reactive nitrogen species, all of which are important to air quality. Here we present mass spectrometry measurements of ClNO2 taken at an undisclosed landfill, which show high concentrations in comparison to any other global study of this type. We use predictive modeling techniques to show the importance of this halogen species to air quality, using indicators such as ozone formation.

Atmospheric Methane Emissions Correlate With Natural Gas Consumption From Residential and Commercial Sectors in Los Angeles	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						methane emissions; greenhouse gas; urban pollution; natural gas leakage	CLARS-FTS; CO2; CH4; BASIN	Legislation in the State of California mandates reductions in emissions of short-lived climate pollutants of 40% from 2013 levels by 2030 for CH4. Identification of the sector(s) responsible for these emissions and their temporal and spatial variability is a key step in achieving these goals. Here, we determine the emissions of CH4 in Los Angeles from 2011-2017 using a mountaintop remote sensing mapping spectrometer. We show that the pattern of CH4 emissions contains both seasonal and nonseasonal contributions. We find that the seasonal component peaks in the winter and is correlated (R-2 = 0.58) with utility natural gas consumption from the residential and commercial sectors and not from the industrial and gas-fired power plant sectors. The nonseasonal component is (22.9 +/- 1.4) Gg CH4/month. If the seasonal correlation is causal, about (1.4 +/- 0.1)% of the commercial and residential natural gas consumption in Los Angeles is released into the atmosphere.

In situ observations of dust deposition are scarce, and model simulations depend on the highly parameterized representations of dust processes with few constraints. By taking advantage of satellites' routine sampling on global and decadal scales, we estimate African dust deposition flux and loss frequency (a ratio of deposition flux to mass loading) along the trans-Atlantic transit using the three-dimensional distributions of aerosol retrieved by spaceborne lidar (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization [CALIOP]) and radiometers (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS], Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer [MISR], and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer [IASI]). On the basis of a 10-year (2007-2016) and basin-scale average, the amount of dust deposition into the tropical Atlantic Ocean is estimated at 136-222 Tg/year. The 65-83% of satellite-based estimates agree with the in situ climatology within a factor of 2. The magnitudes of dust deposition are highest in boreal summer and lowest in fall, whereas the interannual variability as measured by the normalized standard deviation with mean is largest in spring (28-41%) and smallest (7-15%) in summer. The dust deposition displays high spatial heterogeneity, revealing that the meridional shifts of major dust deposition belts are modulated by the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone. On the basis of the annual and basin mean, the dust loss frequency derived from the satellite observations ranges from 0.078 to 0.100 day(-1), which is lower than model simulations by up to factors of 2 to 5. The most efficient loss of dust occurs in winter, consistent with the higher possibility of low-altitude transported dust in southern trajectories being intercepted by rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone. The satellite-based estimates of dust deposition can be used to fill the geographical gaps and extend time span of in situ measurements, study the dust-ocean interactions, and evaluate model simulations of dust processes.

Analysis of Water Vapor Absorption in the Far-Infrared and Submillimeter Regions Using Surface Radiometric Measurements From Extremely Dry Locations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						water vapor continuum; far-infrared; submillimeter; radiative fluxes; heating rates; spectroscopy	EMITTED RADIANCE INTERFEROMETER; MEASUREMENT ARM PROGRAM; FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTROMETERS; ATMOSPHERIC RADIATION; SPECTRAL RADIANCE; CLOSURE EXPERIMENT; HALF-WIDTHS; CONTINUUM; MODEL; INSTRUMENT	The second Radiative Heating in Underexplored Bands Campaign (RHUBC-II) was conducted in 2009 by the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program to improve water vapor spectroscopy in the far-infrared spectral region. RHUBC-II was located in an extremely dry region of Chile to ensure very low opacities in this spectral region. Spectrally resolved measurements by a far-infrared spectrometer and a submillimeter interferometer from RHUBC-II are compared with line-by-line radiative transfer model calculations. Water vapor amounts and temperatures used in the calculations come from collocated radiosondes, with extensive adjustments to correct for issues due to the campaign's dry conditions and mountainous terrain. A reanalysis is also performed of far-infrared measurements taken at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement North Slope of Alaska site before and during the first RHUBC campaign. These analyses determine that differences between the measurements and model calculations using existing spectroscopic parameters are significant in the far-infrared and submillimeter regions, leading to the derivation of improved water vapor continuum absorption coefficients and air-broadened widths of 74 water vapor lines. The foreign continuum is increased by more than 50% in part of the far-infrared and the widths of more than 20 lines are changed by more than 10%. The uncertainty in the foreign continuum coefficients is estimated as greater than 20% in some spectral regions, primarily a consequence of the uncertainty in the specification of water vapor. The improved far-infrared spectroscopic parameters have a notable impact on calculated spectral radiances and a modest impact on broadband radiative fluxes and heating rates.	[Mlawer, E.

Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry: Applications for the In Situ Measurement of Nonvolatile Organics at Ocean Worlds	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Amino acids; Fatty acids; Chemical ionization; Mass spectrometry; Life detection; Ocean worlds	CASSINI ION; E-RING; PLUME; ENCELADUS; WATER; INSTRUMENT; ATMOSPHERE; ANALYZER; HYDROGEN; MISSION	A new technique that has applications for the detection of nonvolatile organics on Ocean Worlds has been developed. Here, liquid mixtures of fatty acids (FAs) and/or amino acids (AAs) are introduced directly into a miniature quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QITMS) developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and analyzed. Two ionization methods, electron impact and chemical ionization (EI and CI, respectively), are compared and contrasted. Further, multiple CI reagents are tested to explore their potential to "soften" ionization of FAs and AAs. Both EI and CI yield mass spectra that bear signatures of FAs or AAs; however, soft CI yields significantly cleaner mass spectra that are easier to interpret. The combination of soft CI with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has also been demonstrated for AAs, generating "fingerprint" mass spectra of fragments from protonated parent ions. To mimic potential Ocean World conditions, water is used as the primary collision gas in MS/MS experiments. This technique has the potential for the in situ analysis of molecules in the cryogenic plumes of Ocean Worlds (e.g., Enceladus) and comets with the ultimate goal of detecting potential biosignatures.

These instruments, especially when used in synergy, have great potential for improving estimates of water reflectance in the post Earth Observing System (EOS) era. Extending the topof- atmosphere (TOA) observations to the UV, where aerosol absorption is effective, adding spectral bands in the SWIR, where even the most turbid waters are black and sensitivity to the aerosol coarse mode is higher than at shorter wavelengths, and measuring in the oxygen A-band to estimate aerosol altitude will enable greater accuracy in atmospheric correction for ocean color science. The multi-angular and polarized measurements, sensitive to aerosol properties (e. g., size distribution, index of refraction), can further help to identify or constrain the aerosol model, or to retrieve directly water reflectance. Algorithms that exploit the new capabilities are presented, and their ability to improve accuracy is discussed. They embrace a modern, adapted heritage two-step algorithm and alternative schemes (deterministic, statistical) that aim at inverting the TOA signal in a single step. These schemes, by the nature of their construction, their robustness, their generalization properties, and their ability to associate uncertainties, are expected to become the new standard in the future. A strategy for atmospheric correction is presented that ensures continuity and consistency with past and present ocean-color missions while enabling full exploitation of the new dimensions and possibilities. Despite the major improvements anticipated with the PACE instruments, gaps/issues remain to be filled/tackled. They include dealing properly with whitecaps, taking into account Earth-curvature effects, correcting for adjacency effects, accounting for the coupling between scattering and absorption, modeling accurately water reflectance, and acquiring a sufficiently representative dataset of water reflectance in the UV to SWIR. Dedicated efforts, experimental and theoretical, are in order to gather the necessary information and rectify inadequacies. Ideas and solutions are put forward to address the unresolved issues. Thanks to its design and characteristics, the PACE mission will mark the beginning of a new era of unprecedented accuracy in ocean-color radiometry from space.

DES Collaboration; SPT Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: Joint analysis of galaxy clustering, galaxy lensing, and CMB lensing two-point functions	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; DES; CONSTRAINTS; EFFICIENT	We perform a joint analysis of the auto and cross-correlations between three cosmic fields: the galaxy density field, the galaxy weak lensing shear field, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) weak lensing convergence field. These three fields are measured using roughly 1300 sq. deg. of overlapping optical imaging data from first year observations of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and millimeter-wave observations of the CMB from both the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey and Planck. We present cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of the two-point correlation functions between galaxy density and galaxy shear with CMB lensing. We test for consistency between these measurements and the DES-only two-point function measurements, finding no evidence for inconsistency in the context of flat Lambda CDM cosmological models. Performing a joint analysis of five of the possible correlation functions between these fields (excluding only the CMB lensing autospectrum) yields S-8 sigma(8) root Omega(m)/0.3 = 0.782(-0.025)(+0.019) and Omega(m) = 0.260(-0.019)(+0.029). We test for consistency between these five correlation function measurements and the Planck-only measurement of the CMB lensing autospectrum, again finding no evidence for inconsistency in the context of flat Lambda CDM models. Combining constraints from all six two-point functions yields S-8 = 0.776(-0.021)(+0.014) and Omega(m) = 0.271(-0.016)(+0.022). These results provide a powerful test and confirmation of the results from the first year DES joint-probes analysis.	[Abbott, T. M. C.; Walker, A.

We describe a novel method to detect cosmic rays in deep-ultraviolet Raman hyperspectral data sets adapted from existing cosmic ray removal methods applied to astronomical images. This method identifies cosmic rays as outliers in the distribution of intensity values in each wavelength channel. In some cases, this algorithm fails to identify cosmic rays in data sets with high inter-spectral variance, uncorrected baseline drift, or few spectra. However, this method effectively identifies cosmic rays in spatially uncorrelated hyperspectral data sets more effectively than other cosmic ray rejection methods and can potentially be employed in commercial and robotic Raman systems to identify cosmic rays semi-autonomously.

Converging filaments in the high-mass cluster forming region Sgr B2(N)	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: formation; stars: massive; techniques: high angular resolution; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; ISM: individual objects: SgrB2(N); radio lines: ISM	STAR; W33A	Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. Aims. We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. Methods. We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0 : 00 4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. Results. A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OH and H2CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M-circle dot, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s(-1) pc(-1), which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales (similar to 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are (sic)0.05 M-circle dot yr(-1), which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M-circle dot yr(-1). Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a "damp" merger. Conclusions. The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster.

Beyond subhalos: Probing the collective effect of the Universe's small-scale structure with gravitational lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DARK-MATTER SUBSTRUCTURE; EDGE-ON DISC; MASS FUNCTION; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; FLUX RATIOS; GALAXY; PHYSICS; LENSES; SIGHT; CONSTRAINTS	Gravitational lensing has emerged as a powerful probe of the matter distribution on subgalactic scales, which itself may contain important clues about the fundamental origins and properties of dark matter. Broadly speaking, two different approaches have been taken in the literature to map the small-scale structure of the Universe using strong lensing, with one focused on measuring the position and mass of a small number of discrete massive subhalos appearing close in projection to lensed images, and the other focused on detecting the collective effect of all the small-scale structures between the lensed source and the observer. In this paper, we follow the latter approach and perform a detailed study of the sensitivity of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses to the ensemble properties of small-scale structure. As in some previous studies, we adopt the language of the substructure power spectrum to characterize the statistical properties of the small-scale density field. We present a comprehensive theory that treats lenses with extended sources as well as those with time-dependent compact sources (such as quasars) in a unified framework for the first time. Our approach uses mode functions to provide both computational advantages and insights about couplings between the lens and source. The goal of this paper is to develop the theory and gain the intuition necessary to understand how the sensitivity to the substructure power spectrum depends on the source and lens properties, with the eventual aim of identifying the most promising targets for such studies.

In this work, UTLS water vapour profiles derived from Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) satellite measurements are assessed with coincident ground-based measurements taken at a high Arctic observatory at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. Additional comparisons to satellite measurements taken by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartography (SCIA-MACHY), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) are included to put the ACE Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and ACE Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (ACE-MAESTRO) results in context. Measurements of water vapour profiles at Eureka are made using a Bruker 125HR solar absorption Fourier transform infrared spectrometer at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) and radiosondes launched from the Eureka Weather Station. Radiosonde measurements used in this study were processed with software developed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) to account for known biases and calculate uncertainties in a well-documented and consistent manner. ACE-FTS measurements were within 11 ppmv (parts per million by volume; 13 %) of 125HR measurements between 6 and 14 km. Between 8 and 14 km ACE-FTS profiles showed a small wet bias of approximately 8% relative to the 125HR. ACE-FTS water vapour profiles had mean differences of 13 ppmv (32 %) or better when compared to coincident radiosonde profiles at altitudes between 6 and 14 km; mean differences were within 6 ppmv (12 %) between 7 and 11 km. ACE-MAESTRO profiles showed a small dry bias relative to the 125HR of approximately 7% between 6 and 9 km and 10% between 10 and 14 km. ACE-MAESTRO profiles agreed within 30 ppmv (36 %) of the radiosondes between 7 and 14 km. ACE-FTS and ACE-MAESTRO comparison results show closer agreement with the radiosondes and PEARL 125HR overall than other satellite datasets - except for AIRS. Close agreement was observed between AIRS and the 125HR and radiosonde measurements, with mean differences within 5% and correlation coefficients above 0.83 in the troposphere between 1 and 7 km. Comparisons to MLS at altitudes around 10 km showed a dry bias, e.g. mean differences between MLS and radiosondes were -25.6 %. SCIAMACHY comparisons were very limited due to minimal overlap between the vertical extent of the measurements. TES had no temporal overlap with the radiosonde dataset used in this study. Comparisons between TES and the 125HR showed a wet bias of approximately 25% in the UTLS and mean differences within 14% below 5 km.

Marine ice sheet instability amplifies and skews uncertainty in projections of future sea-level rise	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						ice sheet; climate variability; sea level; uncertainty	THWAITES GLACIER; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; TRANSIENT-RESPONSE; SHELF; OCEAN; FLOW; ANTARCTICA; DYNAMICS; RETREAT; MODEL	Sea-level rise may accelerate significantly if marine ice sheets become unstable. If such instability occurs, there would be considerable uncertainty in future sea-level rise projections due to imperfectly modeled ice sheet processes and unpredictable climate variability. In this study, we use mathematical and computational approaches to identify the ice sheet processes that drive uncertainty in sea-level projections. Using stochastic perturbation theory from statistical physics as a tool, we show mathematically that the marine ice sheet instability greatly amplifies and skews uncertainty in sea-level projections with worst-case scenarios of rapid sea-level rise being more likely than best-case scenarios of slower sea-level rise. We also perform large ensemble simulations with a state-of-the-art ice sheet model of Thwaites Glacier, a marine-terminating glacier in West Antarctica that is thought to be unstable. These ensemble simulations indicate that the uncertainty solely related to internal climate variability can be a large fraction of the total ice loss expected from Thwaites Glacier. We conclude that internal climate variability alone can be responsible for significant uncertainty in projections of sea-level rise and that large ensembles are a necessary tool for quantifying the upper bounds of this uncertainty.

Until recently, quantum limited amplifiers have been incompatible with these detectors due to the dynamic range, power, and bandwidth constraints. However, we show that a kinetic inductance based traveling-wave parametric amplifier can be used for this application and reaches the quantum limit. The total system noise for this readout scheme was equal to similar to 2.1 in units of quanta. For incident photons in the 800-1300nm range, the amplifier increased the average resolving power of the detector from similar to 6.7 to 9.3 at which point the resolution becomes limited by noise on the pulse height of the signal. Noise measurements suggest that a resolving power of up to 25 is possible if the redesigned detectors can remove this additional noise source.

J	MacDonald, M; Hutchins, N; Lohse, D; Chung, D				MacDonald, Michael; Hutchins, Nicholas; Lohse, Detlef; Chung, Daniel			Heat transfer in rough-wall turbulent thermal convection in the ultimate regime	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article							DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; RAYLEIGH-BENARD CONVECTION; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; PRANDTL NUMBER; CHANNEL FLOW; REYNOLDS; TRANSPORT; TEMPERATURE; PROFILES; PLATES	Heat and momentum transfer in wall-bounded turbulent flow, coupled with the effects of wall roughness, is one of the outstanding questions in turbulence research. In the standard Rayleigh-Benard problem for natural thermal convection, it is notoriously difficult to reach the so-called ultimate regime in which the near-wall boundary layers are turbulent. Following the analyses proposed by Kraichnan [Phys. Fluids 5, 1374 (1962)] and Grossmann and Lohse [Phys. Fluids 23, 045108 (2011)], we instead utilize recent direct numerical simulations of forced convection over a rough wall in a minimal channel [MacDonald et al., J. Fluid Mech. 861, 138 (2019)] to directly study these turbulent boundary layers. We focus on the heat transport (in dimensionless form, the Nusselt number Nu) or equivalently the heat transfer coefficient (the Stanton number C-h). Extending the analyses of Kraichnan and Grossmann and Lohse, we assume logarithmic temperature profiles with a roughness-induced shift to predict an effective scaling of Nu similar to Ra-0(.)42, where Ra , is the dimensionless temperature difference, corresponding to C-h similar to Re-0.16 where Re is the centerline Reynolds number. This is pronouncedly different from the skin-friction coefficient C-f, which in the fully rough turbulent regime is independent of Re, due to the dominant pressure drag. In rough-wall turbulence, the absence of the analog to pressure drag in the temperature advection equation is the origin for the very different scaling properties of the heat transfer as compared to the momentum transfer. This analysis suggests that, unlike momentum transfer, the asymptotic ultimate regime, where Nu similar to Ra-1/2, will never be reached for heat transfer at finite Rayleigh number.

Similar studies on individual smaller, temperate planets are rare owing to the inherent difficulty of the observations and also to the average faintness of their host stars. To investigate their ensemble atmospheric properties, we construct a sample of 28 similar planets, all of which possess equilibrium temperature within 300-500 K, have similar size (1-3 R-circle plus), and orbit early M dwarfs and late K dwarfs with effective temperatures within a few hundred kelvin of one another. In addition, NASA's Kepler/K2 and Spitzer missions gathered transit observations of each planet, producing a uniform transit data set in both wavelength and coarse planetary type. With the transits measured in Kepler's broad optical bandpass and Spitzer's 4.5 mu m wavelength bandpass, we measure the transmission spectral slope, Delta z/H, for the entire sample. While this measurement is too uncertain in nearly all cases to infer the properties of any individual planet, the distribution of Delta z/H among several dozen similar planets encodes a key trend. We find that the distribution of Delta z/H is not well described by a single Gaussian distribution. Rather, a ratio of the Bayesian evidences between the likeliest one-component and two-component Gaussian models favors the latter by a ratio of 100:3. In the best-fit two-component Gaussian model, one Gaussian is centered around an average Delta z/H = -0.1 with a standard deviation of 8.2, while a smaller but significant second population (20% +/- 10% of all) is located at significantly higher Delta z/H center values with higher uncertainty. Although the exact shape and locations of the Gaussian models are sensitive to our assumptions in mean molecular weight, we can conclude that (1) there exist two populations of small and temperate planets regarding their effective radius variations between the Kepler bandpass and Spitzer bandpass and (2) atmospheres of this kind of planets are far from uniformly flat, and a fraction of them may be particularly favorable for follow-up observations from space-based platforms like the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.

GHz toward 10 galaxy clusters with Bolocam and AzTEC/ASTE. We also used Planck data to constrain the signal at large angular scales, Herschel-SPIRE images to subtract the brightest galaxies that comprise the cosmic infrared background (CIB), Chandra imaging to map the electron temperature T-e of the intra-cluster medium, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging to derive models of each galaxy cluster's mass density. The galaxy clusters gravitationally lens the background CIB, which produced an on-average reduction in brightness toward the galaxy clusters' centers after the brightest galaxies were subtracted. We corrected for this deficit, which was between 5% and 25% of the 270. GHz SZ effect signal within R-2500. Using the SZ effect measurements, along with the X-ray constraint on T-e, we measured each galaxy cluster's average line of sight (LOS) velocity v(z) within R-2500, with a median per-cluster uncertainty of +/- 700 km s(-1). We found an ensemble-mean < v(z)> of 430. +/-. 210 m s(-1), and an intrinsic cluster-to-cluster scatter sigma(int) of 470. +/-. 340 km s(-1). We also obtained maps of vz over each galaxy cluster's face with an angular resolution of 70 ''. All four galaxy clusters previously identified as having a merger oriented along the LOS showed an excess variance in these maps at a significance of similar or equal to 2-4 sigma, indicating an internal v(z) rms of greater than or similar to 1000 km s(-1). None of the six galaxy clusters previously identified as relaxed or plane-of-sky mergers showed any such excess variance.

SPEX airborne spectropolarimeter calibration and performance	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							AEROSOL PROPERTIES; RETRIEVAL; POLARIZATION; POLARIMETER; MISSION; MULTIANGLE; SCATTERING; INTENSITY; PARASOL; OCEAN	To improve our understanding of the complex role of aerosols in the climate system and on air quality, measurements are needed of optical and microphysical aerosol. From many studies, it has become evident that a satellite-based multiangle, multiwavelength polarimeter will be essential to provide such measurements. Here, high accuracy (similar to 0.003) on the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) measurements is important to retrieve aerosol properties with an accuracy needed to advance our understanding of the aerosol effect on climate. SPEX airborne, a multiangle hyperspectral polarimeter, has been developed for observing and characterizing aerosols from NASA's high-altitude research aircraft ER-2. It delivers measurements of radiance and DoLP at visual wavelengths with a spectral resolution of 3 and 7-30 nm, respectively, for radiance and polarization, at nine fixed equidistant viewing angles from -56 degrees to +56 degrees oriented along the ground track, and a swath of 7 degrees oriented across-track. SPEX airborne uses spectral polarization modulation to determine the state of linear polarization of scattered sunlight. This technique has been developed in the Netherlands and has been demonstrated with ground-based instruments. SPEX airborne serves as a demonstrator for a family of space-based SPEX instruments that have the ability to measure and characterize atmospheric aerosol by multiangle hyperspectral polarimetric imaging remotely from a satellite platform. SPEX airborne was calibrated radiometrically and polarimetrically using Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) facilities including the Polarization Stage Generator-2 (PSG-2), which is designed for polarimetric calibration and validation of the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI). Using the PSG-2, the accuracy of the SPEX airborne DoLP measurements in the laboratory setup is found to be 0.0020.004. Radiometric calibration is realized with an estimated accuracy of 4%. In 2017, SPEX airborne took part in the "Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeters and Lida:" campaign on the ER-2 that included four polarimeters and two lidars. Polarization measurements of SPEX airborne and the coflying Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP), recorded during the campaign, were compared and display root-mean-square (RMS) differences ranging from 0.004 (at 555 nm) up to 0.02 (at 410 nm). For radiance measurements, excellent agreement between SPEX airborne and RSP is obtained with an RMS difference of similar to 4%. The lab- and flight-performance values for polarization are similar to those recently published for AirMSPI, where also an intercomparison with RSP was made using data from field campaigns in 2013. The intercomparison of radiometric and polarimetric data both display negligible bias. The in-flight comparison results provide verification of SPEX airborne's capability to deliver high-quality data. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America	[Smit, J. Martijn; Rietjens, Jeroen H.

For viscous flow problems, however, they do not track the boundary layers that form around embedded obstacles and therefore do not maintain them resolved. Hence, an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) framework for EBMs is proposed in this paper. It is based on computing the distance froman edge of the embedding computational fluid dynamics mesh to the nearest embedded discrete surface and on satisfying the y+ requirements. It is also equipped with a Hessian-based criterion for resolving flow features such as shocks, vortices, and wakes and with load balancing for achieving parallel efficiency. It performs mesh refinement using a parallel version of the newest vertex bisectionmethod to maintain mesh conformity. Hence, while it is sufficiently comprehensive to support many discretizationmethods, it is particularly attractive for vertex-centered finite volume schemeswhere dual cells tend to complicate the mesh adaptation process. Using the EBM known as FIVER, this AMRframework is verified for several academic FSI problems. Its potential for realistic FSI applications is also demonstrated with the simulation of a challenging supersonic parachute inflation dynamics problem.

J	Bock, C; Galey, C				Bock, Conrad; Galey, Charles			Integrating four-dimensional ontology and systems requirements modelling	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN			English	Article						Ontologies; systems engineering; four-dimensional; requirements	DESIGN; UML; INTEROPERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; EXTENSION; LANGUAGE	Ontology has many applications to engineering but is not easily taken up by engineers. For example, specifying products in space and time together (four dimensions) enables more reliable modelling and analysis, but this work is primarily ontological and not accessible to most engineers. This paper summarises an existing method for integrating ontology and engineering, then applies it to four-dimensional requirements modelling, extending prior results. Requirements in this paper are treated as desired effects of a system on its operating environment. These effects are often respecified in multiple designs and tools, leading to redundancy and potential inconsistency. This can be addressed with centralised models of operating environment developed in systems engineering languages. These languages can specify the structure of operating environments formally enough to specify desired effects (except for spatial aspects), but cannot do the same for desired behaviour of those environments, because behaviours typically specify actions taken by a system to achieve those effects. This paper proposes new engineering-accessible extensions to logical system modelling for specifying intended environmental effects, including spatial relationships, without committing to the actions taken to achieve them. The proposed model supports centralised specifications of required system effects on their operating environments, enabling efficient integration with design.

Autonomous controls that lock the laser frequency to a cavity reference and establish the 5 degrees of freedom two-way laser link between remote spacecraft succeeded on the first attempt. Active beam pointing based on differential wave front sensing compensates spacecraft attitude fluctuations. The LRI has operated continuously without breaks in phase tracking for more than 50 days, and has shown biased range measurements similar to the primary ranging instrument based on microwaves, but with much less noise at a level of 1 nm/root Hz at Fourier frequencies above 100 mHz.

It is a pleasure to acknowledge the spacecraft provider, Airbus Defence and Space, for their excellence in integrating the LRI instrument to precise requirements without which the LRI could not meet its goals. The LRI team would like to acknowledge the Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) and German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) Mission Operation teams at the German Space Operation Center (GSOC) for their excellent work and support in commanding the LRI instrument in all mission phases. The Australian National University developed an alternative triple mirror assembly and were involved in testing and concept development for link acquisition. Part of the research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. GRACE-FO is a partnership betweenNASAand German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany. JPLmanages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The development of the LRI in Germanywas supported by Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Project No. 03F0654B, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR).		28	14	14	2	6	AMER PHYSICAL SOC	COLLEGE PK	ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA	0031-9007	1079-7114		PHYS REV LETT	Phys.
