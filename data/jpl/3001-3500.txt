Several products currently exist from multiple observing platforms and processing centers, making product selection for different uses challenging. Here we evaluate four popular SSS datasets in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) to characterize the error in each product versus in-situ observations: Two products from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, processed by Remote Sensing Systems (REMSS) (40 km and 70 km); one SMAP 60 km product from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); and one 60 km product from ESA's Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. Overall, the four products are remarkably consistent on seasonal time scales, reproducing dominant salinity features. Towards the coast, 3 of the 4 products (JPL SMAP, REMSS 40 km SMAP, and SMOS) show increasing salty biases (reaching 0.7-1 pss) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSD) (reaching 1.5-2.5 pss), and a decreasing signal to noise ratio from 3 to 1. REMSS 40 km generally shows a lower RMSD than other products (0.5 vs. 1.1 pss) in the nearshore region. However, at some buoy locations, SMOS shows the lowest RMSD values, but has a higher bias overall (>0.2 vs. <0.1 pss). The REMSS 70km product is not consistent in terms of data availability in the nearshore region and performs poorly within 100 km of the coast, relative to other products. Additional analysis of the temporal structure of the errors over a range of scales (8/9-day to seasonal) shows significantly decreasing RMSD with increasing timescales across products.

As this is directly linked to the electron transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis, SIF is a powerful proxy for photosynthetic activity. SIF observations are relatively new and, while global scale measurements from satellites using high-resolution spectroscopy of Fraunhofer bands are becoming more available, observations at the intermediate canopy scale using these techniques are sparse. We present a novel ground-based spectrometer system - PhotoSpec - for measuring SIF in the red (670-732 nm) and far-red (729-784 nm) wavelength range as well as canopy reflectance (400-900 nm) to calculate vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). PhotoSpec includes a 2D scanning telescope unit which can be pointed to any location in a canopy with a narrow field of view (FOV = 0.7 degrees) PhotoSpec has a high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution, which allows high precision solar Fraunhofer line retrievals over the entire fluorescence wavelength range under all atmospheric conditions using a new two-step linearized least-squares retrieval procedure. Initial PhotoSpec observations include the diurnal SIF cycle of single broad leaves, grass, and dark-light transitions. Results from the first tower-based measurements in Costa Rica show that the instrument can continuously monitor SIF of several tropical species throughout the day. The PhotoSpec instrument can be used to explore the relationship between SIF, photosynthetic efficiencies, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and the impact of canopy radiative transfer, viewing geometry, and stress conditions at the canopy scale.

In this approach, the floats have control only over their depth. This control authority is combined with an imperfect model of ocean currents to attempt to force the floats to maintain position. First, the impact of model accuracy on the ability to station keep (e.g. maintain X-Y position) using simulated planning and nature (ground-truth in simulation) models is studied. In this study, the impact of batch versus continuous planning is examined. In batch planning the float depth plan is derived for an extended period of time and then executed open loop. In continuous planning the depth plan is updated with the actual position and the remainder of the plan re-planned based on the new information. In these simulation results are shown that (a) active control can significantly improve station keeping with even an imperfect predictive model and (b) continuous planning can mitigate the impact of model inaccuracy. Second, the effect of using heuristic path completion estimators in search are studied. In general, using a more conservative estimator increases search quality but commensurately increases the amount of search and therefore computation time. Third are presented results from an April 2015 deployment in the Pacific Ocean that show that even with an imperfect model of ocean currents, model-based control can enhance float control performance.

J	Bock, C; Elaasar, M				Bock, Conrad; Elaasar, Maged			Reusing metamodels and notation with Diagram Definition	SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING												It is increasingly common for language specifications to describe visual forms (concrete syntax) separately from underlying concepts (abstract syntax). This is typically to enable interchange of visual information between graphical modeling tools, such as positions of nodes and routings of lines. Often overlooked is that separation of visual forms and abstract concepts enables languages to define multiple visual forms for the same underlying concepts and for the same visual form to be used for similar underlying concepts in different languages (many-to-many relationships between concrete and abstract syntax). Visual forms can be adapted to communities using different notations for the same concepts and can be used to integrate communities using the same notation for similar concepts. Models of concrete syntax have been available for some time, but are rarely used to capture these many-to-many relationships with abstract syntax. This paper shows how to model these relationships using concrete graphical syntax expressed in the Diagram Definition standard, examining cases drawn from the Unified Modeling Language and the Business Process Model and Notation. This gives definers of graphical languages a way to specify visual forms for multiple communities.																	1619-1366	1619-1374				OCT	2018	17	4					1079	1103		10.1007/s10270-016-0537-x							WOS:000453101000003						
J	Kalaydzhyan, T; Yu, N				Kalaydzhyan, Tigran; Yu, Nan			Searching for Stochastic Background of Ultra-Light Fields with Atomic Sensors	UNIVERSE												We propose a cross-correlation method for the searches of ultra-light fields, in particular, with a space network of atomic sensors. The main motivation of the approach is cancellation of uncorrelated noises in the observation data and unique pattern the fields leave on the cross-spectrum, depending on their nature (i.e., scalar, vector or tensor). In particular, we analytically derive a dependence of the cross-spectrum on the angle between two pairs of detectors. We then confirm obtained angular curves with a numerical simulation. We apply the method to the detection of dark matter and gravitational waves.

Direct Insertion of NASA Airborne Snow Observatory-Derived Snow Depth Time series Into the iSnobal Energy Balance Snow Model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Accurately simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of mountain snow water equivalent improves estimates of available meltwater and benefits the water resource management community. In this paper we present the first integration of lidar-derived distributed snow depth data into a physics-based snow model using direct insertion. Over four winter seasons (2013-2016) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL) Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) performed near-weekly lidar surveys throughout the snowmelt season to measure snow depth at high resolution over the Tuolumne River Basin above Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The modeling component of the ASO program implements the iSnobal model to estimate snow density for converting measured depths to snow water equivalent and to provide temporally complete snow cover mass and thermal states between flights. Over the four years considered in this study, snow depths from 36 individual lidar flights were directly inserted into the model to provide updates of snow depth and distribution. Considering all updates to the model, the correlation between ASO depths and modeled depths with and without previous updates was on average r(2) = 0.899 (root-mean-square error = 12.5 cm) and r(2) = 0.162 (root-mean-square error = 41.5 cm), respectively. The precise definition of the snow depth distribution integrated with the iSnobal model demonstrates how the ASO program represents a new paradigm for the measurement and modeling of mountain snowpacks and reveals the potential benefits for managing water in the region. Plan Language Summary In regions that depend primarily on snow to support life, water availability is becoming an increasingly important topic. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) is a new platform for estimating the amount of water stored in mountain snowpacks. Since 2013, the ASO has combined detailed measurements of snow depth from an aircraft with snowpack density estimates from a physics-based snow model to provide predictions of total snow water equivalent stored in the Tuolumne River Basin in the California Sierra Nevada. This work describes the process of updating the snow model using the measured ASO snow depths through a direct insertion process. When the distribution of all the snow in the basin is known more accurately, the model results are improved.

J	Tang, GQ; Long, D; Behrangi, A; Wang, CG; Hong, Y				Tang, Guoqiang; Long, Di; Behrangi, Ali; Wang, Cunguang; Hong, Yang			Exploring Deep Neural Networks to Retrieve Rain and Snow in high Latitudes Using Multisensor and reanalysis Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Satellite remote sensing is able to provide information on global rain and snow, but challenges remain in accurate estimation of precipitation rates, particularly in snow retrieval. In this work, the deep neural network (DNN) is applied to estimate rain and snow rates in high latitudes. The reference data for DNN training are provided by two spaceborne radars onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory and CloudSat. Passive microwave data from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), infrared data from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and environmental data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are trained to the spaceborne radar-based reference precipitation. The DNN estimates are compared to data from the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF), which is used to retrieve passive microwave precipitation for the GPM mission. First, the DNN-based retrieval method performs well in both training and testing periods. Second, the DNN can reveal the advantages and disadvantages of different channels of GMI and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Additionally, infrared and environmental data can improve precipitation estimation of the DNN, particularly for snowfall. Finally, based on the optimized DNN, rain and snow are estimated in 2017 from orbital GMI brightness temperatures and compared to ERA-Interim and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data. Evaluation results show that (1) the DNN can largely mitigate the underestimation of precipitation rates in high latitudes by GPROF; (2) the DNN-based snowfall estimates largely outperform those of GPROF; and (3) the spatial distributions of DNN-based precipitation are closer to reanalysis data. The method and assessment presented in this study could potentially contribute to the substantial improvement of satellite precipitation products in high latitudes. Plain Language Summary Snow has a significant influence on the hydrological cycle and water resource availability. Compared to ground gauges and radars with limited coverage, satellite remote sensing can provide global rain and snow observations from space. However, traditional satellite precipitation retrieval methods are prone to errors in snow estimation at high latitudes. In this study, we developed a new rain and snow estimation method at high latitudes using deep neural networks. The reference data sets were from two spaceborne radars that provide the most direct precipitation observations from space. Passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data were trained to the reference data sets for rain and snow estimation. Results show that the neural network-based method can largely reduce the underestimation of rain and snow rates in high latitudes in many prior algorithms. Statistical indices for snow estimation are notably improved. Furthermore, combining data from passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data sets contribute to better precipitation estimation than a single source. We suggest that deep neural networks could potentially contribute to the improvement of satellite precipitation at high latitudes, which is valuable for expanding the spatial coverage of current satellite products.

Opportunities and Challenges in Computing Fresh Groundwater Discharge to Continental Coastlines: A Multimodel Comparison for the United States Gulf and Atlantic Coasts	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The fresh component of submarine groundwater discharge (fresh SGD) transports nutrient and contaminant loads from land to sea. Fresh SGD fluxes are poorly known but depend on geology, topography, climate, and land use. Here we assess two general approaches for quantifying the magnitude of fresh SGD over regional to continental scales-water budgets (lumped parameter models) and groundwater flow models-focusing on the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts as a large-scale case study. Estimates of fresh SGD fluxes from groundwater flow models are more variable than estimates from water budgets, and both are often less than field-based estimates. Both approaches predict the volume of fresh SGD within approximately 50% of 12.3 km(3)/year, in line with previous estimates, and differences are largely driven by hydrographic data inputs. The simplified water budget approach, while computationally cheap, cannot resolve flow paths or continuous flux distributions and may neglect groundwater flow from deep aquifers or distal recharge zones. Conversely, three-dimensional groundwater flow models can resolve flow paths and fresh SGD contributions from heterogeneous aquifer systems but are computationally expensive and require more parameterization. Ultimately, multiple models and integrated field data are needed to improve our estimates of fresh SGD fluxes over a wide range of scales.

Vibrations reduce the quality of the correction provided by the adaptive optics system, blurring the science image, and reducing the sensitivity of most science modules. We studied vibrations using the Subaru coronagraphic extreme adaptive optics instrument at the Subaru Telescope as it is the most vibration-sensitive system installed on the telescope. We observed vibrations for all targets, usually at low frequency, below 10 Hz. Using accelerometers on the telescope, we confirmed that these vibrations were introduced by the telescope itself, and not the instrument. It was determined that they were related to the pitch of the encoders of the telescope drive system, both in altitude and azimuth, with frequencies evolving proportionally to the rotational speed of the telescope. Another strong vibration was found in the altitude axis of the telescope, around the time of transit of the target, when the altitude rotational speed is below 0.12 arc sec/s. These vibrations are amplified by the 10-Hz control loop of the telescope, especially in a region between 4 and 6 Hz. We demonstrate an accurate characterization of the frequencies of the telescope vibrations using only the coordinates-right ascension and declination-of the target and provide a means by which we can predict them for any telescope pointing. This will be a powerful tool that can be used by more advanced wavefront control algorithms, especially predictive control that uses information about the disturbance to calculate the best correction.

This is the first time that cometary energetic particles have been observed at Mars. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)-solar energetic particle (SEP) and the Mars Odyssey-High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) instruments recorded evidence of precipitating particles, which are likely O+ pickup ions, during the similar to 10 hr that Mars was within the region of the comet's coma. O+ pickup ions were also detected several hours after, although whether their origin is the comet or space weather is not conclusive. We discuss the possible origin of those particles and also the cause of an additional shower of energetic particles that HEND observed between 22 and 35 hr after the comet's closest approach, which may be related to dust impacts from the comet's dust tail. An O+ pickup ion energy flux simulation is performed with representative solar wind and cometary conditions, together with a simulation of their energy deposition profile in the atmosphere of Mars. Results indicate that the O+ pickup ion fluxes observed by SEP were deposited in the ionosphere around 105 to 120 km altitude, and they are compared with precomet flyby estimations of cometary pickup ions. The comet's flyby deposited a significant fluence of energetic particles into Mars' upper atmosphere, at a similar level to a large space weather event. Plain Language Summary Comet Siding Spring is a comet from the Oort cloud (a spherical shell of cometary bodies far beyond the solar system) that made a single flyby through the inner solar system in October 2014. It passed very close to Mars on 19 October 2014, at only one third of the Earth-Moon distance. This is a unique event as a close encounter of this type with Mars is predicted to occur only once in 100,000years. In this work, we analyze data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) and the Mars Odyssey missions in order to understand how the Martian atmosphere reacts to such an unusual external event. This is done through the study of energetic particles from the comet. These particles are important as they constitute an energy input into Mars' atmosphere and are therefore useful for understanding atmospheric evolution and habitability. We have found several O+ detections from the comet, while Mars was within the comet environment (during similar to 10 hr). Also, we discuss several other interesting features that occurred after the closest approach, which could be related to comet dust tail impacts between 22 and 35 hr after the comet's closest approach. In general, the comet deposited into Mars' upper atmosphere a similar level of energy to that of a large space weather storm.

Using the Airborne Snow Observatory to Assess Remotely Sensed Snowfall Product in the California Sierra Nevada	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) performed two acquisitions over two mountainous basins in California on 29 January and 3 March 2017, encompassing two atmospheric river events that brought heavy snowfall to the area. These surveys produced high-resolution (50 m) maps of snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) that were used to estimate monthly areal snowfall accumulation. Comparison of ASO snow accumulation with point measurements showed that the ASO estimates ranged from -10 to +16% relative bias across three sites, which is likely inflated by the disagreement in areal representation of the quantities from the actual errors in these products. The aggregated SWE accumulations from ASO are then used to evaluate a suite of in situ based and remote sensing precipitation products. During the study period, Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and Mountain Mapper estimates had relative bias <10% compared with ASO-based estimates of snow accumulation, but satellite and radar products largely underestimate snowfall accumulation compared to ASO (up to 50%). Despite their underestimation, satellite and radar products show correlation coefficients >0.8 with ASO snow accumulation over the selected grids at the monthly scale. Finally, we leveraged the fine-scale sampling of the spatially complete ASO products to show that by moving from 100 m to 2 km spatial scales, the perceived bias errors SWE at point locations increased by an order of magnitude, displaying a nonlinear relationship. The study demonstrates that ASO acquisitions in cold months can bring a new and effective approach to spatial evaluation of precipitation products.

A New Enceladus Global Control Network, Image Mosaic, and Updated Pointing Kernels From Cassini's 13-Year Mission	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												NASA's Cassini spacecraft spent 13 years exploring the Saturn system, including 23 targeted flybys of the small, geologically active moon Enceladus. These flybys provided a wealth of image data from Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem. To improve the usability of the Enceladus data set, we created a new, global photogrammetric control network for Enceladus that enabled compilation of a versatile cartographic package to support geologic mapping and other investigations. The network used 586 images in four image filters with a pixel scale generally between 50 and 500 m per pixel and a phase angle less than 120 degrees and consisted of 10,362 tie points and 173,704 individual image measures, averaging nearly 17 measures per tie point. Least squares bundle adjustment resulted in a root-mean-square residual of 0.45 pixel, corresponding to root-mean-square ground point uncertainties of 66, 51, and 46 m in latitude, longitude, and radius, respectively. Using our geodetic control network, we created new global image mosaics, coregistered flyby mosaics to support geologic mapping, and updated pointing kernels for every image used in the solution. These products, including the updated pointing kernels, are available to the community through NASA's Planetary Data System Imaging Annex. The bundle adjustment solution also yielded independently determined shape information, resulting in radii within the stated uncertainty of International Astronomical Union values. The challenges of the data set, and the technical methodology described here are applicable to bodies imaged during multiple flybys with variable viewing and illumination geometry, including other midsized satellites of Saturn, and the Europa Clipper mission. Plain Language Summary In 2004, NASA's Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn and spent the next 13 years in orbit around the planet. During that time, cameras on Cassini took thousands of pictures of Saturn's small moon Enceladus, which has a young, fractured surface and geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor erupting from cracks at its south pole. The pictures provide a wealth of information but are difficult to use. Small uncertainties in the exact location and look direction of the Cassini spacecraft when the pictures were taken cause large uncertainties in locating where on the surface each picture is actually positioned. Overlapping pictures taken at different times during Cassini's mission therefore often do not properly align. We improved the usability of these pictures by identifying thousands of common points between overlapping images and mathematically performing a simultaneous realignment of more than 600 of Cassini's best pictures of Enceladus. We then combined 108 individual pictures into a single global picture that can be used for creating geologic maps.

In the case that a debris disc, inferred from an infrared excess in the SED, is best modelled as two distinct temperatures, we infer the presence of two spatially separated rings of debris. Giant planets may well exist between these two belts of debris, and indeed could be responsible for the formation of the gap between these belts. We observe 24 such two-belt systems using the VLT/SPHERE high-contrast imager, and interpret our results under the assumption that the gap is indeed formed by one or more giant planets. A theoretical minimum mass for each planet can then be calculated, based on the predicted dynamical time-scales to clear debris. The typical dynamical lower limit is similar to 0.2M(J) in this work, and in some cases exceeds 1M(J). Direct imaging data, meanwhile, are typically sensitive to planets down to similar to 3.6M(J) at 1 arcsec, and 1.7M(J) in the best case. Together, these two limits tightly constrain the possible planetary systems present around each target, many of which will be detectable with the next generation of high-contrast imagers.

Nonlinear data assimilation for clouds and precipitation using a gamma inverse-gamma ensemble filter	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Where clouds occur, their water content is always positive definite, and may be near zero. In addition, it is common for errors in remote-sensing observations of clouds and rainfall to be represented as a fraction of the measurement. Furthermore, there is nonlinearity in the relationships among cloud environment, cloud microphysical processes, and the amount and distribution of cloud and precipitation. For these reasons, data assimilation algorithms that rely on linearity and assumptions of Gaussian probability distributions may have difficulty in assimilating observations in cloudy regions, as well as producing an analysis that realistically represents the actual distribution of clouds and precipitation. A recently developed ensemble filter algorithm, the Gamma, Inverse-Gamma, and Gaussian Ensemble Kalman Filter (GIGG-EnKF), allows for fractional observation errors and positive-definite quantities. As such, it has promise for producing more effective and accurate data assimilation and retrievals of clouds and precipitation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the GIGG-EnKF by using it to estimate the values of warm rain cloud microphysical parameters in a cloud model using observations of precipitation. GIGG-EnKF estimates of cloud parameters and rainfall are compared with a Bayesian reference solution returned by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and with a perturbed-observations Ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF). The ETKF produces an ensemble with a substantial number of negative (non-physical) precipitation rates and parameter values. In contrast, the GIGG-EnKF precipitation analysis is positive definite, and is able to adapt to changes in the observation value (and observation uncertainty). Nonlinearity in the parameter-precipitation relationship is handled by implementing an iterative outer loop regression from the observation space to state space. The positive-definite constraint and natural accommodation of fractional error, along with the iterative outer loop, produces an accurate reproduction of the Bayesian analysis of the precipitation rate and cloud microphysical parameter values.

Do slow slip events trigger large and great megathrust earthquakes?	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Slow slip events have been suggested to trigger subduction earthquakes. However, examples to date have been poorly recorded, occurring offshore, where data are sparse. Better understanding of slow slip events and their influence on subsequent earthquakes is critical for hazard forecasts. We analyze a well-recorded event beginning 6 months before the 2012 Mw (moment magnitude) 7.6 earthquake in Costa Rica. The event migrates to the eventual megathrust rupture. Peak slip rate reached a maximum of 5 mm/day, 43 days before the earthquake, remaining high until the earthquake. However, changes in Mohr-Coulomb failure stress at the hypocenter were small (0.1 bar). Our data contradict models of earthquake nucleation that involve power law acceleration of slip and foreshocks. Slow slip events may prove useful for short-term earthquake forecasts.

The node (e.g., planets/satellites/Orbiters) positions in deep space are predictable and messages are transmitted from one node to the other in a store-and-forward mode whenever these nodes are in contact with each other. Contact Graph Routing (CGR) has been proposed for interplanetary networks due to its delay tolerant nature and characteristics. The CGR chooses a single path between a source and a destination node to achieve the best delivery time of a bundle. However, the contacts that cannot transmit one complete bundle or have some leftover capacity after transmitting one or more complete bundles are ignored here. This leads to wastage of deep space transmission opportunities which are significant. In this paper, we propose a scheme for utilizing these contacts efficiently by fragmenting the bundles wherever possible. The bundle fragments are then routed to the destination using multiple paths. Simulation studies show that CGR-BF efficiently exploits the network's bandwidth and substantially increases the goodput incurring minimum overhead compared to that of the CGR where fixed size bundles are used.

Multi-year (2010-2016) observations of satellite-derived sea surface salinity (SSS) and in situ water column hydrographic data during summer 2016 were used to investigate physical aspects of the ROFI east of the Mississippi River Delta to better assess regional susceptibility to hypoxia in the summer months. Time series of SSS data indicate that the shelf region impacted by the seasonal expansion of freshwater can be as extensive as the well-known "dead zone" region west of the Delta, and hydrographic observations from a shelf -wide survey indicate strong stratification associated with the ROFI. Peak buoyancy frequencies typically ranged between 0.15 and 0.25 s(-1) and were concentrated in a 2-3 m layer around 4-10 m deep across much of the shelf. This ROFI is expected to be influenced by local freshwater sources which, while individually small, make a notable contribution in aggregate to the region (annually averaged daily discharge of approximately 2880 m(3) s(-1)). The dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions under this freshwater cap were spatially and temporally variable, with areas of hypoxia and near-hypoxic conditions over portions of the shelf, demonstrating the utility of satellite-derived SSS in identifying coastal areas potential vulnerability to hypoxia. These regions of low bottom dissolved oxygen persisted throughout the peak summer season at several sites on the shelf, with the northeastern corner of Mississippi Bight having the most intense and persistent hypoxia.

A Two-Decade Anthropogenic and Biogenic Isoprene Emissions Study in a London Urban Background and a London Urban Traffic Site	ATMOSPHERE												A relationship between isoprene and 1,3-butadiene mixing ratios was established to separate the anthropogenic and biogenic fractions of the measured isoprene in London air in both urban background (Eltham) and urban traffic (Marylebone Road) areas over two decades (1997-2017). The average daytime biogenic isoprene mixing ratios over this period reached 0.09 +/- 0.04 ppb (Marylebone Road) and 0.11 +/- 0.06 ppb (Eltham) between the period of 6:00 to 20:00 local standard time, contributing 40 and 75% of the total daytime isoprene mixing ratios. The average summertime biogenic isoprene mixing ratios for 1997-2017 are found to be 0.13 +/- 0.02 and 0.15 +/- 0.04 ppb which contribute 50 and 90% of the total summertime isoprene mixing ratios for Marylebone Road and Eltham, respectively. Significant anthropogenic isoprene mixing ratios are found during night-time (0.11 +/- 0.04 ppb) and winter months (0.14 +/- 0.01 ppb) at Marylebone Road. During high-temperature and high-pollution events (high ozone) there is a suggestion that ozone itself may be directly responsible for some of the isoprene emission. By observing the positive correlation between biogenic isoprene levels with temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and ozone mixing ratios during heatwave periods, the Cobb-Douglas production function was used to obtain a better understanding of the abiotic factors that stimulate isoprene emission from plants. Other reasons for a correlation between ozone and isoprene are discussed. The long-term effects of urban stressors on vegetation were also observed, with biogenic isoprene mixing ratios on Marylebone Road dropping over a 20-year period regardless of the sustained biomass levels.

J	Behrangi, A; Richardson, M				Behrangi, Ali; Richardson, Mark			Observed High-Latitude Precipitation Amount and Pattern and CMIP5 Model Projections	REMOTE SENSING												Utilizing reanalysis and high sensitivity W-band radar observations from CloudSat, this study assesses simulated high-latitude (55-82.5 degrees) precipitation and its future changes under the RCP8.5 global warming scenario. A subset of models was selected based on the smallest discrepancy relative to CloudSat and ERA-I reanalysis using a combined ranking for bias and spatial root mean square error (RMSE). After accounting for uncertainties introduced by internal variability due to CloudSat's limited four year day-night observation period, RMSE provides greater discrimination between the models than a typical mean state bias criterion. Over 1976-2005 to 2071-2100, colder months experience larger fractional modelled precipitation increases than warmer months, and the observation-constrained models generally report a larger response than the full ensemble. For everywhere except the Southern Hemisphere (SH55, for 55-82.5 degrees S) ocean, the selected models show greater warming than the model ensemble while their hydrological sensitivity (fractional precipitation change with temperature) is indistinguishable from the full ensemble relationship. This indicates that local thermodynamic effects explain much of the net high-latitude precipitation change. For the SH ocean, the models that perform best in the present climate show near-median warming but greater precipitation increase, implying a detectable contribution from processes other than local thermodynamic changes. A Taylor diagram analysis of the full CMIP5 ensemble finds that the Northern Hemisphere (NH55) and SH55 land areas follow a wet get wetter paradigm. The SH55 land areas show stable spatial correlations between the simulated present and future climate, indicative of small changes in the spatial pattern, but this is not true of NH55 land. This shows changes in the spatial pattern of precipitation changes through time as well as the differences in precipitation between wet and dry regions.

It was launched on 10 June 2011 as part of the Aquarius/SAC-D observatory. The observatory is a partnership between the United States National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), which provided Aquarius, and the Argentinian space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), which provided the spacecraft bus, Satelite de Aplicaciones Cientificas (SAC-D). The observatory was lost four years later on 7 June 2015 when a failure in the power distribution network resulted in the loss of control of the spacecraft. The Aquarius Mission formally ended on 31 December 2017. The last major milestone was the release of the final version of the salinity retrieval (Version 5). Version 5 meets the mission requirements for accuracy, and reflects the continuing progress and understanding developed by the science team over the lifetime of the mission. Further progress is possible, and several issues remained unresolved at the end of the mission that are relevant to future salinity retrievals. The understanding developed with Aquarius is being transferred to radiometer observations over the ocean from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, and salinity from SMAP with accuracy approaching that of Aquarius are already being produced.

Sensitivity of Evapotranspiration Components in Remote Sensing-Based Models	REMOTE SENSING												Accurately estimating evapotranspiration (ET) at large spatial scales is essential to our understanding of land-atmosphere coupling and the surface balance of water and energy. Comparisons between remote sensing-based ET models are difficult due to diversity in model formulation, parametrization and data requirements. The constituent components of ET have been shown to deviate substantially among models as well as between models and field estimates. This study analyses the sensitivity of three global ET remote sensing models in an attempt to isolate the error associated with forcing uncertainty and reveal the underlying variables driving the model components. We examine the transpiration, soil evaporation, interception and total ET estimates of the Penman-Monteith model from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (PM-MOD), the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) at 42 sites where ET components have been measured using field techniques. We analyse the sensitivity of the models based on the uncertainty of the input variables and as a function of the raw value of the variables themselves. We find that, at 10% added uncertainty levels, the total ET estimates from PT-JPL, PM-MOD and GLEAM are most sensitive to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (%RMSD = 100.0), relative humidity (%RMSD = 122.3) and net radiation (%RMSD = 7.49), respectively. Consistently, systemic bias introduced by forcing uncertainty in the component estimates is mitigated when components are aggregated to a total ET estimate. These results suggest that slight changes to forcing may result in outsized variation in ET partitioning and relatively smaller changes to the total ET estimates. Our results help to explain why model estimates of total ET perform relatively well despite large inter-model divergence in the individual ET component estimates.

In this study, we present, using interferometric measurements constructed from Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan (TOPS) data and ALOS-2 ScanSAR, coseismic deformation and source model of the M-w 7.3, 12 November 2017 earthquake that hit northwest of the Zagros Mountains in the region between Iran-Iraq border. This was one of the strongest seismic events to hit this region in the past century, and it resulted in an uplift area of about 3500 km(2) between the High Zagros Fault (HZF) and Mountain Front Fault (MFF) with a maximum amount of 70 cm south of Miringe fault. A subsidence over an area of 1200 km(2) with a maximum amount of 35 cm occurred near Vanisar village at the hanging wall of the HZF. Bayesian inversion of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations suggests a source model at a depth between 14 and 20 km that is consistent with the existence of a decoupling horizon southwest edge of the northern portion of the Zagros Mountains near the MFF. Moreover, we present evidence for a number of coseismically induced rockslides and landslides, the majority of them which occurred along or close to pre-existing faults, causing decorrelation in differential interferograms. Exploiting the offset-tracking technique, we estimated surface motion by up to 34 and 10 m in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, due to lateral spreading on a big coseismic-induced landslide near Mela-Kabod. Field observations also revealed several zones of en echelon fractures and crack zones developed along a pre-existing fault passing through Qasr-e Shirin City, which exhibited secondary surface slip by up to 14 cm along its strike.

Compared to single-baseline PolInSAR, multibaseline PolInSAR allows forest canopy height to be estimated more accurately across a wider range of height values. However, to arrive at a single forest height estimate, the estimates from the multiple baselines must be selected or weighted. A number of approaches to selecting between baselines have been proposed in the literature, but they are generally based on simple metrics of the PolInSAR data and do not necessarily capture the full range of characteristics that make one baseline produce more accurate forest height estimates than another. We solve this problem by treating baseline selection as a supervised classification problem that can be trained using a small amount of sparse lidar data located within the PolInSAR coverage area. We train a support vector machine classifier using a variety of coarse lidar sample spacings of 250 m and greater, to demonstrate that data from future spaceborne lidar missions will be sufficient for this purpose. We demonstrate results for multiple study areas in the country of Gabon using data collected by NASA's uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar and land, vegetation, and ice sensor lidar. The use of lidar fusion for PolInSAR baseline selection yields improved results compared to standard baseline selection methods, and further demonstrates the strong potential of PolInSAR and lidar fusion for remote sensing of forests.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				OCT	2018	11	10					3415	3433		10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2841388							WOS:000447950200004

Multiple interferometric baselines are required to ensure consistent height retrieval performance across a broad range of tree heights. Previous studies have proposed multibaseline merging strategies using metrics extracted from PolInSAR measurements. Here, we introduce the multibaseline merging using a support vector machine trained by sparse LiDAR samples. The novelty of this method lies in the new way of combining the two datasets. Its advantage is that it does not require a complete LiDAR coverage, but only sparse LiDAR samples distributed over the PolInSAR image. LiDAR samples are not used to obtain the best height among a set of height stacks, but rather to train the retrieval algorithm in selecting the best height using the variables derived through PolInSAR processing. This enables more accurate height estimation for a wider scene covered by the SAR with only partial LiDAR coverage. We test our approach on NASA AfriSAR data acquired over tropical forests by the L-band UAVSAR and the LVIS LiDAR instruments. The estimated height from this approach has a higher accuracy (r(2) = 0.81, RMSE = 7.1 m) than previously introduced multibaseline merging approach (r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 9.2 m). This method is beneficial to future spaceborne missions, such as GEDI and BIOMASS, which will provide a wealth of near-contemporaneous LiDAR samples and PolInSAR measurements for mapping forest structure at global scale.

J	Riel, B; Denbina, M; Lavalle, M				Riel, Bryan; Denbina, Michael; Lavalle, Marco			Uncertainties in Forest Canopy Height Estimation From Polarimetric Interferometric SAR Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The random volume over ground (RVoG) model has been widely applied to estimate forest tree height from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PolInSAR) data for the past two decades. Successful application of the RVoG model requires certain assumptions to be valid for the imaged forest and the acquisition scenarios in order to avoid large errors in height estimates. Quantification of errors and uncertainties of RVoG-estimated heights have typically been limited to comparison against external validation data, such as lidar or field measurements. In this paper, we present a straightforward approach to simultaneously estimate height and height uncertainty from PolInSAR data using a Bayesian framework that accounts for errors in the data, as well as errors due to incorrect RVoG modeling assumptions, such as those caused by temporal decorrelation effects and errors in ground phase estimation. We apply our method to synthetic data to study how forest height uncertainty depends on modeling assumptions and PolInSAR acquisition parameters. We also compare our estimated Bayesian uncertainties to PolInSAR-derived and lidar-derived height RMS deviations observed over Gabonese tropical forests during the joint NASA-ESA 2016 AfriSAR campaign. Our results show good correspondence between uncertainties and deviations, as well as a strong correlation between uncertainty and estimated tree height. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can associate specific areas of high uncertainty to confounding effects, such as temporal decorrelation and noncanopy related scattering.

The AfriSAR Campaign: Tomographic Analysis With Phase-Screen Correction for P-Band Acquisitions	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												ESA's earth explorer BIOMASS mission is a P-band (432-438 MHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) using a combination of polarimetry and interferometric observations to quantify the vertical structure and biomass of global forests, with the primary focus on tropical forests. The methodology to map the vertical structure of the forest is based on multibaseline tomographic measurements from space. In this paper, we use data acquired by airborne sensors during the AfriSAR campaign in humid tropical forests of Africa to examine the potential of P-band tomographic SAR measurements in estimating forest parameters. We use data acquired by ONERA's P-band SAR system over the Lope National Park in central Gabon during July 2015 to estimate vertical profiles. In processing the multibaseline data, we develop and implement a phase-screen correction methodology based on recent works by Tebaldini et al. to improve the quality of measurements by removing phase perturbations associated with platform motions and uncertainties in flight trajectories. The vertical structure estimated from the corrected tomographic measurements are then compared with small and large footprint light detection and ranging (Lidar) observations collected as part of the AfriSAR campaign. The results suggest that phase-screen correction can significantly improve the vertical profile of radar backscattered power to match the Lidar observations in detecting ground, vertical vegetation density, and total height of the forests across a variety of forest types and terrain complexity.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				OCT	2018	11	10					3492	3504		10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2831441							WOS:000447950200010

Extensive performance evaluation and development of efficient data transmission mechanisms for its main protocol, bundle protocol (BP), are needed. In this paper, a new transmission approach based on "proactive" retransmission is proposed for BP for highly efficient data delivery in deep-space communications characterized by a high rate of data loss, long signal propagation delay, and highly asymmetric channel rate, given ample transmission bandwidth. The objective is to ensure successful and reliable deep-space file transfer within a single communication round-trip interval. The expected total number of transmission attempts needed for successful delivery of a file is first calculated based on the available space channel quality and the configured bundle size. Then, the time-out interval for custodial retransmission is set according to the expected number of transmission attempts required, such that all these attempts will be undertaken within the interval of a single round-trip. The performance evaluations based on both theoretical modeling and file transfer experiments indicate that the proposed proactive retransmission approach achieves the objective and has significant performance advantages over the existing reactive retransmission regardless of the transmission conditions.

Although bulk metallic glass parts are successfully fabricated using additive manufacturing, the porosity is too high for imparting good mechanical properties. The processing is tuned to create a fully-dense, dendrite-reinforced metal-matrix composite with low hardness and high indentation fracture toughness. Microstructures and properties of the printed alloy are compared to bulk amorphous samples made through thermal spray additive manufacturing (TSAM). The work shows that printing glass-forming alloys can result in tunable properties based on the cooling rate, porosity, and composite microstructures.

This subset was chosen from about 1800 IRAC NEO observations as having obvious periodicity and significant amplitude. For objects where the period observed did not sample the full rotational period, we derived lower limits to these parameters based on sinusoidal fits. Light curve durations ranged from 42 to 544 minutes, with derived periods from 16 to 270 minutes. We discuss the effects of light curve variations on the thermal modeling used to derive diameters and albedos from Spitzer photometry. We find that both diameters and albedos derived from the light curve maxima and minima agree with our previously published results, even for extreme objects, showing the conservative nature of the thermal model uncertainties. We also evaluate the NEO rotation rates, sizes, and their cohesive strengths.

Optimal estimation for imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We present a new method for atmospheric correction of remote Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectroscopy. Our approach fits a combined model of atmospheric scattering, absorption, and surface reflectance across the solar reflected interval from 380 to 2500 nm. This can estimate spectrally-broad atmospheric perturbations such as aerosol effects that are difficult to retrieve with narrow spectral windows. A probabilistic formulation from Optimal Estimation inversion theory accounts for uncertainties in model parameters and measurement noise. This paper presents a field experiment using NASA's Next Generation Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) with analysis of retrieval accuracy and information content. The inversion outperforms traditional approaches, achieving mean reflectance accuracy of 1.0% on diverse validation surfaces. Predicted posterior distributions fully explain the observed discrepancies, demonstrating the first closed uncertainty budget for VSWIR imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction. This shows the potential of combined surface/atmosphere fitting to advance the accuracy and statistical rigor of remote reflectance measurements.

SMAP Radiometer-Only Tropical Cyclone Intensity and Size Validation	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on January 31, 2015. It is a combined L-band active/passive system envisioned for the measurement of soil moisture over land. In addition to the soil moisture measurement, the SMAP data readily permit retrievals of ocean surface winds and sea surface salinity. In the previous work, we have found that the SMAP radiometer displays sensitivity to ocean surface wind all the way up to the most extreme wind speeds, possibly as high as 70 m/s, far beyond what is capable with typical C- and K u-bands ocean wind scatterometers. In this letter, we use the Rapid Scatterometer and stepped frequency microwave radiometer to further validate these SMAP radiometer-only high-wind speed retrievals. In addition, we consider the size of the retrieved high wind speeds, validating them with the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system B-deck files.

This requires to estimate and correct small residual motion errors (RMEs) within the accuracy limits of the sensor navigation subsystem, e.g., using residual motion compensation (MoCo) algorithms. Because of their data-driven nature, the performance of these algorithms severely degrades for heavily decorrelated interferograms. This letter proposes a generic RME estimation and compensation strategy optimally estimating RME in a stack of SAR acquisitions, where some interferometric pairs are strongly affected by decorrelation. The algorithm works even if the whole scene decorrelates, as long as the coherence magnitude is reasonably high over short temporal and spatial baselines. The approach entails correcting the navigation data of each slave image of a one-to-many interferometric network with a cumulative correction. The summation is over the results of a precursory application of a general data-driven residual MoCo algorithm (e.g., multisquint) to interferometric pairs for which the impact of interferometric decorrelation is marginal (i.e., small temporal and/or spatial baselines). Compared to other RME correction strategies, the main appeal of the proposed approach lies in the simplicity of its implementation. The overall methodology is tested on a zero-baseline time series acquired at L-band by the German Aerospace Center's airborne system F-SAR.

J	Gnanaskandan, A; Bellan, J				Gnanaskandan, Aswin; Bellan, Josette			Side jet effects in high-pressure turbulent flows: Direct Numerical Simulation of nitrogen injected into carbon dioxide	JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS												Direct Numerical Simulation realizations were generated of a round jet under high-pressure (high-p) turbulent conditions. In the simulations, a jet of nitrogen was injected into a chamber filled with carbon dioxide for three different jet-to-chamber density ratio, s, and three different chamber pressures, P-ch,P-0. The results show that for s = 0.5 and 0.35 side jets form whereas no side jets are observed for s = 1; thus providing, for the first time, evidence of side jet formation in high-p flows. Due to these side jets, mixing of the jet fluid and chamber fluid is promoted; although the species experience regular diffusional mixing, it is shown that due to turbulent conditions there can be effective uphill thermal conduction. Analysis of the vortical features of the side jets elucidated the process through which the enhanced mixing occurs: fluid from the jet is effectively pumped in the radial direction though the combined action of dilatation/compression and vortex stretching/shrinking. The value of s is shown to control radial and circumferential mixing versus axial mixing which occurs through jet penetration in the flow. Examination of dynamic and thermodynamic quantities indicates that side jets also promote flow unsteadiness. The pressure in the chamber is demonstrated to have negligible effect on the side jets.																	0896-8446	1872-8162				OCT	2018	140						165	181		10.1016/j.supflu.2018.04.015							WOS:000446284200017

EPIC 203868608 was previously studied as a triple star system in the Upper Scorpius OB association, but the followup Keck NIRC2/HIRES/NIRSPAO observations reported here reveal its quadruple nature. We find that the system consists of a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) Aab (M5+M5) and an eclipsing binary (EB) Bab with a total mass that is lower than that of the SB2. Furthermore, we measure the obliquity of the EB using the Doppler tomography technique during the primary eclipse. EPIC 203868608 Bab is likely on an inclined orbit with a projected obliquity of -57(-36)(+40) degrees. The inclined orbit is used to constrain the tidal quality factor for low-mass stars and the evolution of the quadruple system. The analytic framework to infer obliquity that has been developed in this paper can be applied to other EB systems as well as transiting planets.

An Operational Land Surface Temperature Product for Landsat Thermal Data: Methodology and Validation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Thermal sensors onboard Landsat satellites have been underutilized due to the lack of consistent and accurate methodologies for retrieving the land surface temperature (LST) at global scales over all land cover types. We present an operational algorithm for generating Landsat LST consistently for all sensors that will be implemented by the United States Geological Survey/The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and made available at the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center. The LST algorithm involves three steps. The observed thermal radiance is atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer model and reanalysis data. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Data Set version 3 is spectrally adjusted and then modified to account for vegetation phenology and snow cover using Landsat visible-shortwave infrared data. The LST is retrieved by inverting the atmospherically and emissivity corrected Landsat radiances with a lookup-table approach. Landsat-derived emissivities were validated at two pseudoinvariant sand dune sites within an average absolute error of 0.54% when compared with laboratory measurements. The Landsat LST retrievals were validated with in situ observations from four surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites, and two inland water bodies (Salton Sea and Lake Tahoe) in the USA. The LST retrievals for Landsat 5 and 7 had a mean bias (root mean square error) of 0.7 K (2.2 K) and 0.9 K (2.3 K) for the SURFRAD sites, and -0.3 K (0.6 K) and 0.4 K (0.7 K) for the inland water bodies, respectively. The operational algorithm will provide a consistent LST record from four decades of historical Landsat thermal data enabling the long-term monitoring of temperature and trends, land cover and land use changes, and improved utilization in models.

Growth was observed at 20-42 degrees C (optimum, 37 degrees C), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0.5-3% NaCl (optimum 0.5 %). The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic amino acid and the isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The polar lipids present were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and one unknown phospholipid. The main fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-15:0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing affiliated strain ATCC 27380(T) to the genus Paenibacillus, and showed the highest sequence similarity to Paenibacillus rigui JCM 16352(T) (97.0 %). The other closely related type strains exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values below 95.9%. The draft genome of ATCC 27380(T) had a size of 4,361,187 bases, with a G+C content of 51.0 %. The average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain ATCC 27380(T) and P. rigui JCM 16352(T) were 72.5% and 18.5 %, respectively, which were below the threshold suggested for species differentiation (96% and 70 %, respectively). The average amino acid identity between strain ATCC 27380(T) and P. rigui JCM 16352(T) was 68.72 %, which was above the suggested genus level demarcation of 65%. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic data, strain ATCC 27380(T) represents a novel species in the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus xerothermodurans sp. nov.

Volans-Carina: A New 90 Myr Old Stellar Association at 85 pc	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present a characterization of the new Volans-Carina Association (VCA) of stars near the Galactic plane (b similar or equal to -10 degrees) at a distance of similar or equal to 75-100 pc, previously identified as group 30 by Oh et al. We compile a list of 19 likely members from Gaia DR2 with spectral types B8-M2, and 46 additional candidate members from Gaia DR2, 2MASS, and AllWISE with spectral types A0-M9 that require further follow-up for confirmation. We find an isochronal age of 89(-7)(+5) Myr based on MIST isochrones calibrated with Pleiades members. This new association of stars is slightly younger than the Pleiades, with less members but located at a closer distance, making its members similar or equal to 3 times as bright as those of the Pleiades on average. It is located further than members of the AB Doradus moving group, which have a similar age, but it is more compact on the sky, which makes it less prone to contamination from random field interlopers. Its members will be useful benchmarks to understand the fundamental properties of stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets at similar or equal to 90 Myr. We also provide an updated version of the BANYAN Sigma Bayesian classification tool that includes the VCA.

Observational evidence for active dust storms on Titan at equinox	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Saturn's moon Titan has a dense nitrogen-rich atmosphere, with methane as its primary volatile. Titan's atmosphere experiences an active chemistry that produces a haze of organic aerosols that settle to the surface and a dynamic climate in which hydrocarbons are cycled between clouds, rain and seas. Titan displays particularly energetic meteorology at equinox in equatorial regions, including sporadic and large methane storms. In 2009 and 2010, near Titan's northern spring equinox, the Cassini spacecraft observed three distinctive and short-lived spectral brightenings close to the equator. Here, we show from analyses of Cassini spectral data, radiative transfer modelling and atmospheric simulations that the brightenings originate in the atmosphere and are consistent with formation from dust storms composed of micrometre-sized solid organic particles mobilized from underlying dune fields. Although the Huygens lander found evidence that dust can be kicked up locally from Titan's surface, our findings suggest that dust can be suspended in Titan's atmosphere at much larger spatial scale. Mobilization of dust and injection into the atmosphere would require dry conditions and unusually strong near-surface winds (about five times more than estimated ambient winds). Such strong winds are expected to occur in downbursts during rare equinoctial methane storms-consistent with the timing of the observed brightenings. Our findings imply that Titan-like Earth and Mars-has an active dust cycle, which suggests that Titan's dune fields are actively evolving by aeolian processes.

J	Williams, JG				Williams, James G.			Insight-building models for lunar range and range rate	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY												The analysis of range or Doppler data between sites on the Earth and Moon requires an accurate computation of the lunar orbit and detailed models of the orientation of the Earth and Moon. Models constructed to understand range and range rate can lack detail, but if they include the largest lunar orbit variations, tracking stations on a rotating Earth, and lunar sites on a synchronously rotating Moon, then they will display the largest effects for orbit elements, Earth orientation, tracking station locations, and lunar site coordinates. The range and range rate are expanded into periodic series. To understand accurate solutions, the largest periodic terms that are sensitive to various solution parameters indicate the sensitivity of data to solution parameters and the time spans needed for their determination. Conclusions include: cylindrical coordinates work well for sites on the rapidly rotating Earth, but Cartesian coordinates are more natural for the synchronously rotating Moon since the series for the three coordinate projections are distinct. For range and range rate data, daily, semimonthly, monthly, and longer periods are present. For Doppler data, the daily periods may be stronger and more useful than the long periods, particularly for terms associated with the terrestrial tracking station. Doppler data do not determine the lander coordinate toward the Earth well. Observational strategies for range and Doppler data are not identical. For all data types, one wishes a variety of hour angles, lunar declinations, times of month, and longer periods. A long span of high-quality range data can improve the lunar orbit, orientation of the Earth's equator, and physical librations. The locations of new lunar sites or new tracking stations can be determined from shorter spans of data.																	0923-2958	1572-9478				OCT	2018	130	10							63	10.1007/s10569-018-9857-1							WOS:000445270900001

The Rich Dynamics of Jupiter's Great Red Spot from JunoCam: Juno Images	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We have used high-resolution images obtained with JunoCam onboard the Juno spacecraft during its close flyby of Jupiter on 2017 July 11, to study the dynamics of the Great Red Spot (GRS) at the upper cloud level. We have measured the horizontal velocity and vorticity fields using the clouds as tracers of the flow. We have analyzed a variety of cloud morphologies that serve to characterize different underlying dynamic processes. Long undulating dark gray filaments (2000-10000 km) circulate around the outer part of the vortex moving at high speed (similar to 120-140 m s(-1)) where mesoscale waves (wavelength 75 km) indicate stable conditions in this region. At mid distance from the center, a large eddy (radius similar to 500 km) is observed in a region of intense horizontal wind shear whereas on the opposite side, compact cloud clusters with cell sizes of similar to 50 km, indicative of shallow convection, are observed. The core of the GRS (similar to 5000 x 3000 km(2)) is turbulent where the circulation has weakly cyclonic and anticyclonic regions. This variety of phenomena occurs in the upper ammonia cloud layer and haze (thickness similar to 20-50 km) that represents the top of a dynamical system with a much deeper circulation.

Often, it is also beneficial to fly at high speeds to complete tasks quickly. A key challenge in enabling these capabilities is to plan trajectories, in a limited time period, that are safe, collision-free, and dynamically feasible. In this context, dynamic feasibility means that the trajectory can be accurately tracked in flight: a critical requirement when flying near to obstacles. When evaluating trajectory planning algorithms, it is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses; in this paper, we compare three state-of-the-art algorithms with a set of real-world planning scenarios and assessments of performance when planned trajectories are tracked in flight. We introduce a combination of the work of Campos-Macias et al. with Bry et al., which is shown to perform well for slow and conservative trajectories. The algorithm from Bry et al. is shown to perform the best for higher speed trajectories with relatively large amounts of open space. An adaptation of the algorithm from the work of Chamitoff et al. for quadrotor applications, as presented here, is shown to be the best planner for high-speed trajectories in tight confines, while relaxing the need for initial seed-paths that are collision free.

M. Keck Observatory	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												The NIRC2 vortex coronagraph is an instrument on Keck II designed to directly image exoplanets and circumstellar disks at mid-infrared bands L' (3.4-4.1 mu m) and M-s (4.55-4.8 mu m). We analyze imaging data and corresponding adaptive optics telemetry, observing conditions, and other metadata over a three-year time period to characterize the performance of the instrument and predict the detection limits of future observations. We systematically process images from 359 observations of 304 unique stars to subtract residual starlight (i.e., the coronagraphic point-spread function) of the target star using two methods: angular differential imaging (ADI) and reference star differential imaging (RDI). We find that for the typical parallactic angle (PA) rotation of our data set (similar to 10 degrees), RDI provides gains over ADI for angular separations smaller than 0".125. Furthermore, we find a power-law relation between the angular separation from the host star and the minimum PA rotation required for ADI to outperform RDI, with a power-law index of -1.18 +/- 0.08. Finally, we use random forest models to estimate ADI and RDI post-processed detection limits a priori. These models, which we provide publicly on a website, explain 70%-80% of the variance in ADI detection limits and 30%-50% of the variance in RDI detection limits. Averaged over a range of angular separations, our models predict both ADI and RDI contrast to within a factor of 2. These results illuminate important factors in high-contrast imaging observations with the NIRC2 vortex coronagraph, help improve observing strategies, and inform future upgrades to the hardware.

Observing Oceans in Tightly Packed Planetary Systems: Perspectives from Polarization Modeling of the TRAPPIST-1 System	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												The recently discovered TRAPPIST-1 system is exciting due to the possibility of several rocky, Earth-sized planets harboring liquid water on their surface. To assess the detectability of oceans on these planets, we model the disk-integrated phase curves and polarization signals for planets in this system for reflected starlight. We examine four cases: (1) dry planet, (2) cloud-covered planet, (3) planet with regional-scale oceans, and (4) planet with global oceans. Polarization signals are strongest for optically thin (less than or similar to 0.1) atmospheres over widespread oceans, with the degree of polarization being up to 90% for a single planet or on the order of 100 parts per billion for the star-planet system. In cases where reflected light from different planets in a tightly packed system cannot be separated, observing in polarized light allows for up to a tenfold increase in star-planet contrast compared to photometric observations alone. However, polarization from other sources, such as atmospheric scattering and cloud variability, will pose major challenges to the detection of glint (specularly reflected starlight) polarization signals. Planned telescopes like LUVOIR may be capable of observing glint from Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars, and if equipped with a polarimeter can significantly improve our ability to detect and study oceans on rocky exoplanets.

Positions, intensities intensities and line shape parameters for the 1 <- 0 bands of CO isotopologues	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												Positions and intensities for transitions in the 1 <- 0 bands of the four CO isotopologues ((CO)-C-12-O-16, (CO)-C-13-O-16, (CO)-C-12-O-18 and (CO)-C-13-O-18) were retrieved from analyses of spectra of different low-pressure pure samples and high-pressure air-broadened mixtures (1940-2260 cm(-1)) in two different multispectrum fittings involving selected groups of 21 (for (CO)-C-13-O-16) and 20 (for (CO)-C-12-O-18) spectra. Air-broadened half-width and air-shift coefficients, their temperature dependences, line mixing via off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients for CO-air collision systems, and quadratic speed dependence parameters were measured for (CO)-C-13-O-16 and (CO)-C-12-O-18 transitions. In both the fittings, two low-pressure room-temperature spectra of a high purity natural sample of CO recorded with the Kitt Peak FTS were included to retrieve the positions and intensities of (CO)-C-12-O-16 transitions. All other spectra in the fittings were obtained with either C-13-enriched or O-18-enriched samples using the JPL Bruker IFS-125HR FTS. Four absorption cells with path lengths between 0.5131(5) and 20.38(2) cm were used to record the data. The cells are temperature controlled, except for the shortest cell. Positions and intensities for the 1 <- 0 band transitions were determined from the retrieved ro-vibrational constants (G, B, D and H), band intensity and Herman-Wallis parameters by applying the theoretical quantum mechanical expressions. The band strengths of (CO)-C-12-O-16, (CO)-C-12-O-18 and (CO)-C-13-O-18 are very close (similar to 0.3%) to HITRAN2012 values but for (CO)-C-13-O-16 the band strength is similar to 4.8% larger than the HITRAN2012 and 2.6% larger than the HITRAN2016 value.

Researchers often design robots specifically to be able to wait for periods of time in low-power states, conserving energy, and protecting hardware during periods of inactivity. In this letter, we introduce a temporary anchor using a low-power hybrid electrostatic/gecko-inspired adhesive for robots such as quadrotors and wall-climbing systems to allow access to remote areas while providing the ability to safely hold a position for an extended duration. This letter presents a self-contained electrostatic and gecko-inspired adhesive anchor mechanism, which is particularly well suited for long-duration payload placement. With structural layers comprised of a rigid plate and a soft foam, this anchor distributes normal stress across the pad while maintaining the compliance required for effective use of the adhesives. This new approach to loading the hybrid adhesive increases the distance off-the-wan that a payload can be supported, even on rough surfaces. We model the capacity of the device and demonstrate carrying an 11.9 N load applied 12 mm off of a rough drywall surface with an adhesive area of 32 cm(-2). We also offer two innovations that extend the mission-duration of an electrostatic adhesive anchor. We show that polyimide, a common dielectric layer in flex circuits, is prone to failing over a period of hours while both polyethylene-terephthalate and polyethylene-napthalate films demonstrate long-term stability under the applied electrical field. Furthermore, to reduce the power consumption of the adhesive, we introduce the concept of power-cycling, and reduce power consumption by an order of magnitude while still maintaining over 85 percent adhesion strength.This temporary anchor can be scaled in size to suit a given application, with virtually no difference in power draw or required electronics.We model the payload capacity of the anchor, and demonstrate performance on a variety of surfaces.

A gap in the planetesimal disc around HD 107146 and asymmetric warm dust emission revealed by ALMA	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												While detecting low-mass exoplanets at tens of au is beyond current instrumentation, debris discs provide a unique opportunity to study the outer regions of planetary systems. Here, we report new ALMA observations of the 80-200 Myr old Solar analogue HD 107146 that reveal the radial structure of its exo-Kuiper belt at wavelengths of 1.1 and 0.86 mm. We find that the planetesimal disc is broad, extending from 40 to 140 au, and it is characterized by a circular gap extending from 60 to 100 au in which the continuum emission drops by about 50 per cent. We also report the non-detection of the CO J = 3-2 emission line, confirming that there is not enough gas to affect the dust distribution. To date, HD 107146 is the only gas-poor system showing multiple rings in the distribution of millimetre sized particles. These rings suggest a similar distribution of the planetesimals producing small dust grains that could be explained invoking the presence of one or more perturbing planets. Because the disc appears axisymmetric, such planets should be on circular orbits. By comparing N-body simulations with the observed visibilities we find that to explain the radial extent and depth of the gap, it would require the presence of multiple low-mass planets or a single planet that migrated through the disc. Interior to HD 107146's exo-Kuiper belt we find extended emission with a peak at similar to 20 au and consistent with the inner warm belt that was previously predicted based on 22 mu m excess as in many other systems. This warm belt is the first to be imaged, although unexpectedly suggesting that it is asymmetric. This could be due to a large belt eccentricity or due to clumpy structure produced by resonant trapping with an additional inner planet.					Booth, Mark/0000-0001-8568-6336; Hughes, A.

A high resolution Mars surface gravity grid	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												We have developed a new model of the gravitational acceleration vector at the surface of Mars, and present it on an equal area grid covering the surface of Mars, with a 1.73 km resolution. The long wavelength part of the model is adopted from MRO120d, which is a spherical harmonic model of the potential derived from Doppler tracking data of spacecraft in orbit about Mars. The short wavelength part is derived from convolution of appropriate Green's functions with the surface mass distribution associated with the MOLA topography, assuming a uniform mass density. The density was selected to be 2782 kg/m(3), which yields surface gravity values, from that approach, which match those from the spacecraft-derived model at the transition wavelength, which is taken to be degree 80. Our estimate of the error in the radial component is 11 mGal, with a larger contribution from long wavelength sources than from short wavelengths.

Whistler Mode Waves Associated With Broadband Auroral Electron Precipitation at Jupiter	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Large amplitude electromagnetic plasma waves are observed simultaneously with intense fluxes of electrons precipitating on auroral field lines at Jupiter. Here we present plasma wave observations from the Juno Waves instrument obtained during an instance of very intense broadband electron precipitation observed by the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument connecting to Jupiter's main auroral oval. The wave spectrum extends from 50 Hz to similar to 10 kHz with peak-to-peak amplitudes of similar to 10 nT in the magnetic channel and of similar to 1 V/m in the electric channel, representing some of the most intense plasma waves observed by Juno. The E and B fields of these electromagnetic waves are correlated and have apparent polarization perpendicular to Jupiter's magnetic field with a downward Poynting flux. We conclude the plasma waves are whistler mode emissions with a possible admixture of ion-cyclotron or Alfven waves and may be important in the broadband electron acceleration. Plain Language Summary Large amplitude whistler mode waves are found coincidently with intense fluxes of precipitating electrons across a broad energy range connecting to Jupiter's main auroral oval. The whistler mode waves are propagating downward, in the same direction as the precipitating electrons. The tight correspondence in time between the waves and the electrons strongly suggests an important interaction between the waves and electrons.

Observation of Electron Conics by Juno: Implications for Radio Generation and Acceleration Processes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Using Juno plasma, electric and magnetic field observations (from JADE, Waves, and MAG instruments), we show that electron conic distributions are commonly observed in Jovian radio sources. The conics are characterized by maximum fluxes at oblique pitch angles, similar to 20 degrees-30 degrees from the B field, both in the upward and downward directions. They constitute an efficient source of free energy for the cyclotron maser instability. Growth rates of similar to 3 to 7 x 10(4) s(-1) are obtained for hectometric waves, leading to amplification by e(10) with propagation paths of 50-100 km. We show that stochastic acceleration due to interactions with a low-frequency electric field turbulence located a few 10(4)km above the ionosphere may form the observed conics. A possible source of turbulence could be inertial Alfven waves, suggesting a connection between the auroral acceleration and generation of coherent radio emissions. Plain Language Summary Jupiter, as many astrophysical magnetized objects, is a powerful emitter of nonthermal radio emissions. The coherent process required for their generation is likely the cyclotron maser instability (CMI). However, the exact conditions of wave amplification are not known precisely at Jupiter. With Juno mission, for the first time, it is possible to explore the auroral regions of Jupiter, where the particles are accelerated and the nonthermal emissions produced. With several crossing of the radio sources, the free energy used by the CMI can now be identified. It corresponds to conic-like distributions, characterized by an accumulation of particles just outside the loss cones. Applying the CMI theory, large growth rates are obtained, showing that the conics probably play a central role in the wave generation source. The formation of the conics could be due to an interaction with a low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence. This suggests a close relationship between the radio wave generation and the particle acceleration, as at Earth, the details of the scenario being, nevertheless, slightly different.

Juno Constraints on the Formation of Jupiter's Magnetospheric Cushion Region	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Observations by the Pioneer, Voyager, Ulysses, and Galileo spacecraft in Jupiter's dayside magnetosphere revealed a cushion region, where the magnetic field became increasingly dipolar and the 10-hr periodicity associated with rotation of the magnetodisc was no longer visible. Focused observations at the dawn terminator by the Juno spacecraft provide critical constraints on the formation physics of the dayside cushion. We observe a persistent 10-hr periodicity at dawn with only minor distortions of the field near the magnetopause boundary, indicating the absence of a systematic dawn cushion region. These data suggest that the dayside cushion is not formed via mass loss associated with magnetic reconnection along a localized X line but rather may be due to the gradual compression of the dawnside magnetic field as it rotates toward local noon. Plain Language Summary Jupiter's space environment is strongly influenced by its fast rotation period of similar to 10hr. Dipolar magnetic field lines are stretched out by centrifugal forces out to distances up to 100 times Jupiter's radius. Observations of Jupiter's dayside magnetosphere from several spacecraft revealed a cushion region that was thought to contain an absence of plasma, constraining how mass and magnetic field are circulated around the planet. This cushion was thought to extend to dawn local times, but there have been very few spacecraft observations of this region until Juno. The Juno data presented here demonstrates that no systematic cushion region exists near the dawn terminator such that flux circulation models need to be reassessed in order to account for a cushion region that is confined closer towards noon local times.

Bagnold Dunes Campaign Phase 2: Visible/Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy of Longitudinal Ripple Sands	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												As part of the Phase 2 Bagnold Dune campaign at Gale Crater, Mars, constraints on the geochemistry, mineralogy, and oxidation state of pristine and disturbed linear sand ripples were made using visible/near-infrared spectral observations for comparison to Phase 1 spectra of the barchan dunes to the north. Spectra acquired by the ChemCam and Mastcam instruments (400-1,000 nm) at four Phase 2 locations revealed similar overall spectral trends between the two regions, but most Phase 2 sands were redder in the visible wavelengths. The majority of targets exhibited lower red/infrared ratios, higher similar to 530-nm band depths, and higher red/blue ratios than Phase 1 samples, suggesting a greater proportion of redder, fine-grained, ferric sands in Phase 2 samples. This is consistent with the slightly greater proportion of hematite in Phase 2 samples as determined from CheMin analyses of the Ogunquit sands, which may reflect contamination from the surrounding hematite-bearing Murray formation bedrock. Plain Language Summary The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover visited the southern portion of the Bagnold Dunes to look for differences in the types of sand grains that comprised the dunes and ripples. The rover's cameras and spectrometers provided information about the color of the sands, which was used to infer the composition and types of minerals. Overall, the sands in this part of the Bagnold Dunes were a bit redder than those further to the north that were studied previously. We interpreted this to mean that the southern sands contained more oxidized (rusted) iron particles. Because the rocks surrounding these dunes were known to contain a fair amount of red, iron-rich minerals, it is probable that the sands were mixed with a small amount of broken fragments from these rocks.

Sand Mineralogy Within the Bagnold Dunes, Gale Crater, as Observed In Situ and From Orbit	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Curiosity investigated active eolian sands near linear dunes during Phase 2 of the Bagnold Dunes campaign in Gale crater, Mars. Ogunquit Beach, a sample scooped from a large-ripple trough within the Mount Desert Island ripple field and delivered to the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffraction instrument, is dominated by basaltic igneous minerals and X-ray amorphous materials. CheMin mineralogy of the Gobabeb sample acquired at a large-ripple crest on the Namib barchan dune during Phase 1 is similar to Ogunquit Beach. Ogunquit Beach, however, contains more plagioclase and Gobabeb contains more olivine. Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM)-based estimates of mineralogy at the optical surface of Namib Dune and Mount Desert Island demonstrate that surface sands are enriched in olivine and depleted in plagioclase over Mount Desert Island relative to Namib Dune. Differences between CheMin-derived and CRISM-derived mineralogies suggest sorting by grain size on bedform to dune field scales. Crystal chemistry from CheMin suggests contributions from multiple igneous sources and the local bedrock. Plain Language Summary Remote sensing data from orbit indicate that wind-blown sands in the Bagnold Dune Field in Gale crater, Mars, are sorted by their composition. The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover studied the Bagnold Dune Field at two locations to investigate the chemical and mineral composition of the sands and why they are sorted across the dune field. Data from Curiosity show distinct differences between the minerals in the upwind portion of the dune field compared to the downwind portion, but these differences are not the same as those observed from orbit. The scale and location of the sampling by Curiosity compared to orbiters explains the discrepancy between the two techniques. Results from both techniques suggest subtle differences in mineralogy within a single dune and across the dune field that can be explained by sorting from wind and contribution from the erosion of local bedrock.

Current C-nutrient models exhibit large uncertainties in their estimates of pool sizes, fluxes, and turnover rates of nutrients, due to a lack of consistent global data for evaluating the models. In this study, we present a new model-data fusion framework called the Global Observation-based Land-ecosystems Utilization Model of Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus (GOLUM-CNP) that combines the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework (CAR-AMOM) data-constrained C-cycle analysis with spatially explicit data-driven estimates of N and P inputs and losses and with observed stoichiometric ratios. We calculated the steady-state N- and P-pool sizes and fluxes globally for large biomes. Our study showed that new N inputs from biological fixation and deposition supplied >20% of total plant uptake in most forest ecosystems but accounted for smaller fractions in boreal forests and grasslands. New P inputs from atmospheric deposition and rock weathering supplied a much smaller fraction of total plant uptake than new N inputs, indicating the importance of internal P recycling within ecosystems to support plant growth. Nutrient-use efficiency, defined as the ratio of gross primary production (GPP) to plant nutrient uptake, were diagnosed from our model results and compared between biomes. Tropical forests had the lowest N-use efficiency and the highest P-use efficiency of the forest biomes. An analysis of sensitivity and uncertainty indicated that the NPP-allocation fractions to leaves, roots, and wood contributed the most to the uncertainties in the estimates of nutrient-use efficiencies. Correcting for biases in NPP-allocation fractions produced more plausible gradients of N- and P-use efficiencies from tropical to boreal ecosystems and highlighted the critical role of accurate measurements of C allocation for understanding the N and P cycles.

This has been shown to bias simulations of radiation and circulation in the Pacific present-day mean state. Here we explore how precipitating ice radiative effects contribute to simulated Pacific climate change via a pair of sensitivity experiments with and without snow radiative effects (SnowOn/SnowOff) using 1pctCO(2) simulations of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) climate model, in which atmospheric CO2 increases at 1% per year for 140 years. In addition, we compare our results with the CMIP5 ensemble mean. The initial climate state of each 1pctCO(2) run shows similar patterns to present-day simulations. Under global warming, the regions of convective activity tend to intensify and shift eastward. These changes are stronger in the SnowOn simulation, which also displays a stronger zonal gradient of sea surface temperature warming relative to SnowOff. The changes in convective activity and the associated precipitation are particularly notable: with reduced precipitation around the maritime continent, and an approximate doubling of the precipitation increase over parts of the western Pacific in SnowOn. CESM1 SnowOff patterns of change are similar to those in CMIP5 models that exclude snow radiative effects, hinting that future warming-driven changes in precipitation and circulation over the Pacific might be stronger than those simulated by most CMIP5 models.

Resolving faint structures in the debris disk around TWA 7 Tentative detections of an outer belt, a spiral arm, and a dusty cloud	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Debris disks are the intrinsic by-products of the star and planet formation processes. Most likely due to instrumental limitations and their natural faintness, little is known about debris disks around low mass stars, especially when it comes to spatially resolved observations. Aims. We present new VLT/SPHERE IRDIS dual-polarization imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust ring around the M2 spectral type star TWA 7. Combined with additional angular differential imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the debris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. Methods. We modeled the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust grains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using the results inferred from the observations, and performed simple N-body simulations. Results. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at similar to 0.72 '' (25 au), with a very shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of similar to 13 degrees with a position angle of similar to 91 degrees east of north. We also report low signal-to-noise ratio detections of an outer belt at a distance of similar to 1.5 '' (similar to 52 au) from the star, of a spiral arm in the southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty clump at 0.11 ''. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a year. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close vicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper limits. We find that the SED is best reproduced with an inner disk at similar to 0.2 '' (similar to 7 au) and another belt at 0.72 '' (25 au). Conclusions. We report the detections of several unexpected features in the disk around TWA 7. A yet undetected 100 M-circle plus planet with a semi-major axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as the spiral arm. We conclude that stellar winds are unlikely to be responsible for the spiral arm.

Detection of velocity dispersion from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Using the Planck full-mission data, we present a detection of the temperature (and therefore velocity) dispersion due to the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect from clusters of galaxies. To suppress the primary CMB and instrumental noise we derive a matched filter and then convolve it with the Planck foreground-cleaned "2D- ILC" maps. By using the Meta Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC), we determine the normalized rms dispersion of the temperature fluctuations at the positions of clusters, finding that this shows excess variance compared with the noise expectation. We then build an unbiased statistical estimator of the signal, determining that the normalized mean temperature dispersion of 1526 clusters is <(Delta T/T)(2))> = (1.64 +/- 0.48) x 10(-11). However, comparison with analytic calculations and simulations suggest that around 0.7 sigma of this result is due to cluster lensing rather than the kSZ effect. By correcting this, the temperature dispersion is measured to be <(Delta T/T)(2))> = (1.35 +/- 0.48) x 10(-11), which gives a detection at the 2.8 sigma level. We further convert uniform-weight temperature dispersion into a measurement of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, by using estimates of the optical depth of each cluster (which introduces additional uncertainty into the estimate). We find that the velocity dispersion is (v(2)) = (123 000 +/- 71 000) (km s(-1))(2), which is consistent with findings from other large-scale structure studies, and provides direct evidence of statistical homogeneity on scales of 600 h(-1) Mpc. Our study shows the promise of using cross-correlations of the kSZ effect with large-scale structure in order to constrain the growth of structure.

We quantify changes of the convective cloud ice mass-weighted altitude centroid (ZIWC) as a function of aerosol optical thickness (AOT). Analyses are conducted in smoke, dust and polluted continental aerosol environments over South America, Central Africa and Southeast Asia, using the latest measurements from the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites. We find aerosols can inhibit or invigorate convection, depending on aerosol type and concentration. On average, smoke tends to suppress convection and results in lower ZIWC than clean clouds. Polluted continental aerosol tends to invigorate convection and promote higher ZIWC. The dust aerosol effects are regionally dependent and their signs differ from place to place. Moreover, we find that the aerosol inhibition or invigoration effects do not vary monotonically with AOT and the variations depend strongly on aerosol type. Our observational findings indicate that aerosol type is one of the key factors in determining the aerosol effects on convective clouds.

Observations of organic and inorganic chlorinated compounds and their contribution to chlorine radical concentrations in an urban environment in northern Europe during the wintertime	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A number of inorganic (nitryl chloride, ClNO2; chlorine, Cl-2; and hypochlorous acid, HOCl) and chlorinated, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (ClOVOCs) have been measured in Manchester, UK during October and November 2014 using time-of-flight chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (ToF-CIMS) with the I- reagent ion. ClOVOCs appear to be mostly photochemical in origin, although direct emission from vehicles is also suggested. Peak concentrations of ClNO2, Cl(2 )and HOCl reach 506, 16 and 9 ppt respectively. The concentrations of ClNO2 are comparable to measurements made in London, but measurements of ClOVOCs, Cl-2 and HOC1 by this method are the first reported in the UK. Maximum HOCl and Cl-2 concentrations are found during the day and ClNO2 concentrations remain elevated into the afternoon if photolysis rates are low. Cl-2 exhibits a strong dependency on shortwave radiation, further adding to the growing body of evidence that it is a product of secondary chemistry. However, night-time emission is also observed. The contribution of ClNO2, Cl-2 and ClOVOCs to the chlorine radical budget suggests that Cl-2 can be a greater source of Cl than ClNO2, contributing 74 % of the Cl radicals produced on a high radiant-flux day. In contrast, on a low radiant-flux day, this drops to 14 %, as both Cl-2 production and loss pathways are inhibited by reduced photolysis rates. This results in ClNO2 making up the dominant fraction (83 %) on low radiant-flux days, as its concentrations are still high. As most ClOVOCs appear to be formed photochemically, they exhibit a similar dependence on photolysis, contributing 3 % of the Cl radical budget observed here.

Polarization engineered N-polar Cs-free GaN photocathodes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS												We report on holistic and systemic approach of development of Cs-free GaN photocathode structures which utilize polarization band engineering in order to allow for air stable operation and eliminate the need for cesium-based surface treatments. Physics-based simulation of band structure and Monte Carlo simulation of electron transport and emission were used to guide experimental development of photocathode structures. By using an N-polar device, the polarization charge allows for the creation of large surface band bending without the need for delta-doped capping layers. The insertion of a thin AlN interlayer allows for the creation of a quasi-band offset and additional beneficial polarization charge to create a desirable band profile. Samples of both polarities were grown and subjected to chemical surface treatments in order to account for differences in native oxide formation on Ga- and N-polar surfaces. Measured photoemission spectra show quantum efficiencies as high as 23% for a HCl-treated Cs-free N-polar photocathode, which is comparable to cesiated devices. Published by AIP Publishing.

The nature of molecular cloud boundary layers from SOFIA [O I] observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Dense highly ionized boundary layers (IBLs) outside of the neutral Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs) have recently been detected via the 122 and 205 mu m transitions of ionized nitrogen. These layers have higher densities than in the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM) but less than typically found in H II regions. Observations of [C II] emission, which is produced in both the PDR and IBL, do not fully define the characteristics of these sources. Observations of additional probes which just trace the PDRs, such as the fine structure lines of atomic oxygen, are needed derive their properties and distinguish among different models for [C II] and [N II] emissison. Aims. We derive the properties of the PDRs adjacent to dense highly ionized boundary layers of molecular clouds. Methods. We combine high-spectral resolution observations of the 63 mu m [O I] fine structure line taken with the upGREAT HFA-band instrument on SOFIA with [C II] observations to constrain the physical conditions in the PDRs. The observations consist of samples along four lines of sight (LOS) towards the inner Galaxy containing several dense molecular clouds. We interpret the conditions in the PDRs using radiative transfer models for [C II] and [O I]. Results. We have a 3.5-sigma detection of [O I] toward one source but only upper limits towards the others. We use the [O I] to [C II] ratio, or their upper limits, and the column density of C+ to estimate the thermal pressure, Pth, in these PDRs. In two LOS the thermal pressure is likely in the range 2-5 x 10(5) in units of Kcm(-3), with kinetic temperatures of order 75-100K and H-2 densities, n(H-2) similar to 2-4 x 10(-3) cm(-3). For the other two sources, where the upper limits on [O I] to [C II] are larger, Pth less than or similar to 10(5) (K cm(-3)). We have also used PDR models that predict the [O I] to [C II] ratio, along with our observations of this ratio, to limit the intensity of the Far UV radiation field. Conclusions. The [C II] and [N II] emission with either weak, or without any, evidence of [O I] indicates that the source of dense highly ionized gas traced by [N II] most likely arises from the ionized boundary layers of clouds rather than from H II regions.

Dust in galaxy clusters: Modeling at millimeter wavelengths and impact on Planck cluster cosmology	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												We have examined dust emission in galaxy clusters at millimeter wavelengths using the Planck 857 GHz map to constrain the model based on Herschel observations that was used in studies for the Cosmic ORigins Explorer (CORE) mission concept. By stacking the emission from Planck-detected clusters, we estimated the normalization of the infrared luminosity versus mass relation and constrained the spatial profile of the dust emission. We used this newly constrained model to simulate clusters that we inject into Planck frequency maps. The comparison between clusters extracted using these gas+dust simulations and the basic gas-only simulations allows us to assess the impact of cluster dust emission on Planck results. In particular, we determined the impact on cluster parameter recovery (size, flux) and on Planck cluster cosmology results (survey completeness, determination of cosmological parameters). We show that dust emission has a negligible effect on the recovery of individual cluster parameters for the Planck mission, but that it impacts the cluster catalog completeness, reducing the number of detections in the redshift range [0.3-0.8] by up to similar to 9%. Correcting for this incompleteness in the cosmological analysis has a negligible effect on cosmological parameter measurements: in particular, it does not ease the tension between Planck cluster and primary cosmic microwave background cosmologies.

KNITNet Collaboration; UKIRT Microlensing Team	KMT-2016-BLG-2052L: Microlensing Binary Composed of M Dwarfs Revealed from a Very Long Timescale Event	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present the analysis of a binary microlensing event, KMT-2016-BLG-2052, for which the lensing-induced brightening of the source star lasted for two seasons. We determine the lens mass from the combined measurements of the microlens parallax, pi(E), and angular Einstein radius, theta(E). The measured mass indicates that the lens is a binary composed of M dwarfs with masses of M-1 similar to 0.34 M-circle dot and M-2 similar to 0.17 M-circle dot. The measured relative lens-source proper motion of mu similar to 3.9 mas yr(-1) is smaller than similar to 5 mas yr(-1) of typical Galactic lensing events, while the estimated angular Einstein radius of theta(E) similar to 1.2 mas is substantially greater than the typical value of similar to 0.5 mas. Therefore, it turns out that the long timescale of the event is caused by the combination of the slow mu and large theta(E) rather than the heavy mass of the lens. From the simulation of Galactic lensing events with very long timescales (t(E) greater than or similar to 100 days), we find that the probabilities that long timescale events are produced by lenses with masses >= 1.0 M-circle dot and >= 3.0 M-circle dot are similar to 19% and 2.6%, respectively, indicating that events produced by heavy lenses comprise a minor fraction of long timescale events. The results indicate that it is essential to determine lens masses by measuring both pi(E) and theta(E) in order to firmly identify heavy stellar remnants, such as neutron stars and black holes.

Elemental Composition at the Cosmic-Ray Source Derived from the ACE-CRIS Instrument. I. C-6 to Ni-28	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We report new elemental source abundances from C-6 to Ni-28 for galactic cosmic rays, using observations from the Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS) on board the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft. Abundances were calculated using CRIS energy spectra at energies below 550 MeV/ nucleon from the 1997-98 and 2009-10 solar-minimum periods, as well as from the 2001-03 solar-maximum period. These new results, when combined with results for heavier elements reported in a forthcoming paper, are consistent with a model of galactic cosmic-ray origin where nuclei found in interstellar grains are accelerated preferentially over those found in interstellar gas, with this acceleration happening in OB associations.

The Hidden Depths of Planetary Atmospheres	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Atmospheric regions below a refractive boundary are hidden in limb observations. Refraction thus creates a gray continuum in the planet's transmission spectrum, which can hide spectral features associated with sources of atmospheric opacity. We combine refractive theory with recent analytical advances describing the effects of surfaces and clouds on transmission spectra, to express the location of this boundary in atmospheric opacity space, for both atomic and molecular extinction, as well as collision-induced absorption. This allows one to quickly estimate how refraction affects spectral features in well-mixed atmospheres. We show that differences in the geometry of limb observations between solar system planets and exoplanets lead to different locations of this boundary, and that more than four extra scale heights of atmosphere are hidden in exoplanet transits compared to solar system observations of cold gas giants. We explore how the location of this refractive boundary in exoplanet transits changes in a well-mixed isothermal atmosphere with its temperature and composition, the spectral type of the planet's host star, and the size of the planet. We demonstrate that five extra scale heights of atmosphere are hidden in a terrestrial planet with a CO2 atmosphere compared to a helium atmosphere, resulting in a flatter spectrum than from its smaller scale height alone. We provide results for a few exoplanets, notably those in the TRAPPIST-1 system, to help the scientific community estimate the impact of refraction on the size of spectral features without radiative transfer calculations, and thus help refine planned James Web Space Telescope observations.

Coupling of better measurements of the mass (M-p) and radius of exoplanets with planet structure models enables estimating the total heavy-element mass (M-Z) in these planets. The corresponding relation is characterized by a power-law profile, M-Z proportional to M-p(3/5). We develop a simplified but physically motivated analysis to investigate how the power-law profile can be produced under the current picture of planet formation. Making use of the existing semi-analytical formulae of accretion rates of pebbles and planetesimals, our analysis shows that the relation can be reproduced well if it traces the final stage of planet formation. In the stage, planets accrete solids from gapped planetesimal disks, and gas accretion is limited by disk evolution. We find that dust accretion accompanying gas accretion does not contribute to M-Z for planets with M-p < 10(3) M-circle plus. Our findings are broadly consistent with those of previous studies, yet we explicitly demonstrate how planetesimal dynamics is crucial for better understanding the relation. While our approach is simple, we can reproduce the trend of a correlation between planet metallicity and M-p that is obtained by detailed population synthesis calculations when the same assumption is adopted. Our analysis suggests that pebble accretion would not play a direct role at the final stage of planet formation, whereas radial drift of pebbles might be important indirectly for metal enrichment of planets. Detailed numerical simulations and more observational data are required for confirming our analysis.

A total of 6 years of collocated ground-based PM10 and satellite-based (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM) radar data, along with ERA-Interim reanalysis, are used in this study to investigate the aerosol effects on three localized rain regimes (shallow, stratiform, and convective rain) over the Pearl River Delta region of China. A subjective analysis method is proposed to discriminate between the localized and synoptic-scale precipitations based on weather composite charts where daily averaged wind field at 850 hPa is overlaid with the geopotential height at 500 hPa. In general, average rain rate tends to be greater under polluted conditions than under clean conditions. But such potential aerosol effects are regime dependent: as the atmosphere becomes slightly polluted (PM10 similar to 38 mu gm(3)), the top 1% radar reflectivity (Z) for all regimes initially increases, followed by continued increases and weak decreases for convective and stratiform/shallow rain regimes, respectively. As the atmosphere becomes much more polluted, such regime dependences of aerosol effects are more significant. From a perspective of the vertical Z structure, comparisons between polluted conditions (days with the highest third of PM10 concentration) and clean conditions (days with the lowest third of PM10 concentration) show that the convective rain regime exhibits a deeper and stronger Z pattern, whereas a much shallower and weaker Z pattern is observed for stratiform and shallow precipitation regimes. In particular, the top height of the 30 dBZ rain echo increases by similar to 29% (similar to 1 : 27 km) for the convective regime, but decreases by similar to 10 : 8%(similar to 0 : 47 km) for the stratiform regime. However, no noticeable changes are observed for the shallow precipitation regime. Impacts of meteorological factors are further studied on both rain top height (RTH) and the center of gravity of Z, including vertical velocity, vertical wind shear, convection available potential energy, and vertically integrated moisture flux divergence (MFD). The possible invigoration effect on convective precipitation seems dependent on wind shear, in good agreement with previous findings. Overall, the observed dependence of the precipitation vertical structure on ground-based PM10 supports the notion of aerosol invigoration or suppression effect on cold or warm rain and adds new insights into the nature of the complex interactions between aerosol and various localized precipitation regimes.

Thus far, the MSL data have revealed a baseline level of CH4 (approximate to 0.4 parts per billion by volume [ppbv]), with seasonal variations, as well as greatly enhanced spikes of CH4 with peak abundances of approximate to 7ppbv. What do these CH4 revelations with drastically different abundances and temporal signatures represent in terms of interior geochemical processes, or is martian CH4 a biosignature? Discerning how CH4 generation occurs on Mars may shed light on the potential habitability of Mars. There is no evidence of life on the surface of Mars today, but microbes might reside beneath the surface. In this case, the carbon flux represented by CH4 would serve as a link between a putative subterranean biosphere on Mars and what we can measure above the surface. Alternatively, CH4 records modern geochemical activity. Here we ask the fundamental question: how active is Mars, geochemically and/or biologically? In this article, we examine geological, geochemical, and biogeochemical processes related to our overarching question. The martian atmosphere and surface are an overwhelmingly oxidizing environment, and life requires pairing of electron donors and electron acceptors, that is, redox gradients, as an essential source of energy. Therefore, a fundamental and critical question regarding the possibility of life on Mars is, Where can we find redox gradients as energy sources for life on Mars? Hence, regardless of the pathway that generates CH4 on Mars, the presence of CH4, a reduced species in an oxidant-rich environment, suggests the possibility of redox gradients supporting life and habitability on Mars. Recent missions such as ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter may provide mapping of the global distribution of CH4. To discriminate between abiotic and biotic sources of CH4 on Mars, future studies should use a series of diagnostic geochemical analyses, preferably performed below the ground or at the ground/atmosphere interface, including measurements of CH4 isotopes, methane/ethane ratios, H-2 gas concentration, and species such as acetic acid. Advances in the fields of Mars exploration and instrumentation will be driven, augmented, and supported by an improved understanding of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, deep subsurface biogeochemistry, astrobiology, planetary geology, and geophysics. Future Mars exploration programs will have to expand the integration of complementary areas of expertise to generate synergistic and innovative ideas to realize breakthroughs in advancing our understanding of the potential of life and habitable conditions having existed on Mars. In this spirit, we conducted a set of interdisciplinary workshops. From this series has emerged a vision of technological, theoretical, and methodological innovations to explore the martian subsurface and to enhance spatial tracking of key volatiles, such as CH4.

The GNOR model is a recent generalization and an extension of the hydrodynamic Drude model (HDM), which goes beyond HDM by taking into account both the convection current and electron diffusion in the MNPs. It allows unified theoretical explanation of some experimentally observed plasmonic phenomena which otherwise would require ab initio analysis as the conventional local response approximation (LRA) fails to account for them. For example, it has been demonstrated in literature that the GNOR model captures size dependent resonance shifts of small MNPs which are unrevealed by the conventional LRA based methods, and it has proven to yield results displaying better agreement with the experimental observations for plasmonic experiments. Attempts to incorporate MNP nonlocal effects in the analytical characterization of vicinal excitons found in literature utilize the phenomenological hydrodynamic model and assume the absence of MNP interband effects. Moreover, they are only applicable to narrow parameter regions. In this paper we present a complete analytical characterization which overcomes these drawbacks and lends to the perusal of the system over wide continua of various parameters, enabling us to get an elevated view at a much lesser level of complexity compared to the conventional LRA based numerical methods or the conventional ab initio methods of accounting for the nonlocal effects. Our proposed GNOR based model predicts strong modifications to various QD properties such as population difference, absorption, MNP induced shifts to excitonic energy and Forster enhanced broadening, coherent plasmonic field enhancement, and quantum state purity, compared to the conventional LRA based predictions. Such modifications are prominent with small MNP radii, high QD dipole moments, small detunings (of the coherent external illumination from the bare excitonic resonance), and near parameter regions exhibiting plasmonic meta resonance (PMR)-like behavior. Moreover, our complete analytical characterization enables optimization of the large system parameter space for different applications, a luxury not fully offered by the methods currently available in literature.

Characterization of low-mass companion HD 142527 B	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. The circumstellar disk of the Herbig Fe star HD 142527 is host to several remarkable features including a warped inner disk, a 120 au-wide annular gap, a prominent dust trap and several spiral arms. A low-mass companion, HD 142527 B, was also found orbiting the primary star at similar to 14 au. Aims. This study aims to better characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the peculiar geometry of the disk. Method. We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in H + K band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several algorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI). Results. HD 142527 B is conspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to extract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within 0 ''.1 from its central star. Fitting our spectrum with both template and synthetic spectra suggests that the companion is a young M2.5 +/- 1.0 star with an effective temperature of 3500 +/- 100 K, possibly surrounded with a hot (1700 K) circum-secondary environment. Pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks provide a mass estimate of 0.34 +/- 0.06 M-circle dot, independent of the presence of a hot environment. However, the estimated stellar radius and age do depend on that assumption; we find a radius of 1.37 +/- 0.05 R-circle dot (resp. 1.96 +/- 0.10 R-circle dot) and an age of 1.8(-0.5)(+1.2) Myr (resp. 0.75 +/- 0.25 Myr) in the case of the presence (resp. absence) of a hot environment contributing in H + K. Our new values for the mass and radius of the companion yield a mass accretion rate of 4.1-5.8 x 10(-9) M-circle dot yr(-1) (2-3% that of the primary). Conclusions. We have constrained the physical properties of HD 142527 B, thereby illustrating the potential for SINFONI+ADI to characterize faint close-in companions. The new spectral type makes HD 142527 B a twin of the well-known TW Hya T Tauri star, and the revision of its mass to higher values further supports its role in shaping the disk.

This study presents a new methodology to retrieve instantaneous precipitation rate over land by using TB temporal variation (TB) at 19GHz, which primarily reflects the surface emissivity variation due to the precipitation impact. As a proof-of-concept, we exploit observations from five polar-orbiting satellites over the Southern Great Plains of the United States. Results show that TB at 19GHz correlate well with the instantaneous precipitation rate. Further analysis shows that TB at 19GHz is better correlated with the precipitation rate when multiple satellite observations are used due to the much shorter revisit time for a certain location. The retrieved instantaneous precipitation rate over Southern Great Plains from TB at 19GHz reasonably agrees with the surface radar observations, with the correlation, the root-mean-square error and the bias being 0.49, 2.39mm/hr, and 6.54%, respectively. Future work seeks to combine the ice scattering signal at high frequencies and this surface emissivity variation signal at low frequencies to achieve an optimal retrieval performance. Plain Language Summary Current precipitation estimation technique via satellite passive microwave observations links the hydrometers in the air to the surface precipitation intensity. That is, the cold brightness temperature (TB) at high-frequency channels (e.g., 85GHz) indicates heavy precipitation. The TB observations from low-frequency channels such as 19GHz are largely discounted. This study presents a new idea to link the surface condition variation to the precipitation intensity, by using TB temporal variation (TB) at 19GHz from five polar-orbiting satellites. Results show that TB at 19GHz correlate well with the precipitation rate. The estimated instantaneous precipitation rate over the Southern Great Plains of United States from TB at 19GHz reasonably agrees with the ground radar observations, with the correlation, the root-mean-square error, and the bias at 0.49, 2.39mm/hr, and 6.54%, respectively.

The Seasonal Cycle of the South Indian Ocean Subtropical Gyre Circulation as Revealed by Argo and Satellite Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The seasonal variability in volume transport of the South Indian Ocean subtropical gyre is characterized for the first time. Only three complete hydrographic crossings of the gyre have been conducted over a 22-year period, with an upcoming repeat in 2019. Changes to geostrophic transport and thermocline properties imply a strengthening of the gyre from 1987 to 2002. However, some of this strengthening could result from aliasing of seasonal variability. We use data from Argo, satellite altimetry, and an Agulhas Current transport proxy at 34S to quantify the seasonal variability of the upper 2,000-m volume transport. A semiannual cycle is revealed, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 6.43.1Sv(1Sv = 10(6) m(3)s(-1)) and dominated by annual anomalies in quadrature near the eastern and western boundaries. Seasonal aliasing does not account for the observed gyre strengthening. Plain Language Summary To predict climate, we need to understand how the ocean is changing, which requires separating observed changes from variability at shorter time scales. On the basis of only three transoceanic sections, between 1987 and 2009, it was concluded that the circulation of the South Indian Ocean has undergone multidecadal strengthening, but unknown seasonal variability could account for some of this signal. Here we use a decade of data from profiling floats and satellites, together with a new time series of Agulhas Current transport at 34S, to characterize the seasonal variability of the South Indian Ocean circulation for the first time. We find a semiannual cycle, of peak-to-peak amplitude 6.4Sv(1Sv = 10(6) m(3)s(-1)), that is dominated by annual anomalies in quadrature near each boundary. This seasonal variability does not explain the gyre strengthening, which is therefore part of a longer-term change. The observed semiannual cycle corresponds well with mass balance between the Agulhas Current and the Indonesian Throughflow.

The Bagnold Dunes in Southern Summer: Active Sediment Transport on Mars Observed by the Curiosity Rover	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Orbiter-based observations have demonstrated that active aeolian environments are ubiquitous across Mars. Here we examine one such environment, the Bagnold Dune Field in Gale crater, with repeat imaging campaigns conducted from Curiosity during southern summer. Images reveal widespread migration of aeolian impact ripples (up to 2.8 cm/sol), which is in stark contrast to the inactivity of similar bedforms during southern winter. The winds responsible for steady southwestward migration of ripples are consistent with predictions of regional-scale flows that enter the crater from the north and interact with the topography of Mount Sharp but are not fully representative of all dune-forming winds. Inferred friction speeds of 1.5 m/s needed to explain mobilization of bedforms are likely not being achieved, and thus, a majority of sediment transport may be taking place at subthreshold conditions. This hypothesis is further supported by sand flux estimates that suggest a low saltation flux environment within the dune field. Plain Language Summary A wealth of orbital images have revealed that wind is actively moving sand on the surface of Mars; landed instruments enable a closer look at these processes. Images acquired during southern summer by the Curiosity rover in Gale crater revealed high levels of wind activity, in contrast to previous imaging done during southern winter. A majority of ripple migration occurs toward the southwest, with ripples moving up to 2.8 cm per day. These findings are consistent with models that predict southern summer to be the windiest season at this location on Mars, with strong regional winds flowing over the northern crater rim and causing strong southwestward flow along the floor of the crater in the vicinity of the rover. Despite the fact that bedforms are active, models do not predict that the wind should be strong enough to initiate motion, which challenges our understanding of the physics of sediment transport under Martian conditions.

Potential basin-scale estimates of Arctic snow depth with sea ice freeboards from CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2: An exploratory analysis	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												The potential of deriving snow depth estimates using differences in freeboard heights from CryoSat-2 (CS-2) and ICESat-2 (IS-2) is examined. In our analysis, we use lidar freeboard from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) on Operation IceBridge (OIB) as proxy of IS-2 total (snow + ice) freeboard. Snow depths are estimates from the OIB snow radar. Differences in height between the total (ATM) and ice (CS-2) freeboards are related to snow depth by the refractive index of the snow layer (eta(s)), which is dependent on snow density. For two years (2014 and 2015), regression of the ATM and CS-2 freeboard differences against OIB snow depth gives correlations of similar to 0.80, estimated eta(s) of similar to 1.21, and standard errors of similar to 8 cm. The resulting refractive index, eta(s), can be compared to that expected of the Arctic snow cover in early spring (1.25 +/- 0.05). The expected biases and variability in the regression analysis are discussed. Results suggest that snow depth can be estimated from the freeboard differences. The benefits of adjusting the orbit of CS-2 for providing more optimized overlaps between IS-2 and CS-2 are considered. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Strain budget of the Ecuador-Colombia subduction zone: A stochastic view	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The 2016 Pedernales earthquake (M-W = 7.8) ruptured a portion of the Colombia-Ecuador subduction interface where several large historical earthquakes have been documented since the great 1906 earthquake (M = 8.6). Considering all significant ruptures that occurred in the region, it has been suggested that the cumulative moment generated co-seismically along this part of the subduction over the last century exceeds the moment deficit accumulated inter-seismically since 1906. Such an excess challenges simple models with earthquakes resetting the elastic strain accumulated inter-seismically in locked asperities. These inferences are however associated with large uncertainties that are generally unknown. The impact of spatial smoothing constraints on co-seismic and inter-seismic models also prevents any robust assessment of the strain budget. We propose a Bayesian kinematic slip model of the 2016 Pedernales earthquake using the most comprehensive dataset to date including InSAR and GPS offsets, tsunami waveforms, and kinematic records from high-rate GPS and strong-motions. In addition, we use inter-seismic geodetic velocities to produce a probabilistic inter-seismic coupling model of the subduction interface. Our stochastic co-seismic and inter-seismic solutions include the ensemble of all plausible models consistent with our prior information and that fit the observations within uncertainties. The analysis of these model ensembles indicates that an excess of co-seismic moment during the 1906-2016 period is likely in Central Ecuador only if we assume that 1942 and 2016 earthquakes are colocated. If this assumption is relaxed, we show that this conclusion no longer holds given uncertainties in co- and inter-seismic processes. The comparison of 1942 and 2016 teleseismic records reveals large uncertainties in the location of the 1942 event, hampering our ability to draw strong conclusions on the unbalanced moment budget in the region. Our results also show a heterogeneous coupling of the subduction interface that coincides with two slip asperities in our co-seismic model for the 2016 Pedernales earthquake and with the location of historical ruptures in 1958, 1979 and 1998. The spatial variability in coupling and complexity in earthquake history suggest strong heterogeneities in frictional properties of the subduction megathrust. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Concurrent ultraviolet and infrared observations of the north Jovian aurora during Juno's first perijove	ICARUS												The UltraViolet Spectrograph (UVS) and the Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) observed the north polar aurora before the first perijove of the Juno orbit (PJ1) on 27 August 2016. The UVS bandpass corresponds to the H-2 Lyman and Werner bands that are directly excited by collisions of auroral electrons with molecular hydrogen. The spectral window of the JIRAM L-band imager includes some of the brightest H-3(+) thermal features between 3.3 and 3.6 mu m. A series of spatial scans obtained with JIRAM every 30 s is used to build up five quasi-global images, each covering similar to 12 min. of observations. JIRAM's best spatial resolution was on the order of 50 km/pixel during this time frame, while UVS has a resolution of about 750 km. Most of the observed large-scale auroral features are similar in the two spectral regions, but important differences are also observed in their morphology and relative intensity. Only a part of the UV-IR differences stems from the higher spatial resolution of JIRAM, as some of them are still present following smoothing of the JIRAM images at the UVS resolution. For example, the JIRAM images show persistent narrow arc structures in the 100 degrees-180 degrees S-III longitude sector at dusk not resolved in the ultraviolet, but consistent with the structure of in situ electron precipitation measured two hours later. The comparison between the H-2 intensity and the H-3(+) radiance measured along two radial cuts from the center of the main emission illustrates the complex relation between the electron energy input, their characteristic energy and the H-3(+) emission. Low values of the H-3(+) intensity relative to the H-2 brightness are observed in regions of high FUV color ratio corresponding to harder electron precipitation. The rapid loss of ELI ions reacting with methane near and below the homopause appears to play a significant role in the control of the relative brightness of the two emissions.

J	Seidel, FC; Stavros, EN; Cable, ML; Green, R; Freeman, A				Seidel, Felix C.; Stavros, E. Natasha; Cable, Morgan L.; Green, Robert; Freeman, Anthony			Imaging spectrometer emulates Landsat: A case study with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing data are most useful if they are available with sufficient precision, accuracy, spatiotemporal and spectral sampling, as well as continuity across decades. The Landsat and Sentinel series, as well other satellites are currently covering significant parts of this observational trade space. It can be expected that growing demands and budget constraints will require new capabilities in orbit that can address as many observables as possible with a single instrument. Recent optical performance improvements of imaging spectrometers make them true alternatives to traditional multispectral imagers. However, they are much more adaptable to a wide range of Earth observation needs due to the combination of continuous high spectral sampling with spatial sampling consistent with previous sensors (e.g., Landsat). Unfortunately, there is a knowledge gap in demonstrating that imaging spectroscopy data can substitute for multi-spectral data while sustaining the long-term record. Thus, the objective of this analysis is to test the hypothesis that imaging spectroscopy data compare radiometrically with multi-spectral data to within 5%. Using a coincident Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight with over-passing Operational Land Imager (OLI) data on Landsat 8, we document a procedure for simulating OLI multi-spectral bands from AVIRIS data, evaluate influencing factors on the observed radiance, and assess the difference in top-of-atmosphere radiance as compared to OLI. The procedure for simulating OLI data include spectral convolution, accounting for the minimal atmospheric effects between the two sensors, and spatial resampling. The remaining differences between the simulated and the real OLI data result mainly from differences in sensor calibration, surface bi-directional reflectance, and spatial sampling. The median relative radiometric difference for each band ranges from - 8.3% to 0.6%. After bias-correction to minimize potential calibration discrepancies, we find no more than a 1.2% relative difference. This analysis therefore successfully demonstrates that imaging spectrometer data can contribute to Landsat-type or other multi-spectral data records. It also shows that cross-calibration from a spectrometer to a radiometer can be easily performed as a result of the imaging spectrometer high spectral sampling and its ability to recreate multi-spectral response functions.

J	Smith, BE; Gardner, A; Schneider, A; Flanner, M				Smith, Benjamin E.; Gardner, Alex; Schneider, Adam; Flanner, Mark			Modeling biases in laser-altimetry measurements caused by scattering of green light in snow	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Laser altimetry offers the potential to monitor ice-sheet elevation changes with millimeter accuracy. While previous missions have used infrared lasers to make these measurements, NASA's upcoming ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite)-2 mission will use a green laser. Because ice absorbs green light very weakly, in the absence of light-absorbing impurities, green photons can scatter off many snow grains before returning to the surface, delaying the return pulse and leading to an apparent downward shift in the snow surface. In this paper, we explore the effects of snow-grain size and impurity content on these measurements, and investigate strategies that might help minimize the biases they introduce. We find that an uninformed choice of measurement parameters (a windowed mean including a large range of photons around the surface) can result in > 0.45 m of apparent surface-height variation between large and small grain sizes. Other choices of measurement parameters, such as a windowed median, can reduce this uncertainty by a factor of two to three. In addition, measurements of surface reflectance at green and infrared wavelengths, and interpretation of return-pulse shapes may be used to estimate and correct for these biases.

Evaluating the effects of surface properties on methane retrievals using a synthetic airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer next generation (AVIRIS-NG) image	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric methane has been increasing since the beginning of the industrial era due to anthropogenic emissions. Methane has many sources, both natural and anthropogenic, and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the contribution of each source to the total methane budget. Thus, remote sensing techniques for monitoring and measuring methane emissions are of increasing interest. Recently, the Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) has proven to be a valuable instrument for quantitative mapping of methane plumes. Despite this success, uncertainties remain regarding the sensitivity of the retrieval algorithms, including the influence of albedo and the impact of surfaces that may cause spurious signals. To explore these sensitivities, we applied the Iterative Maximum a Posterior Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) methane retrieval algorithm to synthetic reflected radiances with variable methane concentrations, albedo, surface cover, and aerosols. This allowed for characterizing retrieval performance, including potential sensitivity to variable surfaces, low albedo surfaces, and surfaces known to cause spurious signals. We found that dark surfaces (below 0.10 mu Wcm(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1) at 2139 nm), such as water and green vegetation, and materials with absorption features in the 2200-2400 nm range caused higher errors in retrieval results. We also found that aerosols have little influence on retrievals in the SWIR. Results from the synthetic scene are consistent with those observed in IMAP-DOAS retrievals for real AVIRIS-NG scenes containing methane plumes from a waste dairy lagoon and coal mine ventilation shafts. Understanding the effect of surface properties on methane retrievals is important given the increased use of AVIRIS-NG to map gas plumes from a diversity of sources over variable landscapes.

Supersaturation on Pluto and elsewhere	ICARUS												The atmosphere of Pluto contains a global thin haze layer, possibly clouds and a variety of gaseous species which may be supersaturated under some conditions. Studies of Pluto climate necessitate a fairly good knowledge of the interactions between gases and aerosols since it has an impact on the vertical profiles of these species and on the fluxes of matter at the planetary scale. In this paper we use the laws of cloud nucleation to evaluate the supersaturation which is needed to trigger condensation. HCN and H2O can supersaturate by factor from several thousand to several billions depending on the type of nucleation which is used. Other species can supersaturate, but with smaller values of saturation. Gaseous species also found as ices at the surface (e.g., CO, N-2, CH4) are of special interest. At a surface temperature of 37 K, they can be supersaturated with S between 1.5 to 2 even if condensation nuclei are available in large number. Such supersaturation factors have an impact on fluxes of these species from the surface to the atmosphere. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Analysis of very-high-resolution Galileo images and implications for resurfacing mechanisms on Europa	ICARUS												The young (<100 Ma) surface of Jupiter's icy satellite Europa raises the key questions: (1) what are the resurfacing mechanisms for creating Europa's young surface, and (2) how have these processes evolved through time? To address these questions we analyze the nine high-resolution frames obtained by the Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI)-eight at 16 m/pixel and one at 8 m/pixel (commonly quoted at the planned 6-12 m/pixel as in Greeley et al., 2000)-during the E12 flyby of Europa in Dec. 1997. This dataset is now two decades old, but it has not been analyzed in detail until this work. Despite the largely different viewing and lighting conditions, we mosaic these high-resolution frames into the 220 m/pixel regional context frame. We then perform geomorphologic mapping of the high-resolution image mosaic and the regional image frame, for comparison, and we also create a structural map of the high-resolution image mosaic. The units in the geomorphologic map are defined by surface texture, landform shape (morphology), dimension, and relative albedo. The structural map units include interpretations from the geomorphologic map units and their interpretation implies potential kinematic processes for the formation of particular structures. Our primary mapping observations include the regular spacing and gentle slopes of the ridge-and-trough terrain, the sharp boundaries and preserved structures of the chaos terrain, and the symmetry but irregular size of double ridges. We then evaluate proposed formation mechanisms for these and other mapped features. The high-resolution images also reveal an abundance of small (<100m) pits, the presence of a newly identified high-albedo smooth material, and potential tectonic fabric, all of which have possible implications for the surface history. The mapping and structural analyses lead to the key finding that local-scale resurfacing mechanisms have transitioned from distributed deformation expressed by the formation of the ridged plains to discrete deformation characterized by the formation of chaos and isolated fractures. This finding is consistent with simultaneous ice-shell thickening and cooling occurring as the ice-shell deformed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We compile and analyze observations from the Keck and Gemini North telescopes between 2001 and 2016, including new and published observations from 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2016. A total of 88 distinct hot spot sites were detected over the 15-year period, 82 of which were detected multiple times, and 24 of which were not detected by Galileo at thermal infrared wavelengths (1-5 mu m). A variety of analytical methods are utilized to investigate the detections of active volcanism as a surface expression of interior heating. Geologic associations of hot spots, including patera type, lava flow type, and proximity to mountainous regions, are made using the USGS-published global geologic map of lo (Williams, 2011). We also provide a summary of outburst-scale events, along with the slightly less bright but more frequent, mini-outbursts described by de Kleer and de Pater (2016a). We investigate the spatial distribution of volcanic activity on lo using nearest neighbor, mean pairwise spacing, and mean latitude statistics with various classification schemes. The analysis confirms previous findings in that the heat dissipation appears to be primarily concentrated in the asthenosphere resulting in a high time-averaged surface heat flux at low latitudes. Our observations show significant spatial deviations do exist from the asthenosphere heat dissipation model while also suggesting a deeper source of magma ascent to be present as well, supporting conclusions from previous analyses of primarily spacecraft data (Veeder et al., 2012; Hamilton, 2013; Davies et al., 2015). From a temporal perspective, there are signs of significant variations in the distribution of global heat flux, as volcanoes undetected, and probably dormant, during the Galileo encounters subsequently erupted and remained active during our observations. We also use the on 3.8-pm radiant intensity timelines of individual hot spots, along with the distribution of extensive lava fields in relation to detected activity, as a means to investigate possible connections between hot spots and short timescale, spatio-temporal variations in the global heat flux distribution. We conclude that while the global heat flux distribution remains relatively constant over decadal timescales, there is evidence that significant deviations do occur potentially as a result of mountain forming processes or triggering mechanisms between eruptions.

Here, we report measurements of Jupiter's radiant energy budget and internal heat based on Cassini multi-instrument observations. Our findings reveal that Jupiter's Bond albedo and internal heat, 0.503 +/- 0.012 and 7.485 +/- 0.160 W m(-2) respectively, are significantly larger than 0.343 +/- 0.032 and 5.444 +/- 0.425 Wm(-2), the previous best estimates. The new results help constrain and improve the current evolutionary theories and models for Jupiter. Furthermore, the significant wavelength dependency of Jupiter's albedo implies that the radiant energy budgets and internal heat of the other giant planets in our solar system should be re-examined. Finally, the data sets of Jupiter's characteristics of reflective solar spectral irradiance provide an observational basis for the models of giant exoplanets.

Detecting the Yarkovsky effect among near-Earth asteroids from astrometric data	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												We present an updated set of near-Earth asteroids with a Yarkovsky-related semimajor axis drift detected from the orbital fit to the astrometry. We find 87 reliable detections after filtering for the signal-to-noise ratio of the Yarkovsky drift estimate and making sure the estimate is compatible with the physical properties of the analysed object. Furthermore, we find a list of 24 marginally significant detections for which future astrometry could result in a Yarkovsky detection. A further outcome of the filtering procedure is a list of detections that we consider spurious because they are either unrealistic or not explicable by the Yarkovsky effect. Among the smallest asteroids of our sample, we determined four detections of solar radiation pressure in addition to the Yarkovsky effect. As the data volume increases in the near future, our goal is to develop methods to generate very long lists of asteroids that have a Yarkovsky effect that is reliably detected and have limited amounts of case by case specific adjustments. Furthermore, we discuss the improvements this work could bring to impact monitoring. In particular, we exhibit two asteroids for which the adoption of a non-gravitational model is needed to make reliable impact predictions.

There is a known similar to 6-year LOD signal suspected to be due to core-mantle coupling. If it is, then the core flow associated with the 6-year LOD signal may also deform the mantle, causing a 6-year signal in the deformation of the Earth's surface. Stacking of Global Positioning System (GPS) data is found to contain a similar to 6-year radial deformation signal. We inverted the deformation signal for the outer core's flow and equivalent angular momentum changes, finding good agreement with the LOD signal in some cases. These results support the idea of subdecadal core-mantle coupling, but are not robust. Interpretation of the results must also take into account methodological limitations. Gravitational field changes resulting from solid Earth deformation were also computed and found to be smaller than the errors in the currently available data.

Discovery of a planetary-mass companion within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Young circumstellar disks are the birthplaces of planets. Their study is of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features. Aims. In this context, the transition disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of an embedded young planet and search for disk structures that may be the result of disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary processes. Methods. We analyse new and archival near-infrared images of the transition disk PDS 70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo, and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential imaging and angular differential imaging modes. Results. We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas (similar to 22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. The luminosity of the detected object is consistent with that of an L-type dwarf, but its IR colours are redder, possibly indicating the presence of warm surrounding material. Further, we confirm the detection of a large gap of similar to 54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than similar to 17 au in radius, and its position angle is consistent with that of the outer disk. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness distribution which is different at different wavelengths and may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains. Conclusions. The detection of a young protoplanet within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 opens the door to a so far observationally unexplored parameter space of planetary formation and evolution. Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and continuing astrometry will allow us to test theoretical predictions regarding planet-disk interactions, planetary atmospheres, and evolutionary models.

The aims of this work are to test the feasibility of observing dust polarization at frequencies lower than 50 GHz, which is the optically thinner part of the modified black body spectrum, and to clarify whether or not the polarization mechanism is identical or similar to that for (sub) millimeter observations. Methods. We performed the new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) full polarization observations at 40-48 GHz (6.3-7.5 mm) towards the nearby (d = 147 +/- 3.4 pc) Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) IRAS 16293-2422, and compared these with the previous Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations. We observed the quasar J1407+2827, which is weakly polarized and can be used as a leakage term calibrator for <9 GHz observations, to gauge the potential residual polarization leakage after calibration. Results. We did not detect Stokes Q, U, and V intensities from the observations of J1407+2827, and constrain (3 sigma) the residual polarization leakage after calibration to be less than or similar to 0.3%. Limited by thermal noise, we only detected linear polarization from one of the two binary components of our target source, IRAS 16293-2422 B. The measured polarization percentages range from less than one percent to a few tens of percent. The derived polarization position angles from our observations are in excellent agreement with those detected from the previous observations of the SMA, implying that on the spatial scale we are probing (similar to 50-1000 au), the physical mechanisms for polarizing the continuum emission do not vary significantly over the wavelength range of similar to 0.88-7.5 mm. Conclusions. We hypothesize that the observed polarization position angles trace the magnetic field, which converges from large scale to an approximately face-on rotating accretion flow. In this scenario, magnetic field is predominantly poloidal on >100 au scales, and becomes toroidal on smaller scales. However, this interpretation remains uncertain due to the high dust optical depths at the central region of IRAS 16293-2422 B and the uncertain temperature profile. We suggest that dust polarization at wavelengths comparable or longer than 7 mm may still trace interstellar magnetic field. Future sensitive observations of dust polarization in the fully optically thin regime will have paramount importance for unambiguously resolving the magnetic field configuration.

J	Heinrich, C; Hu, W				Heinrich, Chen; Hu, Wayne			Does Planck 2015 polarization data favor high redshift reionization?	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We study the relationship between signatures of high redshift ionization in large-angle CMB polarization power spectra and features in the Planck 2015 data. Using a principal component (PC) ionization basis that is complete to the cosmic variance limit out to z(max) = 30, 40, 50, we find a robust > 95% CL preference for ionization at z > 15 with no preference for z > 40. This robustness originates from the l similar to 10 region of the data which show high power relative to l <= 8 and result in a poor fit to a steplike model of reionization. Instead, by allowing for high redshift reionization, the PCs provide a better fit by 2 Delta ln L = 5-6. Due to a degeneracy in the ionization redshift response, this improved fit is due to a single aspect of the model: the ability to accommodate z > 10 component to the ionization as we illustrate with a two-step reionization model. For this and other models that accommodate such a component, its presence is allowed and even favored; for models that do not, their poor fit reflects statistical or systematic fluctuations. These possibilities produce very different and testable predictions at l similar to 15-20, as well as small but detectable differences at l > 30 that can further restrict the high redshift limit of reionization.

Here, we report simultaneous measurements of N2O5 and a suite of inorganic halogens including ClNO2 and reactions of chloride with volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) in the gas and particle phases utilising the Filter Inlet for Gas and AEROsols time-of-flight chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-ToF-CIMS) during an intensive measurement campaign 40 km northwest of Beijing in May and June 2016. A maximum mixing ratio of 2900 ppt of ClNO2 was observed with a mean campaign nighttime mixing ratio of 487 ppt, appearing to have an anthropogenic source supported by correlation with SO2, CO and benzene, which often persisted at high levels after sunrise until midday. This was attributed to such high mixing ratios persisting after numerous e-folding times of the photolytic lifetime enabling the chlorine atom production to reach 2.3 x 10(5) molecules cm(-3) from ClNO2 alone, peaking at 09:30 LT and up to 8.4 x 10(5) molecules cm(-3) when including the supporting inorganic halogen measurements. Cl-VOCs were observed in the particle and gas phases for the first time at high time resolution and illustrate how the iodide ToF-CIMS can detect unique markers of chlorine atom chemistry in ambient air from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. Their presence and abundance can be explained via time series of their measured and steady-state calculated precursors, enabling the assessment of competing OH and chlorine atom oxidation via measurements of products from both of these mechanisms and their relative contribution to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation.

The unusually warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event aligned with a disrupted Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) caused an unprecedented perturbation to this circulation in 2015-2016. Here, we quantify the impact of the alignment of these two phenomena in 2015-2016 on lower stratospheric water vapor and ozone from satellite observations. We show that the warm ENSO event substantially increased water vapor and decreased ozone in the tropical lower stratosphere. The QBO disruption significantly decreased global lower stratospheric water vapor and tropical ozone from early spring to late autumn. Thus, this QBO disruption reversed the lower stratosphere moistening triggered by the alignment of the warm ENSO event with westerly QBO in early boreal winter. Our results suggest that the interplay of ENSO events and QBO phases will be crucial for the distributions of radiatively active trace gases in a changing future climate, when increasing El Nino-like conditions and a decreasing lower stratospheric QBO amplitude are expected.

This article presents the WIP recommendations for the global data infrastructure needed to support CMIP design, future growth, and evolution. Developed in close coordination with those who build and run the existing infrastructure (the Earth System Grid Federation; ESGF), the recommendations are based on several principles beginning with the need to separate requirements, implementation, and operations. Other important principles include the consideration of the diversity of community needs around data - a data ecosystem - the importance of provenance, the need for automation, and the obligation to measure costs and benefits. This paper concentrates on requirements, recognizing the diversity of communities involved (modelers, analysts, software developers, and downstream users). Such requirements include the need for scientific reproducibility and account- ability alongside the need to record and track data usage. One key element is to generate a dataset-centric rather than system-centric focus, with an aim to making the infrastructure less prone to systemic failure. With these overarching principles and requirements, the WIP has produced a set of position papers, which are summarized in the latter pages of this document. They provide specifications for managing and delivering model output, including strategies for replication and versioning, licensing, data quality assurance, citation, long-term archiving, and dataset tracking. They also describe anew and more formal approach for specifying what data, and associated metadata, should be saved, which enables future data volumes to be estimated, particularly for well-defined projects such as CMIP6. The paper concludes with a future facing consideration of the global data infrastructure evolution that follows from the blurring of boundaries between climate and weather, and the changing nature of published scientific results in the digital age.

In particular, metalens arrays have the potential of being monolithically integrated with infrared focal plane arrays (IR FPAs) to increase the operating temperature and sensitivity of the latter. In this work, we demonstrate a type of transmissive metalens that focuses the incident light (lambda = 3-5 mu m) on the detector plane after propagating through the substrate, i.e., solid-immersion type of focusing. The metalens is fabricated by etching the backside of the detector substrate material (GaSb here), making this approach compatible with the architecture of back-illuminated FPAs. In addition, our designs work for all incident polarizations. We fabricate a 10 x 10 metalens array that proves the scalability of this approach for FPAs. In the future, these solid-immersion metalenses arrays will be monolithically integrated with IR FPAs.

Pyrene is co-deposited with a gaseous mixture of H2O and CO2 (100% CO2; 50:50 CO2:H2O; and 100% H2O) and is subjected to Lye, photons from a hydrogen-flow microwave discharge lamp. To our surprise, we found ionization of pyrene in all three ices, with ionization yields following the H2O content in the ice, indicating that H2O ice stabilizes charged ions and electrons better than CO2 ice by a factor of 10. Caution needs to be exercised not to overinterpret our finding that pyrene is ionized in pure CO2 ice, because even trace amounts of water in the CO2 matrix could result in an increased ionization of pyrene. In addition to ionization of pyrene in CO2 ice, photochemical products of the CO2 ice itself, namely CO and CO3, were found to form efficiently, as detected using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in agreement with earlier studies. UV vis spectra showed formation of ozone (O-3) with prolonged irradiation. Surprisingly, O-3 yields followed CO2 concentration in the ice mixtures, with the strongest bands in photolyzed CO2 ice and the weakest in photolyzed H2O ice, indicating that CO2 ice is very protoreactive and produces more O atoms than H2O ice. Pyrene-containing photoproducts, incorporating CO2 or CO or O, such as Py-COOH, Py-OH, or Py-CHO, are not explicitly seen in the UV vis absorption spectra, but we cannot rule out the possibility that their UV absorption may be swamped under the strong absorption of O-3.

A complex dynamo inferred from the hemispheric dichotomy of Jupiter's magnetic field	NATURE												The Juno spacecraft, which is in a polar orbit around Jupiter, is providing direct measurements of the planet's magnetic field close to its surface(1). A recent analysis of observations of Jupiter's magnetic field from eight (of the first nine) Juno orbits has provided a spherical-harmonic reference model (JRM09)(2) of Jupiter's magnetic field outside the planet. This model is of particular interest for understanding processes in Jupiter's magnetosphere, but to study the field within the planet and thus the dynamo mechanism that is responsible for generating Jupiter's main magnetic field, alternative models are preferred. Here we report maps of the magnetic field at a range of depths within Jupiter. We find that Jupiter's magnetic field is different from all other known planetary magnetic fields. Within Jupiter, most of the flux emerges from the dynamo region in a narrow band in the northern hemisphere, some of which returns through an intense, isolated flux patch near the equator. Elsewhere, the field is much weaker. The non-dipolar part of the field is confined almost entirely to the northern hemisphere, so there the field is strongly non-dipolar and in the southern hemisphere it is predominantly dipolar. We suggest that Jupiter's dynamo, unlike Earth's, does not operate in a thick, homogeneous shell, and we propose that this unexpected field morphology arises from radial variations, possibly including layering, in density or electrical conductivity, or both.

Although several independent studies have shown that the FTIR measurements can provide formaldehyde total columns with good precision, the spatial coverage has not been optimal for providing good diagnostics for satellite or model validation. Furthermore, these past studies used different retrieval settings, and biases as large as 50 % can be observed in the HCHO total columns depending on these retrieval choices, which is also a weakness for validation studies combining data from different ground-based stations. For the present work, the HCHO retrieval settings have been optimized based on experience gained from past studies and have been applied consistently at the 21 participating stations. Most of them are either part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) or under consideration for membership. We provide the harmonized settings and a characterization of the HCHO FTIR products. Depending on the station, the total systematic and random uncertainties of an individual HCHO total column measurement lie between 12 % and 27 % and between 1 and 11 x 10(14) molec cm(-2), respectively. The median values among all stations are 13 % and 2.9 x 10(14) molec cm(-2) for the total systematic and random uncertainties. This unprecedented harmonized formaldehyde data set from 21 ground-based FTIR stations is presented and its comparison with a global chemistry transport model shows consistency in absolute values as well as in seasonal cycles. The network covers very different concentration levels of formaldehyde, from very clean levels at the limit of detection (few 10(13) molec cm(-2)) to highly polluted levels (7 x 10(16) molec cm(-2)). Because the measurements can be made at any time during daylight, the diurnal cycle can be observed and is found to be significant at many stations. These HCHO time series, some of them starting in the 1990s, are crucial for past and present satellite validation and will be extended in the coming years for the next generation of satellite missions.

Exploring the first aerosol indirect effect over Southeast Asia using a 10-year collocated MODIS, CALIOP, and model dataset	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Satellite observations and model simulations cannot, by themselves, give full insight into the complex relationships between aerosols and clouds. This is especially true over Southeast Asia, an area that is particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation yet poses some of the world's largest observability and predictability challenges. We present a new collocated dataset, the Curtain Cloud-Aerosol Regional ATrain dataset, or CCARA. CCARA includes collocated satellite observations from Aqua's Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) with the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS). The CCARA dataset is designed with the capability to investigate aerosol-cloud relationships in regions with limited aerosol retrievals due to high cloud amounts by leveraging the NAAPS model reanalysis of aerosol concentration in these regions. This combined aerosol and cloud dataset provides coincident and vertically resolved cloud and aerosol observations for 2006-2016. Using the model reanalysis aerosol fields from the NAAPS and coincident cloud liquid effective radius retrievals from MODIS (cirrus contamination using CALIOP), we investigate the first aerosol indirect effect in Southeast Asia. We find that, as expected, aerosol loading anti-correlates with cloud effective radius, with maximum sensitivity in cumulous mediocris clouds with heights in the 3-4.5 km level. The highest susceptibilities in droplet effective radius to modeled perturbations in particle concentrations were found in the more remote and pristine regions of the western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. Conversely, there was much less variability in cloud droplet size near emission sources over both land and water. We hypothesize this is suggestive of a high aerosol background already saturated with cloud condensation nuclei even during the relatively clean periods, in contrast to the remote ocean regions, which have periods where the aerosol concentrations are low enough to allow for larger droplet growth.

A hexagon in Saturn's northern stratosphere surrounding the emerging summertime polar vortex	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Saturn's polar stratosphere exhibits the seasonal growth and dissipation of broad, warm vortices poleward of similar to 75 degrees latitude, which are strongest in the summer and absent in winter. The longevity of the exploration of the Saturn system by Cassini allows the use of infrared spectroscopy to trace the formation of the North Polar Stratospheric Vortex (NPSV), a region of enhanced temperatures and elevated hydrocarbon abundances at millibar pressures. We constrain the timescales of stratospheric vortex formation and dissipation in both hemispheres. Although the NPSV formed during late northern spring, by the end of Cassini's reconnaissance (shortly after northern summer solstice), it still did not display the contrasts in temperature and composition that were evident at the south pole during southern summer. The newly formed NPSV was bounded by a strengthening stratospheric thermal gradient near 78 degrees N. The emergent boundary was hexagonal, suggesting that the Rossby wave responsible for Saturn's long-lived polar hexagon-which was previously expected to be trapped in the troposphere-can influence the stratospheric temperatures some 300 km above Saturn's clouds.

J	Morsy, AM; Povinelli, ML; Hennessy, J				Morsy, Ahmed M.; Povinelli, Michelle L.; Hennessy, John			Highly selective ultraviolet aluminum plasmonic filters on silicon	OPTICS EXPRESS												We report the use of aluminum patterning to make highly selective UV bandpass filters. We design and fabricate a periodic array of nanoholes in Al thin film on a bare silicon substrate as an analog for potential integration with a Si photodetector. Arrays were designed to operate in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. Our results show that we can obtain a single dominant peak filter with a linewidth of 30 nm at normal incidence, in contrast to similar structures on glass substrates, where multiple modes influence the UV spectrum. Varying the angle of incidence is shown to split the plasmonic mode and further decrease the linewidth of the maximum wavelength mode down to 10 nm. Our results therefore show high potential for applications in solid-state image sensors for astronomy and planetary studies.

Ion Heating Measurements on the Centerline of a High-Current Hollow Cathode Plume	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER					52nd AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion and Energy Conference	JUL 24-27, 2016	Salt Lake City, UT	AIAA, ASME, SAE, ASEE				An experimental investigation into the correlation between ion acoustic turbulence (IAT) and anomalous ion heating in the plume of a 100 A-class LaB6 hollow cathode is presented. Laser-induced fluorescence is employed to measure the ion velocity distribution function, and a translating ion saturation probe is used to quantify the spatial dependence of the IAT wave energy. It is found that over a range of flow rates and operating currents both the ion temperature and IAT energy increase downstream of the cathode in qualitatively similar ways. Both parameters also are shown to be impacted by operating conditions: the IAT energy and ion temperature decrease at higher flow rates and lower discharge currents. It is shown that the ratio between ion temperature and wave energy is related by a scaling parameter that depends on the background plasma parameters, and this relation is examined in the context of previous analytical work on IAT-induced ion heating.

Linking serpentinization, hyperalkaline mineral waters and abiotic methane production in continental peridotites: an integrated hydrogeological-biogeochemical model from the Cabeco de Vide CH4-rich aquifer (Portugal)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Continental active serpentinization of ultramafic rocks is today recognized as a key process triggering a sequence of phenomena involving the passage from inorganic, to organic and metabolic reactions. These may have a role in the origin of life, and may explain the occurrence of abiotic hydrocarbons on Earth and other planets. Production of hyperalkaline waters and abiotic methane (CH4) are two critical steps in this sequence. They were described independently by specific hydrogeological and geochemical models. Here, we update and combine these models into a unified scheme using and integrating geological, hydrogeological, hydrogeochemical, gasgeochemical and microbial analyses acquired from 2002 to 2014 in the Cabeco de Vide (CdV) study site, Portugal. The hyperalkaline (pH > 10.5), Na-Cl/Ca-OH mineral water of CdV evolve from groundwater-peridotite interaction (serpentinization) generating hydrogen (H-2), which, according to multiple theoretical, laboratory and field evidence, likely reacted with CO2 within metal- (catalyst) rich rocks, abiotically producing CH4 (up to 1.2 mg/L; -24.4 degrees/oo < delta C-13-CH4 < -14.0 degrees/(oo) and -285 degrees/(oo) < delta H-2-CH4 < -218 degrees/(oo)). The hyper alkaline water hosts hydrogen oxidizing bacteria "Setpentinomonas", which may explain the paucity of H-2 observed in the dissolved gas. The CdV gas-rich mineral waters ascend along a fault at the boundary of the peridotite intrusion. Temporal changes of pH and CH4 concentration result from episodic mixing with shallower MgHCO3-type waters. Soil-gas analyses show that methane migrates to the surface along the fault, also independently from the water emergences, consistently with non-aqueous abiotic CH4 production. Our integrated model is generally compatible with observations from other gas-bearing continental serpentinization sites.

Electron/proton/ion gradients, particularly in the context of hydrothermal chimney structures, may also be relevant to the origins of life on Earth. Hydrothermal vents are similar in some ways to typical fuel cell devices: redox/pH gradients between seawater and hydrothermal fluid are analogous to the fuel cell oxidant and fuel reservoirs; the porous chimney wall is analogous to a separator or ion-exchange membrane and is also a conductive path for electrons; and the hydrothermal minerals are analogous to electrode catalysts. The modular and scalable characteristics of fuel cell systems make for a convenient planetary geology test bed in which geologically relevant components may be assembled and investigated in a controlled simulation environment. We have performed fuel cell experiments and electrochemical studies to better understand the catalytic potential of seafloor minerals and vent chimneys, using samples from a black smoker vent chimney as an initial demonstration. In a fuel cell with Na+-conducting Nafion((R)) membranes and liquid fuel/oxidant reservoirs (simulating the vent environment), the black smoker mineral catalyst in the membrane electrode assembly was effective in reducing O-2 and oxidizing sulfide. In a H-2/O-2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell with H+-conducting Nafion membranes, the black smoker catalyst was effective in reducing O-2 but not in oxidizing H-2. These fuel cell experiments accurately simulated the redox reactions that could occur in a geological setting with this particular catalyst, and also tested whether the minerals are sufficiently active to replace a commercial fuel cell catalyst. Similar experiments with other geocatalysts could be utilized to test which redox reactions could be driven in other hydrothermal systems, including hypothesized vent systems on other worlds.

MOA Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration; KMTNet Collaboration	MOA-2015-BLG-337: A Planetary System with a Low-mass Brown Dwarf/Planetary Boundary Host, or a Brown Dwarf Binary	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We report on the discovery and analysis of the short-timescale binary-lens microlensing event, MOA-2015-BLG-337. The lens system could be a planetary system with a very low-mass host, around the brown dwarf (BD)/planetary-mass boundary, or a BD binary. We found two competing models that explain the observed light curves with companion/host mass ratios of q similar to 0.01 and similar to 0.17, respectively. A significant finite source effect in the best-fit planetary model (q similar to 0.01) reveals a small angular Einstein radius of theta(E) similar or equal to 0.03 mas, which favors a low-mass lens. We obtain the posterior probability distribution of the lens properties from a Bayesian analysis. The results for the planetary models strongly depend on a power-law index in planetary-mass regime, alpha(pl), in the assumed mass function. In summary, there are two solutions of the lens system: (1) a BD/planetary-mass boundary object orbited by a super-Neptune (the planetary model with alpha(pl) = 0.49) and (2) a BD binary (the binary model). If the planetary models are correct, this system can be one of a new class of planetary system, having a low host mass and also a planetary-mass ratio (q < 0.03) between the companion and its host. The discovery of the event is important for the study of planetary formation in very low-mass objects. In addition, it is important to consider all viable solutions in these kinds of ambiguous events in order for the future comprehensive statistical analyses of planetary/binary microlensing events.

DES Collaboration	The Splashback Feature around DES Galaxy Clusters: Galaxy Density and Weak Lensing Profiles	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Splashback refers to the process of matter that is accreting onto a dark matter halo reaching its first orbital apocenter and turning around in its orbit. The clustercentric radius at which this process occurs, r(sp), defines a halo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster. A rapid decline in the halo profile is expected near rsp. We measure the galaxy number density and weak lensing mass profiles around REDMAPPER galaxy clusters in the first-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean M-200m mass approximate to 2.5 x 10(14)M(circle dot), we find strong evidence of a splashback-like steepening of the galaxy density profile and measure r(sp) = 1.13 +/- 0.07 h(-1) Mpc, consistent with the earlier Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurements of More et al. and Baxter et al. Moreover, our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the existence of a splashback-like steepening of the matter profile of galaxy clusters. We measure r(sp) = 1.34 +/- 0.21 h(-1) Mpc from the weak lensing data, in good agreement with our galaxy density measurements. For different cluster and galaxy samples, we find that, consistent with.CDM simulations, rsp scales with R-200m and does not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3-0.6. We also find that potential systematic effects associated with the REDMAPPER algorithm may impact the location of rsp. We discuss the progress needed to understand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from DES and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock catalogs and independent cluster samples.

Importance of positive cloud feedback for tropical Atlantic interhemispheric climate variability	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Over the tropical Atlantic during boreal spring, average interhemispheric differences in sea-surface temperature (SST) coincide with a coherent pattern of interannual climate variability often referred to as the Atlantic Meridional Mode. This includes anomalous SST and sea-level pressure roughly anti-symmetric about the equator, as well as cross-equatorial near-surface winds directed toward the warmer hemisphere. Within subtropical marine boundary layer cloud regions in both hemispheres, enhanced cloudiness associated with this variability is co-located with cool SST, a strong temperature inversion, and cold horizontal surface temperature advection, while reduced cloudiness is associated with the opposite meteorological conditions. This is indicative a positive cloud feedback that reinforces the underlying SST anomalies. The simulation of this feedback varies widely among models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Models that fail to simulate this feedback substantially underestimate the amplitudes of typical tropical Atlantic interhemispheric variability in cloudiness off of the equator, SST, and atmospheric circulation. Models that correctly reproduce a positive cloud feedback generally produce higher and more realistic amplitudes of variability, but with substantial scatter. Marine boundary layer clouds therefore appear to be a key element of springtime coupled atmosphere-ocean variability over the tropical Atlantic. A markedly more successful simulation of this variability in climate models may be obtained by better representing boundary layer cloud processes.

To implement the forest moratorium for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, Indonesia's government requires information on the carbon stored in forests, including intact, degraded, secondary, and peat swamp forests. We developed a hybrid approach of producing a wall-to-wall map of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of intact and degraded forests of Kalimantan at 1 ha grid cells by combining field inventory plots, airborne lidar samples, and satellite radar and optical imagery. More than 110 000 ha of lidar data were acquired to systematically capture variations of forest structure and more than 104 field plots to develop lidar-biomass models. The lidar measurements were converted into biomass using models developed for 66 439 ha of drylands and 44 250 ha of wetland forests. By combining the AGB map with the national land cover map, we found that 22.3 Mha (10(6) ha) of forest remain on drylands ranging in biomass from 357.2 +/- 12.3 Mgha(-1) in relatively intact forests to 134.2 +/- 6.1 Mgha(-1) in severely degraded forests. The remaining peat swamp forests are heterogeneous in coverage and degradation level, extending over 3.62 Mha and having an average AGB of 211.8 +/- 12.7 Mgha(-1). Emission factors calculated from aboveground biomass only suggest that the carbon storage potential of more than 15 Mha of degraded and secondary dryland forests will be about 1.1 PgC.

We quantified the impacts of the 2011 and 2012 droughts on terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake anomalies over the contiguous US (CONUS) relative to non-drought years during 2010-2015 using satellite observations and the carbon monitoring system-flux inversion modeling framework. Soilmoisture and temperature anomalies are good predictors of gross primary production anomalies (R-2 > 0.6) in summer but less so for net biosphere production (NBP) anomalies, reflecting different respiration responses. We showed that regional responses combine in complicated ways to produce the observed CONUS responses. Because of the compensating effect of the carbonflux anomalies between northern and southern CONUS in 2011 and between spring and summer in 2012, the annual NBP decreased by 0.10 +/- 0.16 GtC in 2011, and increased by 0.10 +/- 0.16 GtC in 2012 over CONUS, consistent with previous reported results. Over the 2011 and 2012 drought-impacted regions, the reductions in NBP were similar to 40% of the regional annual fossil fuel emissions, underscoring the importance of quantifying natural carbon flux variability as part of an overall observing strategy. The NBP reductions over the 2011 and 2012 CONUS drought-impacted region were opposite to the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate anomaly, implying that global atmospheric CO2 growth rate is an offsetting effect between enhanced uptake and emission, and enhancing the understanding of regional carbon-cycle climate relationship is necessary to improve the projections of future climate.

IoT devices are heterogeneous in signaling, sensing, and mobility, and their resources for computation and communication are typically limited. Therefore, to enable location awareness in large-scale IoT networks, there is a need for efficient, scalable, and distributed multisensor fusion algorithms. This article presents a framework for designing network localization and navigation (NLN) for the IoT. Multisensor localization and operation algorithms developed within NLN can exploit spatiotemporal cooperation, are suitable for arbitrary, large-network sizes, and only rely on an information exchange among neighboring devices. The advantages of NLN are evaluated in a large-scale IoT network with 500 agents. In particular, because of multisensor fusion and cooperation, the presented network localization and operation algorithms can provide attractive localization performance and reduce communication overhead and energy consumption.

In this study, atmosphere-only simulations are performed from 2002 to 2006 using the Community Atmospheric Model, version 5.1, with and without dust emission from the Sahara Desert. The Saharan dust exhibits noticeable impacts on the regional longwave and shortwave radiation, cloud formation, and the convective systems over West Africa and the tropical Atlantic. The African easterly jet and West African monsoon are modulated by dust, leading to northward shifts of the intertropical convergence zone and the TC genesis region. The dust events induce positive midlevel moisture and entropy deficit anomalies, enhancing the TC genesis. On the other hand, the increased vertical wind shear and decreased low-level vorticity and potential intensity by dust inhibit TC formation in the genesis region. The ventilation index shows a decrease in the intensification region and an increase in the genesis region by dust, corresponding to favorable and unfavorable TC activities, respectively. The comparison of nondust scenarios in 2005 and 2006 shows more favorable TC conditions in 2005 characterized by higher specific humidity and potential intensity, but lower ventilation index, wind shear, and entropy deficit. Those are attributable to the observed warmer sea surface temperature (SST) in 2005, in which dust effects can be embedded. Our results imply significant dust perturbations on the radiative budget, hydrological cycle, and large-scale environments relevant to TC activity over the Atlantic.

Evaluating GPP and Respiration Estimates Over Northern Midlatitude Ecosystems Using Solar-Induced Fluorescence and Atmospheric CO2 Measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												On regional to global scales, few constraints exist on gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-e) fluxes. Yet constraints on these fluxes are critical for evaluating and improving terrestrial biosphere models. In this study, we evaluate the seasonal cycle of GPP, R-e, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) produced by four terrestrial biosphere models and FLUXCOM, a data-driven model, over northern midlatitude ecosystems. We evaluate the seasonal cycle of GPP and NEE using solar-induced fluorescence retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 and column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (X-CO2) from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network, respectively. We then infer R-e by combining constraints on GPP with constraints on NEE from two flux inversions. An ensemble of optimized R-e seasonal cycles is generated using five GPP estimates and two NEE estimates. The optimized R-e curves generally show high consistency with each other, with the largest differences due to the magnitude of GPP. We find optimized R-e exhibits a systematically broader summer maximum than modeled R-e, with values lower during June-July and higher during the fall than R-e. Further analysis suggests that the differences could be due to seasonal variations in the carbon use efficiency (possibly due to an ecosystem-scale Kok effect) and to seasonal variations in the leaf litter and fine root carbon pool. The results suggest that the inclusion of variable carbon use efficiency for autotrophic respiration and carbon pool dependence for heterotrophic respiration is important for accurately simulating R-e.

Precipitating Electron Energy Flux and Characteristic Energies in Jupiter's Main Auroral Region as Measured by Juno/JEDI	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS												The relationship between electron energy flux and the characteristic energy of electron distributions in the main auroral loss cone bridges the gap between predictions made by theory and measurements just recently available from Juno. For decades such relationships have been inferred from remote sensing observations of the Jovian aurora, primarily from the Hubble Space Telescope, and also more recently from Hisaki. However, to infer these quantities, remote sensing techniques had to assume properties of the Jovian atmospheric structure-leading to uncertainties in their profile. Juno's arrival and subsequent auroral passes have allowed us to obtain these relationships unambiguously for the first time, when the spacecraft passes through the auroral acceleration region. Using Juno/Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI), an energetic particle instrument, we present these relationships for the 30-keV to 1-MeV electron population. Observations presented here show that the electron energy flux in the loss cone is a nonlinear function of the characteristic or mean electron energy and supports both the predictions from Knight (1973, https://doi.org/10.1016/0032-0633(73)90093-7) and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence acceleration theories (e.g., Saur et al., 2003, https://doi.org/10.1029/2002GL015761). Finally, we compare the in situ analyses of Juno with remote Hisaki observations and use them to help constrain Jupiter's atmospheric profile. We find a possible solution that provides the best agreement between these data sets is an atmospheric profile that more efficiently transports the hydrocarbons to higher altitudes. If this is correct, it supports the previously published idea (e.g., Parkinson et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1029/2005JE002539) that precipitating electrons increase the hydrocarbon eddy diffusion coefficients in the auroral regions.

The model then solves for the neutral atmospheric perturbations generated by spherical acoustic-gravity waves and the resulting ionospheric plasma perturbations over the epicentral area. We apply the model to simulate the near-field ionospheric disturbances during two major earthquake events: the 2011 Tohoku-Oki, Japan, and the 2015 Illapel, Chile, events. To validate the results, we extract receiver-to-satellite total electron content perturbations from the simulations and compare them to the corresponding slant total electron content perturbations from Global Positioning System observations. We find good agreement on magnitudes and arrival times between the simulations and observations.

Speed-dependent Voigt lineshape parameter database from dual frequency comb measurements at temperatures up to 1305 K. Part II: Argon-broadened H2O absorption, 6801-7188 cm(-1)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												We report argon-broadened water vapor transition parameters and their temperature dependence based on measured spectra spanning 6801-7188 cm(-1) from a broad-bandwidth, high-resolution dual frequency comb spectrometer. The 25 collected spectra of 2% water vapor in argon ranged from 296 K to 1305 K with total pressure spanning 100Torr to 600Torr. A multispectrum fitting routine was used in conjunction with a quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profile to extract broadening and shift parameters, and a power-law temperature-dependence exponent for both. The measurements represent the first broad bandwidth, argon-broadened water vapor absorption study, and are an important step toward a foreign gas-perturbed, high-temperature database developed using advanced lineshape profiles.

EPIC/DSCOVR images the sunlit hemisphere of our planet from approximate to 1,500,000 km away with approximate to 8 km pixels at the center of the disc. EPIC pixel-scale spectral data is used to estimate in-band/continuum radiance ratios for O-2's A- and B-bands, from which one can derive, in principle, both cloud top height and cloud geometrical thickness. We use the general framework of optimal estimation theory to show that in practice, once measurement error is factored in, only cloud top height can be reliably inferred. With that limitation in mind, we discuss the ramifications for retrieval algorithm development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This analysis constrains Ceres's early history and offers a framework within which future observations may be interpreted. A broad range of alteration conditions have been simulated using the Geochemist's Workbench and PHREEQC software, associated with the FREZCHEM model that constrains the consequences of freezing the liquid phase in equilibrium with the observed mineralogical assemblage. Comparison of the modeling results with observed surface mineralogy at Ceres indicates advanced alteration under a relatively high fugacity of hydrogen, a conclusion that is consistent with predictions for, and observations of, large ice-rich bodies. The simulations suggest production of methane that could help regulate the redox environment and possibly form clathrate hydrates upon freezing of the early ocean. The detection of localized occurrences of natrite (sodium carbonate) at the surface of Ceres provides key constraints on the composition of fluids that are necessarily alkaline. In addition, the combined hydrothermal and freezing simulations suggest that hydrohalite may be abundant in Ceres's subsurface, similar to Earth's polar regions. The global homogeneity of Ceres's surface, made of material formed at depth, suggests a large-scale formation mechanism, while local heterogeneities associated with impact craters and landslides suggest that some form of sodium carbonate and other salts are accessible in the shallow subsurface.

Ceres' spectral link to carbonaceous chondritesAnalysis of the dark background materials	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Ceres' surface has commonly been linked with carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) by ground-based telescopic observations, because of its low albedo, flat to red-sloped spectra in the visible and near-infrared (VIS/NIR) wavelength region, and the absence of distinct absorption bands, though no currently known meteorites provide complete spectral matches to Ceres. Spatially resolved data of the Dawn Framing Camera (FC) reveal a generally dark surface covered with bright spots exhibiting reflectance values several times higher than Ceres' background. In this work, we investigated FC data from High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) and Ceres eXtended Juling (CXJ) orbit (similar to 140m/pixel) for global spectral variations. We found that the cerean surface mainly differs by spectral slope over the whole FC wavelength region (0.4-1.0m). Areas exhibiting slopes <-10%m(-1) constitute only similar to 3% of the cerean surface and mainly occur in the bright material in and around young craters, whereas slopes -10%m(-1) occur on more than 90% of the cerean surface; the latter being denoted as Ceres' background material in this work. FC and Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) spectra of this background material were compared to the suite of CCs spectrally investigated so far regarding their VIS/NIR region and 2.7m absorption, as well as their reflectance at 0.653m. This resulted in a good match to heated CI Ivuna (heated to 200-300 degrees C) and a better match for CM1 meteorites, especially Moapa Valley. This possibly indicates that the alteration of CM2 to CM1 took place on Ceres.

Geologic constraints on the origin of red organic-rich material on Ceres	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The geologic context of red organic-rich materials (ROR) found across an elongated 200km region on Ceres is evaluated with spectral information from the multispectral framing camera (FC) and the visible and near-infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR) of Dawn. Discrete areas of ROR materials are found to be associated with small fresh craters less than a few hundred meters in diameter. Regions with the highest concentration of discrete ROR areas exhibit a weaker diffuse background of ROR materials. The observed pattern could be consistent with a field of secondary impacts, but no appropriate primary crater has been found. Both endogenic and exogenic sources are being considered for these distinctive organic materials.

Ceres internal structure from geophysical constraints	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Thermal evolution modeling has yielded a variety of interior structures for Ceres, ranging from a modestly differentiated interior to more advanced evolution with a dry silicate core, a hydrated silicate mantle, and a volatile-rich crust. Here we compute the mass and hydrostatic flattening from more than one hundred billion three-layer density models for Ceres and describe the characteristics of the population of density structures that are consistent with the Dawn observations. We show that the mass and hydrostatic flattening constraints from Ceres indicate the presence of a high-density core with greater than a 1 sigma probability, but provide little constraint on the density, allowing for core compositions that range from hydrous and/or anhydrous silicates to a mixture of metal and silicates. The crustal densities are consistent with surface observations of salts, water ice, carbonates, and ammoniated clays, which indicate hydrothermal alteration, partial fractionation, and the possible settling of heavy sulfide and metallic particles, which provide a potential process for increasing mass with depth.

Dark Energy Survey Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year-1 results: galaxy mock catalogues for BAO	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Mock catalogues are a crucial tool in the analysis of galaxy surveys data, both for the accurate computation of covariance matrices, and for the optimization of analysis methodology and validation of data sets. In this paper, we present a set of 1800 galaxy mock catalogues designed to match the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 BAO sample (Crocce et al. 2017) in abundance, observational volume, redshift distribution and uncertainty, and redshift-dependent clustering. The simulated samples were built upon HALOGEN (Avila et al. 2015) halo catalogues, based on a 2LPTdensity field with an empirical halo bias, For each of them, a light-cone is constructed by the superposition of snapshots in the redshift range 0.45 < z < 1.4. Uncertainties introduced by so-called photometric redshifts estimators were modelled with a double-skewed-Gaussian curve fitted to the data. We populate haloes with galaxies by introducing a hybrid halo occupation distribution-halo abundance matching model with two free parameters. These are adjusted to achieve a galaxy bias evolution b(z(ph)) that matches the data at the 1 sigma level in the range 0.6 < z(ph) < 1.0. We further analyse the galaxy mock catalogues and compare their clustering to the data using the angular correlation function w(theta), the comoving transverse separation clustering xi(mu < 0.8)(S-perpendicular to) and the angular power spectrum C-l, finding them in agreement. This is the first large set of three-dimensional {RA,Dec.,z} galaxy mock catalogues able to simultaneously accurately reproduce the photometric redshift uncertainties and the galaxy clustering.

DES Collaboration	Improving weak lensing mass map reconstructions using Gaussian and sparsity priors: application to DES SV	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Mapping the underlying density field, including non-visible dark matter, using weak gravitational lensing measurements is now a standard tool in cosmology. Due to its importance to the science results of current and upcoming surveys, the quality of the convergence reconstruction methods should be well understood. We compare three methods: Kaiser-Squires (KS), Wiener filter, and GLIMPSE. Kaiser-Squires is a direct inversion, not accounting for survey masks or noise. The Wiener filter is well-motivated for Gaussian density fields in a Bayesian framework. GLIMPSE uses sparsity, aiming to reconstruct non-linearities in the density field. We compare these methods with several tests using public Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data and realistic DES simulations. The Wiener filter and GLIMPSE offer substantial improvements over smoothed Kaiser-Squires with a range of metrics. Both the Wiener filter and GLIMPSE convergence reconstructions show a 12 per cent improvement in Pearson correlation with the underlying truth from simulations. To compare the mapping methods' abilities to find mass peaks, we measure the difference between peak counts from simulated Lambda CDM shear catalogues and catalogues with no mass fluctuations (a standard data vector when inferring cosmology from peak statistics); the maximum signal-to-noise of these peak statistics is increased by a factor of 3.5 for the Wiener filter and 9 for GLIMPSE. With simulations, we measure the reconstruction of the harmonic phases; the phase residuals' concentration is improved 17 per cent by GLIMPSE and 18 per cent by the Wiener filter. The correlation between reconstructions from data and foreground redMaPPer clusters is increased 18 per cent by the Wiener filter and 32 per cent by GLIMPSE.

Characterization of Aspergillus niger Isolated from the International Space Station	MSYSTEMS												The initial characterization of the Aspergillus niger isolate JSC-093350089, collected from U.S. segment surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the extensively studied strain ATCC 1015. Whole-genome sequencing of the ISS isolate enabled its phylogenetic placement within the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade and revealed that the genome of JSC-093350089 is within the observed genetic variance of other sequenced A. niger strains. The ISS isolate exhibited an increased rate of growth and pigment distribution compared to a terrestrial strain. Analysis of the isolate's proteome revealed significant differences in the molecular phenotype of JSC-093350089, including increased abundance of proteins involved in the A. niger starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition. Together, these data reveal the existence of a distinct strain of A. niger on board the ISS and provide insight into the characteristics of melanized fungal species inhabiting spacecraft environments. IMPORTANCE A thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight presents many economic benefits and is imperative for the health of crew. As A. niger is a predominant ISS isolate frequently detected in built environments, studies of A. niger strains inhabiting closed systems may reveal information fundamental to the success of long-duration space missions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of fungi in extreme environments as well as countermeasures to eradicate unfavorable microbes. Further, it enhances understanding of host-microbe interactions in closed systems, which can help NASA's Human Research Program maintain a habitat healthy for crew during long-term manned space missions.

Investigating the Kinetics of Montmorillonite Clay-Catalyzed Conversion of Anthracene to 9,10-Anthraquinone in the Context of Prebiotic Chemistry	ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES												Carbonaceous meteorites contributed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the organic inventory of the primordial Earth where they may have reacted on catalytic clay mineral surfaces to produce quinones capable of functioning as redox species in emergent biomolecular systems. To address the feasibility of this hypothesis, we assessed the kinetics of anthracene (1) conversion to 9,10-anthraquinone (2) in the presence of montmorillonite clay (MONT) over the temperature range 25 to 250 degrees C. Apparent rates of conversion were concentration independent and displayed a sigmoidal relationship with temperature, and conversion efficiencies ranged from 0.027 to 0.066%. Conversion was not detectable in the absence of MONT or a sufficiently high oxidation potential (in this case, molecular oxygen (O-2)). These results suggest a scenario in which meteoritic 1 and MONT interactions could yield biologically important quinones in prebiotic planetary environments.																	0169-6149	1573-0875				SEP	2018	48	3					321	330		10.1007/s11084-018-9562-9							WOS:000450474100005	30203410

An emerging innovative approach is offered by Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry (GNSS-R), a concept that takes advantage of GNSS-transmitting satellites and independent radar receivers to provide bistatic radar observations of Earth's surface with large-scale coverage. The objective of this paper is to assess the capability of spaceborne GNSS reflections to characterize surface inundation dynamics in a complex wetlands environment in the Peruvian Amazon with respect to current state-of-the-art methods. This study examines contemporaneous ALOS2 PALSAR-2 L-band imaging radar, CYGNSS GNSS reflections, and ground measurements to assess associated advantages and challenges to mapping inundation dynamics, particularly in regions under dense tropical forest canopies. Three derivatives of CYGNSS Delay-Doppler maps (1) peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), (2) leading edge slope, and (3) trailing edge slope, demonstrated statistically significant logarithmic relationships with estimated flooded area percentages determined from SAR, with SNR exhibiting the strongest association. Aggregated Delay-Doppler maps SNR time series data examined for inundated regions undetected by imaging radar suggests GNSS-R exhibits a potentially greater sensitivity to inundation state beneath dense forest canopies relative to SAR. Results demonstrate the capability for mapping extent and dynamic wetlands ecosystems in complex tropical landscapes, alone or in combination with other remote-sensing techniques such as those based on imaging radar, contributing to enhanced mapping of these regions. However, several aspects of GNSS-R observations such as noise level, spatial resolution, and signal coherence need to be further examined.

The mission successfully collected data from 25 August 2011 to 7 June 2015. The Aquarius project released its final version (Version-5) of the SSS data product in December 2017. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the validation results from the Aquarius Validation Data System (AVDS) and other statistical methods, and to provide a general view of the Aquarius SSS quality to the users. The results demonstrate that Aquarius has met the mission target measurement accuracy requirement of 0.2 psu on monthly averages on 150 km scale. From the triple point analysis using Aquarius, in situ field and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) products, the root mean square errors of Aquarius Level-2 and Level-3 data are estimated to be 0.17 psu and 0.13 psu, respectively. It is important that caution should be exercised when using Aquarius salinity data in areas with high radio frequency interference (RFI) and heavy rainfall, close to the coast lines where leakage of land signals may significantly affect the quality of the SSS data, and at high-latitude oceans where the L-band radiometer has poor sensitivity to SSS.

How Long should the MISR Record Be when Evaluating Aerosol Optical Depth Climatology in Climate Models?	REMOTE SENSING												This study used the nearly continuous 17-year observation record from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra Earth Observing System satellite to determine which temporal subsets are long enough to define statistically stable speciated aerosol optical depth (AOD) climatologies (i.e., AOD by particle types) for purposes of climate model evaluation. A random subsampling of seasonally averaged total and speciated AOD retrievals was performed to quantitatively assess the statistical stability in the climatology, represented by the minimum record length required for the standard deviation of the subsampled mean AODs to be less than a certain threshold. Our results indicate that the multi-year mean speciated AOD from MISR is stable on a global scale; however, there is substantial regional variability in the assessed stability. This implies that in some regions, even 17 years may not provide a long enough sample to define regional mean total and speciated AOD climatologies. We further investigated the agreement between the statistical stability of total AOD retrievals from MISR and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), also on the NASA Terra satellite. The difference in the minimum record lengths between MISR and MODIS climatologies of total AOD is less than three years for most of the globe, with the exception of certain regions. Finally, we compared the seasonal cycles in the MISR total and speciated AODs with those simulated by three global chemistry transport models in the regions of climatologically stable speciated AODs. We found that only one model reproduced the observed seasonal cycles of the total and non-absorbing AODs over East China, but the seasonal cycles in total and dust AODs in all models are similar to those from MISR in Western Africa. This work provides a new method for considering the statistical stability of satellite-derived climatologies and illustrates the value of MISR's speciated AOD data record for evaluating aerosols in global models.

Validation of CryoSat-2 SARIn Data over Austfonna Ice Cap Using Airborne Laser Scanner Measurements	REMOTE SENSING												The study presented here is focused on the assessment of surface elevations derived from CryoSat-2 SARIn level 1b data over the Austfonna ice cap, Svalbard, in 2016. The processing chain that must be applied to the CryoSat-2 waveforms to derive heights is non-trivial, and consists of multiple steps, all requiring subjective choices of methods such as the choice of retracker, geo-relocation, and outlier rejection. Here, we compare six CryoSat-2 level-2 type data sets of surface elevations derived using different SARIn processing chains. These data sets are validated against surface elevation data collected from an airborne laser scanner, during a dedicated CryoSat validation experiment field campaign carried out in April 2016. The flight pattern of the airborne campaign was designed so that elevations were measured in a grid pattern rather than along single lines, as has previously been the standard procedure. The flight grid pattern was chosen to optimize the comparison with the CryoSat-2 SARIn elevation data, the location of which can deviate from nadir by several kilometers due to topography within the satellite footprint. The processing chains behind the six data sets include different outlier/error rejection approaches, and do not produce the same number of data points in our region of interest. To make a consistent analysis, we provide statistics from the validation of both the full data sets from each processing chain, and on only those data that all the six data sets provide a geo-located elevation estimate for. We find that the CryoSat-2 data sets that agree best with the validation data are those derived from dedicated land ice processing schemes. This study may serve as a benchmark for future CryoSat-2 retracker developments, and the evaluation software and data set are made publicly available.

Tracking the weight of Hurricane Harvey's stormwater using GPS data	SCIENCE ADVANCES												On 26 August 2017, Hurricane Harvey struck the Gulf Coast as a category four cyclone depositing similar to 95 km(3) of water, making it the wettest cyclone in U.S. history. Water left in Harvey's wake should cause elastic loading and subsidence of Earth's crust, and uplift as it drains into the ocean and evaporates. To track daily changes of transient water storage, we use Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, finding a clear migration of subsidence (up to 21 mm) and horizontal motion (up to 4 mm) across the Gulf Coast, followed by gradual uplift over a 5-week period. Inversion of these data shows that a third of Harvey's total stormwater was captured on land (25.7 +/- 3.0 km(3)), indicating that the rest drained rapidly into the ocean at a rate of 8.2 km(3)/day, with the remaining stored water gradually lost over the following 5 weeks at similar to 1 km(3)/day, primarily by evapotranspiration. These results indicate that GPS networks can remotely track the spatial extent and daily evolution of terrestrial water storage following transient, extreme precipitation events, with implications for improving operational flood forecasts and understanding the response of drainage systems to large influxes of water.

Archaeological prospection has often focused on L-band SAR sensors, given the ability of longer wavelengths to penetrate more deeply into sand. In contrast, this study demonstrates capabilities of shorter-wavelength, but higher spatial resolution, C-band and X-band SAR sensors in archaeological subsurface imaging at the site of Uqdat al-Bakrah (Safah), Oman. Despite having varying parameters and acquisitions, both the X-band and C-band images analyzed were able to identify a subsurface paleo-channel that is not visible on the ground surface. This feature was first identified through Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey, then recognized in the SAR imagery and further verified by test excavations. Both the GPR and the excavations reveal the base of the paleo-channel at a depth of 0.6 m-0.7 m. Hence, both X-band and C-band wavelengths are appropriate for subsurface archaeological prospection in suitable (dry silt and sand) conditions with specific acquisition parameters. Moreover, these results offer important new insights into the paleo-environmental context of ancient metal-working at Uqdat al-Bakrah and demonstrate surface water flow roughly contemporary with the site's occupation.

Subannual and Seasonal Variability of Atlantic-Origin Waters in Two Adjacent West Greenland Fjords	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Plain Language Summary Greenland fjords provide a pathway for the inflow of warm shelf waters to glacier termini and outflow of glacially modified waters to the coastal ocean. Characterizing the dominant modes of variability in fjord circulation, and how they vary over subannual and seasonal time scales, is critical for predicting ocean heat transport to the ice. Here we present a 2-year hydrographic record from a suite of moorings in Davis Strait and two neighboring west Greenland fjords that exhibit contrasting fjord and glacier geometry (Kangerdlugssuaq Sermerssua and Rink Isbrae). Hydrographic variability above the sill exhibits clear seasonality, with a progressive cooling of near-surface waters and shoaling of deep isotherms above the sill during winter to spring. Renewal of below-sill waters coincides with the arrival of dense waters at the fjord mouth; warm, salty Atlantic-origin water cascades into fjord basins from winter to midsummer. We then use Seaglider observations at Davis Strait, along with reanalysis of sea ice and wind stress in Baffin Bay, to explore the role of the West Greenland Current and local air-sea forcing in driving fjord renewal. These results demonstrate the importance of both remote and local processes in driving renewal of near-terminus waters, highlighting the need for sustained observations and improved ocean models that resolve the complete slope-trough-fjord-ice system. Submarine melting of ice due to warm ocean waters has been implicated as a mechanism for the retreat and destabilization of marine-terminating glaciers worldwide. In Greenland, fjords provide an important connection between marine-terminating glaciers and warm subsurface waters located offshore. However, due to sparse ocean-glacier observations in these ice-choked systems, especially during winter months, we lack an understanding of how the large-scale circulation along Greenland's periphery influences near-glacier ocean temperatures. To address this, we present a 2-year mooring record from Davis Strait and two neighboring west Greenland fjords. Above the sill, fjord temperatures exhibit a clear seasonal cycle that is inherited from the continental shelf and slope. Below the sill, warming of fjord waters occurs more intermittently and is initiated when salty Atlantic-origin waters arrive at the fjord mouth. In summary, these novel observations allow for a better understanding of ocean-glacier interactions in Greenland.

The north end of the EMC rupture exhibits an asymmetric pattern of deformation that is substantial and smooth northeast of the rupture and limited but with surface fracturing slip northwest. The earthquake triggered 1cm of surface coseismic slip at the Yuha fault, which continued to slip postseismically. 2.5cm of Yuha fault slip occurred by the time of the 15 June 2010 M(w)5.7 Ocotillo aftershock and 5cm of slip occurred by 2017 following a logarithmic afterslip decay 16-day timescale. The Ocotillo aftershock triggered 1.4cm of slip on a northwest trend extending to the Elsinore fault and by 7years after the EMC earthquake 2.4cm of slip had accumulated with a distribution following an afterslip function with a 16-day timescale consistent with other earthquakes and a rate strengthening upper crustal sedimentary layer. GPS data show broad coseismic uplift of the Salton Trough and delayed postseismic motion that may be indicative of fluid migration there and subsidence west of the rupture extension, which continues following the earthquake. The data indicate that the Elsinore, Laguna Salada, and EMC ruptures are part of the same fault system. The results also suggest that north-south shortening and east-west extension across the region drove fracture advancing step tectonics north of the EMC earthquake rupture. Plain Language Summary Airborne radar and Global Positioning System observations of the Yuha Desert and Salton Trough suggest that the 2010 M7.2 El Mayor - Cucapah earthquake rupture, the Laguna Salada fault in Baja California, Mexico, and the Elsinore fault in California are part of the same fault system. The M5.7 Ocotillo aftershock links these faults and is a result of stress propagation from afterslip on the El Mayor - Cucapah rupture. Further east in the Salton Trough fluid migration also contributes to the observed results.

We are motivated by the problem of creating space structures at a scale greater than what is feasible with a single self-deploying design. We had two goals in this work. The first was to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of long-order multitask autonomy. The second was to study the balance between required tolerances in hardware design and robotic autonomy. This paper reports on a payload-centric autonomy paradigm and presents results from laboratory demonstrations of automated assembly of structures using a multilimbed robotic platform. We present results with deployable 20 lb payloads (1 m trusses) that are robotically assembled to form a 3-m diameter kinematically closed loop structure to subcentimeter accuracy. The robot uses its limbs to deploy the stowed modular structural components, manipulate them in free space, and assemble them via dual-arm force control. We report on results and lessons learned from multiple successful end-to-end in-lab demonstrations of autonomous truss assembly with JPL's RoboSimian robot originally developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Videos of these demonstrations can be seen at (JPL, 2017). Each end-to-end run took precisely 26 min to execute with very little variance across runs. We present changes/improvements to the RoboSimian system post-DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) (Karumanchi et al., 2016). The new architecture has been improved with a focus on scalable autonomy as opposed to semiautonomy as required at the DRC.																	1556-4959	1556-4967				SEP	2018	35	6					1005	1021		10.1002/rob.21792							WOS:000446433000010

Several distinctive features of DPR measurements of hail-bearing columns, potentially exploitable by hydrometeor classification algorithms, are identified. In particular, the height and the strength of the Ka-band reflectivity peak show a strong relationship with the hail shaft area within the instrument field of view (FOV). Signatures of multiple scattering (MS) at the Ka band are observed for a range of rimed particles, including but not exclusively for hail. MS amplifies uncertainty in the effective Ka reflectivity estimate and has a negative impact on the accuracy of dual-frequency rainfall retrievals at the ground. The hydrometeor composition of convective cells presents a large inhomogeneity within the DPR FOV. Strong nonuniform beamfilling (NUBF) introduces large ambiguities in the attenuation correction at Ku and Ka bands, which additionally hamper quantitative retrievals. The effective detection of profiles affected by MS is a very challenging task, since the inhomogeneity within the DPR FOV may result in measurements that look remarkably like MS signatures. The shape of the DPR reflectivity profiles is the result of the complex interplay between the scattering properties of the different hydrometeors, NUBF, and MS effects, which significantly reduces the ability of the DPR system to detect hail at the ground.

The novel design provides blue-optimized seeing-limited imaging from 350-560 nm with configurable spectral resolution from 1000-20,000 in a field of view up to 20 '' x 33 ''. Selectable volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings and high-performance dielectric, multilayer silver, and enhanced-aluminum coatings provide end-to-end peak efficiency in excess of 45% while accommodating the future addition of a red channel that will extend wavelength coverage to 1 micron. KCWI takes full advantage of the excellent seeing and dark sky above Maunakea with an available nod-and-shuffle observing mode. The instrument is optimized for observations of faint, diffuse objects such as the intergalactic medium or cosmic web. In this paper, a detailed description of the instrument design is provided with measured performance results from the laboratory test program and 10 nights of on-sky commissioning during the spring of 2017. The KCWI team is lead by Caltech and JPL (project management, design, and implementation) in partnership with the University of California at Santa Cruz (camera optical and mechanical design) and the W. M. Keck Observatory (observatory interfaces).

Carbonaceous chondrites as analogs for the composition and alteration of Ceres	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The mineralogy and geochemistry of Ceres, as constrained by Dawn's instruments, are broadly consistent with a carbonaceous chondrite (CM/CI) bulk composition. Differences explainable by Ceres's more advanced alteration include the formation of Mg-rich serpentine and ammoniated clay; a greater proportion of carbonate and lesser organic matter; amounts of magnetite, sulfide, and carbon that could act as spectral darkening agents; and partial fractionation of water ice and silicates in the interior and regolith. Ceres is not spectrally unique, but is similar to a few other C-class asteroids, which may also have suffered extensive alteration. All these bodies are among the largest carbonaceous chondrite asteroids, and they orbit in the same part of the Main Belt. Thus, the degree of alteration is apparently related to the size of the body. Although the ammonia now incorporated into clay likely condensed in the outer nebula, we cannot presently determine whether Ceres itself formed in the outer solar system and migrated inward or was assembled within the Main Belt, along with other carbonaceous chondrite bodies.

C.; Mest, Scott C.; Neesemann, Adrian			Compositional variability on the surface of 1 Ceres revealed through GRaND measurements of high-energy gamma rays	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												High-energy gamma rays (HEGRs) from Ceres's surface were measured using Dawn's Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND). Models of cosmic-ray-initiated gamma ray production predict that the HEGR flux will inversely vary with single-layer hydrogen concentrations for Ceres-like compositions. The measured data confirm this prediction. The hydrogen-induced variations in HEGR rates were decoupled from the measurements by detrending the HEGR data with Ceres single-layer hydrogen concentrations determined by GRaND neutron measurements. Models indicate that hydrogen-detrended HEGR counting rates correlate with water-free average atomic mass, which is denoted as <A>*. HEGR variations across Ceres's surface are consistent with <A>* variations of +/- 0.5 atomic mass units. Chemical variations in the CM and CI chondrites, our closest analogs to Ceres's surface, suggest that <A>* variations on Ceres are primarily driven by variations in the concentration of Fe, although other elements such as Mg and S could contribute. Dawn observations have shown that Ceres's interior structure and surface composition have been modified by some combination of physical (i.e., ice-rock fractionation) and/or chemical (i.e., alteration) processes that has led to variations in bulk surface chemistry. Locations of the highest inferred <A>* values, and thus possibly the highest Fe and least altered materials, tend to be younger, less cratered surfaces that are broadly associated with the impact ejecta of Ceres's largest craters.

Ceres's global and localized mineralogical composition determined by Dawn's Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR)	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) instrument on the Dawn mission observed Ceres's surface at different spatial resolutions, revealing a nearly uniform global distribution of surface mineralogy. Clearly, Ceres experienced extensive water-related processes and chemical differentiation. The surface is mainly composed of a dark component (carbon, magnetite?), Mg-phyllosilicates, ammoniated clays, carbonates, and salts. The observed species suggest endogenous, global-scale aqueous alteration. While mostly uniform at regional scale, Ceres's surface shows small localized areas with different species and/or variations in abundances. Few local exposures of water ice are seen, especially at higher latitudes. Sodium carbonates have been identified in several areas on the surface, notably in Occator bright faculae. Organic matter has also been discovered in several places, most conspicuously in a large area close to the Ernutet crater. The observed mineralogies, with the presence of ammoniated species and sodium salts, have a strong resemblance to materials found on other bodies of the outer solar system, such as Enceladus. This poses some questions about the original material from which Ceres accreted, suggesting a colder environment for such material with respect to Ceres's present position.

Ambient and cold-temperature infrared spectra and XRD patterns of ammoniated phyllosilicates and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites relevant to Ceres and other solar system bodies	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Mg-phyllosilicate-bearing, dark surface materials on the dwarf planet Ceres have NH4-bearing materials, indicated by a distinctive 3.06m absorption feature. To constrain the identity of the Ceres NH4-carrier phase(s), we ammoniated ground particulates of candidate materials to compare their spectral properties to infrared data acquired by Dawn's Visible and Infrared (VIR) imaging spectrometer. We treated Mg-, Fe-, and Al-smectite clay minerals; Mg-serpentines; Mg-chlorite; and a suite of carbonaceous meteorites with NH4-acetate to exchange ammonium. Serpentines and chlorites showed no evidence for ammoniation, as expected due to their lack of exchangeable interlayer sites. Most smectites showed evidence for ammoniation by incorporation of NH4+ into their interlayers, resulting in the appearance of absorptions from 3.02 to 3.08m. Meteorite samples tested had weak absorptions between 3.0 and 3.1m but showed little clear evidence for enhancement upon ammoniation, likely due to the high proportion of serpentine and other minerals relative to expandable smectite phases or to NH4+ complexing with organics or other constituents. The wavelength position of the smectite NH4 absorption showed no variation between IR spectra acquired under dry-air purge at 25 degrees C and under vacuum at 25 degrees C to -180 degrees C. Collectively, data from the smectite samples show that the precise center wavelength of the characteristic similar to 3.05m v(3) absorption in NH4 is variable and is likely related to the degree of hydrogen bonding of NH4-H2O complexes. Comparison with Dawn VIR spectra indicates that the hypothesis of Mg-saponite as the ammonium carrier phase is the simplest explanation for observed data, and that Ceres dark materials may be like Cold Bokkeveld or Tagish Lake but with proportionally more Mg-smectite.

Mineralogy and temperature of crater Haulani on Ceres	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												We investigate the region of crater Haulani on Ceres with an emphasis on mineralogy as inferred from data obtained by Dawn's Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer (VIR), combined with multispectral image products from the Dawn Framing Camera (FC) so as to enable a clear correlation with specific geologic features. Haulani, which is one of the youngest craters on Ceres, exhibits a peculiar blue visible to near-infrared spectral slope, and has distinct color properties as seen in multispectral composite images. In this paper, we investigate a number of spectral indices: reflectance; spectral slopes; abundance of Mg-bearing and NH4-bearing phyllosilicates; nature and abundance of carbonates, which are diagnostic of the overall crater mineralogy; plus a temperature map that highlights the major thermal anomaly found on Ceres. In addition, for the first time we quantify the abundances of several spectral endmembers by using VIR data obtained at the highest pixel resolution (similar to 0.1km). The overall picture we get from all these evidences, in particular the abundance of Na- and hydrous Na-carbonates at specific locations, confirms the young age of Haulani from a mineralogical viewpoint, and suggests that the dehydration of Na-carbonates in the anhydrous form Na2CO3 may be still ongoing.

Deconstructing the King megafire	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Hypotheses that megafires, very large, high-impact fires, are caused by either climate effects such as drought or fuel accumulation due to fire exclusion with accompanying changes to forest structure have long been alleged and guided policy, but their physical basis remains untested. Here, unique airborne observations and microscale simulations using a coupled weather-wildland-fire-behavior model allowed a recent megafire, the King Fire, to be deconstructed and the relative impacts of forest structure, fuel load, weather, and drought on fire size, behavior, and duration to be separated. Simulations reproduced observed details including the arrival at an inclined canyon, a 25-km run, and later slower growth and features. Analysis revealed that fire-induced winds that equaled or exceeded ambient winds and fine-scale airflow undetected by surface weather networks were primarily responsible for the fire's rapid growth and size. Sensitivity tests varied fuel moisture and amount across wide ranges and showed that both drought and fuel accumulation effects were secondary, limited to sloped terrain where they compounded each other, and, in this case, unable to significantly impact the final extent. Compared to standard data, fuel models derived solely from remote sensing of vegetation type and forest structure improved simulated fire progression, notably in disturbed areas, and the distribution of burn severity. These results point to self-reinforcing internal dynamics rather than external forces as a means of generating this and possibly other outlier fire events. Hence, extreme fires need not arise from extreme fire environment conditions. Kinematic models used in operations do not capture fire-induced winds and dynamic feedbacks so can underestimate megafire events. The outcomes provided a nuanced view of weather, forest structure, fuel accumulation, and drought impacts on landscape-scale fire behaviorroles that can be misconstrued using correlational analyses between area burned and macroscale climate data or other exogenous factors. A practical outcome is that fuel treatments should be focused on sloped terrain, where factors multiply, for highest impact.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				SEP	2018	28	6					1565	1580		10.1002/eap.1752							WOS:000443555100016	29797684

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to support the distribution of data in support of commensal data analysis. The protocol, vys, is designed to provide access to a high time resolution data stream while a primary observation continues with the typical (lower) time resolution data stream. This form of dual time resolution, commensal observing has been implemented to enable the search for millisecond astrophysical transient events by a new, dedicated compute cluster located at the VLA. The fast transient detection system, realfast, performs real-time analysis in situ to detect events of interest and record relatively short duration data "cut-outs" of those events. By selectively recording high time resolution data, provided by vys at rates of up to 1.4 GBs(-1), realfast will reduce the recorded data volume by an estimated factor of up to 1000. This makes it possible to search for transients commensally in a high data rate stream over the thousands of hours needed to find the rarest events.

The spectacular lensing system consists of an edge-on foreground disk galaxy at z = 0.22 and a nearly complete Einstein ring of an intrinsic ultra-luminous infrared (IR) galaxy at z = 1.03. Is this high IR luminosity powered by pure star formation (SF) or also an active galactic nucleus (AGN)? Previous nebular line diagnostics indicate that it is star formation dominated. We perform a 27-band multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling including the new SOFIA/HAWC+ data to constrain the fractional AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity. The AGN fraction in the IR turns out to be negligible. In addition, J1429-0028 serves as a testbed for comparing SED results from different models/templates and SED codes (MAGPHYS, SED3FIT, and CIGALE). We stress that star formation history is the dominant source of uncertainty in the derived stellar mass (as high as a factor of similar to 10) even in the case of extensive photometric coverage. Furthermore, the detection of a source at z similar to 1 with SOFIA/HAWC+ demonstrates the potential of utilizing this facility for distant galaxy studies including the decomposition of SF/AGN components, which cannot be accomplished with other current facilities.

The scattering model accounted for combined effects from periodicity in soil and vegetation, and changes in plant structure and phenology. The model estimates were compared with observations during the two growing seasons in North Central Florida. The unbiased average root-mean-square (rms) differences between the model and observations decreased from 5 to 1.31 dB when these combined effects were included. During the early stage, direct scattering from soil was the primary scattering mechanism, and as the vegetation increased, the interactions between stems and soil became the dominant scattering mechanism. The most sensitive soil parameters were moisture content and rms height, and vegetation parameters were the widths of stems, leaves, and ears, and the stem water content. This paper demonstrates that it is necessary to consider periodicity and plant structural effects in algorithms to retrieve realistic soil moisture in agricultural terrain.

Companions that share the same age, distance, and metallicity as their host while being on large enough orbits to be studied as "isolated" objects make prime targets for spectroscopic observations, and they are valuable benchmark objects for exoplanet atmosphere models. The search strategy is based on deep imaging in multiple bands across the near-infrared domain For all 177 objects of our sample, z(ab)', J, [3.6], and [4.5] images were obtained with CFHT/MegaCam, GEMINI/GMOS, CFHT/WIRCam, GEMINI/Flamingos-2, and Spitzer IIRAC. Using this set of four images per target, we searched for sources with red z(ab)' and [3.6]-[4.5] colors, typically reaching good completeness down to 2 M-J(up) companions, while going down to 1 M-J(up) for some targets, at separations of 1000-5000 au. The search yielded four candidate companions with the expected colors, but they were all rejected through follow-up proper motion observations.

VII. Discovery of a Nearby Sirius-like White Dwarf System (HD 169889)	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Monitoring the long-term radial velocity (RV) and acceleration of nearby stars has been proven as an effective method for directly detecting binary and substellar companions. Some fraction of nearby RV trend systems are expected to be comprised of compact objects that likewise induce a systemic Doppler signal. In this paper, we report the discovery of a white dwarf (WD) companion found to orbit the nearby (pi = 28.297 +/- 0.066 mas) G9 V star HD. 169889. High-contrast imaging observations using NIRC2 at the W. M. Keck Observatory and LMIRCam at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) Observatory uncover the (Delta H = 9.76 +/- 0.16,Delta L' = 9.60 +/- 0.03) companion at an angular separation of 0.'' 8 (28 au). Thirteen years of precise Doppler observations reveal a steep linear acceleration in the RV time series and place a dynamical constraint on the companion mass of M >= 0.369 +/- 0.010 M-circle dot. This "Sirius-like" system adds to the census of WD companions suspected to be missing from surveys of in the solar neighborhood.

Simultaneous Search for Prompt Radio Emission Associated with the Short GRB 170112A Using the All-sky Imaging Capability of the OVRO-LWA	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We have conducted the most sensitive low-frequency (below 100 MHz) search to date for prompt, low-frequency radio emission associated with short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA). The OVRO-LWA's nearly full-hemisphere field of view (similar to 20,000 square degrees) allows us to search for low-frequency (sub-100 MHz) counterparts for a large sample of the subset of GRB events for which prompt radio emission has been predicted. Following the detection of short GRB 170112A by Swift, we used all-sky OVRO-LWA images spanning one hour prior to and two hours following the GRB event to search for a transient source coincident with the position of GRB 170112A. We detect no transient source to within a 3 sigma flux density limit of 4.5. Jy at 13 s timescales for frequencies spanning 27-84. MHz. We place constraints on a number of models predicting prompt, low-frequency radio emission accompanying short GRBs and their potential binary neutron star merger progenitors, and place an upper limit of L-radio/L gamma less than or similar to 3.5 x 10(-6) on the fraction of energy released in the prompt radio emission, under the assumptions of negligible scattering of the radio pulse and beaming of emission along the line of sight. These observations serve as a pilot effort for a program targeting a wider sample of both short and long GRBs with the OVRO-LWA, including bursts with confirmed redshift measurements that are critical to placing constraining limits on prompt radio emission models, as well as a program for the follow-up of gravitational wave compact binary coalescence events detected by advanced LIGO and Virgo.

A Mid-IR Selected Changing-look Quasar and Physical Scenarios for Abrupt AGN Fading	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We report a new changing-look quasar, WISE. J105203.55+151929.5 at z = 0.303, found by identifying highly mid-IR-variable quasars in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. (WISE)/Near-Earth Object WISE Reactivation (NEOWISE) data stream. Compared to multiepoch mid-IR photometry of a large sample of SDSS-confirmed quasars, WISE. J1052+1519. is an extreme photometric outlier, fading by more than a factor of two at 3.4 and 4.6 mu m since 2009. Swift target-of-opportunity observations in 2017 show even stronger fading in the soft X-rays compared to the ROSAT detection of this source in 1995, with at least a factor of 15 decrease. We obtained second-epoch spectroscopy with the Palomar telescope in 2017 that, when compared with the 2006 archival SDSS spectrum, reveals that the broad H beta emission has vanished and that the quasar has become significantly redder. The two most likely interpretations for this dramatic change are source fading or obscuration, where the latter is strongly disfavored by the mid-IR data. We discuss various physical scenarios that could cause such changes in the quasar luminosity over this timescale, and favor changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk that occur on the thermal and heating/cooling front timescales. We discuss possible physical triggers that could cause these changes, and predict the multiwavelength signatures that could distinguish these physical scenarios.

Observed warming over northern South America has an anthropogenic origin	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												We investigate whether the recently observed trends in daily maximum and minimum near-surface air temperature (Tmax and Tmin, respectively) over South America (SA) are consistent with the simulated response of Tmin and Tmax to anthropogenic forcing. Results indicate that the recently observed warming in the dry seasons is well beyond the range of natural (internal) variability. In the wet season the natural modes of variability explain a substantial portion of Tmin and Tmax variability. We demonstrate that the large-scale component of greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing is detectable in dry-seasonal warming. However, none of the global and regional climate change projections reproduce the observed warming of up to 0.6 K/Decade in Tmax in 1983-2012 over northern SA during the austral spring (SON). Thus, besides the global manifestation of GHG forcing, other external drivers have an imprint. Using aerosols-only forcing simulations, our results provide evidence that anthropogenic aerosols also have a detectable influence in SON and that the indirect effect of aerosols on cloud's lifetime is more compatible with the observed record. In addition, there is an increasing trend in the observed incoming solar radiation over northern SA in SON, which is larger than expected from natural (internal) variability alone. We further show that in the dry seasons the spread of projected trends based on the RCP4.5 scenario derived from 30 CMIP5 models encompasses the observed area-averaged trends in Tmin and Tmax. This may imply that the observed excessive warming in the dry seasons serve as an illustration of plausible future expected change in the region.				von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012	von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069												0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2018	51	5-6					1901	1914		10.1007/s00382-017-3988-z							WOS:000442433200017

Furthermore, high-quality station velocities are of great importance for the prediction of future station coordinates, which are fundamental for several geodetic applications. In this study, we investigate the performance of predictions from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) terrestrial reference frames (TRFs) based on Kalman filtering. The predictions are computed by extrapolating the deterministic part of the coordinate model. As observational data, we used over 4000 VLBI sessions between 1980 and the middle of 2016. In order to study the predictions, we computed VLBI TRF solutions only from the data until the end of 2013. The period of 2014 until 2016.5 was used to validate the predictions of the TRF solutions against the measured VLBI station coordinates. To assess the quality, we computed average WRMS values from the coordinate differences as well as from estimated Helmert transformation parameters, in particular, the scale. We found that the results significantly depend on the level of process noise used in the filter. While larger values of process noise allow the TRF station coordinates to more closely follow the input data (decrease in WRMS of about 45%), the TRF predictions exhibit larger deviations from the VLBI station coordinates after 2014 (WRMS increase of about 15%). On the other hand, lower levels of process noise improve the predictions, making them more similar to those of solutions without process noise. Furthermore, our investigations show that additionally estimating annual signals in the coordinates does not significantly impact the results. Finally, we computed TRF solutions mimicking a potential real-time TRF and found significant improvements over the other investigated solutions, all of which rely on extrapolating the coordinate model for their predictions, with WRMS reductions of almost 50%.

The Gas Composition and Deep Cloud Structure of Jupiter's Great Red Spot	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We have obtained high-resolution spectra of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) between 4.6-5.4 mu m using telescopes on Mauna Kea to derive gas abundances and to constrain its cloud structure between 0.5-5 bars. We used line profiles of deuterated methane (CH3D). at 4.66 mu m to infer the presence of an opaque cloud at 5 +/- 1 bars. From thermochemical models, this is almost certainly a water cloud. We also used the strength of Fraunhofer lines in the GRS to obtain the ratio of reflected sunlight to thermal emission. The level of the reflecting layer was constrained to be at 570 +/- 30 mbar based on fitting strong NH3 lines at 5.32 mu m. We identify this layer as an ammonia cloud based on the temperature where gaseous NH3 condenses. We found evidence for a strongly absorbing but not totally opaque cloud layer at pressures deeper than 1.3 bars by combining Cassini/CIRS spectra of the GRS at 7.18 mu m with ground-based spectra at 5 mu m. This is consistent with the predicted level of an NH4SH cloud. We also constrained the vertical profile of H2O and NH3. The GRS spectrum is matched by a saturated H2O profile above an opaque water cloud at 5 bars. The pressure of the water cloud constrains Jupiter's O/H ratio to be at least 1.1 times solar. The NH3 mole fraction is 200 +/- 50 ppm for pressures between 0.7-5 bars. Its abundance is 40 ppm at the estimated pressure of the reflecting layer. We obtained 0.8 +/- 0.2 ppm for PH3, which is a factor of 2 higher than in the warm collar surrounding the GRS. We detected all five naturally occurring isotopes of germanium in GeH4 in the GRS. We obtained an average value of 0.35 +/- 0.05 ppb for GeH4. Finally, we measured 0.8 +/- 0.2 ppb for CO in the deep atmosphere.

Community Targets of JWST's Early Release Science Program: Evaluation of WASP-63b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We present observations of WASP-63b by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part of "A Preparatory Program to Identify the Single Best Transiting Exoplanet for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Science (ERS)." WASP-63b is one of the community targets under consideration for the JWST ERS program. We present a spectrum derived from a single observation by HST Wide Field Camera. 3 in the near-infrared. We engaged groups across the transiting exoplanet community to participate in the analysis of the data and present results from each. Extraction of the transmission spectrum by several independent analyses find an H2O absorption feature with varying degrees of significance ranging from 1 sigma to 3 sigma. The feature, in all cases, is muted in comparison to a clear atmosphere at solar composition. The reasons for the muting of this feature are ambiguous due to a degeneracy between clouds and composition. The data does not yield robust detections of any molecular species other than H2O. The group was motivated to perform an additional set of retrieval exercises to investigate an apparent bump in the spectrum at similar to 1.55 mu m. We explore possible disequilibrium chemistry and find this feature is consistent with super-solar HCN abundance but it is questionable if the required mixing ratio of HCN is chemically and physically plausible. The ultimate goal of this study is to vet WASP-63b as a potential community target to best demonstrate the capabilities and systematics of JWST instruments for transiting exoplanet science. In the case of WASP-63b, the presence of a detectable water feature indicates that WASP-63b remains a plausible target for JWST observations.

High-contrast imaging of HD 163296 with the Keck/NIRC2 L ' -band vortex coronograph	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We present observations of the nearby (D similar to 100 pc) Herbig star HD 163296 taken with the vortex coronograph at Keck/NIRC2 in the L' band (3.7 mu m) to search for planetary mass companions in the ringed disc surrounding this pre-main-sequence star. The images reveal an arc-like region of scattered light from the disc surface layers that is likely associated with the first bright ring detected with ALMA in the lambda= 1.3mm dust continuum at similar to 65 au. We also detect a point-like source at similar to 0.5 arcsec projected separation in the north-east direction, close to the inner edge of the second gap in the millimetre images. Comparing the point source photometry with the atmospheric emission models of non-accreting giant planets, we obtain a mass of 6-7 M-J for a putative protoplanet, assuming a system age of 5 Myr. Based on the contrast at a 95 per cent level of completeness calculated on the emission-free regions of our images, we set upper limits for the masses of giant planets of 8-15 M-J, 4.5-6.5 M-J, and 2.5-4.0M(J) at the locations of the first, second, and third gap in the millimetre dust continuum, respectively. Further deep, high-resolution thermal IR imaging of the HD 163296 system are warranted to confirm the presence and nature of the point source and to better understand the structure of the dust disc.

The big lobe of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet: morphological and spectrophotometric evidences of layering as from OSIRIS data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Between 2014 and 2016, ESA's Rosetta OSIRIS cameras acquired multiple-filters images of the layered nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. No correlation between layers disposition and surface spectral variegation has been observed so far. This paper investigates possible spectral differences among decametre-thickness outcropping layers of the biggest lobe of the comet by means of OSIRIS image dataset. A two-classes maximum likelihood classification was applied on consolidated outcrops and relative deposits identified on post-perihelion multispectral images of the big lobe. We distinguished multispectral data on the basis of the structural elevation of the onion-shell Ellipsoidal Model of 67P. The spatial distribution of the two classes displays a clear dependence on the structural elevation, with the innermost class resulting over 50 per cent brighter than the outermost one. Consolidated cometarymaterials located at different structural levels are characterized by different brightness and revealed due to the selective removal of large volumes. This variegation can be attributed to a different texture of the outcrop surface and/or to a different content of refractory materials.

In this work, we present results from a coordinated observing campaign to measure planet masses and eccentricities that combines radial velocity measurements from Keck/HIRES and transit-timing measurements from K2 and Spitzer. K2-24b and c have low, but nonzero, eccentricities of e(1)similar to e(2) similar to 0.08. The low observed eccentricities provide clues to the formation and dynamical evolution of K2-24b and K2-24c, suggesting that they could be the result of stochastic gravitational interactions with a turbulent protoplanetary disk, among other mechanisms. K2-24b and c are 19.0(-2.)(1)(+2.2 )M(circle plus) and 15.4(-1.8)(+1.9) M-circle plus, respectively; K2-24c is 20% less massive than K2-24b, despite being 40% larger. Their large sizes and low masses imply large envelope fractions, which we estimate at 26(-3)(+3)% and 52(-3)(+5%). In particular, K2-24c' s large envelope presents an intriguing challenge to the standard model of core-nucleated accretion that predicts the onset of runaway accretion when f(env) approximate to 50%.

T.; Gjerloev, Jesper; Sun, Wei; Wang, Y.; Ou, Jiaming; Ge, Yasong			Coupling of semiannual and annual variations in the SuperMAG SML and SMU indices	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												It is found that the coupling between the solar wind and polar geomagnetic activity cause the annual and semiannual variation of auroral electrojet. The wavelet spectrum of the SuperMAG index, SML and SMU shows that both of the semiannual and annual variations are permanent features, and spectral power of the annual period of SML and SMU are stronger than that of the semiannual period. Due to coupling of the annual variation and the semiannual variation of SML, the diurnal variation of SML in summer months is not well correlated with results anticipated from the previous principle hypotheses [McIntosh, 1959; Russell and McPherron, 1973; Svalgaard, 1977; Cliver et al., 2000; Newell et al., 2013]. The annual/semiannual variation of SML and SMU is typically coupled together and is dependent on the local time and latitudinal variations of ionospheric conductivity and the electric field. A new index, the annual-corrected SMO index (SMO*), was suggested to indicate the semiannual variation of the westward auroral electrojet (SML). The seasonal-UT distribution of SMO* has good correlation with that predicted by the equinoctial hypothesis [McIntosh, 1959; Svalgaard, 2011].																	0032-0633					SEP 1	2018	158						87	95		10.1016/j.pss.2018.05.001							WOS:000440266000011						
J	Jain, A				Jain, Abhinandan			An analytical workbench for system level multibody dynamics	MULTIBODY SYSTEM DYNAMICS												There has been considerable focus in the research community on developing accurate models, as well as on fast algorithms for solving the equations of motion of multibody systems required for simulating the dynamics of such systems. This paper focuses on the less explored complementary topic of evaluating system level dynamics properties of multibody systems. Examples of such dynamics properties are the system mass matrix, Jacobians and sensitivities of these quantities. These system level quantities manifest the dynamical properties of the system and are important for design, optimization and control. While such system level quantities are often used in theory to describe the underlying mathematical physics of the systems, due to their complexity there is a lack of a systematic methods for computing them when desired. In this paper we describe a computational workbench framework that provides a bridge between theory and the computation of such system level quantities. This workbench framework builds upon the Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA) that has been used for analysis and algorithm development for multibody dynamics. Mathematical operator expressions from the SOA can be transcribed literally to the workbench command line to allow the easy evaluation of complex dynamics quantities. We use a specific Python/C++ implementation of a workbench called PyCraft to illustrate the structure and use of such a workbench. Several examples illustrating operator-based analysis and corresponding PyCraft-based computation are included.																	1384-5640	1573-272X				SEP	2018	44	1					57	79		10.1007/s11044-018-9623-x							WOS:000440805700003

We use Spot-5 images to track the migration of 64 Barchan dunes in Qatar using the COSI-Corr technique. We estimate the volume of the dunes using a scaling law calibrated from one particular dune, which was surveyed in the field. Using volume and migration rate, we determine the sand flux from a single dune, Qnunes, and scale this estimate to the whole dune field. We compare the measured sand flux with those derived from wind velocity measurements at a local meteorological station as well as with those predicted from ERA-Interim (a Global Circulation Model). The comparison revealed that the wind velocity predicted by ERA-Interim is inappropriate to calculate the sand flux. This is due to the 6-h sampling rate and to systematic bias revealed by a comparison with the local wind data. We describe a simple procedure to correct for these effects. With the proposed correction, similar sand flux are predicted using the local and ERA-Interim data, independently of the value of the value of the shear velocity threshold, 11,4. The predicted sand flux is about 65% of Q(Dunes.) The agreement is best assuming the value u(*t) = 0.244 m/s, which is only slightly larger than the value of u(*t)= 0.2612 m/s estimated based in the sand granulometry measured from field samples. The influence of the dune topography on the wind velocity field could explain the underestimation. In any case, the study demonstrates the possibility of validating GCM model and calibrating aeolian sand transport laws using remote sensing measurements of dune dynamics and highlights the caveats associated to such an approach. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Implementation of a vector-based river network routing scheme in the community WRF-Hydro modeling framework for flood discharge simulation	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Continental-scale flood discharge modeling requires a high level of efficiency and flexibility. To this end, this study documents the implementation and application of a vector-based river routing model in the community WRF-Hydro modeling framework. Using Hurricane Ike as a case study, the hybrid vector-grid modeling framework's sensitivity to the land grid resolution and the coupling interface is assessed. Results show the model is more sensitive to the coupling interface than the grid resolution, and a 1-km land grid with an area-weighted coupling interface exhibits the optimal simulation results. A geographic information system (GIS) based approach is adopted to improve the regional representativeness of the flow travel time estimation. The model's computational efficiency and complexity are compared to a grid-based routing scheme, demonstrating its advantages for large-scale "offline" hydrological applications with GIS-supported features. Trade-offs between the modeling efficiency and complexity are then discussed to inform future large-scale flood prediction applications.

Footprint-scale assessments of these products are generally restricted to limited number of densely-instrumented validation sites. However, by taking active and passive soil moisture products together with a third independent soil moisture estimates via land surface modeling, triple collocation (TC) can be applied to estimate the correlation metric of satellite soil moisture products (versus an unknown ground truth) over a quasi-global domain. Here, an assessment of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture retrievals via TC is presented. Considering the potential violation of TC error assumptions, the impact of active-passive and satellite-model error cross correlations on the TC-derived inter-comparison results is examined at in situ sites using quadruple collocation analysis. In addition, confidence intervals for the TC-estimated correlation metric are constructed from moving-block bootstrap sampling designed to preserve the temporal persistence of the original (unevenly-sampled) soil moisture time series. This study is the first to apply TC to obtain a robust global-scale cross-assessment of SMAP, SMOS and ASCAT soil moisture retrieval accuracy in terms of anomaly temporal correlation. Our results confirm the overall advantage of SMAP (with a global average anomaly correlation of 0.76) over SMOS (0.66) and ASCAT (0.63) that has been established in several recent regional, ground-based studies. SMAP is also the best-performing product over the majority of applicable land pixels (52%), although SMOS and ASCAT each shows advantage in distinct geographic regions.

On deviations from free-radial outflow in the inner coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ICARUS												The Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System (OSIRIS) onboard the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft acquired images of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) and its surrounding dust coma starting from May 2014 until September 2016. In this paper we present methods and results from analysis of OSIRIS images regarding the dust outflow in the innermost coma of 67P. The aim is to determine the global dust outflow behaviour and place constraints on physical processes affecting particles in the inner coma. We study the coma region right above the nucleus surface, spanning from the nucleus centre out to a distance of about 50 km comet centric distance (approximately 25 average comet radii). We primarily adopt an approach used by Thomas and Keller (1990) to study the dust outflow. We present the effects on azimuthally-averaged values of the dust reflectance of non-radial flow and non-point-source geometry, acceleration of dust particles, sublimation of icy dust particles after ejection from the surface, dust particle fragmentation, optical depth effects and the influence of gravitationally bound particles. All of these physical processes could modify the observed distribution of light scattered by the dust coma. In the image analysis, profiles of azimuthally averaged dust brightness as a function of impact parameter b (azimuthal average, "(A) over bar -curve") were fitted with a simple function that best fits the shape of our profile curves (f (b; u, v, w, z) = u/b(v) + wb + z). The analytical fit parameters (u, v, w, z), which hold the key information about the dust outflow behaviour, were saved in a comprehensive database. Through statistical analysis of these information, we show that the spatial distribution of dust follows free-radial outflow behaviour (i.e. force-free radial outflow with constant velocity) beyond distances larger than similar to 11.9 km from the comet centre, which corresponds to a relative distance of about 6 average comet radii from the comet centre. Hence, we conclude that beyond this distance, and on average, fragmentation and gravitationally bound particles are negligible processes in determining the optically scattered light distribution in the innermost coma. Closer to the nucleus we observe dust outflow behaviour that deviates from free-radial outflow. A comparison of our result profiles with numerical models using a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach with dust particle distributions calculated using a test particle approach has been used to demonstrate the influence of a complex shape and particle acceleration on the azimuthal average profiles. We demonstrate that, while other effects such as fragmentation or sublimation of dust particles cannot be ruled out, acceleration of the dust particles and effects arising from the shape of the irregular nucleus (non-point source geometry) are sufficient to explain the observed dust outflow behaviour from image data analysis. As a by-product of this work, we have calculated "Af rho" values for the 1/r regime. We found a peak in the coma activity in terms of Af rho (normalised to a phase angle of 90) of similar to 210 cm 20 days after perihelion. Furthermore, based on simplified models of particle motion within bound orbits, it is shown that limits on the total cross-sectional area of bound particles might be derived through further analysis. An example is given. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The sensitivity of solsticial pauses to atmospheric ice and dust in the MarsWRF General Circulation Model	ICARUS												Mars exhibits less atmospheric variability at the solstices than it does during periods nearer the equinoxes. Much of this variability in air temperature and dust activity is attributable to a significant decrease in eastward traveling transient wave amplitudes in the lower atmosphere near the solstice. Previous versions of the Mars Weather Research and Forecasting (MarsWRF) model using only dust radiative forcing have reproduced the nature but not the magnitude of this 'solsticial pause' in atmospheric variability. In this paper, we use a version of MarsWRF that includes a fully-interactive dust and water cycle to simulate winter solsticial pauses under a range of dust and water ice conditions. The upgraded model specifically includes a new hybrid binned/two-moment microphysics model that simulates dust, water ice, and cloud condensation nuclei. The scheme tracks mass and number density for the three particle types throughout the atmosphere and allows advection by resolved winds, mixing by unresolved processes, and sedimentation that depends on particle size and density. Ice and dust particles interact with radiation in the atmosphere using a Mie scattering parameterization that allows for variable particle size and composition. Heterogeneous nucleation and condensation use an adaptive bin size scheme to accurately track the particle size during condensation and sublimation processes. All microphysical processes in the model are calculated within the dynamical timesteps using stability-guaranteed implicit calculations with no sub-timestepping. The impact of the addition of water processes to the model was assessed by comparing simulations with only interactive dust (dry simulations) and ones with a fully-interactive dust and water cycle (wet simulations). In dry simulations with dust storms a solsticial pause occurs in the northern winter with a magnitude (or 'depth') that depends on the opacity of the southern summer dust storms. In wet simulations that include water ice and dust particles, deep solsticial pauses are found in both winter hemispheres. In all simulations that reproduce the solsticial pause, energy and instability analysis suggest that a decrease in baroclinic instability and increase in barotropic energy conversion occurs during the solsticial pause. In dry simulations the decrease in baroclinic instability is caused by increased dust opacity leading to increased thermal static stability. In wet simulations, additional opacity from local cap-edge ice clouds reduces the near surface wind shear and further inhibits baroclinic eddy growth. The wet simulations are in better agreement with observations and tend to support results from other models that include ice cloud radiative effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

M.; Giorgini, Jon D.; Howell, Ellen S.; Magri, Christopher; Nolan, Michael C.; Springmann, Alessondra; Taylor, Patrick A.; Virkki, Anne			A revised shape model of asteroid (216) Kleopatra	ICARUS												We used three different sets of Arecibo delay-Doppler radar images and five well-covered occultations to generate a revised three-dimensional shape model of asteroid (216) Kleopatra with a spatial resolution of similar to 10 km. We find Kleopatra to be a bi-lobate contact binary of overall dimensions 276 x 94 x 78 km +/- 15% and equivalent diameter D-eq = 122 30 km; our uncertainties are upper and lower bounds. Separated binary models are ruled out by multi-chord occultations. Our model is 27% longer than the "dog-bone" model originally published by Ostro et al. (2000) but is similar to their model in the minor and intermediate axes extents. Our model's dimensions are also consistent with more recent ones based on lightcurves, adaptive-optics, and interferometric imaging. We confirm a rotational period of P = 5.385280 h +/- 0.000001 h and a rotation pole at ecliptic longitude and latitude (lambda, beta) = (74 degrees + 20 degrees) 5 degrees. Over its southern hemisphere (the one most frequently observed on Earth), Kleopatra's radar albedo is 0.43 +/- 0.10, consistent with a high near-surface bulk density and, by inference, the high metal content expected for M-class asteroids. However, the radar albedo for equatorial observations is considerably lower and more typical of a dominantly silicate composition. This observation could readily be explained by a relatively thin (1-2 m) silicate mantle over equatorial latitudes. Kleopatra's surface is relatively smooth with a mean slope of 12 degrees at the similar to 10 km baseline scale. Analysis of its geopotential surface suggests loose material will preferentially migrate to the neck, and this is supported by our radar observations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mapping polar atmospheric features on Titan with VIMS: From the dissipation of the northern cloud to the onset of a southern polar vortex	ICARUS												We have analyzed the complete archive of the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data in order to monitor and analyze the evolution of the clouds and haze coverage at both poles of Titan during the entire Cassini mission. Our objective is to give a cartographic synopsis from a VIMS perspective, to provide a global view of the seasonal evolution of Titan's atmosphere over the poles. We leave the detailed comparison with the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) data sets to further studies. We have computed global hyperspectral mosaics for each of the 127 targeted flybys of Titan to produce synthetic color maps emphasizing the main atmospheric features. The north pole appears fully covered by a huge cloud as soon as the first observations in 2004 and up to the equinox in 2009 (Le Mouelic et al., 2012). The northern skies then became progressively clearer, after the circulation turnover in 2009, revealing the underlying lakes and seas to the optical instruments up to 2017. The reverse situation is observed over the south pole, which was mostly clear of such a high obscuring cloud during the first years of the mission, but started to develop a polar cloud in 2012. This feature grew up month after month until the end of the mission in 2017, with a poleward latitudinal extent of 75 degrees S in 2013 up to 58 degrees S in April 2017. Thanks to the spectral capabilities of VIMS, we have detected HCN spectral signatures over the north pole in almost all flybys between 2004 and 2008. These HCN signatures started then to show up over the south pole in almost all flybys between 2012 and 2017, so perfectly matching the timing and spatial extent of the northern and southern polar atmospheric features.

J	Kwok, R; Kacimi, S				Kwok, Ron; Kacimi, Sahra			Three years of sea ice freeboard, snow depth, and ice thickness of the Weddell Sea from Operation IceBridge and CryoSat-2	CRYOSPHERE												We examine the variability of sea ice freeboard, snow depth, and ice thickness in three years (2011, 2014, and 2016) of repeat surveys of an IceBridge (OIB) transect across the Weddell Sea. Averaged over this transect, ice thickness ranges from 2.40 +/- 1.07 (2011) to 2.60 +/- 1.15 m (2014) and snow depth from 35.8 +/- 11.5 (2016) to 43.6 +/- 10.2 cm (2014), suggesting a highly variable but broadly thicker ice cover compared to that inferred from drilling and ship-based measurements. Spatially, snow depth and ice thickness are higher in the more deformed ice of the western Weddell. The impact of undersampling the thin end of the snow depth distribution on the regional statistics, due to the resolution of the snow radar, is assessed. Radar freeboards (uncompensated for snow thickness) from CryoSat-2 (CS-2) sampled along the same transect are consistently higher (by up to 8 cm) than those computed using OIB data. This suggests radar scattering that originates above the snow-ice interface, possibly due to salinity in the basal layer of the snow column. Consequently, sea ice thicknesses computed using snow depth estimates solely from differencing OIB and CS-2 freeboards (without snow radar) are therefore generally higher; mean differences in sea ice thickness along a transect are up to similar to 0.6 m higher (in 2014). This analysis is relevant to the use of differences between ICESat-2 and CS-2 freeboards to estimate snow depth for ice thickness calculations. Our analysis also suggests that, even with these expected biases, this is an improvement over the assumption that snow depth is equal to the total freeboard, with which the underestimation of thickness could be up to a meter. Importantly, better characterization of the source of these biases is critical for obtaining improved estimates and understanding the limits of retrievals of Weddell Sea ice thickness from satellite altimeters.

Its temporal evolution allows changes (e.g.,acceleration) to be detected in one or more components. Study of the sea-level budget provides constraints on missing or poorly known contributions, such as the unsurveyed deep ocean or the still uncertain land water component. In the context of the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenge entitled "Regional Sea Level and Coastal Impacts", an international effort involving the sea-level community worldwide has been recently initiated with the objective of assessing the various datasets used to estimate components of the sea-level budget during the altimetry era (1993 to present). These datasets are based on the combination of a broad range of space-based and in situ observations, model estimates, and algorithms. Evaluating their quality, quantifying uncertainties and identifying sources of discrepancies between component estimates is extremely useful for various applications in climate research. This effort involves several tens of scientists from about 50 research teams/institutions worldwide (www.wcrp-climate.org/grand-challenges/gc-sea-level, last access: 22 August 2018). The results presented in this paper are a synthesis of the first assessment performed during 2017-2018. We present estimates of the altimetry-based global mean sea level (average rate of 3.1 +/- 0.3mm yr(-1) and acceleration of 0.1 mm yr(-2) over 1993-present), as well as of the different components of the sea-level budget (http://doi.org/10.17882/54854, last access: 22 August 2018). We further examine closure of the sea-level budget, comparing the observed global mean sea level with the sum of components. Ocean thermal expansion, glaciers, Greenland and Antarctica contribute 42%, 21%, 15% and 8% to the global mean sea level over the 1993-present period. We also study the sea-level budget over 2005-present, using GRACE-based ocean mass estimates instead of the sum of individual mass components. Our results demonstrate that the global mean sea level can be closed to within 0.3 mm yr(-1) (1 sigma). Substantial uncertainty remains for the land water storage component, as shown when examining individual mass contributions to sea level.

Thermal inertia and roughness of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from MIRO and VIRTIS observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Aims. Using data from the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we evaluate the physical properties of the surface and subsurface of the nucleus and derive estimates for the thermal inertia (TI) and roughness in several regions on the largest lobe of the nucleus. Methods. We have developed a thermal model to compute the temperature on the surface and in the uppermost subsurface layers of the nucleus. The model takes heat conduction, self-heating, and shadowing effects into account. To reproduce the brightness temperatures measured by the MIRO instrument, the thermal model is coupled to a radiative transfer model to derive the TI. To reproduce the spatially resolved infrared measurements of the VIRTIS instrument, the thermal model is coupled to a radiance model to derive the TI and surface roughness. These methods are applied to Rosetta data from September 2014. Results. The resulting TI values from both instruments are broadly consistent with each other. From the millimetre channel on MIRO, we determine the TI in the subsurface to be < 80 JK(-1) m(2) s 0 : 5 for the Seth, Ash, and Aten regions. The submillimetre channel implies similar results but also suggests that higher values could be possible. A low TI is consistent with other MIRO measurements and in situ data from the MUPUS instrument at the final landing site of Philae. The VIRTIS results give a best-fitting value of 80 JK(-1) m(2) s 0 : 5 and values in the range 40-160 JK(-1) m(2) s 0 : 5 in the same areas. These observations also allow the subpixel scale surface roughness to be estimated and compared to images from the OSIRIS camera. The VIRTIS data imply that there is significant roughness on the infrared scale below the resolution of the available shape model and that, counter-intuitively, visually smooth terrain (centimetre scale) can be rough at small (micrometre-millimetre) scales, and visually rough terrain can be smooth at small scales.

Great Expectations: Plans and Predictions for New Horizons Encounter With Kuiper Belt Object 2014 MU69 ("Ultima Thule")	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The New Horizons encounter with the cold classical Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 (informally named "Ultima Thule," hereafter Ultima) on 1 January 2019 will be the first time a spacecraft has ever closely observed one of the free-orbiting small denizens of the Kuiper Belt. Related to but not thought to have formed in the same region of the solar system as the comets that been explored so far, it will also be the most distant, and most primitive body yet visited by spacecraft. In this letter we begin with a brief overview of cold classical Kuiper Belt objects, of which Ultima is a prime example. We give a short preview of our encounter plans. We note what is currently known about Ultima from Earth-based observations. We then review our expectations and capabilities to evaluate Ultima's composition, surface geology, structure, near space environment, small moons, rings, and the search for activity. Plain Language Summary The letter discusses the current state-of-knowledge for the cold classical Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69, the target of a close encounter by NASA's New Horizon spacecraft on 1 January 2019. We also review our encounter plans and make broad speculative predictions as to might be revealed by our observations. New Horizons will fly to within 3,500 km of 2014 MU69 (informally named "Ultima Thule"), acquiring images with pixel scale resolutions significantly better than 100 m/pixel). We plan to obtain topography derived from stereo imaging and body shape. Our spectroscopic observations potentially could detect H2O, CH4, N-2, CH3OH, and NH3, depending on their brightness and abundance on the surface. We will also search for evidence of outgassing, small moons, and rings. This exploration will transform Kuiper Belt and Kuiper Belt object science from a purely astronomical regime, to a geological and geophysical regime, which radically changed paradigms when the same happened to asteroids and comets in past decades.

Here we use 23 years of NASA satellite and airborne laser altimetry from the Airborne Topographic Mapper; Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor; and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite to generate time series of elevation change to compare with surface mass balance products from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model and from the Modele Atmospherique Regional. For 1994-2016, the results agree at the 15-26% level, with the largest discrepancy in North Greenland. During the cold summer of 2015, the root-mean-square discrepancy is 40% in the north, 30% in the southwest, and 18-25% at low elevation. The difference drops to 23% in the southwest and 14% at low elevation during the 2016 warm summer. Plain Language Summary Snowelt/ice melt is a major component of the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet and its contribution to global sea level rise. Here we evaluate the accuracy of regional atmospheric climate models at reconstructing ice melt/snowmelt in Greenland for the first time using 23 years of thousands of kilometers of laser altimetry data. Such study was not possible in the past due to a lack of long-term, geographically diverse, in situ data. We find that the regional climate models track down the long-term trend in snowmelt/ice melt with remarkable accuracy across Greenland and do very well in warm summers, but we caution that model performance degrades at the regional level, for example, in North Greenland.

Ocean-Induced Melt Triggers Glacier Retreat in Northwest Greenland	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In recent decades, tidewater glaciers in Northwest Greenland contributed significantly to sea level rise but exhibited a complex spatial pattern of retreat. Here we use novel observations of bathymetry and water temperature from NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland mission to quantify the role of warm, salty Atlantic Water in controlling the evolution of 37 glaciers. Modeled ocean-induced undercutting of calving margins compared with ice advection and ice front retreat observed by satellites from 1985 to 2015 indicate that 35 glaciers retreated when cumulative anomalies in ocean-induced undercutting rose above the range of seasonal variability of calving-front positions, while two glaciers standing on shallow sills and colder water did not retreat. Deviations in the observed timing of retreat are explained by residual uncertainties in bathymetry, inefficient mixing of waters in shallow fjords, and the presence of small floating sections. Overall, warmer ocean temperature triggered the retreat, but calving processes dominate ablation (71%).

J	Kalousova, K; Sotin, C				Kalousova, Klara; Sotin, Christophe			Melting in High-Pressure Ice Layers of Large Ocean Worlds-Implications for Volatiles Transport	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A high-pressure ice layer controls the exchange of heat and material between the silicate core and the ocean of Ganymede and Titan. We have shown (Kalousova et al., 2018, ) that a temperate (partially molten) layer is always present at the ocean interface. Another temperate layer with a few percent of water may be present at the silicates interface for low values of Rayleigh number. We derive scaling laws to predict the critical value under which this temperate layer exists and the amount of generated melt. The presence of liquid water in contact with silicates was probably limited to the early history, providing a pathway for the transfer of salts and volatiles like Ar-40 to the ocean. We also derive scaling laws for the water outflow velocity and for the top temperate layer thickness. These laws can be used to model the global thermal and compositional evolution of large ocean worlds. Plain Language Summary Ocean worlds, where a deep global ocean is present below the icy crust, provide an interesting habitable environment where life may exist. On Enceladus, which is small, and Europa, where the H2O/silicate (water/rock) ratio is small, the global ocean is in direct contact with the silicates. On Titan and Ganymede, where this ratio is large, a layer of high-pressure (HP) ice is present between the ocean and the rocky core. This paper shows that early in their evolution, the lower part of this HP ice layer was temperate (porous ice with water in the pores). Such a temperate layer enables a silicates-ocean exchange of salts and volatiles such as Ar-40 that was measured in Titan's atmosphere by the Cassini mission. It also provides a potentially habitable environment in Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system that will be studied by the ESA JUICE mission.

Ring-Mold Craters on Ceres: Evidence for Shallow Subsurface Water Ice Sources	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												One of the main tasks of the Dawn mission is to characterize the potentially ice-rich crust of the dwarf planet Ceres. Ongoing studies reveal morphological features related to ice-rich material such as pits or particular landslides. Here we report the identification of ring-mold craters within the huge impact crater Occator. The Cerean ring-mold craters exhibit strong morphological similarities to the ring-mold craters on Mars, where ice-rich material is thought to be involved in such crater development. We discuss the occurrence of water ice reservoirs in the subsurface and assume that ice-rich material likely plays an important role in the development of ring-mold craters on Ceres. The occurrence of ring-mold craters on the surface of Ceres is not only a sign of water ice reservoirs in the subsurface but can also be used for the study of habitable zones on planetary bodies. Plain Language Summary One of the main tasks of the Dawn mission is to characterize the potentially ice-rich crust of the dwarf planet Ceres. Ongoing studies reveal morphological features related to ice-rich material such as pits or particular landslides. Here we report the identification of a special type of craters, so-called ring-mold craters. The craters are found within the huge impact crater Occator.

The three ET models were run daily and at a resolution of 25 km for 2002-2007, and based on common input data when possible. The local weights, derived based on the variance of the difference between the tower ET anomalies and the modelled ET anomalies, were made dynamic by estimating them using a 61-day running window centred on each day. These were then extrapolated from the tower locations to the global landscape by regressing them on the main model inputs and derived ET using a neural network. Over the stations, the weighted scheme usefully decreased the random error component, and the weighted ET correlated better with the tower data than a simple average. The global extrapolation produced weights displaying strong seasonal and geographical patterns, which translated into spatiotemporal differences between the ET weighted and simple average ET products. However, the uncertainty of the weights after the extrapolation remained large. Out-sample prediction tests showed that the tower data set, mostly located at temperate regions, had limitations with respect to the representation of different biome and climate conditions. Therefore, even if the local weighting was successful, the extrapolation to a global scale remains problematic, showing a limited added value over the simple average. Overall, this study suggests that merging tower observations and ET products at the timescales and spatial scales of this study is complicated by the tower spatial representativeness, the products' coarse spatial resolution, the nature of the error in both towers and gridded data sets, and how all these factors impact the weights extrapolation from the tower locations to the global landscape.

Dark Energy Survey Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: Cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and weak lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg(2) of griz imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric-redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while "blind" to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat Lambda CDM and wCDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for Lambda CDM) or 7 (for wCDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 x 457 element analytic covariance matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point functions and from their combination obtain S-8 equivalent to sigma(8) (Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.773(-0.020)(+0.026) and Omega(m) = 0.267(-0.017)(+0.030) for Lambda CDM; for wCDM, we find S-8 = 0.782(-0.024)(+0.036) , Omega(m) = 0.284(-0.030)(+0.033), and w = -0.82(-0.20)(+0.21) at 68% C.L. The precision of these DES Y1 constraints rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms. Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for S-8 and Omega(m) are lower than the central values from Planck for both Lambda CDM and wCDM, the Bayes factor indicates that the DES Y1 and Planck data sets are consistent with each other in the context of Lambda CDM. Combining DES Y1 with Planck, baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements from SDSS, 6dF, and BOSS and type Ia supernovae from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis data set, we derive very tight constraints on cosmological parameters: S-8 = 0.802 +/- 0.012 and Omega(m) = 0.298 +/- 0.007 in Lambda CDM and w = -1.00(-0.04)(+0.05) in wCDM. Upcoming Dark Energy Survey analyses will provide more stringent tests of the Lambda CDM model and extensions such as a time-varying equation of state of dark energy or modified gravity.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: Galaxy clustering for combined probes	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We measure the clustering of DES year 1 galaxies that are intended to be combined with weak lensing samples in order to produce precise cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of large-scale structure and lensing correlations. Two-point correlation functions are measured for a sample of 6.6 x 10(5) luminous red galaxies selected using the REDMAGIC algorithm over an area of 1321 square degrees, in the redshift range 0.15 < z < 0.9, split into five tomographic redshift bins. The sample has a mean redshift uncertainty of sigma(z)/(1 + z) = 0.017. We quantify and correct spurious correlations induced by spatially variable survey properties, testing their impact on the clustering measurements and covariance. We demonstrate the sample's robustness by testing for stellar contamination, for potential biases that could arise from the systematic correction, and for the consistency between the two-point auto-and cross-correlation functions. We show that the corrections we apply have a significant impact on the resultant measurement of cosmological parameters, but that the results are robust against arbitrary choices in the correction method. We find the linear galaxy bias in each redshift bin in a fiducial cosmology to be b(sigma(8)/0.81) vertical bar(z=0.24) =1.40 +/- 0.07, b(sigma(8)/0.81) vertical bar(z=0.38) = 1.60 +/- 0.05, (sigma(8)/0.81) vertical bar(z=0.53) = 1.60 +/- 0.04 for galaxies with luminosities L/L-* > 0.5, b(sigma(8)/0.8) vertical bar(z=0.68) = 1.93 +/- 0.04 for L/L-* > 1 and b(sigma(8)/0.81) vertical bar(z=0.83) = 1.98 +/- 0.07 for L/L-* > 1.5, broadly consistent with expectations for the redshift and luminosity dependence of the bias of red galaxies. We show these measurements to be consistent with the linear bias obtained from tangential shear measurements.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: Galaxy-galaxy lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We present galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from 1321 sq. deg. of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 (Y1) data. The lens sample consists of a selection of 660,000 red galaxies with high-precision photometric redshifts, known as redMaGiC, split into five tomographic bins in the redshift range 0.15 < z < 0.9. We use two different source samples, obtained from the METACALIBRATION (26 million galaxies) and IM3SHAPE (18 million galaxies) shear estimation codes, which are split into four photometric redshift bins in the range 0.2 < z < 1.3. We perform extensive testing of potential systematic effects that can bias the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, including those from shear estimation, photometric redshifts, and observational properties. Covariances are obtained from jackknife subsamples of the data and validated with a suite of log-normal simulations. We use the shear-ratio geometric test to obtain independent constraints on the mean of the source redshift distributions, providing validation of those obtained from other photo-z studies with the same data. We find consistency between the galaxy bias estimates obtained from our galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements and from galaxy clustering, therefore showing the galaxymatter cross-correlation coefficient r to be consistent with one, measured over the scales used for the cosmological analysis. The results in this work present one of the three two-point correlation functions, along with galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, used in the DES cosmological analysis of Y1 data, and hence the methodology and the systematics tests presented here provide a critical input for that study as well as for future cosmological analyses in DES and other photometric galaxy surveys.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: Cosmological constraints from cosmic shear	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We use 26 x 10(6) galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 shape catalogs over 1321 deg(2) of the sky to produce the most significant measurement of cosmic shear in a galaxy survey to date. We constrain cosmological parameters in both the flat Lambda CDM and the wCDM models, while also varying the neutrino mass density. These results are shown to be robust using two independent shape catalogs, two independent photo-z calibration methods, and two independent analysis pipelines in a blind analysis. We find a 3.5% fractional uncertainty on sigma(8) (Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.782(- 0.027)(+0.027) at 68% C. L., which is a factor of 2.5 improvement over the fractional constraining power of our DES Science Verification results. In wCDM, we find a 4.8% fractional uncertainty on sigma(8) (Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.777(-0.038)(+0.036) and a dark energy equation-of-state w = -0.95(-0.39)(+0.33) . We find results that are consistent with previous cosmic shear constraints in sigma(8)-Omega(m), and we see no evidence for disagreement of our weak lensing data with data from the cosmic microwave background. Finally, we find no evidence preferring a wCDM model allowing w not equal -1. We expect further significant improvements with subsequent years of DES data, which will more than triple the sky coverage of our shape catalogs and double the effective integrated exposure time per galaxy.

Projecting groundwater storage changes in California's Central Valley	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Accurate and detailed knowledge of California's groundwater is of paramount importance for statewide water resources planning and management, and to sustain a multi-billion-dollar agriculture industry during prolonged droughts. In this study, we use water supply and demand information from California's Department of Water Resources to develop an aggregate groundwater storage model for California's Central Valley. The model is evaluated against 34 years of historic estimates of changes in groundwater storage derived from the United States Geological Survey's Central Valley Hydrologic Model (USGS CVHM) and NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (NASA GRACE) satellites. The calibrated model is then applied to predict future changes in groundwater storage for the years 2015-2050 under various precipitation scenarios from downscaled climate projections. We also discuss and project potential management strategies across different annual supply and demand variables and how they affect changes in groundwater storage. All simulations support the need for collective statewide management intervention to prevent continued depletion of groundwater availability.

ANITA Collaboration	Antarctic surface reflectivity calculations and measurements from the ANITA-4 and HiCal-2 experiments	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												The balloon-borne HiCal radio-frequency (RF) transmitter, in concert with the ANITA radio-frequency receiver array, is designed to measure the Antarctic surface reflectivity in the RF wavelength regime. The amplitude of surface-reflected transmissions from HiCal, registered as triggered events by ANITA, can be compared with the direct transmissions preceding them by O(10) microseconds, to infer the surface power reflection coefficient R. The first HiCal mission (HiCal-1, Jan. 2015) yielded a sample of 100 such pairs, resulting in estimates of R at highly glancing angles (i.e., zenith angles approaching 90 degrees), with measured reflectivity for those events which exceeded extant calculations [P. W. Gorham et al., Journal of Astronomical Instrumentation, 1740002 (2017)]. The HiCal-2 experiment, flying from December 2016-January 2017, provided an improvement by nearly 2 orders of magnitude in our event statistics, allowing a considerably more precise mapping of the reflectivity over a wider range of incidence angles. We find general agreement between the HiCal-2 reflectivity results and those obtained with the earlier HiCal-1 mission, as well as estimates from Solar reflections in the radio-frequency regime [D. Z. Besson et al., Radio Sci. 50, 1 (2015)]. In parallel, our calculations of expected reflectivity have matured; herein, we use a plane-wave expansion to estimate the reflectivity R from both a flat, smooth surface (and, in so doing, recover the Fresnel reflectivity equations) and also a curved surface.

A singular value decomposition framework for retrievals with vertical distribution information from greenhouse gas column absorption spectroscopy measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												We review the singular value decomposition (SVD) framework and use it for quantifying and discerning vertical information in greenhouse gas retrievals from column integrated absorption measurements. While the commonly used traditional Bayesian optimal estimation (OE) assumes a prior distribution in order to regularize the inversion problem, the SVD approach identifies principal components that can be retrieved from the measurement without explicitly specifying a prior mean and prior covariance matrix. We review the SVD method, explicitly recognize the use of an uninformative prior and show it to incur no bias from the choice of the prior. We also make the connection between the SVD method and the pseudo-inverse, which makes it more intuitive and easy to understand. We illustrate the use of the SVD method on an integrated path differential absorption CO2 lidar measurement model and verify our derivations and bias-free properties versus optimal estimation using numerical simulations. In contrast, traditional OE retrievals exhibit bias when the prior mean used in the retrieval differs from the true mean. Hence, the SVD method is particularly useful for situations in which knowledge of the prior mean and prior covariance of the true state (e.g., greenhouse gas profiles) is inadequate.

Juno observations of spot structures and a split tail in Io-induced aurorae on Jupiter	SCIENCE												Jupiter's aurorae are produced in its upper atmosphere when incoming high-energy electrons precipitate along the planet's magnetic field lines. A northern and a southern main auroral oval are visible, surrounded by small emission features associated with the Galilean moons. We present infrared observations, obtained with the Juno spacecraft, showing that in the case of Io, this emission exhibits a swirling pattern that is similar in appearance to a von Karman vortex street. Well downstream of the main auroral spots, the extended tail is split in two. Both of Ganymede's footprints also appear as a pair of emission features, which may provide a remote measure of Ganymede's magnetosphere. These features suggest that the magnetohydrodynamic interaction between Jupiter and its moon is more complex than previously anticipated.

Local methane enhancements above background are diagnosed in the GOSAT data on a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid by estimating the local background as the low (10th-25th) percentiles of the deseasonalized frequency distributions of the data for individual years. Trends in methane enhancements on the 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid are then aggregated nationally and for individual source sectors, using information from state-of-science bottom-up inventories. We find that US methane emissions increased by 2.5 +/- 1.4 % a(-1) (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) over the 7-year period, with contributions from both oil-gas systems (possibly unconventional oil-gas production) and from livestock in the Midwest (possibly swine manure management). Mexican emissions show a decrease that can be attributed to a decreasing cattle population. Canadian emissions show year-to-year variability driven by wetland emissions and correlated with wetland areal extent. The US emission trends inferred from the GOSAT data account for about 20% of the observed increase in global methane over the 2010-2016 period.

Despite existing studies of cross-shelf and on-shelf CDW transports, CDW pathways onto the ABS originating from further offshore have never been investigated. Here, we investigate CDW pathways onto the ABS using a regional ocean model. Simulated CDW tracers from a zonal section across 67 degrees S (SO4P) circulate along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Ross Gyre (RG) and travel into ABS continental shelf after 3-5 years, but source locations are shifted westward by similar to 900 km along S04P in 2001-2006 compared to 2009-2014. We find that simulated on- and off-shelf CDW is similar to 0.1-0.2 degrees C warmer in the 2009-2014 case than in the 2001-2006 case together with changes in simulated ocean circulation. These differences are primarily caused by lateral, rather than surface, boundary conditions, implying that large-scale atmospheric and ocean circulations are able to control CDW pathways and thus off- and on-shelf CDW properties.

To estimate such complex, time-variable error structures from noisy data, we introduce a Bayesian extension to triple collocation in which the systematic errors and noise terms are not constant but vary with explanatory variables. We apply the technique to the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product over croplands, hypothesizing that errors in the vegetation correction during the retrieval leave a characteristic fingerprint in the soil moisture time series. We find that time-variable offsets and sensitivities are commonly associated with an imperfect vegetation correction. Especially the changes in sensitivity can be large, with seasonal variations of up to 40 %. Variations of this size impede the seasonal comparison of soil moisture dynamics and the detection of extreme events. Also, estimates of vegetationhydrology coupling can be distorted, as the SMAP soil moisture has larger R-2 values with a biomass proxy than the in situ data, whereas noise alone would induce the opposite effect. This observation highlights that time-variable biases can easily give rise to distorted results and misleading interpretations. They should hence be accounted for in observational and modelling studies.

NASA's Cold Atom Lab (CAL): system development and ground test status	NPJ MICROGRAVITY												We report the status of the Cold Atom Lab (CAL) instrument to be operated aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Utilizing a compact atom chip-based system to create ultracold mixtures and degenerate samples of Rb-87, K-39, and K-41, CAL is a multi-user facility developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to provide the first persistent quantum gas platform in the microgravity conditions of space. Within this unique environment, atom traps can be decompressed to arbitrarily weak confining potentials, producing a new regime of picokelvin temperatures and ultra-low densities. Further, the complete removal of these confining potential allows the free fall evolution of ultracold clouds to be observed on unprecedented timescales compared to earthbound instruments. This unique facility will enable novel ultracold atom research to be remotely performed by an international group of principle investigators with broad applications in fundamental physics and inertial sensing. Here, we describe the development and validation of critical CAL technologies, including demonstration of the first on-chip Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of Rb-87 with microwave-based evaporation and the generation of ultracold dual-species quantum gas mixtures of K-39/Rb-87 and K-41/Rb-87 in an atom chip trap via sympathetic cooling.																	2373-8065					AUG 21	2018	4								16	10.1038/s41526-018-0049-9							WOS:000442292800001	30155516

This source is particularly suited to generate photons for interaction with Rb-87 based atomic systems. We experimentally investigate the dependence of pair generation rate, single photon heralding efficiency, and bandwidth as a function of the number of atoms, detuning, and intensity of the pump beams. The observed power and detuning behaviors can be explained by the steady-state solution of an established three-level model of an atom. Measurements presented here provide a useful insight on the optimization of this kind of photon-pair source.

The overarching scientific objective of GAUGE was to use atmospheric data to estimate the magnitude, distribution, and uncertainty of the UK greenhouse gas (GHG, defined here as CO2, CH4, and N2O) budget, 2013-2015. To address this objective, we established a multi-year and interlinked measurement and data analysis programme, building on an established tall-tower GHG measurement network. The calibrated measurement network comprises ground-based, airborne, ship-borne, balloon-borne, and space-borne GHG sensors. Our choice of measurement technologies and measurement locations reflects the heterogeneity of UK GHG sources, which range from small point sources such as landfills to large, diffuse sources such as agriculture. Atmospheric mole fraction data collected at the tall towers and on the ships provide information on sub-continental fluxes, representing the backbone to the GAUGE network. Additional spatial and temporal details of GHG fluxes over East Anglia were inferred from data collected by a regional network. Data collected during aircraft flights were used to study the transport of GHGs on local and regional scales. We purposely integrated new sensor and platform technologies into the GAUGE network, allowing us to lay the foundations of a strengthened UK capability to verify national GHG emissions beyond the project lifetime. For example, current satellites provide sparse and seasonally uneven sampling over the UK mainly because of its geographical size and cloud cover. This situation will improve with new and future satellite instruments, e.g. measurements of CH4 from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard Sentinel-5P. We use global, nested, and regional atmospheric transport models and inverse methods to infer geographically resolved CO2 and CH4 fluxes. This multi-model approach allows us to study model spread in a posteriori flux estimates. These models are used to determine the relative importance of different measurements to infer the UK GHG budget. Attributing observed GHG variations to specific sources is a major challenge. Within a UK-wide spatial context we used two approaches: (1) Delta(CO2)-C-14 and other relevant isotopologues (e.g. delta(CCH4)-C-13) from collected air samples to quantify the contribution from fossil fuel combustion and other sources, and (2) geographical separation of individual sources, e.g. agriculture, using a high-density measurement network. Neither of these represents a definitive approach, but they will provide invaluable information about GHG source attribution when they are adopted as part of a more comprehensive, long-term national GHG measurement programme. We also conducted a number of case studies, including an instrumented landfill experiment that provided a test bed for new technologies and flux estimation methods. We anticipate that results from the GAUGE project will help inform other countries on how to use atmospheric data to quantify their nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement.

The effect of precipitation in RO retrievals has been investigated as a potential cause of the bias, using precipitation measurements interpolated into the actual three-dimensional RO ray paths to calculate the excess phase induced by precipitation. The study consisted of comparing the retrievals when such extra delay is removed from the actual measurement and when it is not. The results show how precipitation itself is not the cause of the positive bias. Instead, we show that the positive bias is linked to high specific-humidity conditions regardless of precipitation. This study also shows a regional dependence of the bias. Furthermore, different analyses and reanalyses show a disagreement under high specific-humidity conditions and, in consequence, heavy precipitation.

Here we present measurements of gas-phase N2O5 and ClNO2 by high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (ToF-CIMS) during summer in urban Beijing, China as part of the Air Pollution and Human Health (APHH) campaign. N2O5 and ClNO2 show large day-to-day variations with average (+/- 1 sigma) mixing ratios of 79.2 +/- 157.1 and 174.3 +/- 262.0 pptv, respectively. High reactivity of N2O5, with tau (N2O5)(-1) ranging from 0.20 x 10(-2) to 1.46 x 10(-2) s(-1), suggests active nocturnal chemistry and a large nocturnal nitrate formation potential via N2O5 heterogeneous uptake. The lifetime of N2O5, tau (N2O5), decreases rapidly with the increase in aerosol surface area, yet it varies differently as a function of relative humidity with the highest value peaking at similar to 40 %. The N2O5 uptake coefficients estimated from the product formation rates of ClNO2 and particulate nitrate are in the range of 0.017-0.19, corresponding to direct N2O5 loss rates of 0.00044-0.0034 s(-1). Further analysis indicates that the fast N2O5 loss in the nocturnal boundary layer in urban Beijing is mainly attributed to its indirect loss via NO3, for example through the reactions with volatile organic compounds and NO, while the contribution of the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 is comparably small (7-33 %). High ClNO2 yields ranging from 0.10 to 0.35 were also observed, which might have important implications for air quality by affecting nitrate and ozone formation.				xie, conghui/AAR-8667-2020; Zhang, Yingjie/L-1868-2016; Wang, Junfeng/Y-7794-2018; Sun, Yele/F-1314-2010; Wang, Yuying/L-9204-2019; wang, qingqing/Y-3082-2018; Wang, Zifa/B-5799-2011; Ge, Xinlei/F-5672-2010; Worsnop, Douglas R/D-2817-2009; Fu, Pingqing/G-4863-2013; IAP, LAPC/AAI-6390-2020; LAPC, IAP/AAI-6991-2020; xu, weiqi/AAJ-7147-2020; Zhao, Jian/J-4876-2017	Zhang, Yingjie/0000-0002-3397-0244; Wang, Junfeng/0000-0001-6215-1953; Sun, Yele/0000-0003-2354-0221; Wang, Yuying/0000-0001-9762-8563; Ge, Xinlei/0000-0001-9531-6478; Worsnop, Douglas R/0000-0002-8928-8017; Fu, Pingqing/0000-0001-6249-2280; IAP, LAPC/0000-0002-6195-7362; LAPC, IAP/0000-0002-0025-3484; Jones, Roderic/0000-0002-6761-3966; Bannan, Thomas/0000-0002-1760-6522; Lee, James D/0000-0001-5397-2872; Priestley, Michael/0000-0002-6597-6608; Worrall, Stephen/0000-0003-1969-3671; Coe, Hugh/0000-0002-3264-1713; Ouyang, Bin/0000-0001-8663-1935; Zhao, Jian/0000-0002-4894-9587; Mehra, Archit/0000-0002-4273-8199												1680-7316	1680-7324				AUG 16	2018	18	16					11581	11597		10.5194/acp-18-11581-2018							WOS:000441783700002

Jupiter Lightning-Induced Whistler and Sferic Events With Waves and MWR During Juno Perijoves	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the Juno perijove explorations from 27 August 2016 through 1 September 2017, strong electromagnetic impulses induced by Jupiter lightning were detected by the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) instrument in the form of 600-MHz sferics and recorded by the Waves instrument in the form of Jovian low-dispersion whistlers discovered in waveform snapshots below 20 kHz. We found 71 overlapping events including sferics, while Waves waveforms were available. Eleven of these also included whistler detections by Waves. By measuring the separation distances between the MWR boresight and the whistler exit point, we estimated the distance whistlers propagate below the ionosphere before exiting to the magnetosphere, called the coupling distance, to be typically one to several thousand of kilometers with a possibility of no subionospheric propagation, which gives a new constraint on the atmospheric whistler propagation. Plain Language Summary Lightning at Jupiter produces a strong electromagnetic impulse, which can escape the Jovian atmosphere and enter the inner magnetosphere. Among the lightning, microwave-frequency sferics come from lightning spots, and audio-frequency whistlers propagate away from the spots below the ionosphere. If certain plasma conditions are met, these whistlers can leak into the magnetosphere. Estimates of whistler propagation distances at the planet have not been previously performed. Since the arrival at Jupiter on 5 July 2016, the Juno spacecraft has provided the opportunity to monitor the two kinds of lightning activity with two onboard instruments during its closest approach to Jupiter. This opportunity happens every 53.6 day in the eccentric, polar orbit of Juno. Using data collected during Juno's closest approaches to Jupiter, the whistler propagation distance was estimated to be approximately one to several thousand kilometers, which may be comparable to the terrestrial equivalent. This new approach provides the benefit of understanding multidimensional structures of lightning at Jupiter.

Global Estimates of River Flow Wave Travel Times and Implications for Low-Latency Satellite Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Earth-orbiting satellites provide valuable observations of upstream river conditions worldwide. These observations can be used in real-time applications like early flood warning systems and reservoir operations, provided they are made available to users with sufficient lead time. Yet the temporal requirements for access to satellite-based river data remain uncharacterized for time-sensitive applications. Here we present a global approximation of flow wave travel time to assess the utility of existing and future low-latency/near-real-time satellite products, with an emphasis on the forthcoming SWOT satellite mission. We apply a kinematic wave model to a global hydrography data set and find that global flow waves traveling at their maximum speed take a median travel time of 6, 4, and 3 days to reach their basin terminus, the next downstream city, and the next downstream dam, respectively. Our findings suggest that a recently proposed <= 2-day data latency for a low-latency SWOT product is potentially useful for real-time river applications. Plain Language Summary Satellites can provide upstream conditions for early flood warning systems, reservoir operations, and other river management applications. This information is most useful for time-sensitive applications if it is made available before an observed upstream flood reaches a downstream point of interest, like a basin outlet, city, or dam. Here we characterize the time it takes floods to travel down Earth's rivers in an effort to assess the time required for satellite data to be downloaded, processed, and made accessible to users. We find that making satellite data available within a recently proposed <= 2-day time period will make the data potentially useful for flood mitigation and other water management applications.

Global Validation of MODIS Near-Surface Air and Dew Point Temperatures	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												This analysis is the first global validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived near-surface air temperature and dew point estimates, which both serve as crucial input data in models of energy, water, and carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. By hypsometrically interpolating the MOD07 Level-2 atmospheric profile product to surface pressure level, we obtained near-surface air temperature and dew point observations at 5 km pixel resolution. We compared these daily data, retrieved over a 14-year record, to corresponding measurements from 109 ground meteorological stations (FLUXNET). Our results show strong agreement between satellite and in situ near-surface air temperature measurements (R-2 = 0.89, root-mean-square error = 3.47 degrees C, and bias = -0.19 degrees C) and dew point observations (R-2 = 0.76, root-mean-square error = 5.04 degrees C, and bias = 0.79 degrees C) with insignificant differences in error across climate zones. This validation is among the earliest assessments of the reprocessed, crosstalk-corrected Collection 6.1 Terra MODIS data and provides support for widespread applications of near-surface atmospheric data.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 16	2018	45	15					7772	7780		10.1029/2018GL077813							WOS:000443129500060

Inflationary versus reionization features from Planck 2015 data	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												Features during inflation and reionization leave corresponding features in the temperature and polarization power spectra that could potentially explain anomalies in the Planck 2015 data but require a joint analysis to disentangle. We study the interplay between these two effects using a model-independent parametrization of the inflationary power spectrum and the ionization history. Preference for a sharp suppression of large-scale power is driven by a feature in the temperature power spectrum at multipoles l similar to 20, whereas preference for a component of high redshift ionization is driven by a sharp excess of polarization power at l similar to 10 when compared with the lowest multipoles. Marginalizing inflationary freedom does not weaken the preference for z greater than or similar to 10 ionization, whereas marginalizing reionization freedom slightly enhances the preference for an inflationary feature but can also mask its direct signature in polarization. The inflation and reionization interpretation of these features makes predictions for the polarization spectrum which can be tested in future precision measurements especially at 10 less than or similar to l less than or similar to 40.																	2470-0010	2470-0029				AUG 16	2018	98	4							043518	10.1103/PhysRevD.98.043518							WOS:000441858300003

Carbon exchange in an Amazon forest: from hours to years	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In Amazon forests, the relative contributions of climate, phenology, and disturbance to net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) are not well understood. To partition influences across various timescales, we use a statistical model to represent eddy-covariance-derived NEE in an evergreen eastern Amazon forest as a constant response to changing meteorology and phenology throughout a decade. Our best fit model represented hourly NEE variations as changes due to sunlight, while seasonal variations arose from phenology influencing photosynthesis and from rainfall influencing ecosystem respiration, where phenology was asynchronous with dry-season onset. We compared annual model residuals with biometric forest surveys to estimate impacts of drought disturbance. We found that our simple model represented hourly and monthly variations in NEE well (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.59, respectively). Modeled phenology explained 1% of hourly and 26% of monthly variations in observed NEE, whereas the remaining modeled variability was due to changes in meteorology. We did not find evidence to support the common assumption that the forest phenology was seasonally light-or water-triggered. Our model simulated annual NEE well, with the exception of 2002, the first year of our data record, which contained 1.2 MgCha(-1) of residual net emissions, because photosynthesis was anomalously low. Because a severe drought occurred in 1998, we hypothesized that this drought caused a persistent, multi-year depression of photosynthesis. Our results suggest drought can have lasting impacts on photosynthesis, possibly via partial damage to still-living trees.

First detection of H2S in a protoplanetary disk The dense GG Tauri A ring	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Studying molecular species in protoplanetary disks is very useful to characterize the properties of these objects, which are the site of planet formation. Aims. We attempt to constrain the chemistry of S-bearing molecules in the cold parts of circumstellar disk of GG Tau A. Methods. We searched for H2S, CS, SO, and SO2 in the dense disk around GG Tau A with the NOrthem Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer. We analyzed our data using the radiative transfer code DiskFit and the three-phase chemical model Nautilus. Results. We detected H2S emission from the dense and cold ring orbiting around GG Tau A. This is the first detection of H2S in a protoplanetary disk. We also detected HCO+, (HCO+)-C-13, and DCO+ in the disk. Upper limits for other molecules, CCS, SO2, SO, HC3N, and c-C3H2 are also obtained. The observed DCO+/HCO+ ratio is similar to those in other disks. The observed column densities, derived using our radiative transfer code DiskFit, are then compared with those from our chemical code Nautilus. The column densities are in reasonable agreement for DCO+, CS, CCS, and SO2. For H2S and SO, our predicted vertical integrated column densities are more than a factor of 10 higher than the measured values. Conclusions. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that only a strong sulfur depletion may explain the low observed H2S column density in the disk. The H2S detection in GG Tau A is most likely linked to the much larger mass of this disk compared to that in other T Tauri systems.																	1432-0746					AUG 15	2018	616								L5	10.1051/0004-6361/201833766							WOS:000441818500001

Our DPSK demodulator chip device, which incorporates a silicon ring resonator, two bus waveguide inputs, and monolithically integrated detectors, operates passively at a bit rate of 10 Gbps at telecommunication wavelengths, and fits within a mm-scale footprint. Critical coupling is used to achieve efficient CPA by tuning the gap between the ring and bus waveguides. The device has a vertical eye opening of 12.47 mV and a quality factor exceeding 3 x 10(4).

Research flights were conducted from 17 December 2015 until 18 March 2016 within 25-87 degrees N, 80 degrees W-30 degrees E. From the GLORIA infrared limb-emission measurements, two-dimensional cross sections of temperature, HNO3, O-3, ClONO2, H2O and CFC-12 are retrieved. During 15 scientific flights of the PGS campaigns the GLORIA instrument measured more than 15 000 atmospheric profiles at high spectral resolution. Dependent on flight altitude and tropospheric cloud cover, the profiles retrieved from the measurements typically range between 5 and 14 km, and vertical resolutions between 400 and 1000 m are achieved. The estimated total (random and systematic) 1 sigma errors are in the range of 1 to 2K for temperature and 10% to 20% relative error for the discussed trace gases. Comparisons to in situ instruments deployed on board HALO have been performed. Over all flights of this campaign the median differences and median absolute deviations between in situ and GLORIA observations are -0.75K +/- 0.88K for temperature, -0.03 ppbv +/- 0.85 ppbv for HNO3, -3.5 ppbv +/- 116.8 ppbv for O-3, -15.4pptv +/- 102.8 pptv for ClONO2, 0.13ppmv +/- 0.63 ppmv for H2O and -19.8pptv +/- 46.9 pptv for CFC-12. Seventy-three percent of these differences are within twice the combined estimated errors of the cross-compared instruments. Events with larger deviations are explained by atmospheric variability and different sampling characteristics of the instruments. Additionally, comparisons of GLORIA HNO3 and O-3 with measurements of the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument show highly consistent structures in trace gas distributions and illustrate the potential of the high-spectral-resolution limb-imaging GLORIA observations for resolving narrow mesoscale structures in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).

Non-linear response of summertime marine productivity to increased meltwater discharge around Greenland	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is thought to enhance marine productivity by adding bioessential iron and silicic acid to coastal waters. However, experimental data suggest nitrate is the main summertime growth-limiting resource in regions affected by meltwater around Greenland. While meltwater contains low nitrate concentrations, subglacial discharge plumes from marine-terminating glaciers entrain large quantities of nitrate from deep seawater. Here, we characterize the nitrate fluxes that arise from entrainment of seawater within these plumes using a subglacial discharge plume model. The upwelled flux from 12 marine-terminating glaciers is estimated to be >1000% of the total nitrate flux from GrIS discharge. This plume upwelling effect is highly sensitive to the glacier grounding line depth. For a majority of Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers nitrate fluxes will diminish as they retreat. This decline occurs even if discharge volume increases, resulting in a negative impact on nitrate availability and thus summertime marine productivity.

Intra-annual variations of regional aerosol optical depth, vertical distribution, and particle types from multiple satellite and ground-based observational datasets	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The climatic and health effects of aerosols are strongly dependent on the intra-annual variations in their loading and properties. While the seasonal variations of regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been extensively studied, understanding the temporal variations in aerosol vertical distribution and particle types is also important for an accurate estimate of aerosol climatic effects. In this paper, we combine the observations from four satellite-borne sensors and several ground-based networks to investigate the seasonal variations of aerosol column loading, vertical distribution, and particle types over three populous regions: the Eastern United States (EUS), Western Europe (WEU), and Eastern and Central China (ECC). In all three regions, column AOD, as well as AOD at heights above 800 m, peaks in summer/spring, probably due to accelerated formation of secondary aerosols and hygroscopic growth. In contrast, AOD below 800 m peaks in winter over WEU and ECC regions because more aerosols are confined to lower heights due to the weaker vertical mixing. In the EUS region, AOD below 800 m shows two maximums, one in summer and the other in winter. The temporal trends in low-level AOD are consistent with those in surface fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations. AOD due to fine particles (< 0.7 mu m diameter) is much larger in spring/summer than in winter over all three regions. However, the coarse mode AOD (> 1.4 mu m diameter), generally shows small variability, except that a peak occurs in spring in the ECC region due to the prevalence of airborne dust during this season. When aerosols are classified according to sources, the dominant type is associated with anthropogenic air pollution, which has a similar seasonal pattern as total AOD. Dust and sea-spray aerosols in the WEU region peak in summer and winter, respectively, but do not show an obvious seasonal pattern in the EUS region. Smoke aerosols, as well as absorbing aerosols, present an obvious unimodal distribution with a maximum occurring in summer over the EUS and WEU regions, whereas they follow a bimodal distribution with peaks in August and March (due to crop residue burning) over the ECC region.

Highest Frequency Detection of FRB 121102 at 4-8 GHz Using the Breakthrough Listen Digital Backend at the Green Bank Telescope	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We report the first detections of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB 121102 above 5.2 GHz. Observations were performed using the 4-8 GHz receiver of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with the Breakthrough Listen digital backend. We present the spectral, temporal, and polarization properties of 21 bursts detected within the first 60 minutes of a total of 6 hr of observations. These observations comprise the highest burst density yet reported in the literature, with 18 bursts being detected in the first 30 minutes. A few bursts clearly show temporal sub-structure with distinct spectral properties. These sub-structures superimpose to provide an enhanced peak signal-to-noise ratio at higher trial dispersion measures. Broad features occur in similar to 1 GHz wide subbands that typically differ in peak frequency between bursts within the band. Finer-scale structures (similar to 10-50 MHz) within these bursts are consistent with the structure expected from Galactic diffractive interstellar scintillation. The bursts exhibit nearly 100% linear polarization, and a large average rotation measure of 9.359 +/- 0.012 x 10(4) rad m(-2) (in the observer's frame). No circular polarization was found for any burst. We measure an approximately constant polarization position angle in the 13 brightest bursts. The peak flux densities of the reported bursts have average values (0.2 +/- 0.1 Jy) similar to those seen at lower frequencies (<3 GHz), while the average burst widths (0.64 +/- 0.46 ms) are relatively narrower.

KMTNet Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration	OGLE-2017-BLG-0537: A Microlensing Event with a Resolvable Lens in less than or similar to 5 years from High-resolution Follow-up Observations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present an analysis of the binary-lens microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-0537. The light curve of the event exhibits two strong caustic-crossing spikes among which the second caustic crossing was resolved by high-cadence surveys. It is found that the lens components with a mass ratio similar to 0.5 are separated in projection by similar to 1.3 theta(E), where theta(E) is the angular Einstein radius. Analysis of the caustic-crossing part yields theta(E) = 1.77 +/- 0.16 mas and a lens-source relative proper motion of mu = 12.4 +/- 1.1 mas yr(-1). The measured it is the third highest value among the events with measured proper motions and is similar to 3 times higher than the value of typical Galactic bulge events, making the event a strong candidate for follow-up observations to directly image the lens by separating it from the source. From the angular Einstein radius combined with the microlens parallax, it is estimated that the lens is composed of two main-sequence stars with masses M-1 similar to 0.4 M-circle dot and M-2 similar to 0.2 M-circle dot located at a distance of D-L similar to 1.2 kpc. However, the physical lens parameters are not very secure due to the weak microlens-parallax signal, thus we cross-check the parameters by conducting a Bayesian analysis based on the measured Einstein radius and event timescale, combined with the blending constraint. From this, we find that the physical parameters estimated from the Bayesian analysis are consistent with those based on the measured microlens parallax. Resolving the lens from the source can be done in about 5 years from highresolution follow-up observations and this will provide a rare opportunity to test and refine the microlensing model.

OGLE Collaboration; FUN Collaboration; KMTNet Grp; Spitzer Team	OGLE-2016-BLG-1045: A Test of Cheap Space-based Microlens Parallaxes	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Microlensing is a powerful and unique technique to probe isolated objects in the Galaxy. To study the characteristics of these interesting objects based on the microlensing method, measurement of the microlens parallax is required to determine the properties of the lens. Of the various methods to measure microlens parallax, the most routine way is to make simultaneous ground- and space-based observations, i.e., by measuring the space-based microlens parallax. However, space-based campaigns usually require "expensive" resources. Gould & Yee (2012) proposed an idea called the "cheap space-based microlens parallax" that can measure the lens-parallax using only two or three space-based observations of high-magnification events (as seen from Earth). This cost-effective observation strategy to measure microlens parallaxes could be used by space-borne telescopes to build a complete sample for studying isolated objects. This would enable a direct measurement of the mass function including both extremely low-mass objects and high-mass stellar remnants. However, to adopt this idea requires a test to check how it would work in actual situations. Thus, we present the first practical test of this idea using the high-magnification microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1045, for which a subset of Spitzer observations fortuitously duplicates the prescription of Gould & Yee (2012). From the test, we confirm that the measurement of the lens-parallax adopting this idea has sufficient accuracy to determine the physical properties of the isolated lens.

Here we present the chemical modeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase chemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For the formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent results with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of COOH with CH2NH2. However, we will report three important findings regarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine. First, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine was destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH3O radicals before it fully evaporated. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase is more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case, NH2OH and CH3COOH rather than CH3NH2 and CH2NH would be the essential precursors to the gas-phase glycine. Second, since the gas-phase glycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, the early evolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the future glycine surveys. Third, we suggest the possibility that the suprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH radicals from CO2, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of glycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in detail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future.				; Majumdar, Liton/F-6759-2014	Saito, Masao/0000-0003-0769-8627; Majumdar, Liton/0000-0001-7031-8039; Ohishi, Masatoshi/0000-0003-2775-7487												0004-637X	1538-4357				AUG 10	2018	863	1							51	10.3847/1538-4357/aad087							WOS:000441290000007

From 2002 to 2012, it performed pole-to-pole measurements during day and night, producing more than 1000 profiles per day. The European Space Agency (ESA) recently released the new version 7 of Level 1B MIPAS spectra, in which a new set of time-dependent correction coefficients for the nonlinearity in the detector response functions was implemented. This change is expected to reduce the long-term drift of the MIPAS Level 2 data. We evaluate the long-term stability of ozone Level 2 data retrieved from MIPAS v7 Level 1B spectra with the IMK/IAA scientific level 2 processor. For this, we compare MIPAS data with ozone measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA's Aura satellite, ozonesondes and ground-based lidar instruments. The ozonesondes and lidars alone do not allow us to conclude with enough significance that the new version is more stable than the previous one, but a clear improvement in long-term stability is observed in the satellite-data-based drift analysis. The results of ozonesondes, lidars and satellite drift analysis are consistent: all indicate that the drifts of the new version are less negative/more positive nearly everywhere above 15 km. The 10-year MIPAS ozone trends calculated from the old and the new data versions are compared. The new trends are closer to old drift-corrected trends than the old uncorrected trends were. From this, we conclude that the nonlinearity correction performed on Level 1B data is an improvement. These results indicate that MIPAS data are now even more suited for trend studies, alone or as part of a merged data record.

This thermal history can be classified by the petrologic type. We investigate the thermal evolution of planetesimals to account for the current abundances (known as the fall statistics) of petrologic types 3-6 of ordinary chondrites. We carry out a number of numerical calculations in which formation times and sizes of planetesimals are taken as parameters. We find that planetesimals that form within 2.0 Myr after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) can contain all petrologic types of ordinary chondrites. Our results also indicate that plausible scenarios of planetesimal formation, which are consistent with the fall statistics, are that planetesimals with radii larger than 60 km start to form around 2.0 Myr after CAIs and/or that ones with radii less than 50 km should be formed within 1.5 Myr after CAIs. Thus, thermal modeling of planetesimals is important for revealing the occurrence and amount of metamorphosed chondrites and for providing invaluable insights into planetesimal formation.

SPIRITS 16tn in NGC 3556: A Heavily Obscured and Low-luminosity Supernova at 8.8 Mpc	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present the discovery by the SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS) of a likely supernova (SN) in NGC 3556 (M108) at only 8.8 Mpc that was not detected by optical searches. A luminous infrared (IR) transient at M-[4.5] = -16.7 mag (Vega), SPIRITS 16tn is coincident with a dust lane in the inclined, star-forming disk of the host. Using observations in the IR, optical, and radio, we attempt to determine the nature of this event. We estimate A(v) approximate to 8-9 mag of extinction, placing it among the three most highly obscured IR-discovered SNe. The [4.5] light curve declined at a rate of 0.013 mag day(-1), and the [3.6]-[4.5] color increased from 0.7 to greater than or similar to 1.0 mag by 184.7 days post discovery. Optical/IR spectroscopy shows a red continuum but no clearly discernible features, preventing a definitive spectroscopic classification. Radio observations constrain the radio luminosity of SPIRITS 16tn to L-nu less than or similar to 10(24) erg s(-1) Hz(-1) between 3 and 15 GHz, excluding many varieties of core-collapse SNe. An SN Ia is ruled out by the observed IR color and lack of spectroscopic features from Fe-peak elements. SPIRITS 16tn was fainter at [4.5] than typical stripped-envelope SNe by mag. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution to SNe II suggests that SPIRITS 16tn was both highly obscured and intrinsically dim, possibly akin to the low-luminosity SN 2005cs. We infer the presence of an IR dust echo powered by an initial peak luminosity of the transient of 5 x 10(40) erg s(-1)less than or similar to L-peak less than or similar to 4 x l0(43) erg s(-1), consistent with the observed range for SNe II. This discovery illustrates the power of IR surveys to overcome the compounding effects of visible extinction and optically subluminous events in completing the inventory of nearby SNe.				; Horesh, Assaf/O-9873-2016	Johansson, Joel/0000-0001-5975-290X; Kasliwal, Tamay/0000-0001-5634-7167; Horesh, Assaf/0000-0002-5936-1156; Van Dyk, Schuyler/0000-0001-9038-9950												0004-637X	1538-4357				AUG 10	2018	863	1							20	10.3847/1538-4357/aacf8b							WOS:000441126000006

Post-drought decline of the Amazon carbon sink	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Amazon forests have experienced frequent and severe droughts in the past two decades. However, little is known about the large-scale legacy of droughts on carbon stocks and dynamics of forests. Using systematic sampling of forest structure measured by LiDAR waveforms from 2003 to 2008, here we show a significant loss of carbon over the entire Amazon basin at a rate of 0.3 +/- 0.2 (95% CI) PgC yr(-1) after the 2005 mega-drought, which continued persistently over the next 3 years (2005-2008). The changes in forest structure, captured by average LiDAR forest height and converted to above ground biomass carbon density, show an average loss of 2.35 +/- 1.80 MgC ha(-1) a year after (2006) in the epicenter of the drought. With more frequent droughts expected in future, forests of Amazon may lose their role as a robust sink of carbon, leading to a significant positive climate feedback and exacerbating warming trends.				; Myneni, Ranga/F-5129-2012	Yu, Yifan/0000-0001-6948-0493; Xu, Liang/0000-0001-7400-3827; Myneni, Ranga/0000-0002-0234-6393												2041-1723					AUG 9	2018	9								3172	10.1038/s41467-018-05668-6							WOS:000441157600007	30093640

Direct kinetics study of CH2OO + methyl vinyl ketone and CH2OO + methacrolein reactions and an upper limit determination for CH2OO + CO reaction	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) are important intermediate products in atmospheric degradation of volatile organic compounds, especially of isoprene. This work investigates the reactions of the smallest Criegee intermediate, CH2OO, with its co-products from isoprene ozonolysis, MVK and MACR, using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS), with either tunable synchrotron radiation from the Advanced Light Source or Lyman-alpha (10.2 eV) radiation for photoionization. CH2OO was produced via pulsed laser photolysis of CH(2)l(2) in the presence of excess O-2. Time-resolved measurements of reactant disappearance and of product formation were performed to monitor reaction progress; first order rate coefficients were obtained from exponential fits to the CH2OO decays. The bimolecular reaction rate coefficients at 300 K and 4 Torr are k(CH2OO + MVK) = (5.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(-13) cm(3) s(-1) and k(CH2OO + MACR) = (4.4 +/- 1.0) x 10(-13) cm(3) s(-1), where the stated +/- 2 sigma uncertainties are statistical uncertainties. Adduct formation is observed for both reactions and is attributed to the formation of a secondary ozonides (1,2,4-trioxolanes), supported by master equation calculations of the kinetics and the agreement between measured and calculated adiabatic ionization energies. Kinetics measurements were also performed for a possible bimolecular CH2OO + CO reaction and for the reaction of CH2OO with CF3CHCH2 at 300 K and 4 Torr. For CH2OO + CO, no reaction is observed and an upper limit is determined: k(CH2OO + CO) < 2 x 10(-16) cm(3) s(-1). For CH2OO + CF3CHCH2, an upper limit of k(CH2OO + CF3CHCH2) < 2 x 10(-14) cm(3) s(-1) is obtained.

Strong whistler mode waves observed in the vicinity of Jupiter's moons	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Understanding of wave environments is critical for the understanding of how particles are accelerated and lost in space. This study shows that in the vicinity of Europa and Ganymede, that respectively have induced and internal magnetic fields, chorus wave power is significantly increased. The observed enhancements are persistent and exceed median values of wave activity by up to 6 orders of magnitude for Ganymede. Produced waves may have a pronounced effect on the acceleration and loss of particles in the Jovian magnetosphere and other astrophysical objects. The generated waves are capable of significantly modifying the energetic particle environment, accelerating particles to very high energies, or producing depletions in phase space density. Observations of Jupiter's magnetosphere provide a unique opportunity to observe how objects with an internal magnetic field can interact with particles trapped in magnetic fields of larger scale objects.

Age of air as a diagnostic for transport timescales in global models	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												This paper presents the first results of an age-ofair (AoA) inter-comparison of six global transport models. Following a protocol, three global circulation models and three chemistry transport models simulated five tracers with boundary conditions that grow linearly in time. This allows for an evaluation of the AoA and transport times associated with inter-hemispheric transport, vertical mixing in the troposphere, transport to and in the stratosphere, and transport of air masses between land and ocean. Since AoA is not a directly measurable quantity in the atmosphere, simulations of Rn-222 and SF6 were also performed. We focus this first analysis on averages over the period 2000-2010, taken from longer simulations covering the period 1988-2014. We find that two models, NIES and TOMCAT, show substantially slower vertical mixing in the troposphere compared to other models (LMDZ, TM5, EMAC, and ACTM). However, while the TOMCAT model, as used here, has slow transport between the hemispheres and between the atmosphere over land and ocean, the NIES model shows efficient horizontal mixing and a smaller latitudinal gradient in SF6 compared to the other models and observations. We find consistent differences between models concerning vertical mixing of the tro-posphere, expressed as AoA differences and modelled 222Rn gradients between 950 and 500 hPa. All models agree, however, on an interesting asymmetry in inter-hemispheric mixing, with faster transport from the Northern Hemisphere surface to the Southern Hemisphere than vice versa. This is attributed to a rectifier effect caused by a stronger seasonal cycle in boundary layer venting over Northern Hemispheric land masses, and possibly to a related asymmetric position of the intertropical convergence zone. The calculated AoA in the mid-upper stratosphere varies considerably among the models (4-7 years). Finally, we find that the inter-model differences are generally larger than differences in AoA that result from using the same model with a different resolution or convective parameterisation. Taken together, the AoA model inter-comparison provides a useful addition to traditional approaches to evaluate transport timescales. Results highlight that inter-model differences associated with resolved transport (advection, reanalysis data, nudging) and parameterised transport (convection, boundary layer mixing) are still large and require further analysis. For this purpose, all model output and analysis software are available.

Jeffrey			Heat capacity of Mg3Sb2, Mg3Bi2, and their alloys at high temperature	MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS												The thermoelectric figure of merit reported for n-type Mg-3(Sb,Bi)(2) compounds has made these materials of great engineering significance, increasing the need for accurate evaluations of their thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is typically derived from measurements of thermal diffusivity and determination of the specific heat capacity. The uncertainty in this method (often 10% or more) is frequently attributed to measurement of heat capacity such that estimated values are often more accurate. Inconsistencies between reported thermal conductivity of Mg-3(Sb,Bi)(2) compounds may be attributed to the different values of heat capacity measured or used to calculate thermal conductivity. The high anharmonicity of these materials can lead to significant deviations at high temperatures from the Dulong-Petit heat capacity, which is often a reasonable substitute for measurements at high temperatures. Herein, a physics-based model is used to assess the magnitude of the heat capacity over the entire temperature range up to 800 K. The model agrees in magnitude with experimental low-temperature values and reproduces the linear slope observed in high-temperature data. Owing to the large scatter in experimental values of high-temperature heat capacity, the model is likely more accurate (within +/- 3%) than a measurement of a new sample even for doped or alloyed materials. It is found that heat capacity for the solid solution series can be simply described (for temperatures: 200 K <= T <= 800 K) by the polynomial equation: c(p)[Jg(-1) K-1] = 3NR/M-w (1 + 1.3 x 10(-4) T - 4 x 10(3) T-2), where 3NR = 124.71 J mol(-1) K-1, M-w is the molecular weight [g mol(-1)] of the formula unit being considered, and T is temperature in K. This heat capacity is recommended to be a standard value for reporting and comparing the thermal conductivity of Mg-3(Sb,Bi)(2) including doped or alloyed derivatives. A general form of the equation is given which can be used for other material systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.				Imasato, Kazuki/AAE-7391-2019; Snyder, G.

Discovery and Dynamical Analysis of an Extreme Trans-Neptunian Object with a High Orbital Inclination	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We report the discovery and dynamical analysis of 2015 BP519, an extreme trans-Neptunian object (TNO) detected by the Dark Energy Survey at a heliocentric distance of 55 au, perihelion of similar to 36 au, and absolute magnitude H-r = 4.3. The current orbit, determined from a 1110 day observational arc, has a semimajor axis a approximate to 450 au, eccentricity e approximate to 0.92, and inclination i 54 degrees. With these orbital elements, 2015 BP519 is the most extreme TNO discovered to date, as quantified by the reduced Kozai action, eta(0) = (1 e(2))(1/2) cos i, which is a conserved quantity at fixed semimajor axis a for axisymmetric perturbations. We discuss the orbital stability and evolution of this object and find that, under the influence of the four known giant planets, 2015 BP519 displays rich dynamical behavior, including rapid diffusion in semimajor axis and more constrained variations in eccentricity and inclination. We also consider the long-term orbital stability and evolutionary behavior within the context of the Planet Nine hypothesis and find that 2015 BP519 adds to the circumstantial evidence for the existence of this proposed new member of the solar system, as it would represent the first member of the population of high-i, (mu) over bar -shepherded TNOs.

Characterizing K2 Candidate Planetary Systems Orbiting Low-mass Stars. III. A High Mass and Low Envelope Fraction for the Warm Neptune K2-55b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												K2-55b is a Neptune-sized planet orbiting a K7 dwarf with a radius of 0.715(-0.)(040)(+0.043) R-circle dot, a mass of 0.688 +/- 0.069 M-circle dot, and an effective temperature of 4300(-100)(+107) K. Having characterized the host star using near-infrared spectra obtained at JR IF/SpeX, we observed a transit of K2-55b with Spitzer/Infrared An ay Camera (IRAC) and confirmed the accuracy of the original K2 ephemeris for future follow-up transit observations. Performing a joint fit to the Spitzer/IRAC and K2 photometry, we found a planet radius of 4.41(-0.28)(+0.32) R circle plus, an orbital period of 2.84927265(-6.42x10-6)(+6)(.)(87x10-6) days, and an 6 42 xi equilibrium temperature of roughly 900 K. We then measured the planet mass by acquiring 12 radial velocity (RV) measurements of the system using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the 10 m Keck I Telescope. Our RV data set precisely constrains the mass of K2-55b to 43.13(-5.80)(+5.98) M-circle plus, indicating that K2-55b has a bulk density of 2.8(-0.6)(+08)g cm(-3) and can be modeled as a rocky planet capped by a modest H/He envelope (M-envelope =12 +/- 3% M-p). K2-55b is denser than most similarly sized planets, raising the question of whether the high planetary bulk density of K2-55b could be attributed to the high metallicity of K2-55. The absence of a substantial volatile envelope despite the high mass of K2-55b poses a challenge to current theories of gas giant formation. We posit that K2-55b may have escaped runaway accretion by migration, late formation, or inefficient core accretion, or that K2-55b was stripped of its envelope by a late giant impact.

Jupiter's Mesoscale Waves Observed at 5 mu m by Ground-based Observations and Juno JIRAM	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We characterize the origin and evolution of a mesoscale wave pattern in Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB), detected for the first time at 5 mu m using a 2016-17 campaign of "lucky imaging" from the VISIR instrument on the Very Large Telescope and the NIRI instrument on the Gemini observatory, coupled with M-band imaging from Juno's JIRAM instrument during the first seven Juno orbits. The wave is compact, with a 1 degrees. 1-1 degrees. 4 longitude wavelength (wavelength 1300-1600 km, wavenumber 260-330) that is stable over time, with wave crests aligned largely north-south between 14 degrees N and 17 degrees N (planetographic). The waves were initially identified in small (10 degrees longitude) packets immediately west of cyclones in the NEB at 16 degrees N but extended to span wider longitude ranges over time. The waves exhibit a 7-10 K brightness temperature amplitude on top of an similar to 210 K background at 5 mu m. The thermal structure of the NEB allows for both inertio-gravity waves and gravity waves. Despite detection at 5 mu m, this does not necessarily imply a deep location for the waves, and an upper tropospheric aerosol layer near 400-800 mbar could feature a gravity wave pattern modulating the visible-light reflectivity and attenuating the 5-mu m radiance originating from deeper levels. Strong rifting activity appears to obliterate the pattern, which can change on timescales of weeks. The NEB underwent a new expansion and contraction episode in 2016-17 with associated cyclone-anticyclone formation, which could explain why the mesoscale wave pattern was more vivid in 2017 than ever before.

At peak visibility, the waves have sufficient contrast (similar to 10%) to be observed from ground-based telescopes. They have a typical wavelength of about 1 degrees.2 (1400 km), variable-length wave trains, and westward phase speeds of a few ms(_1) or less. New analysis of Voyager 2 data shows similar wave trains over at least 300 hr. Some waves appear curved when over cyclones and anticyclones, but most are straight, but tilted, shifting in latitude as they pass vortices. Based on their wavelengths, phase speeds, and faint appearance at high-altitude sensitive passbands, the observed NEB waves are consistent with inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) at the 500 mbar pressure level, though formation altitude is not well constrained. Preliminary General Circulation Model simulations generate IGWs from vortices interacting with the environment and can reproduce the observed wavelengths and orientations. Several mechanisms can generate these waves, and all may contribute: geostrophic adjustment of cyclones; cyclone/anticyclone interactions; wind interactions with obstructions or heat pulses from convection; or changing vertical wind shear. However, observations also show that the presence of vortices and/or regions of convection are not sufficient by themselves for wave formation, implying that a change in vertical structure may affect their stability, or that changes in haze properties may affect their visibility.

The morphology of the outer disk (r similar to 0."3) at PA = 0 degrees-45 degrees and PA degrees = 180-290 degrees is likely density wave-induced spirals, and comparison between our observational results and simulations suggests a planet formation. We have also investigated the azimuthal profiles at the ring and the outer-disk regions as well as radial profiles in the directions of the spiral-like structures and semimajor axis. Azimuthal analysis shows a large variety in wavelength and implies that the disk has non-axisymmetric dust distributions. The radial profiles in the major-axis direction (PA = 271 degrees) suggest that the outer region (r >= 0."25) may be influenced by shadows of the inner region of the disk. The spiral-like directions (PA = 10 degrees and 230 degrees) show different radial profiles, which suggests that the surfaces of the spiral-like structures are highly flared and/or have different dust properties. Finally, a color map of the disk shows a lack of an outer eastern region in the H-band disk, which may hint at the presence of an inner object that casts a directional shadow onto the disk.

Buildup of Abiotic Oxygen and Ozone in Moist Atmospheres of Temperate Terrestrial Exoplanets and Its Impact on the Spectral Fingerprint in Transit Observations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We investigate the abiotic production of oxygen and its photochemical byproduct ozone through water vapor photolysis in moist atmospheres of temperate terrestrial exoplanets. The amount of water vapor available for photolysis in the middle atmosphere of a planet can be limited by an atmospheric cold-trap, the formation of which largely depends on the amount of noncondensable gases. We study this effect using a photochemical model coupled to a 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model in atmospheres with N-2, CO2, and H2O as the main constituents. We find that in atmospheres with a low N-2 inventory, water vapor mixing ratios in the middle atmosphere can be more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to atmospheres with an Earth-like N-2 inventory. Without a strong surface sink, the noncondensable oxygen can build up rapidly, drying out the upper atmosphere. With a moderate surface sink, the planet can approach a steady state with significant oxygen mixing ratios in which oxygen production is balanced by surface uptake. We use a radiative transfer model to study the spectroscopic fingerprint of these atmospheres in transit observations. Spectral signatures of abiotic oxygen and ozone can be of comparable magnitude as in spectra of Earth seen as an exoplanet. Middle atmospheric water vapor is unlikely to be a usable indicator of the abiotic origin of oxygen because of the influence of oxygen on the water vapor distribution. This suggests that atmospheric oxygen and ozone cannot be used as binary bioindicators and that their interpretation will likely require atmospheric and planetary models.

DES Collaboration	Quasar Accretion Disk Sizes from Continuum Reverberation Mapping from the Dark Energy Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present accretion disk size measurements for 15 luminous quasars at 0.7 <= z <= 1.9 derived from griz light curves from the Dark Energy Survey. We measure the disk sizes with continuum reverberation mapping using two methods, both of which are derived from the expectation that accretion disks have a radial temperature gradient and the continuum emission at a given radius is well described by a single blackbody. In the first method we measure the relative lags between the multiband light curves, which provides the relative time lag between shorter and longer wavelength variations. From this, we are only able to constrain upper limits on disk sizes, as many are consistent with no lag the 2 sigma level. The second method fits the model parameters for the canonical thin disk directly rather than solving for the individual time lags between the light curves. Our measurements demonstrate good agreement with the sizes predicted by this model for accretion rates between 0.3 and 1 times the Eddington rate. Given our large uncertainties, our measurements are also consistent with disk size measurements from gravitational microlensing studies of strongly lensed quasars, as well as other photometric reverberation mapping results, that find disk sizes that are a factor of a few (similar to 3) larger than predictions.

DES Collaboration	Stellar Streams Discovered in the Dark Energy Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We perform a search for stellar streams around the Milky Way using the first 3 yr of multiband optical imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We use DES data covering similar to 5000 deg(2) to a depth of g > 23.5 with a relative photometric calibration uncertainty of <1%. This data set yields unprecedented sensitivity to the stellar density field in the southern celestial hemisphere, enabling the detection of faint stellar streams to a heliocentric distance of similar to 50 kpc. We search for stellar streams using a matched filter in color-magnitude space derived from a synthetic isochrone of an old, metal-poor stellar population. Our detection technique recovers four previously known thin stellar streams: Phoenix, ATLAS, Tucana III, and a possible extension of Molonglo. In addition, we report the discovery of 11 new stellar streams. In general, the new streams detected by DES are fainter, more distant, and lower surface brightness than streams detected by similar techniques in previous photometric surveys. As a by-product of our stellar stream search, we find evidence for extratidal stellar structure associated with four globular clusters: NGC 288, NGC 1261, NGC 1851, and NGC 1904. The ever-growing sample of stellar streams will provide insight into the formation of the Galactic stellar halo, the Milky Way gravitational potential, and the large-and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way.

In this study we examine changes in the geometry, velocity and surface elevation of nine lake-terminating and nine land-terminating glaciers in the Everest region of the central Himalaya over the time period 2000 to 2015. The land-terminating glaciers we examined all decelerated (mean velocity change of - 0.16 to -5.60 m a(-1) for different glaciers), thinned most in their middle reaches, and developed a more gently sloping surface ( -0.02 to -0.37 degrees change) down-glacier over the period 2000-2015. The lake-terminating glaciers we examined all retreated (0.46 to 1.42 km), became steeper (0.04 to 8.68 degrees change), and showed maximum thinning towards their termini, but differed in terms of their dynamics, with one group of glaciers accelerating (mean speed-up of 0.18 to 8.04 m a(-1)) and the other decelerating (mean slow-down of -0.36 m a(-1) to -8.68 m a(-1)). We suggest that these two scenarios of glacier evolution each represent a different phase of glacial lake expansion; one that is accompanied by increasingly dynamic glacier behaviour and retreat, and a phase where glacial lakes have little impact on glacier behaviour that may precede or follow the phase of active retreat. Our observations are important because they quantify the interaction of glacial lake expansion with glacier ice mass loss, and show that increased glacier recession should be expected where a glacial lake has begun to develop.

Nongrowing season methane emissions-a significant component of annual emissions across northern ecosystems	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Wetlands are the single largest natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas, and occur extensively in the northern hemisphere. Large discrepancies remain between "bottom-up" and "top-down" estimates of northern CH4 emissions. To explore whether these discrepancies are due to poor representation of nongrowing season CH4 emissions, we synthesized nongrowing season and annual CH4 flux measurements from temperate, boreal, and tundra wetlands and uplands. Median nongrowing season wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 g/m(2) in bogs to 5.2 g/m(2) in marshes and were dependent on moisture, vegetation, and permafrost. Annual wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 gm(-2) year(-1) in tundra bogs to 78 gm(-2)year(-1) in temperate marshes. Uplands varied from CH4 sinks to CH4 sources with a median annual flux of 0.0 +/- 0.2 gm(-2)year(-1). The measured fraction of annual CH4 emissions during the nongrowing season (observed: 13% to 47%) was significantly larger than that was predicted by two process-based model ensembles, especially between 40 degrees and 60 degrees N (modeled: 4% to 17%). Constraining the model ensembles with the measured nongrowing fraction increased total nongrowing season and annual CH4 emissions. Using this constraint, the modeled nongrowing season wetland CH4 flux from >40 degrees north was 6.1 +/- 1.5 Tg/year, three times greater than the nongrowing season emissions of the unconstrained model ensemble. The annual wetland CH4 flux was 37 +/- 7 Tg/year from the data-constrained model ensemble, 25% larger than the unconstrained ensemble. Considering nongrowing season processes is critical for accurately estimating CH4 emissions from high-latitude ecosystems, and necessary for constraining the role of wetland emissions in a warming climate.

Sea State Bias of ICESat in the Subarctic Seas	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The fine spatial resolution of laser altimeters makes them potentially valuable to oceanography studying features at mesoscale, close to land, and in the marginal ice zone. To fulfill this promise, we must understand laser sea state bias (SSB). SSB occurs in the measurement of sea surface height in the presence of waves when the altimeter observations are preferentially influenced by particular parts (e.g., wave troughs) of the wave-covered surface. Radar altimeters have received considerable attention relating radar SSB to wave properties and wind speed. Comparatively, little attention has been devoted to the SSB of laser altimeters, and the studies of laser SSB which have been done have led to indeterminate or ambiguous results even as to sign. Here, we find that to make changes in satellite dynamic ocean topography (DOT) from the Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) period, 2004-2009, to the CryoSat-2 period, 2011-2015, consistent with hydrography plus ocean bottom pressure in the subarctic Greenland and Norwegian seas, we need to correct the ICESat DOT for SSB. On average, ICESat SSB is -18% of significant wave height in excess of 1.7 m.

After 3 years of operation, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) satellite has acquired a wealth of 1-band wide-swath SAR data over many areas using its ScanSAR mode. We present interferometry SAR (InSAR) time series analysis results from ALOS-2 ScanSAR data. We analyze the possible error sources in the InSAR and correct them if possible. We present different time series analysis results including azimuth frequency modulation rate error, line of sight (LOS) ionospheric phase, azimuth shift caused by the ionosphere, and LOS displacement processed using both full-aperture and burst-by-burst workflows. The final InSAR LOS displacement time series result reveals both large-scale tectonic and small-scale anthropogenic deformation components. The results demonstrate the potential for measuring continental or even global-scale tectonic deformation and illustrate the promise of upcoming L-band wide-swath SAR missions, such as the NASA-ISRO SAR mission.

Gas-phase rate coefficients for a series of alkyl cyclohexanes with OH radicals and Cl atoms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL KINETICS												The rate coefficients of the reactions of OH radicals and Cl atoms with three alkylcyclohexanes compounds, methylcyclohexane (MCH), trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane (DCH), and ethylcyclohexane (ECH) have been investigated at (293 +/- 1) K and 1000 mbar of air using relative rate methods. A majority of the experiments were performed in the Highly Instrumented Reactor for Atmospheric Chemistry (HIRAC), a stainless steel chamber using in situ FTIR analysis and online gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) detection to monitor the decay of the alkylcyclohexanes and the reference compounds. The studies were undertaken to provide kinetic data for calibrations of radical detection techniques in HIRAC. The following rate coefficients (in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) were obtained for Cl reactions: k((Cl+MCH)) = (3.51 +/- 0.37) x 10(-10), k((Cl+DCH)) = (3.63 +/- 0.38) x 10(-10), k((Cl+ECH)) = (3.88 +/- 0.41) x 10(-10), and for the reactions with OH radicals: k((OH+MCH)) = (9.5 +/- 1.3) x 10(-12), k((OH+DCH)) = (12.1 +/- 2.2) x 10(-12), k((OH+ECH)) = (11.8 +/- 2.0) x 10(-12). Errors are a combination of statistical errors in the relative rate ratio (2 sigma) and the error in the reference rate coefficient. Checks for possible systematic errors were made by the use of two reference compounds, two different measurement techniques, and also three different sources of OH were employed in this study: photolysis of CH3ONO with black lamps, photolysis of H2O2 at 254 nm, and nonphotolytic trans-2-butene ozonolysis. For DCH, some direct laser flash photolysis studies were also undertaken, producing results in good agreement with the relative rate measurements. Additionally, temperature-dependent rate coefficient investigations were performed for the reaction of methylcyclohexane with the OH radical over the range 273-343 K using the relative rate method; the resulting recommended Arrhenius expression is k((OH + MCH)) = (1.85 +/- 0.27) x 10(-11) exp((-1.62 +/- 0.16) kJ mol(-1)/RT) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The kinetic data are discussed in terms of OH and Cl reactivity trends, and comparisons are made with the existing literature values and with rate coefficients from structure-activity relationship methods. This is the first study on the rate coefficient determination of the reaction of ECH with OH radicals and chlorine atoms, respectively.

J	Sung, MK; Kim, SH; Kim, BM; Choi, YS				Sung, Mi-Kyung; Kim, Seon-Hwa; Kim, Baek-Min; Choi, Yong-Sang			Interdecadal Variability of the Warm Arctic and Cold Eurasia Pattern and Its North Atlantic Origin	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study investigates the origin of the interdecadal variability in the warm Arctic and cold Eurasia (WACE) pattern, which is defined as the second empirical orthogonal function of surface air temperature (SAT) variability over the Eurasian continent in Northern Hemisphere winter, by analyzing the Twentieth Century Reanalysis dataset. While previous studies highlight recent enhancement of the WACE pattern, ascribing it to anthropogenic warming, the authors found that the WACE pattern has experienced a seemingly periodic interdecadal variation over the twentieth century. This long-term variation in the Eurasian SAT is attributable to the altered coupling between the Siberian high (SH) and intraseasonal Rossby wave emanating from the North Atlantic, as the local wave branch interacts with the SH and consequentially enhances the continental temperature perturbation. It is further identified that these atmospheric circulation changes in Eurasia are largely controlled by the decadal amplitude modulation of the climatological stationary waves over the North Atlantic region. The altered decadal mean condition of stationary wave components brings changes in local baroclinicity and storm track activity over the North Atlantic, which jointly change the intraseasonal Rossby wave generation and propagation characteristics as well. With simple stationary wave model experiments, the authors confirm how the altered mean flow condition in the North Atlantic acts as a source for the growth of the Rossby wave that leads to the change in the downstream WACE pattern.

In Situ Analysis of Opal in Gale Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Silica enrichments resulting in up to 90wt% SiO2 have been observed by the Curiosity rover's instruments in Gale crater, Mars, within the Murray and Stimson formations. Samples acquired by the rover drill revealed a significant abundance of an X-ray amorphous silica phase. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) highlights an overall correlation of the hydrogen signal with silica content for these Si-enriched targets. The increased hydration of the high-silica rocks compared to the surrounding bedrock is also confirmed by active neutron spectroscopy. Laboratory LIBS experiments have been performed to calibrate the hydrogen signal and show that the correlation observed on Mars is consistent with a silica phase containing on average 6.31.4wt% water. X-ray diffraction and LIBS measurements indicate that opal-A, amorphous hydrated silica, is the most likely phase containing this water in the rocks. Pyrolysis experiments were also performed on drilled samples by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument to measure volatile content, but the data suggests that most of the water was released during handling prior to pyrolysis. The inferred low-temperature release of water helps constrain the nature of the opal. Given the geological context and the spatial association with other phases such as calcium sulfates, the opal was likely formed from multiple diagenetic fluid events and possibly represents the latest significant water-rock interaction in these sedimentary rocks.

Characterization of Hydrogen in Basaltic Materials With Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for Application to MSL ChemCam Data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												The Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, is equipped with ChemCam, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument, to determine the elemental composition of nearby targets quickly and remotely. We use a laboratory sample set including prepared mixtures of basalt with systematic variation in hydrated mineral content and compositionally well-characterized, altered basaltic volcanic rocks to measure hydrogen by characterizing the H-alpha emission line in LIBS spectra under Martian environmental conditions. The H contents of all samples were independently measured using thermogravimetric analysis. We found that H peak area increases with weight percent H for our laboratory mixtures with basaltic matrices. The increase is linear with weight percent H in the mixtures with structurally bound H up to about 1.25wt.% H and then steepens for higher H-content samples, a nonlinear trend not previously reported but potentially important for characterizing high water content materials. To compensate for instrument, environmental, and target matrix-related effects on quantification of H content from the LIBS signal, we examined multiple normalization methods. The best performing methods utilize O 778- and C 248-nm emission lines. The methods return comparable results when applied to ChemCam data of H-bearing materials on Mars. The calibration and normalization methods tested here will aid in investigations of H by LIBS on Mars with ChemCam and SuperCam. Further laboratory work will aid quantification across different physical matrices and heterogeneous textures because of differences we observed in H in pelletized and natural rock samples of the same composition. Plain Language Summary ChemCam, one of the Curiosity rover instruments, measures the chemical composition of nearby targets quickly and remotely using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The LIBS technique requires laboratory calibration to quantitatively determine the abundances of major and minor elements. We measured prepared mixtures of basalt with systematic variation in hydrated mineral content and compositionally well-characterized, altered basaltic volcanic rocks with a ChemCam-analog instrument under Martian environmental conditions to characterize LIBS hydrogen emission. To compensate for instrument, environmental, and target-related effects on quantification of H content from the LIBS signal, we tested multiple normalization methods. While the H signal increased nonlinearly with weight percent for high H samples, we found laboratory calibrations that allowed us to successfully determine the H content of Martian veins and bedrock measured by ChemCam.

J	Rollins, C; Avouac, JP; Landry, W; Argus, DF; Barbot, S				Rollins, Chris; Avouac, Jean-Philippe; Landry, Walter; Argus, Donald F.; Barbot, Sylvain			Interseismic Strain Accumulation on Faults Beneath Los Angeles, California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Geodetic data show that the Los Angeles metropolitan area is undergoing 8-9 mm/year of north-south tectonic shortening associated with the Big Bend of the San Andreas Fault. This shortening has been linked to multiple damaging twentieth century thrust earthquakes as well as possible Mw >= 7.0 Holocene thrust events beneath central Los Angeles. To better characterize this seismic hazard, we assess how this shortening is being accommodated by interseismic strain accumulation on subsurface faults, incorporating detailed seismology- and geology-based models of fault geometry and the low-stiffness Los Angeles sedimentary basin. We find that strain accumulation on local strike-slip faults likely contributes no more than 1-2 mm/year of the shortening. We formally invert the geodetic data for the pattern of interseismic strain accumulation on the north dipping Sierra Madre, Puente Hills, and Compton thrust faults and a master decollement. We explore the impact of the assumed material model, strain accumulation on faults to the west and east, and other model assumptions. We infer that the three faults slip at 3-4 mm/year over the long term and are currently partially or fully locked and accruing interseismic strain on their upper sections. This locking implies an annual deficit of seismic moment, 1.6 + 1.3/-0.5 x 10(17) Nm/year in total, which is presumably balanced over the long-term average by the moment released in earthquakes. The depth distribution of moment deficit accumulation rate matches that of seismicity rates in Los Angeles to first order, in part, because the models incorporate the blind nature of the Puente Hills and Compton Faults.				; Avouac, Jean-Philippe/B-5699-2015	Barbot, Sylvain/0000-0003-4257-7409; Avouac, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-3060-8442												2169-9313	2169-9356				AUG	2018	123	8					7126	7150		10.1029/2017JB015387							WOS:000446170700057

Submarine landforms reveal varying rates and styles of deglaciation in North-West Greenland fjords	MARINE GEOLOGY												An understanding of the former configuration and dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet is needed to provide a context for modern observations, to constrain numerical models and to predict the likely future ice-sheet response to climatic change. Whereas previous geophysical investigations of the North-West Greenland margin have focused on the mapping of full-glacial and deglacial landforms on the mid to outer shelf, relatively little is known about more recent ice-sheet dynamics on the inner shelf and in the fjords. We present swath-bathymetric data from the inner shelf and fjords of North-West Greenland. Streamlined subglacial landforms, including icesculpted bedrock and mega-scale glacial lineations, reveal the direction of Late Quaternary ice flow through fjords and across the inner shelf. Landforms that are transverse to the former ice-flow direction, including small recessional moraines, major moraine ridges and grounding-zone wedges, show the locations of former still-stands in the grounding zone during regional deglaciation and terminus readvances linked to the Little Ice Age. The distribution of submarine glacial landforms in the inner fjords suggests that the outlet glaciers of North-West Greenland experienced varying rates and styles of ice retreat during the late Holocene, which was probably controlled mainly by fjord water depth. Inner fjords that have contemporary water depths of < 350 m contain series of small recessional moraines, which indicate the slow retreat of a grounded ice margin. Small recessional moraines are generally absent from inner fjords with water depths of > 350 m, which are interpreted to have experienced more rapid ice retreat during the late Holocene.

Deep SOAR follow-up photometry of two Milky Way outer-halo companions discovered with Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We report the discovery of a new star cluster, DES 3, in the constellation of Indus, and deeper observations of the previously identified satellite DES J0222.7-5217 (Eridanus III). DES 3 was detected as a stellar overdensity in first-year Dark Energy Survey data, and confirmed with deeper photometry from the 4.1-m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope. The new system was detected with a relatively high significance and appears in the DES images as a compact concentration of faint blue point sources. We determine that DES 3 is located at a heliocentric distance of similar or equal to 76.2 kpc and it is dominated by an old (similar or equal to 9.8Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H] similar or equal to -1.84) population. While the age and metallicity values of DES 3 are comparable to typical globular clusters (objects with a high stellar density, stellar mass of similar to 10(5) M-circle dot and luminosity M-V similar to -7.3), its half-light radius (r(h) similar to 6.87 pc) and luminosity (M-V similar to -1.7) are more indicative of faint star cluster. Based on the angular size, DES 3, with a value of r(h) similar to 0.'31, is among the smallest faint star clusters known to date. Furthermore, using deeper imaging of DES J0222.7-5217 taken with the SOAR telescope, we update structural parameters and perform the first isochrone modelling. Our analysis yields the first age (similar or equal to 12.6Gyr) and metallicity ([Fe/H] similar or equal to -2.01) estimates for this object. The half-light radius (r(h) similar or equal to 11.24 pc) and luminosity (M-V similar or equal to -2.4) of DES J0222.7-5217 suggest that it is likely a faint star cluster. The discovery of DES 3 indicates that the census of stellar systems in the Milky Way is still far from complete, and demonstrates the power of modern wide-field imaging surveys to improve our knowledge of the Galaxy's satellite population.

Baryon content in a sample of 91 galaxy clusters selected by the South Pole Telescope at 0.2 < z < 1.25	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We estimate total mass (M-500), intracluster medium (ICM) mass (M-ICM), and stellar mass (M-star) in a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected sample of 91 galaxy clusters with masses M-500 greater than or similar to 2.5 x 10(14) M-circle dot and redshift 0.2 < z < 1.25 from the 2500 deg(2) South Pole Telescope SPT-SZ survey. The total masses M-500 are estimated from the SZE observable, the ICM masses M-ICM are obtained from the analysis of Chandra X-ray observations, and the stellar masses M-star are derived by fitting spectral energy distribution templates to Dark Energy Survey griz optical photometry and WISE or Spitzer near-infrared photometry. We study trends in the stellar mass, the ICM mass, the total baryonic mass, and the cold baryonic fraction with cluster halo mass and redshift. We find significant departures from self-similarity in the mass scaling for all quantities, while the redshift trends are all statistically consistent with zero, indicating that the baryon content of clusters at fixed mass has changed remarkably little over the past approximate to 9 Gyr. We compare our results to the mean baryon fraction (and the stellar mass fraction) in the field, finding that these values lie above (below) those in cluster virial regions in all but the most massive clusters at low redshift. Using a simple model of the matter assembly of clusters from infalling groups with lower masses and from infalling material from the low-density environment or field surrounding the parent haloes, we show that the measured mass trends without strong redshift trends in the stellar mass scaling relation could be explained by a mass and redshift dependent fractional contribution from field material. Similar analyses of the ICM and baryon mass scaling relations provide evidence for the so-called 'missing baryons' outside cluster virial regions.

Design and characterization of the Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Age (LEDA) radiometer systems	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												The Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Age (LEDA) was designed to detect the predicted O(100) mK sky-averaged absorption of the cosmic microwave background by hydrogen in the neutral pre-and intergalactic medium just after the cosmological Dark Age. The spectral signature would be associated with emergence of a diffuse Lya background from starlight during 'Cosmic Dawn'. Recently, Bowman et al. have reported detection of this predicted absorption feature, with an unexpectedly large amplitude of 530 mK, centred at 78 MHz. Verification of this result by an independent experiment, such as LEDA, is pressing. In this paper, we detail design and characterization of the LEDA radiometer systems, and a first-generation pipeline that instantiates a signal path model. Sited at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array, LEDA systems include the station correlator, five well-separated redundant dual polarization radiometers and back-end electronics. The radiometers deliver a 30-85MHz band (16 < z < 34) and operate as part of the larger interferometric array, for purposes ultimately of in situ calibration. Here, we report on the LEDA system design, calibration approach, and progress in characterization as of 2016 January. The LEDA systems are currently being modified to improve performance near 78 MHz in order to verify the purported absorption feature.

EPIC 219217635: a doubly eclipsing quadruple system containing an evolved binary	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We have discovered a doubly eclipsing, bound, quadruple star system in the field of K2 Campaign 7. EPIC 219217635 is a stellar image with K-p = 12.7 that contains an eclipsing binary (EB) with P-A = 3.59470 d and a second EB with P-B = 0.61825 d. We have obtained follow-up radial velocity (RV) spectroscopy observations, adaptive optics imaging, and ground-based photometric observations. From our analysis of all the observations, we derive good estimates for a number of the system parameters. We conclude that (1) both binaries are bound in a quadruple star system; (2) a linear trend to the RV curve of binary A is found over a 2-yr interval, corresponding to an acceleration, <(gamma)over dot> = 0.0024 +/- 0.0007 cm s(-2); (3) small irregular variations are seen in the eclipse timing variations (ETVs) detected over the same interval; (4) the orbital separation of the quadruple system is probably in the range of 8-25 au; and (5) the orbital planes of the two binaries must be inclined with respect to each other by at least 25 degrees. In addition, we find that binary B is evolved, and the cooler and currently less massive star has transferred much of its envelope to the currently more massive star. We have also demonstrated that the system is sufficiently bright that the eclipses can be followed using small ground-based telescopes, and that this system may be profitably studied over the next decade when the outer orbit of the quadruple is expected to manifest itself in the ETV and/or RV curves.

Preservation of potential biosignatures in the shallow subsurface of Europa	NATURE ASTRONOMY												Jupiter's moon Europa, which is thought to possess a large liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust, is one of the most compelling targets in the search for life beyond Earth. Its geologically young surface, along with a number of surface features, indicate that material from Europa's interior may be emplaced on the surface. However, the surface is affected by the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter's magnetosphere, which over time may lead to chemical alteration and destruction of potential biosignatures. We show that radiation dose rates are highly dependent on surface location. Radiation processing and destruction of potential biosignatures is found to be significant down to depths of -1cm in mid- to high-latitude regions, and to depths of 10-20 cm within 'radiation lenses' centred on the leading and trailing hemispheres. These results indicate that future missions to Europa's surface do not need to excavate material to great depths to investigate the composition of endogenic material and search for potential biosignatures.

Ecosystem heterogeneity and diversity mitigate Amazon forest resilience to frequent extreme droughts	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The impact of increases in drought frequency on the Amazon forest's composition, structure and functioning remain uncertain. We used a process- and individual-based ecosystem model (ED2) to quantify the forest's vulnerability to increased drought recurrence. We generated meteorologically realistic, drier-than-observed rainfall scenarios for two Amazon forest sites, Paracou (wetter) and Tapajos (drier), to evaluate the impacts of more frequent droughts on forest biomass, structure and composition. The wet site was insensitive to the tested scenarios, whereas at the dry site biomass declined when average rainfall reduction exceeded 15%, due to high mortality of large-sized evergreen trees. Biomass losses persisted when year-long drought recurrence was shorter than 2-7yr, depending upon soil texture and leaf phenology. From the site-level scenario results, we developed regionally applicable metrics to quantify the Amazon forest's climatological proximity to rainfall regimes likely to cause biomass loss >20% in 50yr according to ED2 predictions. Nearly 25% (1.8 million km(2)) of the Amazon forests could experience frequent droughts and biomass loss if mean annual rainfall or interannual variability changed by 2 sigma. At least 10% of the high-emission climate projections (CMIP5/RCP8.5 models) predict critically dry regimes over 25% of the Amazon forest area by 2100.

Assessing global surface water inundation dynamics using combined satellite information from SMAP, AMSR2 and Landsat	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A method to assess global land surface water (fw) inundation dynamics was developed by exploiting the enhanced fw sensitivity of L-band (1.4 GHz) passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The L-band fw (fw(LBand)) retrievals were derived using SMAP H-polarization brightness temperature (T-b) observations and predefined L-band reference microwave emissivities for water and land end-members. Potential soil moisture and vegetation contributions to the microwave signal were represented from overlapping higher frequency T-b observations from AMSR2. The resulting fw(LBand) global record has high temporal sampling (1-3 days) and 36-km spatial resolution. The fw(LBand) annual averages corresponded favorably (R = 0.85, p-value < 0.001) with a 250-m resolution static global water map (MOD44W) aggregated at the same spatial scale, while capturing significant inundation variations worldwide. The monthly fw(LBand) averages also showed seasonal inundation changes consistent with river discharge records within six major US river basins. An uncertainty analysis indicated generally reliable fw(LBand) performance for major land cover areas and under low to moderate vegetation cover, but with lower accuracy for detecting water bodies covered by dense vegetation. Finer resolution (30-m)fw(LBand) results were obtained for three sub-regions in North America using an empirical downscaling approach and ancillary global Water Occurrence Dataset (WOD) derived from the historical Landsat record. The resulting 30-m fw(LBand) retrievals showed favorable spatial accuracy for water (commission error 31.46%, omission error 30.20%) and land (commission error 0.87%, omission error 0.96%) classifications and seasonal wet and dry periods when compared to independent water maps derived from Landsat-8 imagery. The new fw(LBand) algorithms and continuing SMAP and AMSR2 operations provide for near real-time, multi-scale monitoring of global surface water inundation dynamics and potential flood risk.

Limited intraseasonal cyclogenesis prediction skill with a high false alarm rate is found when averaged over about 600 tropical cyclones (TCs) over global oceans from 2003 to 2013, particularly over the North Atlantic (NA). Relatively skillful genesis predictions with more than 1-week lead time are only evident for about 10% of the total TCs. Further analyses suggest that TCs with relatively higher genesis skill are closely associated with the Madden Julian oscillation (MJO) and tropical synoptic waves, with their geneses strongly phase-locked to the convectively active region of the MJO and low-level cyclonic vorticity associated with synoptic-scale waves. Moreover, higher cyclogenesis prediction skill is found for TCs that formed during the enhanced periods of strong MJO episodes than those during weak or suppressed MJO periods. All these results confirm the critical role of the MJO and tropical synoptic waves for intraseasonal prediction of TC activity. Tropical cyclogenesis prediction skill in this coupled model is found to be closely associated with model predictability of several large-scale dynamical and thermodynamical fields. Particularly over the NA, higher predictability of low-level relative vorticity, midlevel humidity, and vertical zonal wind shear is evident along a tropical belt from the West Africa coast to the Caribbean Sea, in accord with more predictable cyclogenesis over this region. Over the extratropical NA, large-scale variables exhibit less predictability due to influences of extratropical systems, leading to poor cyclogenesis predictive skill.

Power Laws of Topography and Gravity Spectra of the Solar System Bodies	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												When a spacecraft visits a new planetary body, it is useful to know the properties of its shape and gravity field. This knowledge helps predict the magnitude of the perturbations in the motion of the spacecraft due to nonsphericity of a body's gravity field as well as planning for an observational campaign. It has been known for the terrestrial planets that the power spectrum of the gravity field follows a power law, also known as the Kaula rule (Kaula, 1963, ; Rapp, 1989, ). A similar rule was derived for topography (Vening Meinesz, 1951). The goal of this study is to generalize the power law dependence of the gravity and topography spectra for solid surface solar system bodies across a wide range of body sizes. Traditionally, it is assumed that the gravity and topography power spectra of planets scale as g(-2), where g is the surface gravity. This gravity scaling also works for the minor bodies to first order. However, we find that a better fit can be achieved using a more general scaling based on the body's radius and mean density. We outline a procedure on how to use this general scaling for topography to provide an a priori estimate for the gravity power spectrum. We show that for irregularly shaped bodies the gravity power spectrum is no longer a power law even if their topography spectrum is a power law. Such a generalization would be useful for observation planning in the future space missions to the minor bodies for which little is known. Plain Language Summary We used the available models of shape and gravity field of the solar system bodies. We study how the amplitude of the mountains and valleys in gravity and topography depends on their size. Mountains on Mars are greater than on the Earth and yet larger on asteroid Vesta compared relative to the body's size. The same is true for gravity: Relative variations in gravity are larger on smaller bodies. We quantify this dependence and develop a method to predict the variations in gravity and topography depending on the body's size and density.

Tide gauge records reveal improved processing of gravity recovery and climate experiment time-variable mass solutions over the coastal ocean	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Monthly ocean bottom pressure solutions from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), derived using surface spherical cap mass concentration (MC) blocks and spherical harmonics (SH) basis functions, are compared to tide gauge (TG) monthly averaged sea level data over 2003-2015 to evaluate improved gravimetric data processing methods near the coast. MC solutions can explain greater than or similar to 42 per cent of the monthly variance in TG time-series over broad shelf regions and in semi-enclosed marginal seas. MC solutions also generally explain similar to 5-32 per cent more TG data variance than SH estimates. Applying a coastline resolution improvement algorithm in the GRACE data processing leads to similar to 31 per cent more variance in TG records explained by the MC solution on average compared to not using this algorithm. Synthetic observations sampled from an ocean general circulation model exhibit similar patterns of correspondence between modelled TG and MC time-series and differences between MC and SH time-series in terms of their relationship with TG time-series, suggesting that observational results here are generally consistent with expectations from ocean dynamics. This work demonstrates the improved quality of recent MC solutions compared to earlier SH estimates over the coastal ocean, and suggests that the MC solutions could be a useful tool for understanding contemporary coastal sea level variability and change.

Water Column Stability and the Role of Velocity Shear on a Seasonally Stratified Shelf, Mississippi Bight, Northern Gulf of Mexico	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Water column stability is a critical component of coastal systems, regulating the vertical exchange of momentum, mass, and biogeochemical constituents. Observations of water column velocity and hydrographic conditions during the summer of 2010 were used to investigate aspects of the region of freshwater influence in the Mississippi Bight. Conductivity-temperature-depth surveys south of Mobile Bay indicated strong stratification (peak buoyancy frequencies 0.09-0.3s(-1)) across the inner and midshelf. Despite this strong stratification, mooring data from the 20-m isobath indicated that the bulk Richardson numbers (Ri) can span 3 orders of magnitude, O(1-100). Examination of the high-frequency (hourly) shear and buoyancy frequency time series revealed downwelling conditions, and near-inertial oscillations were primarily responsible for generating instances of relatively low stability (bulk Ri<1). Periods of intense near-inertial oscillations also intermittently drove synthetic gradient Ri to critical or near-critical levels within the pycnocline. While the near-inertial oscillations were dominated by a clockwise rotating two-layer structure, there was also a secondary three-layer structure, both of which interacted with the low-frequency upwelling to produce highly variable vertical structuring of the horizontal velocity. The resulting velocity shear on water column stability may have important implications for shelf hypoxia during the stratified season in the Mississippi Bight.

The plasma is distributed into a torus of material around Jupiter, called the Io plasma torus. The Juno spacecraft performed its first perijove on 27 August 2016. During this time the spacecraft's X and Ka-band radio signals passed through the Io plasma torus. From the differential Doppler shift of the X and Ka-band frequencies we are able to determine the Io plasma torus total electron content. From the total electron content, we determine that the electron densities are larger than predicted from Voyager-based models by around 35 +/- 14% in the cold torus and 38 +/- 14% in the torus beyond 5.5 R-J. The ion temperatures were greater than predicted from the models by 44 +/- 15% in the cold torus but consistent with models in the torus beyond 5.5 R-J. From the time of maximum total electron content, which is sensitive to the torus location, we also find the Io plasma torus equatorial plane appears to be tilted by about 1.5 degrees more than the nominal centrifugal equator tilt based on the tilt of a dipole magnetic field approximation. Different tilts were found for the cold torus and torus beyond 5.5 R-J.																	2169-9380	2169-9402				AUG	2018	123	8					6207	6222		10.1029/2017JA025113							WOS:000445731300008

To test the performance of the V23 product over Mongolia, we compared values of MISR AOD with spatially and temporally matched AOD from the Dalanzadgad AERONET site and find good agreement (correlation r = 0.845, and root-mean-square deviation RMSD = 0.071). Over UB, exploratory principal component analysis indicates that the 74 MISR AOD mixture profiles consisted primarily of small, spherical, non-absorbing aerosols in the wintertime, and contributions from medium and large dust particles in the summertime. Comparing several machine learning methods for relating the 74 MISR mixtures to ground-level pollutants, including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and 10 mu m (PM10), as well as sulfur dioxide (SO2), a proxy for sulfate particles, we find that Support Vector Machine regression consistently has the highest predictive performance with median test R-2 for PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 equal to 0.461, 0.063, and 0.508, respectively. These results indicate that the high-dimensional MISR AOD mixture set can provide reliable predictions of air pollution and can distinguish dominant particle types in the UB region.

VADASE was presented in previous works as an approach able to estimate in real time the velocities and displacements in a global reference frame (ITRF), using high-rate (1 Hz or more) carrier phase observations and broadcast products (orbits, clocks) collected by a stand-alone GNSS receiver, achieving a displacements accuracy within 1-2 cm (usually better) over intervals up to a few minutes. It has been well known since the very first implementation and testing of VADASE that the estimated displacements might be impacted by two different effects: spurious spikes in the velocities due to outliers (consequently, displacements, obtained through velocities integration, are severely corrupted) and trends in the displacements time series, mainly due to broadcast orbit and clock errors. Two strategies are herein introduced, respectively based on Leave-One-Out cross-validation (VADASE-LOO) for a receiver autonomous outlier detection, and on a network augmentation strategy to filter common trends out (A-VADASE); they are combined (first, VADASE-LOO; second, A-VADASE) for a complete solution. Moreover, starting from this VADASE improved solution, an additional strategy is proposed to estimate in real time the overall coseismic displacement occurring at each GNSS receiver. New VADASE advances are successfully applied to the GPS data collected during the recent three strong earthquakes that occurred in Central Italy on 24 August and 26 and 30 October 2016, and the results are herein presented and discussed. The VADASE real-time estimated coseismic displacements are compared to the static ones derived from the daily solutions obtained within the standard post-processing procedure by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.

The full-Stokes ice flow model (Elmer/Ice) is initialized using an inverse method to infer the basal friction coefficient from a satellite-derived surface velocity mosaic. The high surface velocities (7.6 km a(-1)) near the glacier front are explained by low basal shear stresses (<25 kPa). The modelling results suggest that 98% of the surface velocities are due to basal sliding in the fast-flowing glacier tongue (>1 km a(-1)). We force the model using different surface mass-balance scenarios taken or adapted from previous studies and geodetic elevation changes between 2000 and 2012. Our results suggest that previous estimates of average surface mass balance over the entire glacier (B.) were likely too high, mainly due to an overestimation in the accumulation area. We propose that most of SRG imbalance is due to the large ice discharge (-0.83 +/- 0.08 Gt a(-1)) and a slightly positive B. (0.08 +/- 0.06 Gt a(-1)). The committed mass-loss estimate over the next century is -0.34 +/- 0.03 Gt a(-1). This study demonstrates that surface mass-balance estimates and glacier wastage projections can be improved using a physically based ice flow model.

Assessment of Radiative Forcing by Light-Absorbing Particles in Snow from In Situ Observations with Radiative Transfer Modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												It is well established that episodic deposition of dust on mountain snow reduces snow albedo and impacts snow hydrology in the western United States, particularly in the Colorado Rockies, which are headwaters for the Colorado River. Until recently the snow observations needed to physically quantify radiative forcing (RF) by dust on snow were lacking, and analysis of impacts used a semiempirical relationship between snow optical properties and observed surface reflectance. Here, we present a physically based daily time series of RF by dust and black carbon (BC) in snow at Senator Beck Basin Study Area, Colorado. Over the 2013 ablation season (March-May), a snow-aerosol radiative transfer model was forced with near daily measured snow property inputs (density, effective grain size, and dust/BC concentrations) and validated with coincidentally measured spectral albedo. Over the measurement period, instantaneous RF by dust and BC in snow ranged from 0.25 to 525 W m(-2), with daily averages ranging from 0 to 347 W m(-2). Dust dominated particulate mass, accounting for more than 90% of RF. The semiempirical RF values, which constitute the continuous long-term record, compared well to the physically based RF values; over the full time series, daily reported semiempirical RF values were 8 W m(-2) higher on average, with a root-mean-square difference of 16 W m(-2).

Criegee Intermediate Reactions with Carboxylic Acids: A Potential Source of Secondary Organic Aerosol in the Atmosphere	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Trace atmospheric concentrations of carboxylic acids have a potent effect upon the environment, where they modulate aqueous chemistry and perturb Earth's radiative balance. Halogenated carboxylic acids are produced by the tropospheric oxidation of halocarbons and are considered persistent pollutants because of their weak tropospheric and aqueous sinks. However, recent studies reported rapid reactions between selected carboxylic acids and Criegee intermediates, which may provide an efficient gas-phase removal process. Accordingly, absolute rate coefficients of two Criegee intermediates, CH2OO and (CH3)(2)COO, with a suite of carboxylic acids (HCOOH, CH3COOH, CClF2COOH, CF3CF2COOH, and pyruvic acid) were measured with a view to develop a structure activity relationship (SAR). This SAR is based upon the dipole-capture model and predicts the reactivity of many further combinations of Criegee intermediates and carboxylic acids. Complementary synchrotron-based photoionization mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that these reactions produce stable ester adducts, with a reaction coordinate involving transfer of the acidic hydrogen from the carboxylic acid to the terminal oxygen of the Criegee intermediate. The adduct products are predicted to have low vapor pressures, and coupling of this chemistry with a global atmospheric chemistry and transport model shows significant production of secondary organic aerosol at locations rich in biogenic alkene emissions.

A Method to Separate Proton Damage in LED and Phototransistor of Optocouplers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE					Conference on Radiation and Its Effects on Components and Systems (RADECS)	OCT 02-06, 2017	Geneva, SWITZERLAND					This paper reports proton damage in light-emitting diode (LED) and phototransistor of the Micropac 66296 optocoupler. Our results show that the optocoupler current transfer ratio (CTR) data are influenced by the gain of the phototransistor. Analysis of the test data reveals interesting information, such as the dependence of the phototransistor gain on irradiation and photocurrent. Only a small reduction of phototransistor gain is observed with increasing irradiation when the irradiation is sufficiently large. The phototransistor gain reduction is more significant when comparisons are made with the unirradiated case. Statistical analysis is performed, using a one-sided tolerance method, on the LED light intensity and the optocoupler CTR data. Mean and statistically derated values of the optocoupler CTR and the LED light intensity data at room temperature are presented.																	0018-9499	1558-1578				AUG	2018	65	8	1				1553	1560		10.1109/TNS.2018.2819960							WOS:000442363300014

We review a recently proposed method for estimating the average satellite population around a given sample of nearby bright galaxies, using a combination of size and magnitude cuts (to select low-redshift dwarf galaxies preferentially) and clustering measurements (to estimate the fraction of true satellites in the cut sample). We test this method using the high-precision photometric redshift catalogue of the COSMOS survey, exploring the effect of specific cuts on the clustering signal. The most effective of the size-magnitude cuts considered recover the clustering signal around low-redshift primaries (z < 0.15) with about two-thirds of the signal and 80 per cent of the signal-to-noise ratio obtainable using the full COSMOS photometric redshifts. These cuts are also fairly efficient, with more than one-third of the selected objects being clustered satellites. We conclude that structural selection represents a useful tool in characterizing dwarf populations to fainter magnitudes and/or over larger areas than are feasible with spectroscopic surveys. In reviewing the low-redshift content of the COSMOS field, we also note the existence of several dozen objects that appear resolved or partially resolved in the HST imaging, and are confirmed to be local (at distances of similar to 250 Mpc or less) by their photometric or spectroscopic redshifts. This underlines the potential for future space-based surveys to reveal local populations of intrinsically faint galaxies through imaging alone.

Our work is motivated by the need to quickly process streams with millions of events generated e.g. by the Curiosity rover on Mars. The approach builds a hierarchy of event abstractions for telemetry visualization and querying to aid human comprehension. Such abstractions can also be used as input to other runtime verification tools. Our notation is inspired by Allen's Temporal Logic, and provides a rule-based declarative way to express event abstractions. We present an algorithm for applying specifications to an event stream and explore modifications to improve the algorithm's asymptotic complexity. The system is implemented in both Scala and C, with the specification language implemented as internal as well as external DSLs. We illustrate the solution with several examples, a performance evaluation, and a real telemetry analysis scenario.

Optimizing biomass estimates of savanna woodland at different spatial scales in the Brazilian Cerrado: Re-evaluating allometric equations and environmental influences	PLOS ONE												Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and accounted for the second largest contribution to carbon emissions in Brazil for the last 10 years, mainly due to land-use changes. It comprises approximately 2 million km(2) and is divided into 22 ecoregions, based on environmental conditions and vegetation. The most dominant vegetation type is cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado ss), a savanna woodland. Quantifying variation of biomass density of this vegetation is crucial for climate change mitigation policies. Integrating remote sensing data with adequate allometric equations and field-based data sets can provide large-scale estimates of biomass. We developed individual-tree aboveground biomass (AGB) allometric models to compare different regression techniques and explanatory variables. We applied the model with the strongest fit to a comprehensive ground-based data set (77 sites, 893 plots, and 95,484 trees) to describe AGB density variation of cerrado ss. We also investigated the influence of physiographic and climatological variables on AGB density; this analysis was restricted to 68 sites because eight sites could not be classified into a specific ecoregion, and one site had no soil texture data. In addition, we developed two models to estimate plot AGB density based on plot basal area. Our data show that for individual-tree AGB models a) log-log linear models provided better estimates than nonlinear power models; b) including species as a random effect improved model fit; c) diameter at 30 cm above ground was a reliable predictor for individual-tree AGB, and although height significantly improved model fit, species wood density did not. Mean tree AGB density in cerrado ss was 22.9 tons ha(-1) (95% confidence interval = +/- 2.2) and varied widely between ecoregions (8.8 to 42.2 tons ha(-1)), within ecoregions (e.g. 4.8 to 39.5 tons ha(-1)), and even within sites (24.3 to 69.9 tons ha(-1)). Biomass density tended to be higher in sites close to the Amazon. Ecoregion explained 42% of biomass variation between the 68 sites (P < 0.01) and shows strong potential as a parameter for classifying regional biomass variation in the Cerrado.

Noise-marginalized optimal statistic: A robust hybrid frequentist-Bayesian statistic for the stochastic gravitational-wave background in pulsar timing arrays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												Observations have revealed that nearly all galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers. When galaxies merge, these SMBHs form SMBH binaries (SMBHBs) that emit low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The incoherent superposition of these sources produce a stochastic GW background (GWB) that can be observed by pulsar timing arrays. The optimal statistic is a frequentist estimator of the amplitude of the GWB that specifically looks for the spatial correlations between pulsars induced by the GWB. In this paper, we introduce an improved method for computing the optimal statistic that marginalizes over the red noise in individual pulsars. We use simulations to demonstrate that this method more accurately determines the strength of the GWB, and we use the noise-marginalized optimal statistic to compare the significance of monopole, dipole, and Hellings-Downs (HD) spatial correlations and perform sky scrambles.																	2470-0010	2470-0029				AUG 1	2018	98	4							044003	10.1103/PhysRevD.98.044003							WOS:000440413600006

A WISE Survey of Circumstellar Disks in the Upper Scorpius Association	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We have performed a survey for new members of the Upper Sco association that have circumstellar disks using mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).

They comprise similar to 36% of the known disk-bearing members of the association. We also have compiled all available mid-infrared photometry from WISE and the Spitzer Space Telescope for the known members of Upper Sco, resulting in a catalog of data for 1608 objects. We have used these data to identify the members that exhibit excess emission from disks and we have classified the evolutionary stages of those disks with criteria similar to those applied in our previous studies of Taurus and Upper Sco. Among 484 members with excesses in at least one band (excluding five Be stars), we classify 296 disks as full, 66 as evolved, 19 as transitional, 22 as evolved or transitional, and 81 as evolved transitional or debris. Many of these disks have not been previously reported, including 129 full disks and 50 disks that are at more advanced evolutionary stages.

New Young Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Upper Scorpius Association	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												To improve the census of the Upper Sco association (similar to 11 Myr, similar to 145 pc), we have identified candidate members using parallaxes, proper motions, and color-magnitude diagrams from several wide-field imaging surveys and have obtained optical and infrared spectra of several hundred candidates to measure their spectral types and assess their membership. We also have performed spectroscopy on a smaller sample of previously known or suspected members to refine their spectral types and evidence of membership. We have classified 530 targets as members of Upper Sco, 377 of which lack previous spectroscopy. Our new compilation of all known members of the association contains 1631 objects. Although the census of Upper Sco has expanded significantly over the last decade, there remain hundreds of candidates that lack spectroscopy. The precise parallaxes and proper motions from the second data release of Gaia should extend down to substellar masses in Upper Sco, which will greatly facilitate the identification of the undiscovered members.

A Family-based Method of Quantifying NEOWISE Diameter Errors	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												Quantifying the accuracy with which physical properties of asteroids can be determined from thermal modeling is critical to measuring the impact of infrared data on our understanding of asteroids. Previous work has used independently derived diameters (from asteroid radar, occultations, and spacecraft visits) to test the accuracy of the NEOWISE diameter determinations. Here, we present a new and different method for bounding the actual NEOWISE diameter errors in the Main Belt based on our knowledge of the albedos of asteroid families. We show the 1 sigma relative diameter error for the Main Belt population must be less than 17.5% for the vast majority of objects. For a typical uncertainty on H magnitude of 0.2 mag, the relative error on diameter for the population would be similar to 10%.																	0004-6256	1538-3881				AUG	2018	156	2							62	10.3847/1538-3881/aacbd4							WOS:000439880400004

Small and Nearby NEOs Observed by NEOWISE During the First Three Years of Survey: Physical Properties	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												Automated asteroid detection routines set requirements on the number of detections, signal-to-noise ratio, and the linearity of the expected motion in order to balance completeness, reliability, and time delay after data acquisition when identifying moving object tracklets. However, when the full-frame data from a survey are archived, they can be searched later for asteroids that were below the initial detection thresholds. We have conducted such a search of the first three years of the reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data, looking for near-Earth objects discovered by ground-based surveys that have previously unreported thermal infrared data. Using these measurements, we can then perform thermal modeling to measure the diameters and albedos of these objects. We present new physical properties for 116 Near-Earth Objects found in this search.

Accurate Ground-based Near-Earth-Asteroid Astrometry Using Synthetic Tracking	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												Accurate astrometry is crucial for determining orbits of near-Earth-asteroids (NEAs) and therefore better tracking them. This paper reports on a demonstration of 10 mas level astrometric precision on a dozen NEAs using the Pomona College 40 inch telescope, at the JPL's Table Mountain Facility. We used the technique of synthetic tracking (ST), in which many short-exposure (1 s) images are acquired and then combined in post-processing to track both target asteroid and reference stars across the field of view. This technique avoids the trailing loss and keeps the jitter effects from atmosphere and telescope pointing common between the asteroid and reference stars, resulting in higher astrometric precision than the 100 mas level astrometry from traditional approach of using long exposure images. Treating our ST of near-Earth asteroids as a proxy for observations of future spacecraft while they are downlinking data via their high rate optical communication laser beams, our approach shows precision plane-of-sky measurements can be obtained by the optical ground terminals for navigation. We also discuss how future data releases from the Gaia mission can improve our results.

When used operationally by authorities, a tradeoff must usually be made between the covered area and the quantity of information collected by the radar. To identify the most appropriate imaging mode, a methodology based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis has been applied to an original data set collected by two airborne systems operating at L-hand, both characterized by a very low instrument noise floor. The data set was acquired during controlled releases of mineral and vegetable oil at sea. Various polarization-dependent quantities are investigated, and their ability to detect slick-covered areas is assessed. A relative ordering of the main polarimetric parameters is reported in this paper. When the sensor has a sufficiently low noise floor, HV is recommended because it provides the strongest slick- sea contrast. Otherwise, VV is found to be the most relevant parameter for detecting slicks on the ocean surface. Among all the investigated quad-polarimetric settings, no significant added value compared to single-polarized data was found. More specifically, it is demonstrated, by increasing the instrument noise level, that the studied polarimetric quantities which combine the four polarimetric channels have performances of detection mainly driven by the instrument noise floor, namely, the noise equivalent sigma zero. This result, obtained by progressively adding noise to the raw synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, indicates that the polarimetric discrimination between clean sea and polluted area results mainly from the differentiated behavior between single-bounce scattering and noise. It is thus demonstrated, using SAR data collected with a low instrument noise floor, that there is no deviation from Bragg scattering for radar scattering from ocean surface covered by mineral and vegetable oil.

In this paper, we focus on anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSIs) and propose a novel detection algorithm based on spectral unmixing and dictionary-based low-rank decomposition. The innovation is threefold. First, due to the highly mixed nature of pixels in HSI data, instead of using the raw pixel directly for anomaly detection, the proposed algorithm applies spectral unmixing to obtain the abundance vectors and uses these vectors for anomaly detection. We show that the abundance vectors possess more distinctive features to identify anomaly from background. Second, to better represent the highly correlated background and the sparse anomaly, we construct a dictionary based on the mean shift clustering of the abundance vectors to improve both the discriminative and representative powers of the algorithm. Finally, a low-rank matrix decomposition method based on the constructed dictionary is proposed to encourage the coefficients of the dictionary, instead of the background itself, to be low rank, and the residual matrix to be sparse. Anomalies can then be extracted by summing up the columns of the residual matrix. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach constantly achieves high detection rate, while maintaining low false alarm rate regardless of the type of images tested.

The systematic effects that hinder the isolation of the precipitation information are described and their significance and separability are assessed.

The C II line is a prime candidate to be a tracer of star formation over large-scale structure since it is one of the brightest emission lines from galaxies. Redshifted C II emission appears in the submillimeter regime, which means it could potentially be present in the higher frequency intensity data from the Planck satellite is used to measure the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We search for CII emission over redshifts z = 2-3.2 in the Planck 545 GHz intensity map by cross-correlating the three highest frequency Planck maps with spectroscopic quasars and CMASS galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III, which we then use to jointly fit CII intensity, CIB parameters, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) emission. We report a measurement of an anomalous emission I-v = 6.6(-4.8)(+5.0) x 10(4) Jy sr(-1) at 95 per cent confidence, which could be explained by C II emission, favouring collisional excitation models of CII emission that tend to be more optimistic than models based on CII luminosity scaling relations from local measurements; however, a comparison of Bayesian information criteria reveals that this model and the CIB & SZ model are equally plausible. Thus, more sensitive measurements will be needed to confirm the existence of a large-scale CII emission at high redshifts. Finally, we forecast that intensity maps from Planck cross-correlated with quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument would increase our sensitivity to CII emission by a factor of 5, while the proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer could increase the sensitivity further.																	0035-8711	1365-2966				AUG	2018	478	2					1911	1924		10.1093/mnras/sty1243							WOS:000439547400038

A KEYFRAME-BASED APPROACH FOR OBSERVABLE GPS-DEGRADED NAVIGATION	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE												State estimation for micro air vehicles (MAVs) often depends heavily on reliable global measurements such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). When global measurements are unavailable, additional sensors, such as cameras or laser scanners, are commonly used to provide measurements of the MAV's translation and rotation relative to a previously observed keyframe image or scan. With the use of only relative sensors, however, the global position and heading of the vehicle are unobservable and cannot be reliably reconstructed. Many existing approaches work with respect to a global reference frame, resulting in a loss of state observability. This article highlights that unobservability leads to inconsistency and a loss of optimality, which reduces estimation accuracy and robustness of the navigation solution. Relative navigation is presented as an alternative approach that maintains observability by always working with respect to a local coordinate frame. While still subject to global drift, relative navigation is shown through rigorous simulation and hardware validation to produce accurate and consistent state estimates when other approaches break down. By subtly restructuring the state estimation problem to a relative framework, many of the pitfalls prevalent in GPS-denied MAV navigation systems are inherently mitigated.

Frankenstein or a Submarine Alkaline Vent: Who is Responsible for Abiogenesis?: Part 2: As life is now, so it must have been in the beginning	BIOESSAYS												We argued in Part 1 of this series that because all living systems are extremely far-from-equilibrium dynamic confections of matter, they must necessarily be driven to that state by the conversion of chemically specific external disequilibria into specific internal disequilibria. Such conversions require task-specific macromolecular engines. We here argue that the same is not only true of life at its emergence; it is the enabling cause of that emergence; although here the external driving disequilibria, and the conversion engines needed must have been abiotic. We argue further that the initial step in life's emergence can only create an extremely simple non-equilibrium seed from which all the complexity of life must then develop. We assert that this complexity develops incrementally and progressively, each step tested for value added in flight. And we make the case that only the submarine alkaline hydrothermal vent (AHV) model has the potential to satisfy these requirements.																	0265-9247	1521-1878				AUG	2018	40	8							1700182	10.1002/bies.201700182							WOS:000439748100002	29974482

We present evidence from diagnostic and inversion models constrained by satellite fluorescence and airborne CO2 from 2012 to 2014 indicating the timing and magnitude of spring carbon uptake in Alaska correlates with landscape thaw and ecoregion. Landscape thaw in boreal forests typically occurs in late April (DOY 111 +/- 7) with a 29 +/- 6 day lag until photosynthetic onset. North Slope tundra thaws 3weeks later (DOY 133 +/- 5) but experiences only a 20 +/- 5 day lag until photosynthetic onset. These time lag differences reflect efficient cold season adaptation in tundra shrub and the longer dehardening period for boreal evergreens. Despite the short transition from thaw to photosynthetic onset in tundra, synchrony of tundra respiration with snow melt and landscape thaw delays the transition from net carbon loss (at photosynthetic onset) to net uptake by 13 +/- 7 days, thus reducing the tundra net carbon uptake period. Two global CO2 inversions using a CASA-GFED model prior estimate earlier northern high latitude net carbon uptake compared to our regional inversion, which we attribute to (i) early photosynthetic-onset model prior bias, (ii) inverse method (scaling factor+optimization window), and (iii) sparsity of available Alaskan CO2 observations. Another global inversion with zero prior estimates the same timing for net carbon uptake as the regional model but smaller seasonal amplitude. The analysis of Alaskan eddy covariance observations confirms regional scale findings for tundra, but indicates that photosynthesis and net carbon uptake occur up to 1 month earlier in evergreens than captured by models or CO2 inversions, with better correlation to above-freezing air temperature than date of primary thaw. Further collection and analysis of boreal evergreen species over multiple years and at additional subarctic flux towers are critically needed.

Using spectroscopic and polarimetric data from the Gemini Planet Imager in H-band (1.6 mu m), we detect the highly inclined (i = 85 degrees) ring of debris down to a projected separation of similar to 12 au (similar to 0.'' 12) for the first time. Optical imaging from HST/STIS shows a smooth dust halo extending outward from the ring to >140 au (>1.'' 1 4). We measure the ring's scattering phase function and polarization fraction over scattering angles of 22 degrees-125 degrees, showing a preference for forward scattering and a polarization fraction that peaks at similar to 30% near the ansae. Modeling of the scattered-light disk indicates that the ring spans radii of similar to 60-220 au, has a vertical thickness similar to that of other resolved dust rings, and contains grains as small as 1.5 mu m in diameter. These models also suggest the grains have a low porosity, are more likely to consist of carbon than astrosilicates, and contain significant water ice. The halo has a surface brightness profile consistent with that expected from grains pushed by radiation pressure from the main ring onto highly eccentric but still bound orbits. We also briefly investigate arrangements of a possible inner disk component implied by our spectral energy distribution models, and speculate about the limitations of Mie theory for doing detailed analyses of debris disk dust populations.

We used multi-temporal airborne Lidar data and field measurements of coarse woody debris to estimate patterns of canopy turnover and associated carbon losses in intact and fragmented forests in the central Brazilian Amazon between 2013-2014 and 2014-2016. Average annualized canopy turnover rates increased by 65% during the drought period in both intact and fragmented forests. The average size and height of turnover events was similar for both time intervals, in contrast to expectations that the 2015-2016 El Nino drought would disproportionally affect large trees. Lidar-biomass relationships between canopy turnover and field measurements of coarse woody debris were modest (R-2 approximate to 0.3), given similar coarse woody debris production and Lidar-derived changes in canopy volume from single tree and multiple branch fall events. Our findings suggest that El Nino conditions accelerated canopy turnover in central Amazon forests, increasing coarse woody debris production by 62% to 1.22 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in drought years .

The study is based on quad-polarization data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar over experimental oil slicks under relatively high winds of 10-12 m/s over an 8-hour period. The data is collected over a wide range of incidence angles and alternates between looking upwind (UW) and downwind (DW). The unique time series enables a detailed study of the behavior of multipolarization parameters over clean sea and oil slicks under varying imaging geometry to be carried out for the first time. For clean sea backscatter, our findings are in agreement with previous studies, showing decreasing backscatter as the incidence angle increases and from UW to DW, with the highest sensitivity in the HH channel. We also find similar variations in oil covered areas. The results suggest that the oil slick backscatter is slightly more sensitive to the relative wind direction than the clean sea, and higher oil-sea damping ratios are found in DW than in UW cases, particularly in the HH channel. All multipolarization features investigated have some degree of dependency on imaging geometry. The lowest sensitivities are found in the magnitude of the copolarization correlation coefficient, the standard deviation of the copolarized phase difference, the polarization difference, the mean scattering angle and the entropy. Several features clearly change behavior when the signal approaches the sensor noise floor, and we find that the measurements and derived parameters may be affected at even higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels than previously proposed, i.e., closer to 7-9 dB above the sensor noise floor. Overall, the polarization difference is clearly identified as the most interesting parameter for oil spill observation, producing high oil-sea contrast in addition to low sensitivity to imaging geometry. The results show that both the relative wind direction and the incidence angle, in combination with the SNR, should be taken into account when developing operational methods based on multipolarization SAR data.

NASA plans to provide the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission which will perform a kinetic impactor experiment to demonstrate asteroid impact hazard mitigation. ESA proposes to provide the Hera mission which will rendezvous with the target to monitor the deflection, perform detailed characterizations, and measure the DART impact outcomes and momentum transfer efficiency. The primary goals of AIDA are (i) to demonstrate the kinetic impact technique on a potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid and (ii) to measure and characterize the deflection caused by the impact. The AIDA target will be the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos, which is of spectral type Sq, with the deflection experiment to occur in October, 2022. The DART impact on the secondary member of the binary at similar to 6 km/s changes the orbital speed and the binary orbit period, which can be measured by Earth-based observatories with telescope apertures as small as 1 m. The DART impact will in addition alter the orbital and rotational states of the Didymos binary, leading to excitation of eccentricity and libration that, if measured by Hera, can constrain internal structure of the target asteroid. Measurements of the DART crater diameter and morphology can constrain target properties like cohesion and porosity based on numerical simulations of the DART impact.

Cassini RADAR Team	Morphological evidence that Titan's southern hemisphere basins are paleoseas	ICARUS												Cassini has shown that modern liquid bodies are largely restricted to North polar latitudes (> 55 degrees) with a comparatively small volume of liquid in the southern hemisphere. This dichotomy has previously been attributed to Saturn's current orbital configuration, but if correct, the configuration is transient and southern depositional basins equivalent in volume to the northern seas are required. In the South polar region, we have identified four dry broad depressions, equivalent in area to the northern seas. Morphologic and topographic data suggest that they represent paleoseas that were filled during an earlier epoch more favorable to the accumulation of southern liquids. All four basins are characterized by topographically low, SAR-dark plains, along with dissected margins that mark putative paleo-shorelines. These characteristics imply that these depressions represent depositional basins. Topographically, the basins have a combined volume that is similar to 3 times greater than the northern seas, sufficiently large to contain all of the northern liquids. A lack of evidence for 5-pm bright material, interpreted as evaponte, challenges our interpretations in the absence of efficient removal or burial mechanisms. The long time scale over which fluids migrate, however, suggests that any deposits have ample time to be altered/removed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is increasingly evident that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are not simply a function of emissions but that there are myriad feedbacks forced by changes in climate that affect atmospheric concentrations. If these feedbacks change with changing climate, which is likely, then the effect of the human enterprise on climate will change. Quantifying, understanding, and articulating the feedbacks within the carbon-climate system at the process level are crucial if we are to employ Earth system models to inform effective mitigation regimes that would lead to a stable climate. Recent advances using space-based, more highly resolved measurements of carbon exchange and its component processes-photosynthesis, respiration, and biomass burning-suggest that remote sensing can add key spatial and process resolution to the existing in situ systems needed to provide enhanced understanding and advancements in Earth system models. Information about emissions and feedbacks from a long-term carbon-climate observing system is essential to better stewardship of the planet.

Saturn's Global Zonal Winds Explored by Cassini/VIMS 5-mu m Images	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) 5-mu m images are used to derive Saturn's global zonal winds around the 2,000-hPa level. The comparison of zonal winds between 2,000 and 300-500hPa shows a general consistency of wind structure between the two pressure levels on a global scale. However at some latitudes, the magnitude of the zonal winds differs between these levels. The equatorial zonal winds are stronger downward, while the zonal winds in the middle and high latitudes are generally weaker downward. These new wind measurements also imply that barotropic and baroclinic instabilities probably exist through the relatively deep atmosphere at some latitudes. Finally, our analysis reveals that the VIMS winds in the two polar regions are basically constant with time except for a westerly jet centered at similar to 88 degrees N, which decreased from 135 +/- 7 m/s in 2008 to 91 +/- 12 m/s in 2017.

Obtaining precise measurements of their mass balance is challenging owing to large area of the basins and the small mass balance signal compared to West Antarctic glaciers. Here we employ a locally optimized processing of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) harmonics to evaluate their mass balance at the sub-basin scale and compare the results with mass budget method (MBM) estimates using regional atmospheric climate model version 2.3 (RACMO2.3) or Modele Atmospherique Regional version 3.6.4 (MAR3.6.4). The sub-basin mass loss estimate for April 2002 to November 2015 is 14.8 4.3 Gt/yr, which is weakly affected by glacial isostatic adjustment uncertainties (1.4 Gt/yr). This result agrees with MBM/RACMO2.3 (15.8 +/- 2.0 Gt/yr), whereas MBM/MAR3.6.4 underestimates the loss (6.6 +/- 1.6 Gt/yr). For the entire drainage, the mass loss for April 2002 to August 2016 is 18.5 +/- 6.6 Gt/yr, or 15 +/- 4% of its ice flux. These results provide unequivocal evidence for mass loss in this East Antarctic sector.

However, the relative toxicity of specific PM types-mixtures of particles of varying sizes, shapes, and chemical compositions-is not well understood. A major impediment has been the sparse distribution of surface sensors, especially those measuring speciated PM. Aerosol remote sensing from Earth orbit offers the opportunity to improve our understanding of the health risks associated with different particle types and sources. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite has demonstrated the value of near-simultaneous observations of backscattered sunlight from multiple view angles for remote sensing of aerosol abundances and particle properties over land. The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument, currently in development, improves on MISR's sensitivity to airborne particle composition by incorporating polarimetry and expanded spectral range. Spatiotemporal regression relationships generated using collocated surface monitor and chemical transport model data will be used to convert fractional aerosol optical depths retrieved from MAIA observations to near-surface PM10, PM2.5, and speciated PM2.5. Health scientists on the MAIA team will use the resulting exposure estimates over globally distributed target areas to investigate the association of particle species with population health effects.

Observations of isocyanate, Amide, Nitrate, and Nitro Compounds From an Anthropogenic biomass burning Using a Tof-CIMS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Anthropogenic biomass burning is poorly represented in models due to a lack of observational data but represents a significant source of short-lived toxic gases. Guy Fawkes Night (bonfire night) is a regular UK-wide event where open fires are lit and fireworks are set off on 5 November. Previous gas phase studies of bonfire night focus on persistent organic pollutants primarily using off-line techniques. Here the first simultaneous online gas phase measurements of several classes of compounds including isocyanates, amides, nitrates, and nitro-organics are made during bonfire night (2014) in Manchester, UK, using a time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (ToF-CIMS) using iodide reagent ions. A shallow boundary layer and low wind speeds favor pollutant buildup with typical HCN, HNCO, and CH3NCO concentrations of tens of parts per thousand increasing by a factor of 13 to potentially harmful levels >1 ppb. Normalized excess mixing ratios relative to CO for a range of isocyanates and amides are reported for the first time. Using a HNCO:CO ratio of 0.1%, we distinguish emissions from flaming and smoldering combustion and report more accurate normalized excess mixing ratios for the distinct burning phases. While bonfire night is a highly polluting event, NO2 concentrations measured at this location are higher at other times, highlighting the importance of traffic as an NO2 emission source at this location. A risk communication methodology is used to equate enhancements in hourly averaged black carbon and NO2 concentrations caused by bonfire night as an equivalent of 26.1 passively smoked cigarettes.

Ice cloud microphysical trends observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We use the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) version 6 ice cloud property and thermodynamic phase retrievals to quantify variability and 14-year trends in ice cloud frequency, ice cloud top temperature (T-ci), ice optical thickness (tau(i)) and ice effective radius (r(ei)). The trends in ice cloud properties are shown to be independent of trends in information content and chi(2). Statistically significant decreases in ice frequency, tau(i), and ice water path (IWP) are found in the SH and NH extratropics, but trends are of much smaller magnitude and statistically insignificant in the tropics. However, statistically significant increases in r(ei) are found in all three latitude bands. Perturbation experiments consistent with estimates of AIRS radiometric stability fall significantly short of explaining the observed trends in ice properties, averaging kernels, and chi(2) trends. Values of r(ei) are larger at the tops of opaque clouds and exhibit dependence on surface wind speed, column water vapour (CWV) and surface temperature (T-sfc) with changes up to 4-5 mu m but are only 1.9% of all ice clouds. Non-opaque clouds exhibit a much smaller change in r(ei) with respect to CWV and T-sfc. Comparisons between DARDAR and AIRS suggest that r(ei) is smallest for single-layer cirrus, larger for cirrus above weak convection, and largest for cirrus above strong convection at the same cloud top temperature. This behaviour is consistent with enhanced particle growth from radiative cooling above convection or large particle lofting from strong convection.

This comparison aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the typical uncertainties in the observational database that can be considered in the future in observational and modelling studies, e.g addressing stratospheric water vapour trends. The time series comparisons are presented for the three latitude bands, the Antarctic (80 degrees-70 degrees S), the tropics (15 degrees S-15 degrees N) and the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (50 degrees-60 degrees N) at four different altitudes (0.1, 3, 10 and 80 hPa) covering the stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The combined temporal coverage of observations from the 15 satellite instruments allowed the consideration of the time period 1986-2014. In addition to the qualitative comparison of the time series, the agreement of the data sets is assessed quantitatively in the form of the spread (i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum volume mixing ratios among the data sets), the (Pearson) correlation coefficient and the drift (i.e. linear changes of the difference between time series over time). Generally, good agreement between the time series was found in the middle stratosphere while larger differences were found in the lower mesosphere and near the tropopause. Concerning the latitude bands, the largest differences were found in the Antarctic while the best agreement was found for the tropics. From our assessment we find that most data sets can be considered in future observational and modelling studies, e.g. addressing stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour variability and trends, if data set specific characteristics (e.g. drift) and restrictions (e.g. temporal and spatial coverage) are taken into account.

Relationship between specular returns in CryoSat-2 data, surface albedo, and Arctic summer minimum ice extent	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Specular (mirror-like) reflections in radar altimeter returns are sensitive indicators of flat open water in leads and melt ponds within the Arctic sea ice cover. Here we find increased specular and near-specular returns in CryoSat-2 waveforms as the sea ice cover transitions from a high albedo snow-covered surface to a lower albedo surface dominated by ponds from snow melt. During early melt, mid-May to late June, increases in fractional coverage of specular returns (F-SR) show spatial correspondence with concurrent decreases in albedo. To examine the utility of F-SR we compared its efficacy with that of satellite-derived albedo in forecasting summer minimum ice extent (SMIE). Regression analysis of the area-averaged F-SR ((F) over bar (SR))(2011-2017) shows that similar to 72% of SMIE variance can be explained by the dates when (F) over bar (SR) climbs to 0.5 within two latitudinal bands covering 70-80 degrees N and 80-90 degrees N. The lag between the two crossing dates provides a measure of the relative rate of the poleward progression of melt. Approximately 93% of SMIE variance can be explained by the date when albedo drops to 0.6 in these same latitudinal bands. Standard errors for these regressions are 0.37 and 0.19 x 10(6) km(2), respectively. Calculating the regression coefficients using only 2011-2016, the 2017 SMIE was forecast with residuals of 0.06 (2% of the total extent) and -0.17 x 10(6) km(2) (4%). Using only 2011-2015 yielded residuals that are less than 0.5 x 10(6) km(2) (similar to 10%) in forecasts of both 2016 and 2017 SMIE, demonstrating the robustness of the regression models. Even though large-scale changes in albedo during summer melt is a characteristic feature of the ice surface, available albedo fields have not been directly used in SMIE forecasts. While this CryoSat-2 record is short, these results suggest that both F-SR and albedo could be potentially useful for enhancing forecasts of SMIE.

These profiles represent some of the most sensitive polarimetric millisecond pulsar profiles to date, revealing the existence of microcomponents (that is, pulse components with peak intensities much lower than the total pulse peak intensity). Although microcomponents have been detected in some pulsars previously, we present microcomponents for PSR B1937+21, PSR J1713+0747, and PSR J2234+0944 for the first time. These microcomponents can have an impact on pulsar timing, geometry, and flux density determination. We present rotation measures for all 28 pulsars, determined independently at different observation frequencies and epochs, and find the Galactic magnetic fields derived from these rotation measures to be consistent with current models. These polarization profiles were made using measurement equation template matching, which allows us to generate the polarimetric response of the Arecibo Observatory on an epoch-by-epoch basis. We use this method to describe its time variability and find that the polarimetric responses of the Arecibo Observatory's 1.4 and 2.1 GHz receivers vary significantly with time.

A New Detection of Extragalactic Anomalous Microwave Emission in a Compact, Optically Faint Region of NGC 4725	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We discuss the nature of a discrete, compact radio source (NGC 4725 B) located approximate to 1.9 kpc from the nucleus in the nearby star-forming galaxy NGC 4725, which we believe to be a new detection of extragalactic anomalous microwave emission (AME). Based on detections at 3, 15, 22, 33, and 44 GHz, NGC 4725 B is a microjansky radio source peaking at approximate to 33 GHz. While the source is not identified in optical (BVRI) photometry, we detect counterparts in the midinfrared Spitzer/IRAC bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 mu m) that appear to be associated with dust emission in the central region of NGC 4725. Consequently, we conclude that NGC 4725 B is a new detection of AME and is very similar to a recent detection of AME in an outer-disk star-forming region in NGC 6946. We find that models of electric dipole emission from rapidly rotating ultra-small grains are able to reproduce the radio spectrum for reasonable interstellar medium conditions. Given the lack of an optical counterpart and the shape of the radio spectrum, NGC 4725 B appears consistent with a nascent star-forming region in which young (less than or similar to 3 Myr) massive stars are still highly enshrouded by their natal cocoons of gas and dust with insufficient supernovae occurring to produce a measurable amount of synchrotron emission.				; Hensley, Brandon/D-8168-2014	Evans, Aaron/0000-0003-2638-1334; Helou, George/0000-0003-3367-3415; Hensley, Brandon/0000-0001-7449-4638; Dong, Dillon/0000-0001-9584-2531												0004-637X	1538-4357				JUL 20	2018	862	1							20	10.3847/1538-4357/aac5f5							WOS:000439184900010

The SCOs were quantified using laboratory-synthesized standards of lactic acid sulfate and nitrophenol organosulfate (NP OS). The variation in field observations was confirmed by comparison to offline measurement techniques (orbitrap and high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) using daily averages. The mean total (of the 17 identified by CIMS) SCO particle mass concentration was 210 +/- 110 ng m(-3) and had a maximum of 540 ng m(-3), although it contributed to only 2 +/- 1% of the organic aerosol (OA). The CIMS identified a persistent gas-phase presence of SCOs in the ambient air, which was further supported by separate vapour-pressure measurements of NP OS by a Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometer (KEMS). An increase in relative humidity (RH) promoted partitioning of SCO to the particle phase, whereas higher temperatures favoured higher gas-phase concentrations. Biogenic emissions contributed to only 19% of total SCOs measured in this study. Here, C10H16NSO7, a monoterpene-derived SCO, represented the highest fraction (10 %) followed by an isoprene-derived SCO. The anthropogenic SCOs with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and aromatic precursors dominated the SCO mass loading (51 %) with C11H11SO7, derived from methyl naphthalene oxidation, contributing to 40 ng m(-3) and 0.3% of the OA mass. Anthropogenic-related SCOs correlated well with benzene, although their abundance depended highly on the photochemical age of the air mass, tracked using the ratio between pinonic acid and its oxidation product, acting as a qualitative photochemical clock. In addition to typical anthropogenic and biogenic precursors the biomass-burning precursor nitrophenol (NP) provided a significant level of NP OS. It must be noted that the contribution analysis here is only representative of the detected SCOs. There are likely to be many more SCOs present which the CIMS has not identified. Gas- and particle-phase measurements of glycolic acid suggest that partitioning towards the particle phase promotes glycolic acid sulfate production, contrary to the current formation mechanism suggested in the literature. Furthermore, the HSO4 center dot H2SO4- cluster measured by the CIMS was utilized as a qualitative marker for acidity and indicates that the production of total SCOs is efficient in highly acidic aerosols with high SO42- and organic content. This dependency becomes more complex when observing individual SCOs due to variability of specific VOC precursors.

Low levels of methanol deuteration in the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. The abundance of deuterated molecules in a star-forming region is sensitive to the environment in which they are formed. Deuteration fractions, in other words the ratio of a species containing D to its hydrogenated counterpart, therefore provide a powerful tool for studying the physical and chemical evolution of a star-forming system. While local low-mass star-forming regions show very high deuteration ratios, much lower fractions are observed towards Orion and the Galactic centre. Astration of deuterium has been suggested as a possible cause for low deuteration in the Galactic centre. Aims. We derive methanol deuteration fractions at a number of locations towards the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334I, located at a mean distance of 1.3 kpc, and discuss how these can shed light on the conditions prevailing during its formation. Methods. We use high sensitivity, high spatial and spectral resolution observations obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to study transitions of the less abundant, optically thin, methanol-isotopologues: (CH3OH)-C-13, (CH3OH)-O-18, CH2DOH and CH3OD, detected towards NGC 6334I. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and excitation temperatures of similar to 120-330 K, we derive column densities for each of the species and use these to infer CH2DOH/CH3OH and CH3OD/CH3OH fractions. Results. We derive column densities in a range of (0.8-8.3) x 10(17) cm(-2) for (CH3OH)-C-13, (0.13-3.4) x 10(17) cm(-2) for (CH3OH)-O-18, (0.03-1.63) x 10(17) cm(-2) for CH2DOH and (0.15-5.5) x 10(17) cm(-2) for CH3OD in a similar to 1 '' beam. Interestingly, the column densities of CH3OD are consistently higher than those of CH2DOH throughout the region by factors of 2-15. We calculate the CH2DOH to CH3OH and CH3OD to CH3OH ratios for each of the sampled locations in NGC 6334I. These values range from 0.03% to 0.34% for CH2DOH and from 0.27% to 1.07% for CH3OD if we use the C-13 isotope of methanol as a standard; using the O-18-methanol as a standard, decreases the ratios by factors of between two and three. Conclusions. All regions studied in this work show CH2DOH/CH3OH as well as CH2DOH/CH3 OD values that are considerably lower than those derived towards low-mass star-forming regions and slightly lower than those derived for the high-mass star-forming regions in Orion and the Galactic centre. The low ratios indicate a grain surface temperature during formation similar to 30 K, for which the efficiency of the formation of deuterated species is significantly reduced. Therefore, astration of deuterium in the Galactic centre cannot be the explanation for its low deuteration ratio but rather the high temperatures characterising the region.																	1432-0746					JUL 19	2018	615								A88	10.1051/0004-6361/201832757							WOS:000439525400002

Transition disks (TDs) are circumstellar disks with inner regions highly depleted in dust. TDs are observed in a small fraction of disk-bearing objects at ages of 1-10 Myr. They are important laboratories to study evolutionary effects in disks, from photoevaporation to planet-disk interactions. Aim. We report the discovery of a large inner dust-empty region in the disk around the very low mass star CIDA 1 (M-* similar to 0.1-0.2 M-circle dot). Methods. We used ALMA continuum observations at 887 mu m, which provide a spatial resolution of 0.'' 21 x 0.'' 12(similar to 15 x 8 au in radius at 140 pc). Results. The data show a dusty ring with a clear cavity of radius similar to 20 au, the typical characteristic of a TD. The emission in the ring is well described by a narrow Gaussian profile. The dust mass in the disk is similar to 17 M-circle plus. CIDA 1 is one of the lowest mass stars with a clearly detected millimeter cavity. When compared to objects of similar stellar mass, it has a relatively massive dusty disk (less than similar to 5% of Taurus Class II disks in Taurus have a ratio of M-disk/M-* larger than CIDA 1) and a very high mass accretion rate (CIDA 1 is a disk with one of the lowest values of M-disk/(M) over dot ever observed). In light of these unusual parameters, we discuss a number of possible mechanisms that can be responsible for the formation of the dust cavity (e.g. photoevaporation, dead zones, embedded planets, close binary). We find that an embedded planet of a Saturn mass or a close binary are the most likely possibilities.

Several recent studies using the thermodynamic model estimated the particle acidity and sulfate production rate, by treating the PM exclusively as a mixture of inorganic salts dominated by ammonium sulfate and neglecting the effects of organic compounds. Noticeably, the estimated pH and sulfate formation rate during pollution periods in China were highly conflicting among the previous studies. Here we show that a particle mixture of inorganic salts adopted by the previous studies does not represent a suitable model system and that the acidity and sulfate formation cannot be reliably inferred without accounting for the effects of multi-aerosol compositions during severe haze events in China. Our laboratory experiments show that SO2 oxidation by NO2 with NH3 neutralization on fine aerosols is dependent on the particle hygroscopicity, phase-state, and acidity. Ammonium sulfate and oxalic acid seed particles exposed to vapors of SO2, NO2, and NH3 at high relative humidity (RH) exhibit distinct size growth and sulfate formation. Aqueous ammonium sulfate particles exhibit little sulfate production, in contrast to aqueous oxalic acid particles with significant sulfate production. Our field measurements demonstrate significant contribution of water-soluble organic matter to fine PM in China and indicate that the use of oxalic acid in laboratory experiments is representative of ambient organic dominant aerosols. While the particle acidity cannot be accurately determined from field measurements or calculated using the thermodynamic model, our results reveal that the pH value of ambient organics-dominated aerosols is sufficiently high to promote efficient SO2 oxidation by NO2 with NH3 neutralization under polluted conditions in China.

Photometric Modeling and VIS-IR Albedo Maps of Tethys From Cassini-VIMS	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We report about the derivation of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) albedo maps and spectral indicators of Saturn's satellite Tethys from the complete Cassini-Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data set. The application of a photometric correction is necessary to remove illumination and viewing effects from the I/F spectra, to compute spectral albedo and to correctly associate spectral variations to changes in composition or physical properties of the surface. In this work we are adopting the photometric correction proposed by Shkuratov et al. (2011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2011.06.011) to derive albedo maps of Tethys from disk-resolved Cassini-VIMS data. After having applied a similar methodology to Dione's data (Filacchione et al., 2018, doi.org/10.1002/2017GL076869), we present here the results achieved for Tethys: surface albedo maps and photometric parameters are computed at five visible (0.35, 0.44, 0.55, 0.70, and 0.95 mu m) and five infrared (1.046, 1.540, 1.822, 2.050, and 2.200 mu m) wavelengths and rendered in cylindrical projection with a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees angular resolution in latitude and longitude, corresponding to a highest spatial resolution of 4.7 km/bin. The 0.35- to 0.55- and 0.55- to 0.95-mu m spectral slopes and the water ice 2.050-mu m band depth maps are computed after having applied the photometric correction, in order to trace the leading-trailing hemisphere dichotomy, to constrain the shape of the equatorial lens generated by the bombardment of high-energy magnetospheric electrons on the leading hemisphere, and to observe the stronger water ice band depth and reddening within the floors of Odysseus and Penelope impact craters. Plain Language Summary Visible and infrared albedo maps of Tethys surface are derived from Cassini-Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer data set by applying a photometric correction able to remove illumination and viewing effects from the data. This processing allows to build spectral indicator maps able to trace composition changes in terms of visible colors and water ice band depth across the surface. We focus our analysis on specific geologic features, including impact craters and low-albedo areas, where exogenic processes are occurring. We report how E-ring particles, magnetospheric and cold plasma particles bombardment, alter the surface of Tethys.

J	Armitage, TWK; Bacon, S; Kwok, R				Armitage, Thomas W. K.; Bacon, Sheldon; Kwok, Ron			Arctic Sea Level and Surface Circulation Response to the Arctic Oscillation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is the leading mode of extratropical northern hemisphere atmospheric variability, affecting surface pressure, winds, temperature, and precipitation. Here we use an altimeter sea level record spanning 2003-2014, covering the ice-covered and ice-free ocean, to examine the influence of the AO on Arctic sea level and surface geostrophic circulation. AO-driven alongshore wind anomalies drive cross-shelf Ekman transport and opposing barotropic sea level anomalies between the shelf seas and deep basins of the Arctic Ocean, with maximum sea level anomaly differences across the shelf-break of similar to 3 cm per unit AO index. This pattern of sea level variability generates topographically steered (generally along-shelf) current anomalies of around 0.5 cm/s per unit AO index. AO-driven wind variability modulates surface currents associated with Atlantic and Pacific water inflow, with opposing inflow anomalies between the Barents Sea Opening and Bering Strait. Plain Language Summary The Arctic Oscillation dominates large-scale changes in atmospheric pressure, wind, temperature, and precipitation north of 20 degrees N. This study uses satellite measurements to investigate the impact the Arctic Oscillation has on sea level and upper ocean currents in the Arctic Ocean. Winds associated with the Arctic Oscillation cause sea levels to rise in the shallow coastal shelf seas, and drop in the deeper ocean, or vice versa, depending if the Arctic Oscillation is in a positive or negative phase. These sea level patterns drive currents which generally follow the edge of the continental shelf. The Arctic Oscillation also influences the strength of the currents associated with the inflow of Atlantic Water through the Barents Sea and the inflow Pacific Water through the Bering Strait.

Self-Consistent Modeling of Electron Precipitation and Responses in the Ionosphere: Application to Low-Altitude Energization During Substorms	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We report a new modeling capability that self-consistently couples physics-based magnetospheric electron precipitation with its impact on the ionosphere. Specifically, the ring current model RAM-SCBE is two-way coupled to an ionospheric electron transport model GLOW (GLobal airglOW), representing a significant improvement over previous models, in which the ionosphere is either treated as a 2-D spherical boundary of the magnetosphere or is driven by empirical precipitation models that are incapable of capturing small-scale, transient variations. The new model enables us to study the impact of substorm-associated, spectrum-resolved electron precipitation on the 3-D ionosphere. We found that after each substorm injection, a high-energy tail of precipitation is produced in the dawn sector outside the plasmapause, by energetic electrons (10 < E < 100 keV) scattered by whistler-mode chorus waves. Consequently, an ionospheric sublayer characterized by enhanced Pedersen conductivity arises at unusually low altitude (similar to 85 km), with its latitudinal width of similar to 5-10 degrees in the auroral zone. The sublayer structure appears intermittently, in correlation with recurrent substorm injections. It propagates eastward from the nightside to the dayside in the same drift direction of source electrons injected from the plasma sheet, resulting in global impact within the ionosphere. This study demonstrates the model's capability of revealing complex cross-scale interactions in the geospace environment. Plain Language Summary Understanding the variability within the near-Earth magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system is not only a scientific goal but also a critical need for reliable nowcasting and forcasting of hazardous space weather. The system is fully coupled in a variety of ways that challenge our current modeling and observational capabilities. In order to unify the ionospheric and magnetospheric dynamics and their interactions, we report a latest modeling effort that self-consistently couples the magnetospheric particle precipitation with its impact on the ionosphere. This model significantly advances the consistency of the models, providing the opportunity to study the 3-D ionospheric variability and associated transient magnetospheric drivers. With this new tool, we find that earthward particle injections in the magnetosphere result in energetic electron precipitation with 10 < E < 100 keV, which cause intense ionization and a transient sublayer with enhanced electric conductivity at unusually low altitudes near 85 km.

Based on the occurrence of fast-moving, near-surface dust plumes from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer cloud motion vector product, dust sources in the study region are identified in geographical depressions, including the Bodele Depression, which represents the leading source. The West African El Djouf desert generates substantial dust emissions, which are typically underestimated by aerosol loading-based dust source identifications. In response to local vegetation cover anomalies, dust emissions and concentrations increased at 15% year(-1) over the Middle East and decreased at 12% year(-1) over the central Sahel during 2001-2013 but partly recovered toward their climatological means afterward. Plain Language Summary Dust storm activity exerts significant influence on society and the environment in North Africa and the Middle East. However, identifying dust source regions across this region remains a challenge due to the limitations and uncertainties in the current satellite-based techniques. Here we present a new dust source identification approach based on dust plume motion, as detected by the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer instrument aboard the polar-orbiting Terra satellite. Using the new satellite technique, dust sources in the study region are identified in geographical depressions, including the Bodele Depression in Chad as the leading source. The West African El Djouf desert generates substantial dust emissions, which are typically underestimated by other dust source identifications. Our joint analysis of Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer plume motion and aerosol data reveals that dust emissions and concentrations increased over the Middle East and decreased over the central Sahel during 2001-2013 but partly recovered afterward.

J	Nash, D; Waliser, D; Guan, B; Ye, HC; Ralph, FM				Nash, Deanna; Waliser, Duane; Guan, Bin; Ye, Hengchun; Ralph, F. Martin			The Role of Atmospheric Rivers in Extratropical and Polar Hydroclimate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, long, transient, water vapor-rich corridors of the atmosphere that are responsible for over 90% of the poleward water vapor transport in and across midlatitudes. However, the role of ARs in modulating extratropical and polar hydroclimate features (e.g., water vapor content and precipitation) has not been fully studied, even though moistening of the polar atmosphere is both a key result and amplifier of Arctic warming and sea ice melt, and precipitation is key to the surface mass balance of polar sea ice and ice sheets. This study uses the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis to characterize the roles of AR water vapor transport on the column-integrated atmospheric water vapor budget in the extratropical and polar regions of both hemispheres. Meridional water vapor transport by ARs across a given latitude (examined for 40 degrees, 50 degrees, 60 degrees, and 70 degrees) is strongly related to variations in area-averaged (i.e., over the cap poleward of the given latitude) total water vapor storage and precipitation poleward of that latitude. For the climatological annual cycle, both AR transport (i.e., nonlocal sources) and total evaporation (i.e., local sources) are most correlated with total precipitation, although with slightly different phases. However, for monthly anomalies, the water budget at higher latitudes is largely dominated by the relationship between AR transport and precipitation. For pentad and daily anomalies, AR transport is related to both precipitation and water vapor storage variations. These results demonstrate the important role of episodic, extreme water vapor transports by ARs in modulating extratropical and polar hydroclimate. Plain Language Summary The term atmospheric river (AR) was coined by scientists Zhu and Newell in the early 1990s with the main result highlighting the importance of relatively infrequent, long conduits of strong moisture transport being responsible for most of the poleward transport of moisture across the midlatitudes and into the polar regions. While it is generally understood that this moisture is critical to the water and energy budgets of high latitudes, there have been no studies that have ever quantified the relationship between AR poleward moisture transports and the hydroclimate features of high latitudes. After a long hiatus in the consideration of the role of ARs on global climate since those of Zhu and Newell, this study quantifies the connections between water vapor transport by ARs across specific latitudes (e.g., 40 degrees) and the hydroclimate poleward of this latitude. The findings show there are strong, time scale-dependent (e.g., daily and monthly) connections between ARs and high-latitude hydroclimate features. For example, the findings show a strong relationship between AR water vapor transport at a given latitude and the area-averaged total precipitation of the region poleward. This and other results in this study indicate the importance of ARs in shaping our global weather and climate.

Link Between Arctic Tropospheric BrO Explosion Observed From Space and Sea-Salt Aerosols From Blowing Snow Investigated Using Ozone Monitoring Instrument BrO Data and GEOS-5 Data Assimilation System	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Bromine radicals (Br+BrO) are important atmospheric species owing to their ability to catalytically destroy ozone as well as their potential impacts on the oxidative pathways of many trace gases, including dimethylsulfide and mercury. Using space-based observations of BrO, recent studies have reported rapid enhancements of tropospheric BrO over large areas (so called BrO explosions) connected to near-surface ozone depletion occurring in polar spring. However, the source(s) of reactive bromine and mechanism(s) that initiate these BrO explosions are uncertain. In this study, we investigate the relationships between Arctic BrO explosions and two of the proposed sources of reactive bromine: sea-salt aerosol (SSA) generated from blowing snow and first-year (seasonal) sea ice. We use tropospheric column BrO derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) in conjunction with the Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS-5) data assimilation system provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. Case studies demonstrate a strong association between the temporal and spatial extent of OMI-observed BrO explosions and the GEOS-5 simulated blowing snow-generated SSA during Arctic spring. Furthermore, the frequency of BrO explosion events observed over the 11-year record of OMI exhibits significant correlation with a time series of the simulated SSA emission flux in the Arctic and little to no correlation with a time series of satellite-based first-year sea ice area. Therefore, we conclude that SSA generated by blowing snow is an important factor in the formation of the BrO explosion observed from space during Arctic spring.

J	Gibson, BM				Gibson, Bradley M.			Adjacent-resonance etalon cancellation in ring-down spectroscopy	OPTICS LETTERS												Adjacent-resonance etalon cancellation provides a means of significantly reducing both systematic and random errors introduced in cavity ring-down spectroscopy by unwanted etalons. By stretching the ring-down cavity symmetrically about its center point and collecting two data sets at cavity lengths separated by lambda/2, two fringing components offset in phase by 180 deg are obtained. When these two data sets are averaged, oscillations in effective mirror reflectivities due to fringing are dramatically reduced. The technique is demonstrated in a 12 cm monolithic ring-down spectrometer. Long-term time constant measurements show a decrease in noise-equivalent absorption and an increase in maximum effective averaging time due to a reduction in noise coupled in by etalons; trace water spectra demonstrate how removing the systematic fringing components eases absorption peak identification.

Assessment of Aeolis Palus stratigraphic relationships based on bench-forming strata in the Kylie and the Kimberley regions of Gale crater, Mars	ICARUS												The stratigraphic context of rock layers is a critical piece of information needed for accurate reconstruction of their geologic history. Although sedimentary rocks are widespread in Gale crater, efforts to deduce stratigraphic relationships of rocks were challenging early in the Mars Science Laboratory mission because vertical bedrock exposures were relatively rare along the first similar to 3 km the rover traversed across Aeolis Palus. Potential insights into the three-dimensional configuration of rock layers were made once the rover passed Dingo Gap, especially in the informally-named Kylie and Kimberley regions. Here, the terrain exhibits low relief (<10 m) cliffs, some of which are continuous over lengths >75 m. Curiosity Mastcam and Navcam images show that the cliffs are capped by resistant, bench-forming rock layers corresponding to two facies: a poorly sorted, weakly stratified pebble conglomerate, and a massive, dark toned, vuggy sandstone. In places, the inclination of the topographic surface (northward similar to 2 degrees to similar to 3 degrees) is similar to the apparent dip of the underlying strata, suggesting the presence of dip slopes in an area inferred to be generally fiat-lying, conformable rock units. Further, we assessed potential strata correlations via plane-fitting exercises and a regional comparison to other capping strata. We speculate that bench-forming strata in the study region could be part of a widespread package of draping strata (the Siccar Point group) that post-dates deposition and exhumation of the lower strata of Mount Sharp.

The NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) frost point hygrometer (FPH) observations at Boulder (Colorado, 40.0 degrees N, 105.2 degrees W) indicate positive trends (about 0.1 to 0.45 ppmvdecade(-1)). On the contrary, negative trends (approximately -0.2 to -0.1 ppmvdecade(-1)) are derived from a merged zonal mean satellite data set for a latitude band around the Boulder latitude. Overall, the trend differences between the two data sets range from about 0.3 to 0.5 ppmvdecade(-1), depending on altitude. It has been proposed that a possible explanation for these discrepancies is a different temporal behaviour at Boulder and the zonal mean. In this work we investigate trend differences between Boulder and the zonal mean using primarily simulations from ECHAM/MESSy (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Hamburg/Modular Earth Submodel System) Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC), WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model), CMAM (Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model) and CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere). On shorter timescales we address this aspect also based on satellite observations from UARS/HALOE (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite/Halogen Occultation Experiment), Envisat/MIPAS (Environmental Satellite/Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) and Aura/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder). Overall, both the simulations and observations exhibit trend differences between Boulder and the zonal mean. The differences are dependent on altitude and the time period considered. The model simulations indicate only small trend differences between Boulder and the zonal mean for the time period between the late 1980s and 2010. These are clearly not sufficient to explain the discrepancies between the trend estimates derived from the FPH observations and the merged zonal mean satellite data set. Unless the simulations underrepresent variability or the trend differences originate from smaller spatial and temporal scales than resolved by the model simulations, trends at Boulder for this time period should also be quite representative for the zonal mean and even other latitude bands. Trend differences for a decade of data are larger and need to be kept in mind when comparing results for Boulder and the zonal mean on this timescale. Beyond that, we find that the trend estimates for the time period between the late 1980s and 2010 also significantly differ among the simulations. They are larger than those derived from the merged satellite data set and smaller than the trend estimates derived from the FPH observations.

DES Collaboration	Density split statistics: Joint model of counts and lensing in cells	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We present density split statistics, a framework that studies lensing and counts-in-cells as a function of foreground galaxy density, thereby providing a large-scale measurement of both 2-point and 3-point statistics. Our method extends our earlier work on trough lensing and is summarized as follows: given a foreground (low redshift) population of galaxies, we divide the sky into subareas of equal size but distinct galaxy density. We then measure lensing around uniformly spaced points separately in each of these subareas, as well as counts-in-cells statistics (CiC). The lensing signals trace the matter density contrast around regions of fixed galaxy density. Through the CiC measurements this can be related to the density profile around regions of fixed matter density. Together, these measurements constitute a powerful probe of cosmology, the skewness of the density field and the connection of galaxies and matter. In this paper we show how to model both the density split lensing signal and CiC from basic ingredients: a non-linear power spectrum, clustering hierarchy coefficients from perturbation theory and a parametric model for galaxy bias and shot-noise. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that this model is sufficiently accurate for a cosmological analysis on year 1 data from the Dark Energy Survey.				cunha, carlos/AAA-5734-2020; Lima, Marcos/E-8378-2010; Carnero, Aurelio/AAH-3411-2019; Sevilla, Ignacio/AAB-8148-2019; Gaztanaga, Enrique/L-4894-2014; Palacios, Jorge Carretero/L-8237-2014; Desai, Shantanu/AAM-8055-2020; Garcia-Bellido, Juan/C-2920-2017	Lima, Marcos/0000-0002-4719-3781; Carnero, Aurelio/0000-0003-3044-5150; Sevilla, Ignacio/0000-0002-1831-1953; Gaztanaga, Enrique/0000-0001-9632-0815; Palacios, Jorge Carretero/0000-0002-3130-0204; Weller, Jochen/0000-0002-8282-2010; Melchior, Peter/0000-0002-8873-5065; Troxel, Michael/0000-0002-5622-5212; Blazek, Jonathan/0000-0002-4687-4657; Kovacs, Andras/0000-0002-5825-579X; Garcia-Bellido, Juan/0000-0002-9370-8360; Soares-Santos, Marcelle/0000-0001-6082-8529; Mohr, Joseph/0000-0002-6875-2087; Carrasco Kind, Matias/0000-0002-4802-3194; Bernstein, Gary/0000-0002-8613-8259; Hilbert, Stefan/0000-0002-4401-8750; Bertin, Emmanuel/0000-0002-3602-3664; Chang, Chihway/0000-0002-7887-0896												2470-0010	2470-0029				JUL 13	2018	98	2							023508	10.1103/PhysRevD.98.023508							WOS:000438496600003

DES Collaboration	Density split statistics: Cosmological constraints from counts and lensing in cells in DES Y1 and SDSS data	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We derive cosmological constraints from the probability distribution function (PDF) of evolved large-scale matter density fluctuations. We do this by splitting lines of sight by density based on their count of tracer galaxies, and by measuring both gravitational shear around and counts-in-cells in overdense and underdense lines of sight, in Dark Energy Survey (DES) First Year and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Our analysis uses a perturbation theory model [O. Friedrich et al., Phys. Rev. D 98, 023508 (2018)] and is validated using N-body simulation realizations and log-normal mocks. It allows us to constrain cosmology, bias and stochasticity of galaxies with respect to matter density and, in addition, the skewness of the matter density field. From a Bayesian model comparison, we find that the data weakly prefer a connection of galaxies and matter that is stochastic beyond Poisson fluctuations on <= 20 arcmin angular smoothing scale. The two stochasticity models we fit yield DES constraints on the matter density Omega(m) = 0.26(-0.04)(+0.05) and Omega(m) = 0.28(-0.03)(+0.04) that are consistent with each other. These values also agree with the DES analysis of galaxy and shear two-point functions (3x2pt, DES Collaboration et al.) that only uses second moments of the PDF. Constraints on s 8 are model dependent (sigma(8) = 0.97(-0.06)(+0.07) and 0.80(-0.07)(+0.06) for the two stochasticity models), but consistent with each other and with the 3 x 2pt results if stochasticity is at the low end of the posterior range. As an additional test of gravity, counts and lensing in cells allow to compare the skewness S-3 of the matter density PDF to its Lambda CDM prediction. We find no evidence of excess skewness in any model or data set, with better than 25 per cent relative precision in the skewness estimate from DES alone.

Non-gravitational acceleration in the trajectory of 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua)	NATURE												'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) is the first known object of interstellar origin to have entered the Solar System on an unbound and hyperbolic trajectory with respect to the Sun(1). Various physical observations collected during its visit to the Solar System showed that it has an unusually elongated shape and a tumbling rotation state(1-4) and that the physical properties of its surface resemble those of cometary nuclei(5,6), even though it showed no evidence of cometary activity(1,5,7). The motion of all celestial bodies is governed mostly by gravity, but the trajectories of comets can also be affected by non-gravitational forces due to cometary outgassing(8). Because non-gravitational accelerations are at least three to four orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational acceleration, the detection of any deviation from a purely gravity-driven trajectory requires high-quality astrometry over a long arc. As a result, non-gravitational effects have been measured on only a limited subset of the small-body population(9). Here we report the detection, at 30 sigma significance, of non-gravitational acceleration in the motion of 'Oumuamua. We analyse imaging data from extensive observations by ground-based and orbiting facilities. This analysis rules out systematic biases and shows that all astrometric data can be described once a non-gravitational component representing a heliocentric radial acceleration proportional to r(-2) or r(-1) (where r is the heliocentric distance) is included in the model. After ruling out solar-radiation pressure, drag-and friction-like forces, interaction with solar wind for a highly magnetized object, and geometric effects originating from 'Oumuamua potentially being composed of several spatially separated bodies or having a pronounced offset between its photocentre and centre of mass, we find comet-like outgassing to be a physically viable explanation, provided that 'Oumuamua has thermal properties similar to comets.

Characterization of Microbial Communities Hosted in Quartzofeldspathic and Serpentinite Lithologies in Jeffrey Mine, Canada	ASTROBIOLOGY												The microbial ecology and activity of serpentine deposits and associated hydrated minerals are largely unknown. Previous research has largely focused on microbial communities in active serpentinizing systems, whereas relatively little research has demonstrated the ability of serpentine deposits to host microbial communities after the cessation of serpentinization. Given the potential role of serpentinization reactions fueling primitive microbial metabolisms on early Earth and the identification of serpentine deposits on Mars, knowledge of these geobiological relationships and potential for serpentine to host extant microbial communities and preserve biosignatures is increasingly important for planetary exploration seeking signs of life. The selection of habitable sites most likely to yield putative biosignatures is crucial to mission success. In this study, we aimed to characterize, on the basis of both metabolic activity and taxonomic composition, the microbial communities hosted in two naturally co-occurring and mineralogically distinct substrates within the serpentine-rich Jeffrey Mine pit-igneous quartzofeldspathic intrusives and serpentinite. Detection of heterotrophic activity in both lithologies at 24 degrees C, and in serpentinite at -5 degrees C, demonstrated that each substrate had the ability to host a viable microbial community, at Mars-relevant temperatures. Targeted amplicon sequencing subsequently showed the presence of bacterial, fungal, and photosynthetic microbial communities in both substrates. Here, we have demonstrated the presence of a viable lithic microbial community within two rock types in the Jeffrey Mine and provided evidence that lithologies associated with serpentine deposits and proximal hydrated minerals have the ability to support diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial colonization.

A Second Chromatic Timing Event of Interstellar Origin toward PSR J1713+0747	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												The frequency dependence of radio pulse arrival times provides a probe of structures in the intervening media. Demorest et al. was the first to show a short-term (similar to 100-200 days) reduction in the electron content along the line of sight to PSR. J1713+0747 in data from 2008 (approximately MJD 54750) based on an apparent dip in the dispersion measure of the pulsar. We report on a similar event in 2016 (approximately MJD 57510), with average residual pulse-arrival times approximate to-3.0, -1.3, and -0.7 mu s at 820, 1400, and 2300. MHz, respectively. Timing analyses indicate possible departures from the standard v(-2) dispersive-delay dependence. We discuss and rule out a wide variety of potential interpretations. We find the likeliest scenario to be lensing of the radio emission by some structure in the interstellar medium, which causes multiple frequency-dependent pulse arrival-time delays.

The whole T Tau system is found to be surrounded by nebulalike envelopes, and several outflow-related structures are detected in these envelopes. We analyzed the detailed polarization patterns of the circumstellar structures near each component of this triple young star system and determined constraints on the circumstellar disks and outflow structures. We suggest that the nearly face-on circumstellar disk of T Tau N is no larger than 0.''8, or 117 au, in the northwest, based on the existence of a hole in this direction, and no larger than 0.''27, or 40 au, in the south. A new structure, "N5," extends to about 0.''42, or 59 au, southwest of the star, and is believed to be part of the disk. We suggest that T Tau S is surrounded by a highly inclined circumbinary disk with a radius of about 0.''3, or 44 au, with a position angle of about 30 degrees, that is misaligned with the orbit of the T Tau S binary. After analyzing the positions and polarization vector patterns of the outflow-related structures, we suggest that T Tau S should trigger the well-known E-W outflow, and is also likely to be responsible for a southwest precessing outflow "coil" and a possible south outflow.

The Kepler Follow-up Observation Program. II. Stellar Parameters from Medium- and High-resolution Spectroscopy	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present results from spectroscopic follow-up observations of stars identified in the Kepler field and carried out by teams of the Kepler Follow-up Observation Program. Two samples of stars were observed over 6 yr (2009-2015): 614 standard stars (divided into "platinum" and "gold" categories) selected based on their asteroseismic detections and 2667 host stars of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), most of them planet candidates. Four data analysis pipelines were used to derive stellar parameters for the observed stars. We compare the T-eff, log(g), and [Fe/H] values derived for the same stars by different pipelines; from the average of the standard deviations of the differences in these parameter values, we derive error floors of similar to 100 K, 0.2 dex, and 0.1 dex for T-eff, log(g), and [Fe/H], respectively. Noticeable disagreements are seen mostly at the largest and smallest parameter values (e.g., in the giant star regime). Most of the log(g) values derived from spectra for the platinum stars agree on average within 0.025 dex (but with a spread of 0.1-0.2 dex) with the asteroseismic log(g) values. Compared to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), the spectroscopically derived stellar parameters agree within the uncertainties of the KIC but are more precise and thus an important contribution toward deriving more reliable planetary radii.

On 2013 May 10, a CME crossed the signal path between the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft and Earth. Using the MESSENGER signal, characteristics of the density, velocity, and magnetic field properties of the crossing plasma were measured. An anomalously strong event occurred in the plasma trailing the CME's passage that correlated with a wave mode conversion, indicating a potential reconnection region. We determine that the plasma following CMEs should be considered when studying how CMEs evolve in interplanetary space and the severity of their geomagnetic impact.

Mid-wavelength high operating temperature barrier infrared detector and focal plane array	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS												We analyze and compare different aspects of InAs/InAsSb and InAs/GaSb type-II superlattices for infrared detector applications and argue that the former is the most effective when implemented for mid-wavelength infrared detectors. We then report results on an InAs/InAsSb superlattice based mid-wavelength high operating temperature barrier infrared detector. At 150 K, the 50% cutoff wavelength is 5.37 mu m, the quantum efficiency at 4.5 mu m is similar to 52% without anti-reflection coating, the dark current density under -0.2V bias is 4.5 x 10(-5) A/cm(2), and the dark-current-limited and the f/2 black-body (300K background in 3-5 mu m band) specific detectivities are 4.6 x 10(11) and 3.0 x 10(11) cm-Hz(1/2)/W, respectively. A focal plane array made from the same material exhibits a mean noise equivalent differential temperature of 18.7 mK at 160K operating temperature with an f/2 optics and a 300K background, demonstrating significantly higher operating temperature than InSb.

Efforts to improve durability have focused on suppressing the solubility of intermediate polysulfides in the electrolyte. Here we describe an in situ electrochemical polysulfide detection method based on the cyclic volatmmetric response. The voltammetric peaks correlate with increased discharge, consistent with increased polysulfide species in the electrolyte as demonstrated by prior literature measurements using spectroscopic methods. We verified that adding metal sulfide species to the sulfur cathode and ceramic-coatings on the polyolefin separator result in reduced polysulfide concentration, consistent with improved cycle life reported earlier. Further, the use of highly concentrated electrolytes produces no detectable dissolved polysulfide species. Future advances in Li/S technology could utilize this method to determine the polysulfide contents in the electrolyte, and thus quantify the efficacy of the sulfur-sequestering strategies.

Major outcomes of an authentic astronomy research experience professional development program: An analysis of 8 years of data from a teacher research program	PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH												The NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) provides a year-long authentic astronomy research project by partnering a research astronomer with small groups of educators. NITARP has worked with a total of 103 educators since 2005. In this paper, surveys are explored that were obtained from 74 different educators, at up to four waypoints during the course of 13 months, from the class of 2010 through the class of 2017; those surveys reveal how educator participants describe the major changes and outcomes in themselves fostered by NITARP. Three-quarters of the educators self-report some or major changes in their understanding of the nature of science. The program provides educators with experience collaborating with astronomers and other educators, and forges a strong link to the astronomical research community; the NITARP community of practice encourages and reinforces these linkages. During the experience, educators get comfortable with learning complex new concepts, with similar to 40% noting in their surveys that their approach to learning has changed. Educators are provided opportunities for professional growth; at least 12% have changed career paths substantially in part due to the program, and 14% report that the experience was "life changing." At least 60% express a desire to include richer, more authentic science activities in their classrooms. This work illuminates what benefits the program brings to its participants; the NITARP approach could be mirrored in similar professional development programs in other STEM subjects.

ANITA Collaboration	Constraints on the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux from the third flight of ANITA	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna, a NASA long-duration balloon payload, searches for radio emission from interactions of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos in polar ice. The third flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna was launched in December 2014 and completed a 22-day flight. We present the results of three analyses searching for Askaryan radio emission of neutrino origin. In the most sensitive of the analyses, we find one event in the signal region on an expected background of 0.7(-0.3)(+0.5). Though consistent with the background estimate, the event remains compatible with a neutrino hypothesis even after additional postunblinding scrutiny.

DES science portal: Creating science-ready catalogs	ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING												We present a novel approach for creating science-ready catalogs through a software infrastructure developed for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We integrate the data products released by the DES Data Management and additional products created by the DES collaboration in an environment known as DES Science Portal. Each step involved in the creation of a science-ready catalog is recorded in a relational database and can be recovered at any time. We describe how the DES Science Portal automates the creation and characterization of lightweight catalogs for DES Year 1 Annual Release, and show its flexibility in creating multiple catalogs with different inputs and configurations. Finally, we discuss the advantages of this infrastructure for large surveys such as DES and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. The capability of creating science-ready catalogs efficiently and with full control of the inputs and configurations used is an important asset for supporting science analysis using data from large astronomical surveys.

Optimal Frequency Ranges for Submicrosecond Precision Pulsar Timing	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Precision pulsar timing requires optimization against measurement errors and astrophysical variance from the neutron stars themselves and the interstellar medium. We investigate optimization of arrival-time precision as a function of radio frequency and bandwidth. We find that increases in bandwidth that reduce the contribution from receiver noise are countered by the strong chromatic dependence of interstellar effects and intrinsic pulse-profile evolution. The resulting optimal frequency range is therefore telescope and pulsar dependent. We demonstrate the results for five pulsars included in current pulsar timing arrays and determine that they are not optimally observed at current center frequencies. For those objects, we find that better choices of total bandwidth as well as center frequency can improve the arrival-time precision. Wideband receivers centered at somewhat higher frequencies with respect to the currently adopted receivers can reduce required overall integration times and provide significant improvements in arrival-time uncertainty by a factor of similar to root 2 in most cases, assuming a fixed integration time. We also discuss how timing programs can be extended to pulsars with larger dispersion measures through the use of higher-frequency observations.

To constrain violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle, we use the one-meter telescope at Table Mountain Observatory near Los Angeles to monitor the relative arrival times of pulses from the Crab Pulsar in the optical (lambda approximate to 585 nm) and near-infrared (lambda approximate to 814 nm) using an instrument that detects single photons with nanosecond-timing resolution in those two bands. The infrared pulse arrives slightly before the visible pulse. Our three analysis methods give delays with statistical errors of.tobs Delta t(obs) = 7.41 +/-.0.58, 0.4. +/- 3.6, and 7.35 +/- 4.48 microseconds (at most 1/4000 of the pulsar period). We attribute this discrepancy to systematic error from the fact that the visible and infrared pulses have slightly different shapes. Whether this delay emerges from the pulsar, is caused by passing through wavelength-dependent media, or is caused by a violation of the equivalence principle, unless there is a fine-tuned cancellation among these, we set the first upper limit on the differential post-Newtonian parameter at these wavelengths of Delta gamma < 1.07 x 10-(10). (3 sigma). This result falls in an unexplored region of parameter space and complements existing limits on equivalence-principle violation from fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, as well as previous limits from the Crab.																	0004-637X	1538-4357				JUL 1	2018	861	1							66	10.3847/1538-4357/aac954							WOS:000437718000001

This work is part of the B-fields in Star-forming Region Observations survey initiated to understand the role of magnetic fields in star formation for nearby star-forming molecular clouds. We present a first look at the geometry and strength of magnetic fields in Oph-B. The field geometry is traced over similar to 0.2 pc, with clear detection of both of the sub-clumps of Oph-B. The field pattern appears significantly disordered in sub-clump Oph-B1. The field geometry in Oph-B2 is more ordered, with a tendency to be along the major axis of the clump, parallel to the filamentary structure within which it lies. The degree of polarization decreases systematically toward the dense core material in the two sub-clumps. The field lines in the lower density material along the periphery are smoothly joined to the large-scale magnetic fields probed by NIR polarization observations. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 630 +/- 410 mu G in the Oph-B2 sub-clump using a Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis. With this magnetic field strength, we find a mass-to-flux ratio lambda = 1.6 +/- 1.1, which suggests that the Oph-B2 clump is slightly magnetically supercritical.

The Millimeter Continuum Size-Frequency Relationship in the UZ Tau E Disk	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present high spatial resolution observations of the continuum emission from the young multiple star system UZ Tau at frequencies from 6 to 340 GHz. To quantify the spatial variation of dust emission in the UZ Tau E circumbinary disk, the observed interferometric visibilities are modeled with a simple parametric prescription for the radial surface brightnesses at each frequency. We find evidence that the spectrum steepens with radius in the disk, manifested as a positive correlation between the observing frequency and the radius that encircles a fixed fraction of the emission (R-eff proportional to nu(0.34 +/- 0.08)). The origins of this size-frequency relation are explored in the context of a theoretical framework for the growth and migration of disk solids. While that framework can reproduce a similar size-frequency relation, it predicts a steeper spectrum than that observed. Moreover, it comes closest to matching the data only on timescales much shorter (<= 1 Myr) than the putative UZ Tau age (similar to 2-3 Myr). These discrepancies are direct consequences of the rapid radial drift rates predicted by models of dust evolution in a smooth gas disk. One way to mitigate that efficiency problem is to invoke small-scale gas pressure modulations that locally concentrate drifting solids. If such particle traps reach high-continuum optical depths at 30-340 GHz with a similar to 30%-60%. filling fraction in the inner disk (r less than or similar to 20 au), they can also explain the observed spatial gradient in the UZ Tau E disk spectrum.

We use National Aeronautics and Space Administration's airborne Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) L-band polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for this study. Results demonstrate that a single polarimetric radar image highlights burn areas. Coherence and interferometric radar pairs show the fire scar and debris flow. An unwrapped interferogram shows the location of the debris flow over the 101 Freeway in greater detail than a raw interferogram. We enhanced the interferogram and coherence product of a pair of images acquired before and after the fire and debris flows, which highlights areas of destroyed structures and major damage. We first despeckled the images and then converted the interferogram to four colors and the coherence map to two colors. Analysis of optical imagery between before and after images shows that the debris flows are best identified using visible bands and that near-infrared better highlights the lower part of the flows where more mud was deposited. These simplified products provide more actionable products for disaster responders; the products were downloaded for use by the State of California. Plain Language Summary Airborne radar imagery from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Airborne Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar platform spanning the 2017 Thomas fire scar and subsequent 2018 debris flows highlights the location of the fire scar and debris flows when processed in different ways. The results highlighting the debris flows correspond with areas of major damage and destroyed structures. Optical image data from Planet Labs Dove satellite show that visible bands differenced before and after highlight the upper part of the debris flows, while near-IR shows the lower muddier part of the flows.

Planet Four: Terrains - Discovery of araneiforms outside of the South Polar layered deposits	ICARUS					6th International Conference on Mars Polar Science and Exploration	SEP, 2016	Reykjavik, ICELAND					We present the results of a systematic mapping of seasonally sculpted terrains on the South Polar region of Mars with the Planet Four: Terrains (P4T) online citizen science project. P4T enlists members of the general public to visually identify features in the publicly released Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX) images. In particular, P4T volunteers are asked to identify: (1) araneiforms (including features with a central pit and radiating channels known as 'spiders'): (2) erosional depressions, troughs, mesas, ridges, and quasi-circular pits characteristic of the South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) which we collectively refer to as 'Swiss cheese terrain', and (3) craters. In this work we present the distributions of our high confidence classic spider araneiforms and Swiss cheese terrain identifications in 90 CTX images covering 11% of the South polar regions at latitudes <= -75 degrees N. We find no locations within our high confidence spider sample that also have confident Swiss cheese terrain identifications. Previously spiders were reported as being confined to the South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD). Our work has provided the first identification of spiders at locations outside of the SPLD, confirmed with high resolution HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) imaging. We find araneiforms on the Amazonian and Hesperian polar units and the Early Noachian highland units, with 75% of the identified araneiform locations in our high confidence sample residing on the SPLD. With our current coverage, we cannot confirm whether these are the only geologic units conducive to araneiform formation on the Martian South Polar region. Our results are consistent with the current CO2 jet formation scenario with the process exploiting weaknesses in the surface below the seasonal CO2 ice sheet to carve araneiform channels into the regolith over many seasons. These new regions serve as additional probes of the conditions required for channel creation in the CO2 jet process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper presents a performance assessment of SMAP soil emission model and SM retrieval algorithms for a Tibetan desert ecosystem. It is found that the SMAP emission model largely underestimates the SMAP measured T-B(H) (approximate to 15 K), and the T-B(V) is underestimated during dry-down episodes. A cold bias is noted for the SMAP effective temperature due to underestimation of soil temperature, leading to the T-B(p) underestimation (> 5 K). The remaining T-B(H) underestimation is found to be related to the surface roughness parameterization that underestimates its effect on modulating the T-B(p) measurements. Further, the topography and uncertainty of soil information are found to have minor impacts on the T-B(p) simulations. The SMAP baseline SM products produced by single-channel algorithm (SCA) using the T-B(V) measurements capture the measured SM dynamics well, while an underestimation is noted for the dry-down periods because of T-B(V) underestimation. The products based on the SCA with T-B(H) measurements underestimate the SM due to underestimation of T-B(H), and the dual-channel algorithm overestimates the SM. After implementing a new surface roughness parameterization and improving the soil temperature and texture information, the deficiencies noted above in T-B(p) simulation and SM retrieval are greatly resolved. This indicates that the SMAP SM retrievals can be enhanced by improving both surface roughness and adopted soil temperature and texture information for Tibetan desert ecosystem.

The proposed solution uses a thermally conductive waveguide vane attenuator with low thermal mass, integrated heater, and silicon thermometer. In the present design, we utilize a 125-mu m-thick z-cut crystal quartz vane due to its low dielectric constant (relative to silicon), high cryogenic thermal conductivity, chemical robustness, and small thermal contraction. To provide adequate attenuation, the bottom side of the quartz fabrication wafer has an nm thick resistive Ti metal layer deposited. On the top of the quartz wafer, a pattern of Au is deposited to allow adhesion of the heater resistor, thermometer, and internal heat strap. The z-cut quartz vane is mounted on three low thermally conductive Torlon posts, centered on the maximum E-field, and positioned across the waveguide. With this approach the quartz vane, protruding all the way into the waveguide, approximates a blackbody with a physical temperature T. The design uniqueness lies in the choice of cryogenically suitable materials coupled with detailed thermal analyses and proper miniaturization. When operated in a proportional-integral-derivative loop, these properties combine to facilitate a programmable calibration load with a switching speed of less than or similar to 10 s. It will be shown that the W-hand design operates overmoded to similar to 230 GHz and that the concept is in principle scalable to terahertz frequencies.

Solar system science with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS												We present a community-led assessment of the solar system investigations achievable with NASA's next-generation space telescope, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). WFIRST will provide imaging, spectroscopic, and coronagraphic capabilities from 0.43 to 2.0 mu m and will be a potential contemporary and eventual successor to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Surveys of irregular satellites and minor bodies are where WFIRST will excel with its 0.28 deg(2) field-of-view Wide Field Instrument. Potential ground-breaking discoveries from WFIRST could include detection of the first minor bodies orbiting in the inner Oort Cloud, identification of additional Earth Trojan asteroids, and the discovery and characterization of asteroid binary systems similar to Ida/Dactyl. Additional investigations into asteroids, giant planet satellites, Trojan asteroids, Centaurs, Kuiper belt objects, and comets are presented. Previous use of astrophysics assets for solar system science and synergies between WFIRST, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, JWST, and the proposed Near-Earth Object Camera mission is discussed. We also present the case for implementation of moving target tracking, a feature that will benefit from the heritage of JWST and enable a broader range of solar system observations.

Cosmogenic neutrinos, produced from the interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with cosmic photon backgrounds, have been regarded as a guaranteed flux. However, the expected neutrino flux depends on the composition of UHECRs at the highest energies; heavier nuclei result in lower neutrino fluxes compared to lighter nuclei and protons. The objective of this study is to estimate the range of cosmogenic neutrino spectra consistent with recent cosmic-ray spectral and compositional data using a fully inferential Bayesian approach. The study assumes a range of source distributions consistent with astrophysical sources, the flux and composition of cosmic rays, and detector systematic uncertainties. The technique applied to this study is the use of an affine-invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which is an effective Bayesian inference tool for characterizing multi-dimensional parameter spaces and their correlations.																	1475-7516					JUL	2018		7							025	10.1088/1475-7516/2018/07/025							WOS:000438603800001

The Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) uses temperature data from reanalysis products to implement rain-snow classification. However, the coarse resolution of reanalysis data may not reveal the spatiotemporal variabilities of temperature, necessitating appropriate downscaling methods. This study compares the performance of eight air temperature T-a downscaling methods in the contiguous United States and six mountain ranges using temperature from the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) as the benchmark. ERA-Interim T-a is downscaled from the original 0.75 degrees to 0.1 degrees. The results suggest that the two purely statistical downscaling methods [nearest neighbor (NN) and bilinear interpolation (BI)] show similar performance with each other. The five downscaling methods based on the freeair temperature lapse rate (TLR), which is calculated using temperature and geopotential heights at different pressure levels, notably improves the accuracy of T-a. The improvement is particularly obvious in mountainous regions. We further calculated wet-bulb temperature T-w for rain-snow classification, using T-a and dewpoint temperature from ERA-Interim and PRISM. TLR-based downscaling methods result in more accurate T-w, compared to NN and BI in the western United States, whereas the improvement is limited in the eastern United States. Rain-snow partitioning is conducted using a critical threshold of T-w, with Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) snowfall data serving as the benchmark. ERA-Interim-based T-w, using TLR downscaling methods is better than that using NN/BI and IMERG precipitation phase. In conclusion, TLR-based downscaling methods show promising prospects in acquiring high-quality T-a and T-w, with high resolution and improving rain-snow partitioning, particularly in mountainous regions.

FT-IR measurements of cold propene (C3H6) cross-sections at temperatures between 150 and 299 K	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												In support of infrared remote sensing of Titan, we present temperature dependent cross-sections of propene (C3H6; CH2=CH-CH3; propylene) measured in the laboratory. A total of 27 high-resolution (up to 0.0022 cm(-1)) spectra of pure C3H6 and mixtures of C3H6 with N-2 were obtained at 150-299 K in the 650-1534 cm(-1) (6.5-15.4 mu m) region. A custom-designed cold cell was used, which was configured with an active temperature control and could be integrated to a Fourier-transform spectrometer (Bruker 125HR) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The observed C3H6 spectral features include its strong v(19) band bearing the most prominent Q-branch peak at 912 cm(-1) and three other strong bands: v(18), v(16) and v(7) centered near 991, 1443, and 1459 cm(-1), respectively. In addition, we have generated empirical pseudoline lists (PLLs) in HITRAN-format, in the two separate spectral regions, which are Region I: 800-1100 and Region II: 1340-1524 cm(-1). The PLLs of C3H6 consists of spectroscopic line parameters (including line intensities and effective lower state energies) for all the individual pseudo line positions. The pseudoline parameters were determined by fitting 27 laboratory spectra of pure and N-2-broadened propene simultaneously in the selected regions. A newly derived partition function was adopted in the line-by-line radiative transfer calculations. Based on the pseudoline intensities, the total integrated intensities in the 800-1120 and 1320-1524cm(-1) regions were measured to be 8.79(47)x 10(-18) and 3.06(21)x 10(-18)cm(-1)/(molecule cm(-2)) at 296 K, respectively. These values are found to be in a good agreement with the recent measurement made at KAUST at room temperature, but they are significantly lower than those reported by one of the most extensive previous studies at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Finally, the two PLLs are submitted as electronic supplements and are also available from the website, https://mark4sun.jpl.nasa.gov/pseudo.html. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: redshift distributions of the weak-lensing source galaxies	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We describe the derivation and validation of redshift distribution estimates and their uncertainties for the populations of galaxies used as weak-lensing sources in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 cosmological analyses. The Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ) code is used to assign galaxies to four redshift bins between z approximate to 0.2 and approximate to 1.3, and to produce initial estimates of the lensing-weighted redshift distributions n(PZ)(i)(z) proportional to d(n)(i)/dz for members of bin i. Accurate determination of cosmological parameters depends critically on knowledge of n(i), but is insensitive to bin assignments or redshift errors for individual galaxies. The cosmological analyses allow for shifts n(i)(z) = n(PZ)(i)(z - Delta z(i)) to correct the mean redshift of n(i)(z) for biases in n(PZ)(i). The Delta z(i) are constrained by comparison of independently estimated 30-band photometric redshifts of galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field to BPZ estimates made from the DES griz fluxes, for a sample matched in fluxes, pre-seeing size, and lensing weight to the DES weak-lensing sources. In companion papers, the Delta z(i) of the three lowest redshift bins are further constrained by the angular clustering of the source galaxies around red galaxies with secure photometric redshifts at 0.15 < z < 0.9. This paper details the BPZ and COSMOS procedures, and demonstrates that the cosmological inference is insensitive to details of the n(i)(z) beyond the choice of Delta z(i). The clustering and COSMOS validation methods produce consistent estimates of Delta z(i) in the bins where both can be applied, with combined uncertainties of sigma(i)(Delta z) = 0.015, 0.013, 0.011, and 0.022 in the four bins. Repeating the photo-z procedure instead using the Directional Neighbourhood Fitting algorithm, or using the n(i)(z) estimated from the matched sample in COSMOS, yields no discernible difference in cosmological inferences.

This can lead to systematic biases in the estimated net and longwave radiation for any particular location and time of year. Under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) project, a new global, high spectral resolution land surface emissivity dataset has recently been made available at monthly at 0.05 degree resolution since 2000. Called the Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL), this dataset is created by the merging of the MODIS baseline-fit emissivity database developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset (GED) produced at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. CAMEL has 13 hinge points between 3.6-14.3 mu m which are expanded to cover 417 infrared spectral channels within the same wavelength region using a principal component regression approach. This work presents the method for calculating BBE using the new CAMEL dataset. BBE is computed via numerical integration over the CAMEL High Spectral Resolution product for two different wavelength ranges-3.6-14.3 mu m which takes advantage of the full, available CAMEL spectra and 8.0-13.5 mu m which has been determined to be an optimal range for computing the most representative all wavelength, longwave net radiation. CAMEL BBE uncertainty estimates are computed, and comparisons are made to BBE computed from lab validation data for selected case sites. Variations of BBE over time and land cover classification schemes are investigated and converted into flux to demonstrate the equivalent error in longwave radiation which would be made by the use of a single, constant BBE value. Misrepresentations in BBE by 0.05 at 310 K corresponds to potential errors in longwave radiation of over 25 W/m(2).

Accelerating rates of Arctic carbon cycling revealed by long-term atmospheric CO2 measurements	SCIENCE ADVANCES												The contemporary Arctic carbon balance is uncertain, and the potential for a permafrost carbon feedback of anywhere from 50 to 200 petagrams of carbon (Schuur et al., 2015) compromises accurate 21st-century global climate system projections. The 42-year record of atmospheric CO2 measurements at Barrow, Alaska (71.29 N, 156.79 W), reveals significant trends in regional land-surface CO2 anomalies (Delta CO2), indicating long-term changes in seasonal carbon uptake and respiration. Using a carbon balance model constrained by Delta CO2, we find a 13.4% decrease in mean carbon residence time (50% confidence range = 9.2 to 17.6%) in North Slope tundra ecosystems during the past four decades, suggesting a transition toward a boreal carbon cycling regime. Temperature dependencies of respiration and carbon uptake suggest that increases in cold season Arctic labile carbon release will likely continue to exceed increases in net growing season carbon uptake under continued warming trends.

Highlights from the First Ten Years of the New Zealand Earthquake Forecast Testing Center	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We present highlights from the first decade of operation of the New Zealand Earthquake Forecast Testing Center of the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP). Most results are based on reprocessing using the best available catalog, because the testing center did not consistently capture the complete real-time catalog. Tests of models with daily updating show that aftershock models incorporating Omori-Utsu decay can outperform long-term smoothed seismicity models with probability gains up to 1000 during major aftershock sequences. Tests of models with 3-month updating show that several models with every earthquake a precursor according to scale (EEPAS) model, incorporating the precursory scale increase phenomenon and without Omori-Utsu decay, and the double-branching model, with both Omori-Utsu and exponential decay in time, outperformed a regularly updated smoothed seismicity model. In tests of 5-yr models over 10 yrs without updating, a smoothed seismicity model outperformed the earthquake source model of the New Zealand National Seismic Hazard Model. The performance of 3-month and 5-yr models was strongly affected by the Canterbury earthquake sequence, which occurred in a region of previously low seismicity. Smoothed seismicity models were shown to perform better with more frequent updating. CSEP models were a useful resource for the development of hybrid time-varying models for practical forecasting after major earthquakes in the Canterbury and Kaikoura regions.

The Forecasting Skill of Physics-Based Seismicity Models during the 2010-2012 Canterbury, New Zealand, Earthquake Sequence	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The static coulomb stress hypothesis is a widely known physical mechanism for earthquake triggering and thus a prime candidate for physics-based operational earthquake forecasting (OEF). However, the forecast skill of coulomb-based seismicity models remains controversial, especially compared with empirical statistical models. A previous evaluation by the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) concluded that a suite of coulomb-based seismicity models were less informative than empirical models during the aftershock sequence of the 1992 M-w 7.3 Landers, California, earthquake. Recently, a new generation of coulomb-based and coulomb/statistical hybrid models were developed that account better for uncertainties and secondary stress sources. Here, we report on the performance of this new suite of models compared with empirical epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) models during the 2010-2012 Canterbury, New Zealand, earthquake sequence. Comprising the 2010 M 7.1 Darfield earthquake and three subsequent M >= 5.9 shocks (including the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake), this sequence provides a wealth of data (394 M >= 3.95 shocks). We assessed models over multiple forecast horizons (1 day, 1 month, and 1 yr, updated after M >= 5.9 shocks). The results demonstrate substantial improvements in the coulomb-based models. Purely physics-based models have a performance comparable to the ETAS model, and the two coulomb/statistical hybrids perform better or similar to the corresponding statistical model. On the other hand, an ETAS model with anisotropic (fault-based) aftershock zones is just as informative. These results provide encouraging evidence for the predictive power of coulomb-based models. To assist with model development, we identify discrepancies between forecasts and observations.

CSEP's goals are to improve our understanding of earthquake predictability, advance forecasting model development, test key scientific hypotheses and their predictive power, and improve seismic hazard assessments. Since its inception in California in 2007, the global CSEP collaboration has been conducting forecast experiments in a variety of tectonic settings and at a global scale and now operates four testing centers on four continents to automatically and objectively evaluate models against prospective data. These experiments have provided a multitude of results that are informing operational earthquake forecasting systems and seismic hazard models, and they have provided new and, sometimes, surprising insights into the predictability of earthquakes and spurned model improvements. CSEP has also conducted pilot studies to evaluate ground-motion and hazard models. Here, we report on selected achievements from a decade of CSEP, and we present our priorities for future activities.

Future mission concepts under study by the 2020 decadal survey, e.g., Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) and the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR), have the potential of achieving this goal. We investigate the baseline requirements for detecting four molecular species, H2O, O-2, CH4, and CO2, assuming concentrations of these species equal to that of modern Earth. These molecules are highly relevant to habitability and life on Earth and other planets. Through numerical simulations, we find the minimum requirements of spectral resolution, starlight suppression, and exposure time for detecting biosignature and habitability marker gases. The results are highly dependent on cloud conditions. A low-cloud case is more favorable because of deeper and denser lines whereas a no-cloud case is the pessimistic case for its low albedo. The minimum exposure time for detecting a certain molecule species can vary by a large factor (similar to 10) between the low-cloud case and the no-cloud case. For all cases, we provide baseline requirements for HabEx and LUVOIR. The impact of exozodiacal contamination and thermal background is also discussed and will be included in future studies.

Horizontal and Vertical Scaling of Cloud Geometry Inferred from CloudSat Data	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A method is described to characterize the scale dependence of cloud chord length using cloud-type classification reported with the 94-GHz CloudSat radar. The cloud length along the CloudSat track is quantified using horizontal and vertical structures of cloud classification separately for each cloud type and for all clouds independent of cloud type. While the individual cloud types do not follow a clear power-law behavior as a function of horizontal or vertical scale, a robust power-law scaling of cloud chord length is observed when cloud type is not considered. The exponent of horizontal length is approximated by beta approximate to 1.66 + 0.00 across two orders of magnitude (similar to 10-1000km). The exponent of vertical thickness is approximated by beta approximate to 2.23 +/- 0.03 in excess of one order of magnitude (similar to 1-14 km). These exponents are in agreement with previous studies using numerical models, satellites, dropsondes, and in situ aircraft observations. These differences in horizontal and vertical cloud scaling are consistent with scaling of temperature and horizontal wind in the horizontal dimension and with scaling of buoyancy flux in the vertical dimension. The observed scale dependence should serve as a guide to test and evaluate scale-cognizant climate and weather numerical prediction models.

Aqueous Processes From Diverse Hydrous Minerals in the Vicinity of Amazonian-Aged Lyot Crater	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Amazonian-aged Lyot crater is the best-preserved and deepest peak-ring impact crater (diameter, D = 220 km) in the northern lowlands of Mars. Morphological features including scouring channels emanating from its ejecta and small channels within the crater have been examined previously to understand hydrological activity associated with the crater. In this study, we analyze images acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to investigate the mineralogical record in Lyot and its surroundings, which are presently enriched in ground ice, to understand the associated aqueous processes, their relative timing, and a possible role for ground ice in hydrous mineral formation. We find diverse hydrous minerals, including Fe/Mg phyllosilicates, chlorite, illite/muscovite, and prehnite in Lyot crater walls, central peak, and ejecta, as well as in two craters to the west of Lyot. The exposure and distribution of the hydrous minerals suggest that they are related to the impact process, either exposed by the excavation of hydrothermally altered rocks or formed through syn-depositional hydrothermal alteration immediately after impacts. The Lyot impact induced channel formation to the north, but no mineralogical evidence of aqueous alteration associated with the channels is observed. The sinuous channels within Lyot, diverted by bedrock units with hydrous mineral detections, did not cause mineralization but likely represent the last stage of water activity in Lyot crater. The separate episodes of water activity indicate flow of liquid water on Mars' surface during the Amazonian but limited to no aqueous alteration to generate hydrous minerals. Plain Language Summary Though liquid water is not stable on the surface of Mars presently, water may have had a more active role on Mars in the recent geologic epoch. In particular, meteor impacts may melt ground ice, creating local environments with liquid water activity. Lyot crater is the deepest, well-preserved impact crater in the northern plains of Mars, with a diameter of 220 km, formed in the most recent geologic epoch. In this work, we study the mineralogy and morphology related to water activities within and adjacent to Lyot crater. One of the mineral types (prehnite) found in Lyot form at relatively high temperature (>200 degrees C) in hydrothermal environments. From the distribution of water-bearing minerals, we found that they probably represent an earlier episode of water activity before or during the impact. While liquid water has carved small channels inside the crater long after the impact, they probably did not exist on the surface long enough to alter the composition of the bedrock materials. Liquid water may be present but probably quite short-lived in the most recent epoch on Mars.

Perchlorate-Driven Combustion of Organic Matter During Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry: Implications for Organic Matter Detection on Earth and Mass	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												The search for life on Mars targets the detection of organic matter from extant or extinct organisms. Current protocols use thermal extraction procedures to transfer organic matter to mass spectrometer detectors. Oxidizing minerals on Mars, such as perchlorate, interfere with organic detection by thermal extraction. Thermal decomposition of perchlorate releases oxygen, which promotes combustion of organic carbon. We have assessed the minimum mass ratio of organic carbon to perchlorate required to detect organic matter by thermal extraction and mass spectrometry. Locations on Mars with organic carbon to perchlorate ratios above 4.7-9.6 should be targeted. Because habitability is enhanced by the presence of liquid water and because perchlorate is a water-soluble salt, locations on Mars with evidence of past or recent liquid water are high priority targets. Plain Language Summary Missions to Mars look for evidence of organic molecules using thermal extraction techniques. Certain minerals on the Martian surface, such as perchlorate salts, break down during heating, releasing oxygen and causing the combustion of any organic matter, which may have been present. In this event organic carbon is lost to analysis as CO and CO2. We used the ratio of CO: CO2 produced as a proxy for the completeness of combustion when various ratios of organic matter and perchlorate where thermally decomposed together. This allowed us to find a minimum organic carbon: perchlorate mass ratio (similar to 5 times) for the survival of organic molecules. Carbon monoxide can only be produced if there is an excess of carbon to oxygen, which could enable the survival of unoxidized organic molecules for their subsequent detection. Applying these findings to Mars suggests that we would not expect to be able to detect organic molecules in average Martian soil. Consequently, future life detection missions to Mars must search for areas that exceed this ratio, either by having more organic matter or less perchlorate, and locations with evidence of recent water activity or in the subsurface are most likely to fulfill both of these criteria.				; Montgomery, Wren/K-6369-2013	Sephton, Mark/0000-0002-2190-5402; Kounaves, Samuel/0000-0002-2629-4831; Montgomery, Wren/0000-0002-8076-8575												2169-9097	2169-9100				JUL	2018	123	7					1901	1909		10.1029/2018JE005615							WOS:000445830200017						
J	Bagnardi, M; Hooper, A				Bagnardi, Marco; Hooper, Andrew			Inversion of Surface Deformation Data for Rapid Estimates of Source Parameters and Uncertainties: A Bayesian Approach	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												New satellite missions (e.g., the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation), advances in data downlinking, and rapid product generation now provide us with the ability to access space-geodetic data within hours of their acquisition. To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efficiently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co-seismic displacements for a thrust-faulting earthquake (2015 M-w 6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real-time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid-response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB (R)-based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientific community.

Sustained Groundwater Loss in California's Central Valley Exacerbated by Intense Drought Periods	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The accelerated rate of decline in groundwater levels across California's Central Valley results from overdrafting and low rates of natural recharge and is exacerbated by droughts. The lack of observations with an adequate spatiotemporal resolution to constrain the evolution of groundwater resources poses severe challenges to water management efforts. Here we present SAR interferometric measurements of high-resolution vertical land motion across the valley, revealing multiscale patterns of aquifer hydrogeological properties and groundwater storage change. Investigating the depletion and degradation of the aquifer-system during 2007-2010, when the entire valley experienced a severe drought, we find that similar to 2% of total aquifer-system storage was permanently lost, owing to irreversible compaction of the system. Over this period, the seasonal groundwater storage change amplitude of 10.11 +/- 2.5 km(3) modulates a long-term groundwater storage decline of 21.32 +/- 7.2 km(3). Estimates for subbasins show more complex patterns, most likely associated with local hydrogeology, recharge, demand, and underground flow. Presented measurements of aquifer-system compaction provide a more complete understanding of groundwater dynamics and can potentially be used to improve					Werth, Susanna/0000-0002-4144-0382; Farr, Thomas/0000-0001-5406-2096												0043-1397	1944-7973				JUL	2018	54	7					4449	4460		10.1029/2017WR022250							WOS:000442502100016	30197456

OCEANUS: A high science return Uranus orbiter with a low-cost instrument suite	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA												Ice-giant-sized planets are the most common type of observed exoplanet, yet the two ice giants in our own solar system (Uranus and Neptune) are the least explored class of planet, having only been observed through ground based observations and a single flyby each by Voyager 2 approximately 30 years ago. These single flybys were unable to characterize the spatial and temporal variability in ice giant magnetospheres, some of the most odd and intriguing magnetospheres in the solar system. They also offered only limited constraints on the internal structure of ice giants; understanding the internal structure of a planet is important for understanding its formation and evolution. The most recent planetary science Decadal Survey by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, "Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022," identified the ice giant Uranus as the third highest priority for a Flagship mission in the decade 2013-2022. However, in the event that NASA or another space agency is unable to fly a Flagship-class mission to an ice giant in the next decade, this paper presents a mission concept for a focused, lower cost Uranus orbiter called OCEANUS (Origins and Composition of the Exoplanet Analog Uranus System). OCEANUS would increase our understanding of the interior structure of Uranus, its magnetosphere, and how its magnetic field is generated. These goals could be achieved with just a magnetometer and the spacecraft's radio system. This study shows that several of the objectives outlined by the Decadal Survey, including one of the two identified as highest priority, are within reach for a New-Frontiers-class mission.

Possible Influence of Extreme Magnetic Storms on the Thermosphere in the High Latitudes	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Solar and interplanetary events can create extreme magnetic storms, such as the Carrington storm in 1859 with intensity up to Dst similar to -1,760 nT. The influence of an idealized, smaller Carrington-type storm on the thermosphere has been simulated using the nonhydrostatic Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model. For the storm conditions we simulated, the solar wind B-Z and velocity were -50 nT and 1,000 m/s, respectively. The corresponding cross polar cap potential reached 360 kV, and the hemispheric power was 200 GW. Consequently, the hemispheric integrated Joule heating exceeded 3,500 GW, which is more than 70 times higher than normal conditions. The thermosphere variations at high latitudes were examined through the comparison of three cases: reference, storm with geomagnetic energy enhancement only, and storm with both solar and geomagnetic energy enhancement. At 400-km altitude, the neutral density increased by >20 times at certain locations and by >10 times globally averaged. The atmosphere experienced a temperature of 4000 K, more than 1,500 m/s horizontal wind, and exceeding 150 m/s vertical wind. In general, additional energy increase from solar irradiation resulted in 20-30% more perturbation in neutral density and temperature. The exobase (top boundary of the thermosphere) expanded to altitudes >1,000 km, and the buoyancy acceleration (difference between vertical pressure gradient force and gravity force) can be as large as 3 m/s(2). The results will help to determine possible extreme responses to interplanetary coronal mass ejections for various phenomena occurring in geospace.				tsurutani, bruce/G-5835-2019; Mannucci, Anthony J/A-1349-2007	tsurutani, bruce/0000-0001-7299-9835; Mannucci, Anthony J/0000-0003-2391-8490												1542-7390					JUL	2018	16	7					802	813		10.1029/2018SW001847							WOS:000441278000004

The instrument, which has an operational bandwidth of 90-102 GHz, employs several unique components, including a custom-designed pair of millimeter-wave transmitter and heterodyne receiver integrated circuit chips constructed with 65 nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) techniques. These elements are directly mated to a hybrid coupling structure that enables free-space interaction of the electronics with a small gas volume while also acting as a cavity end mirror. Instrument performance for sensing of volatile compounds is highlighted with experimental trials taken in bulk gas flows and seeded molecular beam environments. Published by AIP Publishing.

It comprises two parent models: a strain rate-based model and a smoothed-seismicity based model. The GEAR1 model was retrospectively evaluated and calibrated using earthquake data from 2005 to 2012, resulting in a preferred log-linear multiplicative combination of the parent forecasts. Since 1 October 2015, the GEAR1 model has undergone prospective evaluation within the Collab-oratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) testing center, forecasting M-w >= 5.95 seismicity. We present initial prospective forecast test results for the GEAR1 model, its tectonic and seismicity components, and for the first iteration of the strain-rate-based model, during the 1 October 2015-7 September 2017 period. During the evaluation period, observed earthquakes are consistent with the GEAR1 forecast and comparative test results likewise support that GEAR1 is more informative than either of its components alone. Based on a combination of retrospective and prospective testing, the tectonic forecasts do not effectively anticipate observed spatial earthquake distribution, largely due to overlocalization of the model with respect to observed earthquake distributions.

Tony			2017 M-w 8.1 Tehuantepec Earthquake: Deep Slip and Rupture Directivity Enhance Ground Shaking but Weaken the	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The 8 September 2017 M-w 8.1 Tehuantepec normal-faulting earthquake caused unexpected widespread intensive shaking, strongly felt as far as Mexico City about 720 km northwest of the epicenter, and generated a 1.8 m tsunami at the coast. Just 11 days later, another devastating Mw 7.1 Puebla earthquake occurred near Mexico City. In this contribution, we characterized this event by a joint inversion using static Global Positioning System (GPS) offsets, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements, high-rate GPS, and teleseismic displacement waveforms, then validated the preferred model by tsunami observations. We demonstrate that the Tehuantepec earthquake rupture propagates mainly unilaterally toward the northwest at a relatively high speed (similar to 3.4 km/s), with three asperities identified: the dominant one is centered between depths from similar to 40 to 60 km while the other two are located at shallower (similar to 20 km) and deeper (similar to 90 km) depths, respectively. Moreover, we find the peak ground acceleration (PGA) recorded along the rupture propagation direction is much larger than that recorded at stations in the opposite direction with nearly identical epicentral distances (similar to 700 km). Dynamic displacements reaching 5 cm were also observed at a GPS station similar to 1450 km from the epicenter. Based on these observations and our model results, we suggest that the deep slip in the low-attenuation mantle and the rupture directivity likely enhance the nationwide ground shaking, whereas the shallow slip may contribute to the local tsunami heights. The derived slip distribution is valuable for future investigation on the explicit relationship between the M-w 8.1 Tehuantepec and M-w 7.1 Puebla events.

In order to inform water management decisions especially in scarce water environments, it is important to assess ET vegetation use by differentiating irrigated socio-economic areas and natural ecosystems. The global remote sensing ET product MOD16 has proven to underestimate ET in semiarid regions where ET is very sensitive to soil moisture. The objective of this research was to test whether a modified version of the remote sensing ET model PT-JPL, proven to perform well in drylands at Eddy Covariance flux sites using the land surface temperature as a proxy to the surface moisture status (PT-JPL-thermal), could be up-scaled at regional levels introducing also a new formulation for net radiation from various MODIS products. We applied three methods to track the spatial and temporal characteristics of ET in the World Heritage UNESCO Donana region: (i) a locally calibrated hydrological model (WATEN), (ii) the PT-JPL-thermal, and (iii) the global remote sensing ET product MOD16. The PT-JPL-thermal showed strong agreement with the WATEN ET in-situ calibrated estimates (rho = 0.78, rho(1month-lag) = 0.94) even though the MOD16 product did not (rho = 0.48). The PT-JPL-thermal approach has proven to be a robust remote sensing model for detecting ET at a regional level in Mediterranean environments and it requires only air temperature and incoming solar radiation from climatic databases apart from freely available satellite products.

Towards a framework for testing general relativity with extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral observations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral observations from future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA will enable strong-field tests of general relativity with unprecedented precision, but at prohibitive computational cost if existing statistical techniques are used. In one such test that is currently employed for LIGO black hole binary mergers, generic deviations from relativity are represented by N deformation parameters in a generalized waveform model; the Bayesian evidence for each of its 2(N) combinatorial submodels is then combined into a posterior odds ratio for modified gravity over relativity in a null-hypothesis test. We adapt and apply this test to a generalized model for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals constructed on deformed black hole spacetimes, and focus our investigation on how computational efficiency can be increased through an evidence-free method of model selection. This method is akin to the algorithm known as product-space Markov chain Monte Carlo, but uses nested sampling and improved error estimates from a rethreading technique. We perform benchmarking and robustness checks for the method, and find order-of-magnitude computational gains over regular nested sampling in the case of synthetic data generated from the null model.

Improving timing sensitivity in the microhertz frequency regime: limits from PSR J1713+0747 on gravitational waves produced by supermassive black hole binaries	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We search for continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) produced by individual supermassive black hole binaries in circular orbits using high-cadence timing observations of PSR J1713+0747. We observe this millisecond pulsar using the telescopes in the European Pulsar Timing Array with an average cadence of approximately 1.6 d over the period between 2011 April and 2015 July, including an approximately daily average between 2013 February and 2014 April. The high-cadence observations are used to improve the pulsar timing sensitivity across the gravitational wave frequency range of 0.008-5 mu Hz. We use two algorithms in the analysis, including a spectral fitting method and a Bayesian approach. For an independent comparison, we also use a previously published Bayesian algorithm. We find that the Bayesian approaches provide optimal results and the timing observations of the pulsar place a 95 per cent upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude of CGWs to be less than or similar to 3.5 x 10(-13) at a reference frequency of 1 mu Hz. We also find a 95 per cent upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude of low-frequency CGWs to be less than or similar to 1.4 x 10(-14) at a reference frequency of 20 nHz.

Evaluating tests of virialization and substructure using galaxy clusters in the ORELSE survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We evaluated the effectiveness of different indicators of cluster virialization using 12 large-scale structures in the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments survey spanning from 0.7 < z < 1.3. We located diffuse X-ray emission from 16 galaxy clusters using Chandra observations. We studied the properties of these clusters and their members, using Chandra data in conjunction with optical and near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy. We measured X-ray luminosities and gas temperatures of each cluster, as well as velocity dispersions of their member galaxies. We compared these results to scaling relations derived from virialized clusters, finding significant offsets of up to 3 sigma-4 sigma for some clusters, which could indicate they are disturbed or still forming. We explored if other properties of the clusters correlated with these offsets by performing a set of tests of virialization and substructure on our sample, including Dressler-Schectman tests, power ratios, analyses of the velocity distributions of galaxy populations, and centroiding differences. For comparison to a wide range of studies, we used two sets of tests: ones that did and did not use spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain rest-frame colours, stellar masses, and photometric redshifts of galaxies. Our results indicated that the difference between the stellar mass or light mean-weighted centre and the X-ray centre, as well as the projected offset of the most-massive/brightest cluster galaxy from other cluster centroids had the strongest correlations with scaling relation offsets, implying they are the most robust indicators of cluster virialization and can be used for this purpose when X-ray data are insufficiently deep for reliable L-X and T-X measurements.

Characterizing these large, heterogeneous systems with a remote explorer is difficult due to communications bandwidth and latency; such a mission will require significant advances in spacecraft autonomy. Science autonomy uses intelligent sensor platforms that analyze data in real-time, setting measurement and downlink priorities to provide the best information toward investigation goals. Such automation must relate abstract science hypotheses to the measurable quantities available to the robot. This study captures these relationships by formalizing traditional science traceability matrices into probabilistic models. This permits experimental design techniques to optimize future measurements and maximize information value toward the investigation objectives, directing remote explorers that respond appropriately to new data. Such models are a rich new language for commanding informed robotic decision making in physically grounded terms. We apply these models to quantify the information content of different rover traverses providing profiling spectroscopy of Cuprite Hills, Nevada. We also develop two methods of representing spatial correlations using human-defined maps and remote sensing data. Model unit classifications are broadly consistent with prior maps of the site's alteration mineralogy, indicating that the model has successfully represented critical spatial and mineralogical relationships at Cuprite.

Time evolution of intrinsic alignments of galaxies	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS												Intrinsic alignments (IA), correlations between the intrinsic shapes and orientations of galaxies on the sky, are both a significant systematic in weak lensing and a probe of the effect of large-scale structure on galactic structure and angular momentum. In the era of precision cosmology, it is thus especially important to model IA with high accuracy. Efforts to use cosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of IA on the large-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant models do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection of galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of IA, because galaxy positions when observed are generally different from their positions at the epoch when IA is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy IA from the time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including the effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a dependence of IA on the velocity shear. We calculate the galaxy-galaxy-IA bispectrum to tree level (in the linear matter density) in terms of the evolved IA coefficients. We then discuss the implications for weak lensing systematics as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. We find that considering advection introduces nonlocality into the bispectrum, and that the degree of nonlocality represents the memory of a galaxy's path from the time of its formation to the time of observation. We discuss how this result can be used to constrain the redshift at which IA is determined and provide Fisher estimation for the relevant measurements using the example of SDSS-BOSS.

Long-term aeolian deflation by prevailing onshore winds has resulted in the deposition of sand on the irregular surface of a Miocene-aged anhydrite outcrop. Two deposits similar to 25 km apart, along the prevailing wind trajectory, were hand excavated then analyzed for vertical (and temporal) changes in physical and chemical composition. Radiocarbon ages of organic matter embedded within the deposits show that rapid accumulation of sediment began at the last glacial maximum and slowed considerably after the Pacific Ocean attained its present post-glacial level. Over this time period, grain sizes are seen to increase while accumulation rates simultaneously decrease, suggesting greater wind speeds and/or a change or decrease in sediment supply. Changes in delta S-34 values of sulfate in the sediment beginning similar to 10 ka indicate an increase in marine sources. Similarly, delta H-2 values from palmitic acid show a steady increase at similar to 10 ka, likely resulting from aridification of the region during the Holocene. Due to the extreme aridity in the region, these sand dunes retain a well-preserved chemical record that reflects changes in elevation and coastal proximity after the last glacial maximum.

The multiwavelength data set is used to constrain parametric models for the distribution of dark and baryonic matter in a sample of six massive galaxy clusters selected from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). For five of the six clusters, the multiwavelength data set is well described by a relatively simple model that assumes spherical symmetry, hydrostatic equilibrium, and entirely thermal pressure support. The joint analysis yields considerably better constraints on the total mass and concentration of the clusters compared to analysis of any one data set individually. The resulting constraints are consistent with simulation-based predictions for the concentration-mass relation. The subsample of five galaxy clusters is used to place an upper limit on the fraction of pressure support in the intracluster medium (ICM) due to nonthermal processes, such as turbulence and bulk flow of the gas. We constrain the nonthermal pressure fraction at r(500c) to be < 0.11 at 95% confidence. This is in tension with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, which predict a nonthermal pressure fraction of approximate to 0.25 at r(500c) for clusters of similar mass and redshift. This tension may be explained by the sample selection and/or our assumption of spherical symmetry.

Coma morphology of comet 67P controlled by insolation over irregular nucleus	NATURE ASTRONOMY												While the structural complexity of cometary comae is already recognizable from telescopic observations(1), the innermost region, within a few radii of the nucleus, was not resolved until spacecraft exploration became a reality(2,3). The dust coma displays jet-like features of enhanced brightness superposed on a diffuse background(1,4,5). Some features can be traced to specific areas on the nucleus, and result conceivably from locally enhanced outgassing and/or dust emission(6-8). However, diffuse or even uniform activity over topographic concavity can converge to produce jet-like features(9,10). Therefore, linking observed coma morphology to the distribution of activity on the nucleus is difficult(11,12). Here, we study the emergence of dust activity at sunrise on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko using high-resolution, stereo images from the OSIRIS camera onboard the Rosetta spacecraft, where the sources and formation of the jet-like features are resolved. We perform numerical simulations to show that the ambient dust coma is driven by pervasive but non-uniform water outgassing from the homogeneous surface layer. Physical collimations of gas and dust flows occur at local maxima of insolation and also via topographic focusing. Coma structures are projected to exhibit jet-like features that vary with the perspective of the observer. For an irregular comet such as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, near-nucleus coma structures can be concealed in the shadow of the nucleus, which further complicates the picture.

Gypsum, bassanite, and anhydrite at Gale crater, Mars	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Analyses by the CheMin X-ray diffraction instrument on Mars Science Laboratory show that gypsum, bassanite, and anhydrite are common minerals at Gale crater. Warm conditions (similar to 6 to 30 degrees C) within CheMin drive gypsum dehydration to bassanite; measured surface temperatures and modeled temperature depth profiles indicate that near-equatorial warm-season surface heating can also cause gypsum dehydration to bassanite. By accounting for instrumental dehydration effects we are able to quantify the in situ abundances of Ca-sulfate phases in sedimentary rocks and in eolian sands at Gale crater. All three Ca-sulfate minerals occur together in some sedimentary rocks and their abundances and associations vary stratigraphically. Several Ca-sulfate diagenetic events are indicated. Salinity-driven anhydrite precipitation at temperatures below similar to 50 degrees C may be supported by co-occurrence of more soluble salts. An alternative pathway to anhydrite via dehydration might be possible, but if so would likely be limited to warmer near-equatorial dark eolian sands that presently contain only anhydrite. The polyphase Ca-sulfate associations at Gale crater reflect limited opportunities for equilibration, and they presage mixed salt associations anticipated in higher strata that are more sulfate-rich and may mark local or global environmental change. Mineral transformations within CheMin also provide a better understanding of changes that might occur in samples returned from Mars.

Frankenstein or a Submarine Alkaline Vent: Who Is Responsible for Abiogenesis?: Part 1: What is life-that it might create itself?	BIOESSAYS												Origin of life models based on "energized assemblages of building blocks" are untenable in principle. This is fundamentally a consequence of the fact that any living system is in a physical state that is extremely far from equilibrium, a condition it must itself build and sustain. This in turn requires that it carries out all of its molecular transformations-obligatorily those that convert, and thereby create, disequilibria-using case-specific mechanochemical macromolecular machines. Mass-action solution chemistry is quite unable to do this. We argue in Part 2 of this series that this inherent dependence of life on disequilibria-converting macromolecular machines is also an obligatory requirement for life at its emergence. Therefore, life must have been launched by the operation of abiotic macromolecular machines driven by abiotic, but specifically "life-like", disequilibria, coopted from mineral precipitates that are chemically and physically active. Models grounded in "chemistry-in-a-bag" ideas, however energized, should not be considered.																	0265-9247	1521-1878				JUL	2018	40	7							1700179	10.1002/bies.201700179							WOS:000435930800001	29870581

Luminous WISE-selected Obscured, Unobscured, and Red Quasars in Stripe 82	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present a spectroscopically complete sample of 147 infrared-color-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) down to a 22 mu m flux limit of 20 mJy over the similar to 270 deg(2) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 region. Most of these sources are in the QSO luminosity regime (L-bol greater than or similar to 10(12)L(circle dot)) and are found out to z similar or equal to 3. We classify the AGNs into three types, finding 57 blue, unobscured Type-1 (broad-lined) sources; 69 obscured, Type-2 (narrow-lined) sources; and 21 moderately reddened Type-1 sources (broad-lined and E(B-V) > 0.25). We study a subset of this sample in X-rays and analyze their obscuration to find that our spectroscopic classifications are in broad agreement with low, moderate, and large amounts of absorption for Type-1, red Type-1, and Type-2 AGNs, respectively. We also investigate how their X-ray luminosities correlate with other known bolometric luminosity indicators such as [O III] line luminosity (L-[O III]) and infrared luminosity (L-6 mu m). While the X-ray correlation with L-[O III] is consistent with previous findings, the most infrared-luminous sources appear to deviate from established relations such that they are either underluminous in X-rays or overluminous in the infrared. Finally, we examine the luminosity function evolution of our sample, and by AGN type, in combination with the complementary, infrared-selected, AGN sample of Lacy et al. (2013), spanning over two orders of magnitude in luminosity. We find that the two obscured populations evolve differently, with reddened Type-1 AGNs dominating the obscured AGN fraction (similar to 30%) for L-5 mu m > 10(45) erg s(-1), while the fraction of Type-2 AGNs with L-5 mu m < 10(45) erg s(-1) rises sharply from 40% to 80% of the overall AGN population.				; Urry, Meg/G-7381-2011	Lacy, Mark/0000-0002-3032-1783; Stern, Daniel/0000-0003-2686-9241; Urry, Meg/0000-0002-0745-9792; Urrutia, Tanya/0000-0001-6746-9936; Graham, Matthew/0000-0002-3168-0139; LaMassa, Stephanie/0000-0002-5907-3330												0004-637X	1538-4357				JUL 1	2018	861	1							37	10.3847/1538-4357/aac5d8							WOS:000436925600001

KL, is a longstanding mystery. We conducted a survey observation and chemical modeling study to investigate if the different distributions of O- and N-bearing species are widely recognized in general star-forming regions. First, we report our observational results of complex organic molecules (COMs) with the 45 m radio telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory toward eight star-forming regions. Through our spectral survey ranging from 80 to 108 GHz, we detected CH3OH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, (CH3)(2)CO, CH3CHO, CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, and NH2CHO. Their molecular abundances were derived via the rotation diagram and the least squares methods. We found that N-bearing molecules tend to show stronger correlations with other N-bearing molecules rather than O-bearing molecules. While G10.47 vertical bar 0.03 showed high fractional abundances of N-bearing species, those in NGC 6334F were not so rich, being less than 0.01 compared to CH3OH. Then the molecular abundances toward these sources were evaluated by chemical modeling with the NAUTILUS three-phase gas-grain chemical code. Based on the simulations of time evolution for the abundance of COMs, we suggest that the observed correlations of fractional abundances between COMs can be explained by a combination of different temperature structures inside the hot cores and the different evolutionary phases. Since our modeling could not fully explain the observed excitation temperatures, it is important to investigate the efficiency of grain surface reactions and their activation barriers and the binding energy of COMs to further promote our understanding.				; Majumdar, Liton/F-6759-2014	Saito, Masao/0000-0003-0769-8627; Ohishi, Masatoshi/0000-0003-2775-7487; Majumdar, Liton/0000-0001-7031-8039												0067-0049	1538-4365				JUL	2018	237	1							3	10.3847/1538-4365/aac8db							WOS:000437414100001

This paper first discusses the need for fractional synthesis in terahertz systems, and provides a brief overview of reference clock frequency selection, and design choices related to implementation of fractional functionality. Sigma Delta-multistage-noise-shape-based and DDFS-based fractional synthesis approaches and architectures are discussed and CMOS synthesizer modules based on both of these approaches are presented. Finally, the paper compares two different 100-GHz CMOS fractional frequency synthesizer chips, which employ the same millimeter-wave circuits but different fractional generators (thirdand sixth order Sigma Delta, and DDFS based). Performance in terms of phase-noise, spurious components, and power consumption are directly compared. Measurements suggest Sigma Delta synthesis is more suitable than DDFS for THz fractional synthesizers due to the high-phase multiplication of spurs.																	2156-342X					JUL	2018	8	4					410	417		10.1109/TTHZ.2018.2840078							WOS:000437303300005						
J	Mikellides, IG; Ortega, AL				Mikellides, Ioannis G.; Ortega, Alejandro Lopez			2D (r-z) numerical simulations of the plasma and channel erosion in a 100kW class nested Hall thruster	PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Results from the first numerical simulations of a nested Hall thruster (NHT) are presented. The X3 is a 100 kW class thruster with one center-mounted hollow cathode and three acceleration channels none of which is currently magnetically shielded. The simulations were conducted with the r-z axisymmetric code Hall2De and focused on operation with all three channels firing, at discharge voltages of 300, 400 and 800 V. The corresponding discharge power levels are 38, 49.6 and 100 kW. A recent experimental campaign provided measurements of the thrust for a wide range of channel combinations and operating conditions, but not at 800 V. At 300 and 400 V, with all three channels operating, the computed thrust is underestimated by 8.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The simulations also allowed for the first estimates of erosion by ion sputtering in a NHT. The maximum erosion rates along the boron nitride channel walls are found to be in the order of 1 mm kh(-1) (10(3) mu m kh(-1)) at 300 V. The rates at 800 V are a few times higher than those at 300 V. Mechanisms driving the erosion are identified, in part through comparisons with measurements and simulations of a similar single-channel unshielded Hall thruster that has been extensively studied in the past. It is found that anomalous collisions, now widely accepted to drive electron transport in these devices, and the manner in which they develop spatially in the channel interior can play a significant role on the channel erosion.																	0963-0252	1361-6595				JUL	2018	27	7							075001	10.1088/1361-6595/aacacb							WOS:000437248400001

The Radio Sky at Meter Wavelengths: m-mode Analysis Imaging with the OVRO-LWA	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												A host of new low-frequency radio telescopes seek to measure the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen from the early universe. These telescopes have the potential to directly probe star and galaxy formation at redshifts 20 >= z >= 7 but are limited by the dynamic range they can achieve against foreground sources of low-frequency radio emission. Consequently, there is a growing demand for modern, high-fidelity maps of the sky at frequencies below 200 MHz for use in foreground modeling and removal. We describe a new wide-field imaging technique for drift-scanning interferometers: Tikhonov-regularized m-mode analysis imaging. This technique constructs images of the entire sky in a single synthesis imaging step with exact treatment of wide-field effects. We describe how the CLEAN algorithm can be adapted to deconvolve maps generated by m-mode analysis imaging. We demonstrate Tikhonov-regularized m-mode analysis imaging using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) by generating eight new maps of the sky north of delta = -30 degrees with 15 ' angular resolution at frequencies evenly spaced between 36.528 and 73.152 MHz and similar to 800 mJy beam(-1) thermal noise. These maps are a 10-fold improvement in angular resolution over existing full-sky maps at comparable frequencies, which have angular resolutions. >= 2 degrees. Each map is constructed exclusively from interferometric observations and does not represent the globally averaged sky brightness. Future improvements will incorporate total power radiometry, improved thermal noise, and improved angular resolution due to the planned expansion of the OVRO-LWA to 2.6. km baselines. These maps serve as a first step on the path to the use of more sophisticated foreground filters in 21 cm cosmology incorporating the measured angular and frequency structure of all foreground contaminants.

Using Deep Space Climate Observatory Measurements to Study the Earth as an Exoplanet	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												Even though it was not designed as an exoplanetary research mission, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) has been opportunistically used for a novel experiment in which Earth serves as a proxy exoplanet. More than 2 yr of DSCOVR Earth images were employed to produce time series of multiwavelength, single-point light sources in order to extract information on planetary rotation, cloud patterns, surface type, and orbit around the Sun. In what follows, we assume that these properties of the Earth are unknown and instead attempt to derive them from first principles. These conclusions are then compared with known data about our planet. We also used the DSCOVR data to simulate phase-angle changes, as well as the minimum data collection rate needed to determine the rotation period of an exoplanet. This innovative method of using the time evolution of a multiwavelength, reflected single-point light source can be deployed for retrieving a range of intrinsic properties of an exoplanet around a distant star.

Strain PI11(T) could grow optimally at 1.0% NaCl concentration with pH 7.0 at 30A degrees C and was positive for oxidase and catalase but negative for hydrolysis of starch, casein, and esculin ferric citrate. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strain PI11(T) belonged to the genus Pseudomonas sharing the highest sequence similarities with Pseudomonas indoloxydans JCM 14246(T) (99.72%), followed by, Pseudomonas oleovorans subsp. oleovorans DSM 1045(T) (99.29%), Pseudomonas toyotomiensis JCM 15604(T) (99.15%), Pseudomonas chengduensis DSM 26382(T) (99.08%), Pseudomonas oleovorans subsp. lubricantis DSM 21016(T) (99.08%), and Pseudomonas alcaliphila JCM 10630(T) (99.01%). Experimental DNA-DNA relatedness between strain PI11(T) and P. indoloxydans JCM 14246(T) was 49.4%. The draft genome of strain PI11(T) consisted of 4,884,839 bp. Average nucleotide identity between the genome of strain PI11(T) and other closely related type strains ranged between 77.25-90.74%. The polar lipid pattern comprised of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine. The major (> 10%) cellular fatty acids were C-18:1 omega 6c/omega 7c, C-16:1 omega 6c/omega 7c, and C-16:0. The DNA G + C content of strain PI11(T) was 62.4 mol%. Based on the results of polyphasic analysis, strain PI11(T) was delineated from other closely related type strains. It is proposed that strain PI11(T) represents represents a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PI11(T) (= KCTC 42576(T) = DSMZ 100245(T)).																	1225-8873	1976-3794				JUL	2018	56	7					458	466		10.1007/s12275-018-7549-x							WOS:000436820500002	29948825

The operational algorithm uses a path-integrated attenuation (PIA) obtained by comparing the measured surface return with that expected either from a nearby, nonprecipitating area or from the same area, acquired at a previous, nonprecipitating time. This surface reference technique has worked well in most situations but can result in erroneously low estimates of the path attenuation in situations with nonuniform filling of the radar beam, especially at Ka-band due to its larger attenuation. This paper explores the existence of relationships between the Ka-band PIA and the characteristics of the measured reflectivity profiles. The author finds that PIA is, indeed, related to reflectivity profiles, with strongest correlation between the PIA and the measured rainfall dual-frequency reflectivity ratio just above the surface. This relationship could be used as an estimator in the cases with severe nonuniform beam filling.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				JUL	2018	56	7					4065	4074		10.1109/TGRS.2018.2821601							WOS:000436418200034

Global Ocean Altimetry With GNSS Reflections From TechDemoSat-1	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) is an experimental Global Navigation Satellite System Reflections (GNSS-R) satellite launched in 2014. The GNSS-R receiver onboard performs realtime navigation and generates delay-Doppler correlation maps for Earth-reflected Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 C/A ranging signals. This paper investigates the performance of the TDS-1 data for ocean surface altimetry retrievals. The analysis includes consideration of the transmitter and receiver orbits, time tag corrections, models for ionospheric and tropospheric delays, zenith to nadir antenna baseline offsets, ocean and solid Earth tides, and a comparison with mean sea surface topography. An error budget is compiled to account for each error source and compared with the experimentally derived surface height retrievals. By analyzing data sets covering global ocean surfaces over +/- 60 degrees latitude, the current performance of spaceborne GNSS-R altimetry with the TDS-1 data set is experimentally established. In comparison with the mean sea surface topography, the surface height residuals are found to be 6.4 m, 1 sigma with a 1-s integration time. A discussion of the factors limiting this performance is presented, with implications for future GNSS-R altimetry missions designed for the observation of mesoscale ocean circulation.

The life of the lanthanum-hexaboride insert in these hollow cathodes is projected to range from 10 kh to over 100 kh based on insert evaporation calculations. A detailed investigation of the life of a 1.5 cm outside-diameter lanthanum-hexaboride hollow cathode has been made. This cathode can provide discharge currents between 5 and 100 A and has an estimated lifetime in excess of 50 kh depending on discharge current and mass flow rate. The insert evaporation rate is determined from a 4000 h discharge wear test of a laboratory model cathode, where insert weight-loss measurements were made at the start, middle, and end of the test. Detailed insert temperature and plasma measurements are used in a one-dimensional disk evaporation model that accommodates the insert temperature profiles found with different discharge currents, flow rates, and cathode orifice diameters, to predict the insert life. The results suggest that insert outgassing is significant early in life, and lanthanum redeposition reduces the net evaporation rate and extends the cathode life.

Hollow Cathode Simulations with a First-Principles Model of Ion-Acoustic Anomalous Resistivity	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER												A mathematical model of the ion-acoustic turbulence that is known to develop in the plume of hollow cathodes is presented. The model takes the form of a partial differential equation for the ion-acoustic wave energy density that can be solved concurrently with a set of the equations of motion that have been augmented with anomalous terms to account for the ion-acoustic turbulence-driven transport of momentum and heat for electrons and ions. Numerical simulations in two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that solve the complete system of these equations show significantly better agreement with plasma measurements compared to a previous idealized model, which assumed complete saturation of the ion-acoustic turbulence and did not account for the growth stage of the waves. In particular, the model is able to predict accurately the location and magnitude of the maximum resistivity to the electron current along the cathode centerline.																	0748-4658	1533-3876				JUL	2018	34	4					1026	1038		10.2514/1.B36782							WOS:000435924500019

Our catalog includes 30 high-quality planet candidates (showing no signs of being non-planetary in nature), 48 more ambiguous events that may be either planets or false positives, 164 eclipsing binaries, and 231 other regularly periodic variable sources. We have released light curves for all targets in C16 and have also released system parameters and transit vetting plots for all interesting candidates identified in this paper. Of particular interest is a candidate planet orbiting the bright F dwarf HD. 73344 (V = 6.9, K = 5.6) with an orbital period of 15 days. If confirmed, this object would correspond to a 2.56. +/-. 0.18 R-(sic) planet and would likely be a favorable target for radial velocity characterization. This paper is intended as a rapid release of planet candidates, eclipsing binaries, and other interesting periodic variables to maximize the scientific yield of this campaign, and as a test run for the upcoming TESS mission, whose frequent data releases call for similarly rapid candidate identification and efficient follow up.

Degradation analysis in the estimation of photometric redshifts from non-representative training sets	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We perform an analysis of photometric redshifts estimated by using a non-representative training sets in magnitude space. We use the ANNz2 and GPz algorithms to estimate the photometric redshift both in simulations and in real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR12). We show that for the representative case, the results obtained by using both algorithms have the same quality, using either magnitudes or colours as input. In order to reduce the errors when estimating the redshifts with a non-representative training set, we perform the training in colour space. We estimate the quality of our results by using a mock catalogue which is split samples cuts in the r band between 19.4 < r < 20.8. We obtain slightly better results with GPz on single point z-phot estimates in the complete training set case, however the photometric redshifts estimated with ANNz2 algorithm allows us to obtain mildly better results in deeper r-band cuts when estimating the full redshift distribution of the sample in the incomplete training set case. By using a cumulative distribution function and a Monte Carlo process, we manage to define a photometric estimator which fits well the spectroscopic distribution of galaxies in the mock testing set, but with a larger scatter. To complete this work, we perform an analysis of the impact on the detection of clusters via density of galaxies in a field by using the photometric redshifts obtained with a non-representative training set.

However, the additional degrees of freedom of finding the best maneuver location can severely complicate automated broad-search algorithms. A computationally efficient formulation that reduces the maneuver design space to a single dimension is presented, where the efficacy of additional maneuvers along previously computed transfers is calculated explicitly via Lawden's "primer vector". Examples include leveraging maneuvers to ease capture at Europa, phasing maneuvers to enable resonant hopping among Saturn's moons, and broken-plane maneuvers on transfers to Mars.																	0731-5090	1533-3884				JUL	2018	41	7					1531	1541		10.2514/1.G003172							WOS:000435436500007

Growth of magnesium diboride thin films on boron buffered Si and silicon-on-insulator substrates by hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition	SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report on the growth of high quality MgB2 thin films on silicon and silicon-on-insulator substrates by hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition. A boron buffer layer was deposited on all sides of the Si substrate to prevent the reaction of Mg vapor and Si. Ar ion milling at a low angle of 1 degrees was used to reduce the roughness of the boron buffer layer before the MgB2 growth. An Ar ion milling at low angle of 1 degrees was also applied to the MgB2 surface to reduce its roughness. The resultant MgB2 films showed excellent superconducting properties and a smooth surface. The process produces thin MgB2 films suitable for waveguide-based superconducting hot electron bolometers and other MgB2-based electronic devices.

Out of more than 17000 NEA candidates, while the majority became either new discoveries or were associated with previously known objects, about 11% were unable to be followed-up or confirmed. We further demonstrate that of the unconfirmed candidates, 926 +/- 50 are likely to be NEAs, representing 18% of discovered NEAs in that period. Only 11% (similar to 93) of the unconfirmed NEA candidates were large (having absolute magnitude H < 22). To identify the reasons why these NEAs were not recovered, we analyzed those from the most prolific asteroid surveys: Pan-STARRS, the Catalina Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Space Surveillance Telescope. We examined the influence of plane-of-sky positions and rates of motion, brightnesses, submission delays, and computed absolute magnitudes, as well as correlations with the phase of the moon and seasonal effects. We find that delayed submission of newly discovered NEA candidate to the NEOCP drove a large fraction of the unconfirmed NEA candidates. A high rate of motion was another significant contributing factor. We suggest that prompt submission of suspected NEA discoveries and rapid response to fast-moving targets and targets with fast growing ephemeris uncertainty would allow better coordination among dedicated follow-up observers, decrease the number of unconfirmed NEA candidates, and increase the discovery rate of NEAs.

We report a statistically significant anticorrelation between the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of the narrowcore of the neutral FeK alpha fluorescence emission line, ubiquitously observed in the reflection spectra of obscured AGN, and the mid-infrared 12 mu m continuum luminosity (taken as a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity). Our sample consists of 72 Compton-thick AGN selected from pointed and deep-field observations covering a redshift range of z similar to 0.0014-3.7. We employ a Monte Carlo-based fitting method, which returns a Spearman's Rank correlation coefficient of rho= -0.28 +/- 0.12, significant to 98.7 per cent confidence. The best-fitting found is log(EWFeK alpha) alpha -0.08 +/- 0.04 log(L-12 mu m), which is consistent with multiple studies of theX-ray Baldwin effect for unobscured and mildly obscured AGN. This is an unexpected result, as the FeK alpha line is conventionally thought to originate from the same region as the underlying reflection continuum, which together constitute the reflection spectrum. We discuss the implications this could have if confirmed on larger samples, including a systematic underestimation of the line-of-sight X-ray obscuring column density and hence the intrinsic luminosities and growth rates for the most luminous AGN.

Hunter			Macromolecular organic compounds from the depths of Enceladus	NATURE												Saturn's moon Enceladus harbours a global water ocean(1), which lies under an ice crust and above a rocky core(2). Through warm cracks in the crust(3) a cryo-volcanic plume ejects ice grains and vapour into space(4-7) that contain materials originating from the ocean(8,9). Hydrothermal activity is suspected to occur deep inside the porous core(10-12), powered by tidal dissipation(13). So far, only simple organic compounds with molecular masses mostly below 50 atomic mass units have been observed in plume material(6,14,15). Here we report observations of emitted ice grains containing concentrated and complex macromolecular organic material with molecular masses above 200 atomic mass units. The data constrain the macromolecular structure of organics detected in the ice grains and suggest the presence of a thin organic-rich film on top of the oceanic water table, where organic nucleation cores generated by the bursting of bubbles allow the probing of Enceladus' organic inventory in enhanced concentrations.

The Search for Activity on Dione and Tethys With Cassini VIMS and UVIS	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the Cassini mission the Saturnian moons Dione and Tethys showed intriguing and multiple clues suggesting residual geologic activity that might be detectable as an atmosphere, plume, or even heat signature. These clues included an atmospheric aura around Dione, injection of particles into Saturn's magnetosphere, mysterious red streaks on Tethys, and possible cryovolcanic features on Dione. A concerted effort that was strengthened in the latter stages of the mission included the acquisition of stellar occulations by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) of both Dione and Tethys and high solar phase observations of Dione by the Visible Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) to detect forward scattering from grains in a plume. Analysis of these observations shows no evidence for even a low level of activity on either moon. In addition, infrared images at 2.65m obtained throughout the mission were scrutinized for the reappearance of an atmosphere-like aura, with negative results.

The Eye of Saturn's North Polar Vortex: Unexpected Cloud Structures Observed at High Spatial Resolution by Cassini/VIMS	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Near-infrared spectral maps of Saturn's north polar vortex obtained at high spatial resolution provided by Cassini/Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) reveal localized ammonia clouds composed of unusually large particles exceeding 13m in radius, the largest cloud particles documented during the Cassini mission. Taken under near-optimum direct polar lighting and viewing conditions within a month of the summer solstice, these small (similar to 200km in breadth) discrete clouds are located within the eye of the polar vortex, which otherwise is unusually clear of observable aerosols in reflected sunlight, with total 2-m opacity <0.04 versus >1.0 elsewhere on Saturn. The dichotomy of large-particle condensate cloud featuresindicative of convective upwellingwithin a large (similar to 2000-km diameter) nearly aerosol-free region of downwelling characteristic of the core of a polar vortex reveals surprising polar dynamics on Saturn. Plain Language Summary Saturn's north pole was imaged with unprecedented clarity in over 200 colors during the Grand Finale phase of the Cassini mission, revealing surprising details on the structures of hazes and clouds. A cyclonic vortex caps the pole, extending out about 20 degrees (20,000km) in latitude, the largest cyclone known in the solar system. As a cyclone, this is a region of subsidence, where air descends downward. Such air, descending into warmer depths, should be relatively clear of condensate clouds of ammoniaone of the major condensables in Saturn's visible atmosphereespecially in the eye of the polar vortex right at the pole. The new multicolored near-infrared images obtained by the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer reveal that indeed the polar eye is remarkably devoid of aerosols, having less than 3% of the aerosol content seen anywhere else on Saturn. But surprisingly, ammonia clouds at the edge of the eyebut still within itare found to be remarkably thick, composed of the largest ammonia ice particles ever seen on Saturn, characteristic of powerful upwelling, not downwelling (subsidence). This conundrum of convection-style clouds forming in a strongly downwelling region is a shocking mystery left by Cassini in its waning days.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2018	45	12					5867	5875		10.1029/2018GL078168							WOS:000438499100008

Results here indicate that the magnitude of negative trends in dry season precipitation in the past decades exceeds the estimated range of trends due to natural variability of the climate system defined in both the preindustrial climate and during the 850-1850 millennium. The observed drying is associated with an increase in vapor pressure deficit. The univariate detection analysis shows that greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing has a systematic influence in negative 30-year trends of precipitation ending in 1998 and later on. The bivariate attribution analysis demonstrates that forcing by elevated GHG levels and land-use change are attributed as key causes for the observed drying during 1983-2012 over the southern Amazonia and central Brazil. We further show that the effect of GS signal (GHG and sulfate aerosols) based on RCP4.5 scenario already has a detectable influence in the observed drying. Thus, we suggest that the recently observed drier dry season is a feature which will continue and intensify in the course of unfolding anthropogenic climate change. Such change could have profound societal and ecosystem impacts over the region. Plain Language Summary This study uses statistical techniques to attribute the recently observed drier dry season over tropical South America to external drivers of climate change, both human-induced and naturally occurring. A decline in dry season precipitation has a large impact on ecosystem health of the region. Thus, attributing the forced components of the observed drier dry season to external drivers of climate change is of great practical importance to societies. Results indicate that the observed drying is well beyond the range of trends due to natural variability of the climate system and is found to be systematically and externally forced. The forcing by elevated greenhouse gas levels and land-use change (mainly deforestation) are attributed as key causes for the observed drying over the southern Amazonia and central Brazil. We further demonstrate that the recently observed drier dry season is a feature which will continue and intensify in the course of unfolding anthropogenic climate change. Such an assessment is critical for adaptation planning and mitigation strategies.				von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012; Behrangi, Ali/V-8927-2019	von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069; Behrangi, Ali/0000-0001-7594-8793												0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2018	45	12					6262	6271		10.1029/2018GL078041							WOS:000438499100049

This study is the first to perform an extensive assessment of the performance of the EMAC model for Arctic winters as previous studies have only made limited evaluations of EMAC simulations which also were mainly focused on the Antarctic winter stratosphere. We have chosen the two extreme Arctic winters 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 to evaluate the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) and the representation of the chemistry and dynamics of the polar winter stratosphere in EMAC. The EMAC simulations are compared to observations by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Soundings (Envisat/MIPAS) and the observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura/MLS). The Arctic winter 2010/2011 was one of the coldest stratospheric winters on record, leading to the strongest depletion of ozone measured in the Arctic. The Arctic winter 2009/2010 was, from the climatological perspective, one of the warmest stratospheric winters on record. However, it was distinguished by an exceptionally cold stratosphere (colder than the climatological mean) from mid-December 2009 to mid-January 2010, leading to prolonged PSC formation and existence. Significant denitrification, the removal of HNO3 from the stratosphere by sedimentation of HNO3-containing polar stratospheric cloud particles, occurred in that winter. In our comparison, we focus on PSC formation and denitrification. The comparisons between EMAC simulations and satellite observations show that model and measurements compare well for these two Arctic winters (differences for HNO3 generally within +/- 20 %) and thus that EMAC nudged toward ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalyses is capable of giving a realistic representation of the evolution of PSCs and associated sequestration of gas-phase HNO3 in the polar winter stratosphere. However, simulated PSC volume densities are smaller than the ones derived from Envisat/MIPAS observations by a factor of 3-7. Further, PSCs in EMAC are not simulated as high up (in altitude) as they are observed. This underestimation of PSC volume density and vertical extension of the PSCs results in an underestimation of the vertical redistribution of HNO3 due to denitrification/re-nitrification. The differences found here between model simulations and observations stipulate further improvements in the EMAC set-up for simulating PSCs.

We have used the continuous data gathered from the three radars during April-May 2010. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) analysis, and wavelet techniques are used to study the temporal and altitude structures of planetary waves. Here, we used a novel technique called EMD to extract the planetary waves from wind data. The planetary waves of similar to 6.5 and similar to 3.6 days periodicity are observed in all three radar stations with peak amplitudes of about 12 and 11 m s(-1), respectively. The 3.6-day wave has an average vertical wavelength from the three radars of about 42 km. The 3.6- and 6.5-day planetary waves are particularly strong in the zonal wind component. We find that the two waves are present at the 84-94 km height region. The observed features of the 3.6- and 6.5-day waves at the three tropical-latitude stations show some correspondence with the results reported for the equatorial-latitude stations.

Dynamic tunable notch filters for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA)	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) is a NASA long-duration balloon experiment with the primary goal of detecting ultra-high-energy (> 10(18) eV) neutrinos via the Askaryan Effect. The fourth ANITA mission, ANITA-IV, recently flew from Dec 2 to Dec 29, 2016. For the first time, the Tunable Universal Filter Frontend (TUFF) boards were deployed for mitigation of narrow-band, anthropogenic noise with tunable, switchable notch filters. The TUFF boards also performed second-stage amplification by approximately 45 dB to boost the similar to mu V-level radio frequency (RF) signals to similar to mV-level for digitization, and supplied power via bias tees to the first-stage, antenna-mounted amplifiers. The other major change in signal processing in ANITA-IV is the resurrection of the 90. hybrids deployed previously in ANITA-I, in the trigger system, although in this paper we focus on the TUFF boards. During the ANITA-IV mission, the TUFF boards were successfully operated throughout the flight. They contributed to a factor of 2.8 higher total instrument livetime on average in ANITA-IV compared to ANITA-III due to reduction of narrow-band, anthropogenic noise before a trigger decision is made.

Constraints on Cosmological Parameters from the Angular Power Spectrum of a Combined 2500 deg(2) SPT-SZ and Planck Gravitational Lensing Map	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We report constraints on cosmological parameters from the angular power spectrum of a cosmic microwave background (CMB) gravitational lensing potential map created using temperature data from 2500 deg 2 of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data supplemented with data from Planck in the same sky region, with the statistical power in the combined map primarily from the SPT data. We fit the lensing power spectrum to a model including cold dark matter and a cosmological constant (ACDM), and to models with single-parameter extensions to Lambda CDM. We find constraints that are comparable to and consistent with those found using the full-sky Planck CMB lensing data, e.g., sigma(g)Omega(0.2)(5)(m) = 0.598 +/- 0.024 from the lensing data alone with weak priors placed on other parameters. Combining with primary CMB data, we explore single-parameter extensions to ACDM. We find Omega(k =) -0.0121(-0.023)(+0.021)or M-v < 0.70 eV at 95% confidence, in good agreement with results including the lensing potential as measured by Planck. We include two parameters that scale the effect of lensing on the CMB: A(L) , which scales the lensing power spectrum in both the lens reconstruction power and in the smearing of the acoustic peaks, and A(phi phi), which scales only the amplitude of the lensing reconstruction power spectrum. We find A(phi phi) x A(L) = 1.01 +/- 0.08 for the lensing map made from combined SPT and Planck data, indicating that the amount of lensing is in excellent agreement with expectations from the observed CMB angular power spectrum when not including the information from smearing of the acoustic peaks.

CO in Protostars (COPS): Herschel-SPIRE Spectroscopy of Embedded Protostars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We present full spectral scans from 200 to 670. mu m of 26 Class 0+I protostellar sources obtained with Herschel-SPIRE as part of the "COPS-SPIRE" Open Time program, complementary to the DIGIT and WISH Key Programs. Based on our nearly continuous, line-free spectra from 200 to 670. mu m, the calculated bolometric luminosities (L-bol) increase by 50%. on average, and the bolometric temperatures (T-bol) decrease by 10%. on average, in comparison with the measurements without Herschel. Fifteen protostars have the same class using Tbol and L-bol/L-smm. We identify rotational transitions of CO lines from J = 4 -> 3to J = 13 -> 12, along with emission lines of (CO)-C-13, HCO+, H2O, and [C I]. The ratios of (CO)-C-12 to (CO)-C-13 indicate that (CO)-C-12 emission remains optically thick for J(up) < 13. We fit up to four components of temperature from the rotational diagram with flexible break points to separate the components. The distribution of rotational temperatures shows a primary population around 100 K with a secondary population at similar to 350 K. We quantify the correlations of each line pair found in our data set and find that the strength of the correlation of CO lines decreases as the difference between J levels between two CO lines increases. The multiple origins of CO emission previously revealed by velocity-resolved profiles are consistent with this smooth distribution if each physical component contributes to a wide range of CO lines with significant overlap in the CO ladder. We investigate the spatial extent of CO emission and find that the morphology is more centrally peaked and less bipolar at high-J lines. We find the CO emission observed with SPIRE related to outflows, which consists of two components, the entrained gas and shocked gas, as revealed by our rotational diagram analysis, as well as the studies with velocity-resolved CO emission.

Currently, there are many AR identification and tracking algorithms in the literature with a wide range of techniques and conclusions. ARTMIP strives to provide the community with information on different methodologies and provide guidance on the most appropriate algorithm for a given science question or region of interest. All ARTMIP participants will implement their detection algorithms on a specified common dataset for a defined period of time. The project is divided into two phases: Tier 1 will utilize the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis from January 1980 to June 2017 and will be used as a baseline for all subsequent comparisons. Participation in Tier 1 is required. Tier 2 will be optional and include sensitivity studies designed around specific science questions, such as reanalysis uncertainty and climate change. High-resolution reanalysis and/or model output will be used wherever possible. Proposed metrics include AR frequency, duration, intensity, and precipitation attributable to ARs. Here, we present the ARTMIP experimental design, timeline, project requirements, and a brief description of the variety of methodologies in the current literature. We also present results from our 1-month "proof-of-concept" trial run designed to illustrate the utility and feasibility of the ARTMIP project.				qian, yun/E-1845-2011; Kurlin, Vitaliy/AAE-7845-2020; Guan, Bin/F-6735-2010; sarangi, chandan/S-7326-2017; Wehner, Michael/F-7841-2015; Payne, Ashley/AAV-3948-2020; Nguyen, Phu/AAT-7451-2020; Tome, Ricardo/AAN-2151-2020; Ramos, Alexandre M./A-1998-2009; Payne, Ashley/M-2240-2016; Gorodetskaya, Irina/K-1987-2015; Leung, Ruby/F-9276-2018	Wehner, Michael/0000-0001-5991-0082; Payne, Ashley/0000-0003-3967-7994; Tome, Ricardo/0000-0003-0657-7057; Ramos, Alexandre M./0000-0003-3129-7233; Payne, Ashley/0000-0003-3967-7994; Gorodetskaya, Irina/0000-0002-2294-7823; Leung, Ruby/0000-0002-3221-9467; Nguyen, Phu/0000-0002-9055-2583; Kawzenuk, Brian/0000-0003-1194-4296; Osborne, Tashiana/0000-0003-3279-4688												1991-959X	1991-9603				JUN 20	2018	11	6					2455	2474		10.5194/gmd-11-2455-2018							WOS:000435636400004

Binarity and Accretion in AGB Stars: HST/STIS Observations of UV Flickering in Y Gem	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Binarity is believed to dramatically affect the history and geometry of mass loss in AGB and post-AGB stars, but observational evidence of binarity is sorely lacking. As part of a project to search for hot binary companions to cool AGB stars using the GALEX archive, we discovered a late-M star, Y Gem, to be a source of strong and variable UV and X-ray emission. Here we report UV spectroscopic observations of Y Gem obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope that show strong flickering in the UV continuum on timescales of less than or similar to 20 s, characteristic of an active accretion disk. Several UV lines with P-Cygni-type profiles from species such as Si IV and C IV are also observed, with emission and absorption features that are red- and blueshifted by velocities of similar to 500 km s(-1) from the systemic velocity. Our model for these (and previous) observations is that material from the primary star is gravitationally captured by a companion, producing a hot accretion disk. The latter powers a fast outflow that produces blueshifted features due to the absorption of UV continuum emitted by the disk, whereas the redshifted emission features arise in heated infalling material from the primary. The outflow velocities support a previous inference by Sahai et al. that Y Gem's companion is a low-mass main-sequence star. Blackbody fittinn of the UV continuum implies an accretion luminosity of about 13 L-circle dot, and thus a mass-accretion rate >5 x 10(-7) M-circle dot yr(-1); we infer that Roche-lobe overflow is the most likely binary accretion mode for Y Gem.

E.			1.6:1 bandwidth two-layer antireflection structure for silicon matched to the 190-310 GHz atmospheric window	APPLIED OPTICS												Although high-resistivity, low-loss silicon is an excellent material for terahertz transmission optics, its high refractive index necessitates an antireflection treatment. We fabricated a wide-bandwidth, two-layer antireflection treatment by cutting subwavelength structures into the silicon surface using multi-depth deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). A wafer with this treatment on both sides has < -20 dB (< 1%) reflectance over 187-317 GHz at a 15 degrees angle of incidence in TE polarization. We also demonstrated that bonding wafers introduce no reflection features above the -20 dB level (also in TE at 15 degrees), reproducing previous work.

Previous imaging observations of the transitional disk around MWC 758 revealed an inner cavity, a ring-like outer disk, emission clumps, and spiral arms, all possibly generated by companions. We present ALMA dust continuum observations of MWC 758 at 0.87 mm wavelength with 43 x 39 mas angular resolution (6.9 x 6.2 au) and 20 mu Jy beam(-1) rms. The central submillimeter emission cavity is revealed to be eccentric; once deprojected, its outer edge can be well fitted by an ellipse with an eccentricity of 0.1 and one focus on the star. The broad ring-like outer disk is resolved into three narrow rings with two gaps in between. The outer two rings tentatively show the same eccentricity and orientation as the innermost ring bounding the inner cavity. The two previously known dust emission clumps are resolved in both the radial and azimuthal directions, with radial widths equal to similar to 4 x the local scale height. Only one of the two spiral arms previously imaged in near-infrared (NIR) scattered light is revealed in ALMA dust emission, at a slightly larger stellocentric distance owing to projection effects. We also submit evidence of disk truncation at similar to 100 au based on comparing NIR imaging observations with models. The spirals, the north clump, and the truncated disk edge are all broadly consistent with the presence of one companion exterior to the spirals at roughly 100 au.

J	Chew, C; Reager, JT; Small, E				Chew, Clara; Reager, John T.; Small, Eric			CYGNSS data map flood inundation during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season was one of the most active and destructive on record, leading to significant flooding in many parts of the United States and the Caribbean. During flooding events such as these, there is an urgent need to quickly map in detail which areas have been severely affected, yet current satellite missions are not capable of sampling the global land surface at high enough spatio-temporal scales for flooding applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to high-resolution flood mapping by repurposing data from the new NASA mission, CYGNSS. The CYGNSS multi-satellite constellation was designed for frequent temporal sampling of the ocean surface in the tropics. We demonstrate that CYGNSS data provide clear signals of surface saturation and inundation extent over land at higher spatio-temporal resolution than radiometers like SMAP. Using a simple thresholding technique, we are able to estimate that approximately 32,580 km(2) of land area in Texas flooded during Hurricane Harvey, and approximately 7210 km(2) of land area flooded in Cuba during Hurricane Irma, or about 7% of Cuba's total area.																	2045-2322					JUN 19	2018	8								9336	10.1038/s41598-018-27673-x							WOS:000435536100012	29921941

Uranus's Northern Polar Cap in 2014	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In October and November 2014, spectra covering the 1.436 to 1.863-m wavelength range from the SINFONI Integral Field Unit Spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope showed the presence of a vast bright north polar cap on Uranus, extending northward from about 40 degrees N and at all longitudes observed. The feature, first detected in August 2014 from Keck telescope images, has a morphology very similar to the southern polar cap that was seen to fade before the 2007 equinox. At strong methane-absorbing wavelengths (for which only the high troposphere or stratosphere is sampled) the feature is not visible, indicating that it is not a stratospheric phenomenon. We show that the observed northern bright polar cap results mainly from a decrease in the tropospheric methane mixing ratio, rather than from a possible latitudinal variation of the optical properties or abundance of aerosol, implying an increase in polar downwelling near the tropopause level. Plain Language Summary In this paper we show that Uranus's northern polar cap in 2014 results from a hole-like depletion of methane rather than a formation or accumulation of aerosols as was previously thought. In this regard, our results provide key insights on the Uranus postequinox circulation as well as on the formation and nature of the different bright features observed before and after 2007 equinox in both hemispheres.

Evaluation of Radiative Transfer Models With Clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Data from hyperspectral infrared sounders are routinely ingested worldwide by the National Weather Centers. The cloud-free fraction of this data is used for initializing forecasts which include temperature, water vapor, water cloud, and ice cloud profiles on a global grid. Although the data from these sounders are sensitive to the vertical distribution of ice and liquid water in clouds, this information is not fully utilized. In the future, this information could be used for validating clouds in National Weather Center models and for initializing forecasts. We evaluate how well the calculated radiances from hyperspectral Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) compare to cloudy radiances observed by AIRS and to one another. Vertical profiles of the clouds, temperature, and water vapor from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting were used as input for the RTMs. For nonfrozen ocean day and night data, the histograms derived from the calculations by several RTMs at 900cm(-1) have a better than 0.95 correlation with the histogram derived from the AIRS observations, with a bias relative to AIRS of typically less than 2K. Differences in the cloud physics and cloud overlap assumptions result in little bias between the RTMs, but the standard deviation of the differences ranges from 6 to 12K. Results at 2,616cm(-1) at night are reasonably consistent with results at 900cm(-1). Except for RTMs which use full scattering calculations, the bias and histogram correlations at 2,616cm(-1) are inferior to those at 900cm(-1) for daytime calculations.

Thermal Emission From Saturn's Polar Cyclones	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We have used data from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer to map the temperatures in Saturn's polar cyclones at the highest spatial resolution obtained during the Cassini mission. We find temperature contrasts of 7K in the upper troposphere within 1.4 degrees of both poles, roughly 50 percent larger than earlier measurements at lower spatial resolution. The polar hot spots weaken with depth, disappearing near 500 mbar. In the stratosphere, the polar hot spot becomes broader, extending 4 degrees from the poles, and weakens with altitude disappearing near 1mbar. A thermal relaxation model shows that the tropospheric hot spot is consistent with adiabatic heating from subsidence with a vertical velocity of about -0.05mm/s above 500mbar. The observed temperature gradients imply that the winds in the polar cyclone decay with increasing altitude over roughly three pressure scale heights above the 200-mbar level. Plain Language Summary We have used data from the Composite Infrared Spectrometer to map the temperatures in Saturn's polar cyclones during the Cassini mission. The final orbits of the mission enabled the highest spatial resolution data (20km) of the mission. The analysis of this data reveals temperature contrasts of 7 degrees C (11 degrees F) in the upper troposphere within 1.4 degrees of both poles which is roughly 50% larger than measurements taken at lower spatial resolution earlier in the mission. We find that the polar hot spot temperature contrast weakens with depth in the troposphere. It was discovered that the hot spot temperature contrast in the stratosphere is broader than seen in the troposphere and weakens with increased altitude. The tropospheric temperature contrasts can be explained by slowly descending vertical winds at a rate of 0.05mm/s. We observed that the temperature gradients are consistent with rapidly decaying winds over increasing altitude at the tropopause.

Titan's Meteorology Over the Cassini Mission: Evidence for Extensive Subsurface Methane Reservoirs	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Cassini observations of Titan's weather patterns over >13years, almost half a Saturnian year, provide insight into seasonal circulation patterns and the methane cycle. The Imaging Science Subsystem and the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer documented cloud locations, characteristics, morphologies, and behavior. Clouds were generally more prevalent in the summer hemisphere, but there were surprises in locations and timing of activity: Southern clouds were common at midlatitudes, northern clouds initially appeared much sooner than model predictions, and north polar summer convective systems did not appear before the mission ended. Differences from expectations constrain atmospheric circulation models, revealing factors that best match observations, including the roles of surface and subsurface reservoirs. The preference for clouds at mid-northern latitudes rather than near the pole is consistent with models that include widespread polar near-surface methane reservoirs in addition to the lakes and seas, suggesting a broader subsurface methane table is accessible to the atmosphere. Plain Language Summary We monitored methane clouds in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan for over 13 years, using images from the Cassini spacecraft. The observations cover almost half of Titan's year, showing how weather patterns changed from late southern summer to northern summer (approximately mid-January through late June on Earth). During southern summer, extensive clouds and, on one occasion, rainfall were observed near Titan's south pole. But surprisingly, this weather pattern did not repeat at the north pole in northern summer. By comparing weather observations to atmospheric models, we can determine sources for the moisture in the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that, in addition to Titan's lakes and seas, there may also be liquid beneath the surface near both poles. This result is consistent with other evidence that suggests there may be underground connections between some of the lakes and seas. Knowing there may be more liquid below Titan's surface helps explain how methane is supplied to the atmosphere and how Titan's methane cycle works (similar to Earth's water cycle: evaporation, cloud formation, rain, and surface collection into rivers, lakes, and oceans). With the end of the Cassini mission, Earth-based telescopes will continue to watch for large clouds on Titan.

In 2017 extrapolar lower stratospheric ozone displayed a strong positive anomaly following much lower values in 2016. This points to large interannual variability rather than an ongoing downward trend, as reported recently by Ball et al. (2018, ). The observed ozone variations are well captured by the chemical transport model throughout the stratosphere and are largely driven by meteorology. Model sensitivity experiments show that the contribution of past trends in short-lived chlorine species to the ozone changes is small. Similarly, the potential impact of modest trends in natural brominated short-lived species is small. These results confirm the important role that atmospheric dynamics plays in controlling ozone in the extrapolar lower stratosphere on multiannual time scales and the continued importance of monitoring ozone profiles as the stratosphere changes. Plain Language Summary Emission of long-lived chlorine and bromine-containing ozone-depleting substances has led to the depletion of the ozone layer, most notably the Antarctic ozone hole. Policy action through the Montreal Protocol has phased out the production of the major long-lived ozone-depleting substances. Consequently, stratospheric chlorine and bromine amounts are declining, and we expect the ozone layer to slowly recover. However, although the tropical lower stratosphere is not a region where large ozone loss has so-far been observed, a recent study by Ball et al. (2018) suggested that ozone there is decreasing, in disagreement with models and expectations of ozone recovery. We use updated observations and an atmospheric model to investigate these issues. First, we use an additional year of observations which show that ozone values in the lower stratosphere increased in 2017, which is a consequence of variations in atmospheric dynamics. Second, our 3-D model performs well in reproducing the observed ozone variations. Although the model is not perfect, the comparisons suggest that we do have a good understanding of the lower stratospheric ozone. Third, we quantify the role of short-lived chlorine and bromine compounds, which are not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, on the recent ozone changes. The effect is small.

Evaluation of Triple-Frequency Radar Retrieval of Snowfall Properties Using Coincident Airborne In Situ Observations During OLYMPEX	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Scattering models of precipitation-size ice particles have shown that aggregates and spheroidal particles occupy distinct regions of the K-u-K-a-W-band dual-frequency ratio (DFR) plane. Furthermore, past ground-based observations suggest that particle bulk density and characteristic size can be retrieved from the DFR plane. This study, for the first time, evaluates airborne DFR observations with coincident airborne microphysical measurements. Over 2hr of microphysical data collected aboard the University of North Dakota Citation from the Olympic Mountains Experiment are matched with Airborne Precipitation and cloud Radar Third Generation triple-frequency radar observations. Across all flights, 31% (63%) of collocated data points show nonspheroidal (spheroidal) particle scattering characteristics. DFR observations compared with in situ observations of effective density and particle characteristic size reveal relationships that could potentially be used to develop quantitative dual- and triple-frequency DFR ice property retrievals. Plain Language Summary Currently, remote sensing retrievals of ice clouds require assumptions since particle shape and size vary greatly in the atmosphere. Additionally, particle shape and size constrain relationships of mass and fall velocity of ice within a cloud, which affect remote sensing retrievals. Modeling studies have shown that the scattering characteristics of complex ice particles (e.g., aggregates) have a distinct signature compared to spherical representations of the same particles when using three frequencies under the following conditions: (1) at least one radar with its wavelength close to the size of the particle and (2) particles have low effective densities. Thus, there is potential to retrieve information about particle shape using triple-frequency radar observations to constrain the assumptions of particle shape in the ice cloud retrieval. This paper is the first study to use airborne triple-frequency radar observations coincident with airborne in situ microphysical measurements to evaluate both the scattering signal discussed and retrievals of characteristic size and effective density. We found that 31% (63%) of the observations from the Olympic Mountains Experiment show nonspheroidal (spheroidal) scattering characteristics. Furthermore, the triple-frequency observations confirm the relationships with observed particle size and effective density outlined in a previous study supporting future use of triple-frequency missions.

Investigating the Tropospheric Chemistry of Acetic Acid Using the Global 3-D Chemistry Transport Model, STOCHEM-CRI	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is one of the most abundant carboxylic acids in the troposphere. In the study, the tropospheric chemistry of CH3COOH is investigated using the 3-D global chemistry transport model, STOCHEM-CRI. The highest mixing ratios of surface CH3COOH are found in the tropics by as much as 1.6ppb in South America. The model predicts the seasonality of CH3COOH reasonably well and correlates with some surface and flight measurement sites, but the model drastically underpredicts levels in urban and midlatitudinal regions. The possible reasons for the underprediction are discussed. The simulations show that the lifetime and global burden of CH3COOH are 1.6-1.8days and 0.45-0.61Tg, respectively. The reactions of the peroxyacetyl radical (CH3CO3) with the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) and other organic peroxy radicals (RO2) are found to be the principal sources of tropospheric CH3COOH in the model, but the model-measurement discrepancies suggest the possible unknown or underestimated sources which can contribute large fractions of the CH3COOH burden. The major sinks of CH3COOH in the troposphere are wet deposition, dry deposition, and OH loss. However, the reaction of CH3COOH with Criegee intermediates is proposed to be a potentially significant chemical loss process of tropospheric CH3COOH that has not been previously accounted for in global modeling studies. Inclusion of this loss process reduces the tropospheric CH3COOH level significantly which can give even larger discrepancies between model and measurement data, suggesting that the emissions inventory and the chemical production sources of CH3COOH are underpredicted even more so in current global models.

The SMAP mission combined active-passive soil moisture product at 9 km and 3 km spatial resolutions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on January 31st, 2015. The spacecraft was to provide high-resolution (3 km and 9 km) global soil moisture estimates at regular intervals by combining for the first time L-band radiometer and radar observations. On July 7th, 2015, a component of the SMAP radar failed and the radar ceased operation. However, before this occurred the mission was able to collect and process similar to 2.5 months of the SMAP high-resolution active-passive soil moisture data (L2SMAP) that coincided with the Northern Hemisphere's vegetation green-up and crop growth season. In this study, we evaluate the SMAP high resolution soil moisture product derived from several alternative algorithms against in situ data from core calibration and validation sites (CVS), and sparse networks. The baseline algorithm had the best comparison statistics against the CVS and sparse networks. The overall unbiased root-mean-square-difference is close to the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) the SMAP mission requirement. A 3 km spatial resolution soil moisture product was also examined. This product had an unbiased root-mean-square-difference of similar to 0.053 m(3)/m(3). The SMAP L2SMAP product for similar to 2.5 months is now validated for use in geophysical applications and research and available to the public through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The L2SMAP product is packaged with the geo-coordinates, acquisition times, and all requisite ancillary information. Although limited in duration, SMAP has clearly demonstrated the potential of using a combined L-band radar-radiometer for proving high spatial resolution and accurate global soil moisture.

Motivations of educators for participating in an authentic astronomy research experience professional development program	PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH												[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Astronomy Education Research.] The NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) partners small groups of educators with a research astronomer for a year-long authentic research project. This program aligns well with the characteristics of high-quality professional development (PD) programs and has worked with a total of 103 educators since 2005. In this paper, surveys were explored that were obtained from 74 different educators, at up to four waypoints during the course of 13 months, incorporating data from the class of 2010 through the class of 2017. This paper investigates how participating teachers describe their motivations for participating in NITARP as evidenced in these feedback forms. Analysis of self-reported data allows a mapping onto a continuum ranging from more inward focused to more outward focused; there is a shift from more inward-focused responses to more outward-focused responses. This insight into teacher motivations has implications for how the educators might be supported during their year with the program. This work provides a new way of parametrizing why educators participate in PD programs that require a considerable investment of time. NITARP, since it has many qualities of successful PD, serves as a model for similar PD programs in other STEM subjects. Likewise, the analysis method might also be useful to similarly evaluate other PD programs.

On four of the five sampling days, we observed a significant difference between morning (frozen scenario) and afternoon (thawed scenario) ground-based measurements of the soil relative permittivity. These results were supported by an in situ soil moisture and temperature network (installed at the scale of a spaceborne passive microwave pixel) which indicated surface soil temperatures fell below 0 degrees C for the same four sampling dates. Ground-based radiometers appeared to be highly sensitive to F/T conditions of the very surface of the soil and indicated normalized polarization index (NPR) values that were below the defined freezing values during the morning sampling period on all sampling dates. The Scanning L-band Active Passive (SLAP) instrumentation, flown over the study region, showed very good agreement with the ground-based radiometers, with freezing states observed on all four days that the airborne observations covered the fields with ground-based radiometers. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite had morning overpasses on three of the sampling days, and indicated frozen conditions on two of those days. It was found that > 60% of the in situ network had to indicate surface temperatures below 0 degrees C before SMAP indicated freezing conditions. This was also true of the SLAP radiometer measurements. The SMAP, SLAP and ground-based radiometer measurements all indicated freezing conditions when soil temperature sensors installed at 5 cm depth were not frozen.

In previous work, spaceborne single-pass InSAR phase-center height has been shown to have the capability of accurately monitoring the subtle height change due to forest growth and degradation (with meter or even sub-meter level RMSE about the regression curve fit to time). In this paper, a new approach using spaceborne SAR interferometry has been developed to detect and quantify selective logging events. In particular, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is first defined, namely disturbance index (DI; from 0 "no disturbance" to 1 "deforestation"). A numerical field data-based InSAR simulation is then performed to study the functional relationship between the field-measured DI and InSAR relative phase-center height change from a modeled perspective. A selective logging event (October 2015 through January 2016) over the Tapajos National Forest in Brazil is used for experimental validation. The InSAR-inverted DI estimates derived from DLR's TanDEM-X time-series data were compared with those measured from a field work over 32 quarter hectare stands at Tapajos with relative RMSE of 30% for DI up to 0.3 and the disturbance epoch can be determined with an average accuracy of 13 days (constrained by the satellite repeat interval usually on the order of 2 weeks). As a comparison, the repeat-pass InSAR coherences from the concurrent JAXA's ALOS-2 data are shown to qualitatively correspond to the TanDEM-X results, confirming both the location and the epoch of the disturbance event. This new method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring (for UN's REDD + programme) through using spaceborne single-pass InSAR missions (e.g., DLR's TanDEM-X and in the future, TanDEM-L).																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JUN 15	2018	211						167	183		10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.009							WOS:000433650700014

Anthony			Evaluating year-to-year anomalies in tropical wetland methane emissions using satellite CH4 observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Natural wetlands are the largest source of methane emissions, contributing 20-40% of global emissions and dominating the inter-annual variability. Large uncertainties remain on their variability and response to climate change. This study uses atmospheric methane observations from the GOSAT satellite to evaluate methane wetland emission estimates. We assess how well simulations reproduce the observed methane inter-annual variability by evaluating the detrended seasonal cycle. The latitudinal means agree well but maximum differences in the tropics of 28.1-34.8 ppb suggest that all simulations fail to capture the extent of the tropical wetland seasonal cycle. We focus further analysis on the major natural wetlands in South America: the seasonally flooded savannah of the Pantanal (Brazil) and Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) regions; and the riverine wetlands formed by the Parana River (Argentina). We see large discrepancies between simulation and observation over the Pantanal and Llanos de Moxos region in 2010, 2011 and 2014 and over the Parana River region in 2010 and 2014. We find highly consistent behaviour between the time and location of these methane anomalies and the change in wetland extent, driven by precipitation related to El Nino Southern Oscillation activity. We conclude that the inability of land surface models to increase wetland extent through overbank inundation is the primary cause of these observed discrepancies and can lead to under-estimation of methane fluxes by as much as 50% (5.3-11.8 Tg yr(-1)) of the observed emissions for the combined Pantanal and Parana regions. As the hydrology of these regions is heavily linked to ENSO variability, being able to reproduce changes in wetland behaviour is important for successfully predicting their methane emissions.

Here we combine satellite observations of its changing volume, flow and gravitational attraction with modelling of its surface mass balance to show that it lost 2,720 +/- 1,390 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2017, which corresponds to an increase in mean sea level of 7.6 +/- 3.9 millimetres (errors are one standard deviation). Over this period, ocean-driven melting has caused rates of ice loss from West Antarctica to increase from 53 +/- 29 billion to 159 +/- 26 billion tonnes per year; ice-shelf collapse has increased the rate of ice loss from the Antarctic Peninsula from 7 +/- 13 billion to 33 +/- 16 billion tonnes per year. We find large variations in and among model estimates of surface mass balance and glacial isostatic adjustment for East Antarctica, with its average rate of mass gain over the period 1992-2017 (5 +/- 46 billion tonnes per year) being the least certain.				van de Berg, Willem Jan/H-4385-2011; Agosta, Cecile/B-9625-2013; Rietbroek, Roelof/AAE-8820-2020; Rignot, Eric/A-4560-2014; Krinner, Gerhard/A-6450-2011; Hanna, Edward/W-5927-2019; Sorensen, Louise Sandberg/E-5282-2014; Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; Nilsson, Johan/F-1888-2019; Ahlstrom, Andreas Peter/E-5257-2014; Peltier, William R./A-1102-2008; Simonsen, Sebastian Bjerregaard/F-4791-2013; Mouginot, Jeremie/G-7045-2015; Velicogna, Isabella/R-5561-2018; Sutterley, Tyler/Q-8325-2016; Wouters, Bert/AAA-4254-2019; A, Geruo/AAP-3565-2020; Van den Broeke, Michiel/F-7867-2011; payne, antony/A-8916-2008; Felikson, Denis/M-2397-2016; Khan, Shfaqat Abbas/B-2664-2012; Harig, Christopher/B-4714-2009; Nield, Grace/I-8366-2012	van de Berg, Willem Jan/0000-0002-8232-2040; Agosta, Cecile/0000-0003-4091-1653; Rietbroek, Roelof/0000-0001-5276-5943; Rignot, Eric/0000-0002-3366-0481; Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920; Sorensen, Louise Sandberg/0000-0002-3771-4061; Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; Ahlstrom, Andreas Peter/0000-0001-8235-8070; Simonsen, Sebastian Bjerregaard/0000-0001-9569-1294; Mouginot, Jeremie/0000-0001-9155-5455; Velicogna, Isabella/0000-0002-9020-1898; Sutterley, Tyler/0000-0002-6964-1194; Wouters, Bert/0000-0002-1086-2435; A, Geruo/0000-0001-5714-402X; Van den Broeke, Michiel/0000-0003-4662-7565; payne, antony/0000-0001-8825-8425; Felikson, Denis/0000-0002-3785-5112; Slater, Thomas/0000-0003-2541-7788; van der Wal, Wouter/0000-0001-8030-9080; McMillan, Malcolm/0000-0002-5113-0177; Khan, Shfaqat Abbas/0000-0002-2689-8563; Harig, Christopher/0000-0001-7944-0591; van Wessem, Melchior/0000-0003-3221-791X; Gardner, Alex/0000-0002-8394-8889; Blazquez, Alejandro/0000-0002-7719-7468; Helm, Veit/0000-0001-7788-9328; Schlegel, Nicole-Jeanne/0000-0001-8035-448X; Loomis, Bryant/0000-0002-9370-9160; Barletta, Valentina Roberta/0000-0003-4427-0830; Langen, Peter L./0000-0003-2185-012X; Otosaka, Ines Natsuki/0000-0001-9740-3735; Whitehouse, Pippa/0000-0002-9092-3444; Scheuchl, Bernd/0000-0001-5947-7709; SCHRAMA, ERNST/0000-0002-9654-4082; Horvath, Alexander/0000-0002-9549-4845; Nield, Grace/0000-0002-3897-7904; Groh, Andreas/0000-0003-0106-5802; Mohajerani, Yara/0000-0002-4292-2367; Gunter, Brian/0000-0002-4743-6173; Vishwakarma, Bramha Dutt/0000-0003-4787-8470												0028-0836	1476-4687				JUN 14	2018	558	7709					219	+		10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y							WOS:000435071400041	29899482

Experimental analysis and thermodynamic calculations of an additively manufactured functionally graded material of V to Invar 36	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH												Functionally graded materials (FGMs) in which the elemental composition intentionally varies with position can be fabricated using directed energy deposition additive manufacturing (AM). This work examines an FGM that is linearly graded from V to Invar 36 (64 wt% Fe, 36 wt% Ni). This FGM cracked during fabrication, indicating the formation of detrimental phases. The microstructure, composition, phases, and microhardness of the gradient zone were analyzed experimentally. The phase composition as a function of chemistry was predicted through thermodynamic calculations. It was determined that a significant amount of the intermetallic sigma-FeV phase formed within the gradient zone. When the sigma phase constituted the majority phase, catastrophic cracking occurred. The approach presented illustrates the suitability of using equilibrium thermodynamic calculations for the prediction of phase formation in FGMs made by AM despite the nonequilibrium conditions in AM, providing a route for the computationally informed design of FGMs.				Liu, Zi-Kui/A-8626-2012; Liu, Zi-Kui/A-8196-2009	Liu, Zi-Kui/0000-0003-3346-3696; Bocklund, Brandon/0000-0002-3264-8413; Shapiro, Andrew/0000-0002-2650-8107												0884-2914	2044-5326				JUN 13	2018	33	11					1642	1649		10.1557/jmr.2018.92							WOS:000439560800013

Along European Coastal Lagoons From Genetic Imprint and Simulated Dispersal Trajectories	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Coastal salt- and brackish water lagoons are unique shallow habitats characterized by beds of submerged seagrasses and salt-tolerant Ruppia species. Established long-term and large-scale patterns of connectivity in lagoon systems can be strongly determined by patterns of nearshore and coastal currents next to local bird-mediated seed dispersal. Despite the importance of dispersal in landscape ecology, characterizing patterns of connectivity remains challenging in aquatic systems. Here, we aimed at inferring connectivity distances of Ruppia cirrhosa along European coastal lagoons using a population genetic imprint and modeled dispersal trajectories using an eddy-resolving numerical ocean model that includes tidal forcing. We investigated 1,303 individuals of 46 populations alongside subbasins of the Mediterranean (Balearic, Tyrrhenian, Ionian) and the Atlantic to Baltic Sea coastline over maximum distances of 563-2,684 km. Ten microsatellite loci under an autotetraploid condition revealed a mixed sexual and vegetative reproduction mode. A pairwise F-ST permutation test of populations revealed high levels of historical connectivity only for distance classes up to 104-280 km. Since full range analysis was not fully explanatory, we assessed connectivity in more detail at coastline and subbasin level using four approaches. Firstly, a regression over restricted geographical distances (300 km) was done though remained comparable to full range analysis. Secondly, piecewise linear regression analyses yielded much better explained variance but the obtained breakpoints were shifted toward greater geographical distances due to a flat slope of regression lines that most likely reflect genetic drift. Thirdly, classification and regression tree analyses revealed threshold values of 47-179 km. Finally, simulated ocean surface dispersal trajectories for propagules with floating periods of 1-4 weeks, were congruent with inferred distances, a spatial Bayesian admixed gene pool clustering and a barrier detection method. A kinship based spatial autocorrelation showed a contemporary within-lagoon connectivity up to 20 km. Our findings indicate that strong differentiation or admixtures shaped historical connectivity and that a pre- and post LGM genetic imprint of R. cirrhosa along the European coasts was maintained from their occurrence in primary habitats. Additionally, this study demonstrates the importance of unraveling thresholds of genetic breaks in combination with ocean dispersal modeling to infer patterns of connectivity.

Spitzer Team; OGLE Collaboration; KMTNet Collaboration	OGLE-2017-BLG-1130: The First Binary Gravitational Microlens Detected from Spitzer Only	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We analyze the binary gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-1130 (mass ratio q similar to 0.45), the first published case in which the binary anomaly was detected only by the Spitzer Space Telescope. This event provides strong evidence that some binary signals can be missed by observations from the ground alone but detected by Spitzer. We therefore invert the normal procedure, first finding the lens parameters by fitting the space-based data and then measuring the microlensing parallax using ground-based observations. We also show that the normal four-fold space-based degeneracy in the single-lens case can become a weak eight-fold degeneracy in binary-lens events. Although this degeneracy is resolved in event OGLE-2017-BLG-1130, it might persist in other events.

Signatures of Young Planets in the Continuum Emission from Protostellar Disks	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Many protostellar disks show central cavities, rings, or spiral arms likely caused by low-mass stellar or planetary companions, yet few such features are conclusively tied to bodies embedded in the disks. We note that even small features on the disk surface cast shadows, because the starlight grazes the surface. We therefore focus on accurately computing the disk thickness, which depends on its temperature. We present models with temperatures set by the balance between starlight heating and radiative cooling, which are also in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The planet has 20, 100, or 1000 M-circle plus, ranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a deep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the appearance of the model disk. The outer walls of the planet-carved gap puff up under starlight heating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in scattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by another more distant planet. The surface brightness contrast between outer wall and shadow for the 1000 M-circle plus planet is an order of magnitude greater than a model neglecting the temperature disturbances. The shadow is so deep that it largely hides the planet-launched outer arm of the spiral wave. Temperature gradients are such that outer low-mass planets undergoing orbital migration will converge within the shadow. Furthermore, the temperature perturbations affect the shape, size, and contrast of features at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths. Thus radiative heating and cooling are key to the appearance of protostellar disks with embedded planets.

N.; Kaki, Dahlia; Chave, Jerome			Canopy area of large trees explains aboveground biomass variations across neotropical forest landscapes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Large tropical trees store significant amounts of carbon in woody components and their distribution plays an important role in forest carbon stocks and dynamics. Here, we explore the properties of a new lidar-derived index, the large tree canopy area (LCA) defined as the area occupied by canopy above a reference height. We hypothesize that this simple measure of forest structure representing the crown area of large canopy trees could consistently explain the landscape variations in forest volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) across a range of climate and edaphic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a unique dataset of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and ground inventory data in nine undisturbed old-growth Neotropical forests, of which four had plots large enough (1 ha) to calibrate our model. We found that the LCA for trees greater than 27 m (similar to 25-30 m) in height and at least 100 m(2) crown size in a unit area (1 ha), explains more than 75% of total forest volume variations, irrespective of the forest biogeographic conditions. When weighted by average wood density of the stand, LCA can be used as an unbiased estimator of AGB across sites (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 46.02 Mg ha(-1), bias = -0.63 Mg ha(-1)). Unlike other lidar-derived metrics with complex nonlinear relations to biomass, the relationship between LCA and AGB is linear and remains unique across forest types. A comparison with tree inventories across the study sites indicates that LCA correlates best with the crown area (or basal area) of trees with diameter greater than 50 cm. The spatial invariance of the LCA-AGB relationship across the Neotropics suggests a remarkable regularity of forest structure across the landscape and a new technique for systematic monitoring of large trees for their contribution to AGB and changes associated with selective logging, tree mortality and other types of tropical forest disturbance and dynamics.

Background levels of methane in Mars' atmosphere show strong seasonal variations	SCIENCE												Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 +/- 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (similar to 7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.

Eight CYGNSS satellites were launched into low Earth orbit on December 15, 2016. Each satellite carries a science radar receiver which measures GPS signals reflected from the Earth surface. The signals contain information about the surface, including wind speed over ocean, and soil moisture and flooding over land. The satellites are distributed around their orbit plane so that measurements can be made more often to capture extreme weather events. Innovative engineering approaches are used to reduce per satellite cost, increase the number in the constellation, and improve temporal sampling. These include the use of differential drag rather than propulsion to adjust the spacing between satellites and the use of existing GPS signals as the science radars' transmitter. Initial on-orbit results demonstrate the scientific utility of the CYGNSS observations, and suggest that a new paradigm in spaceborne Earth environmental monitoring is possible.

Bacillus safensis FO-36b and Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032: a whole genome comparison of two spacecraft assembly facility isolates	BMC MICROBIOLOGY												Background: Bacillus strains producing highly resistant spores have been isolated from cleanrooms and space craft assembly facilities. Organisms that can survive such conditions merit planetary protection concern and if that resistance can be transferred to other organisms, a health concern too. To further efforts to understand these resistances, the complete genome of Bacillus safensis strain FO-36b, which produces spores resistant to peroxide and radiation was determined. The genome was compared to the complete genome of B. pumilus SAFR-032, and the draft genomes of B. safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2 and the type strain B. pumilus ATCC7061(T). Additional comparisons were made to 61 draft genomes that have been mostly identified as strains of B. pumilus or B. safensis. Results: The FO-36b gene order is essentially the same as that in SAFR-032 and other B. pumilus strains. The annotated genome has 3850 open reading frames and 40 noncoding RNAs and riboswitches. Of these, 307 are not shared by SAFR-032, and 65 are also not shared by MERTA and ATCC7061(T). The FO-36b genome has ten unique open reading frames and two phage-like regions, homologous to the Bacillus bacteriophage SPP1 and Brevibacillus phage Jimmer1. Differing remnants of the Jimmer1 phage are found in essentially all B. safensis / B. pumilus strains. Seven unique genes are part of these phage elements. Whole Genome Phylogenetic Analysis of the B. pumilus, B. safensis and other Firmicutes genomes, separate them into three distinct clusters. Two clusters are subgroups of B. pumilus while one houses all the B. safensis strains. The Genome-genome distance analysis and a phylogenetic analysis of gyrA sequences corroborated these results. Conclusions: It is not immediately obvious that the presence or absence of any specific gene or combination of genes is responsible for the variations in resistance seen. It is quite possible that distinctions in gene regulation can alter the expression levels of key proteins thereby changing the organism's resistance properties without gain or loss of a particular gene. What is clear is that phage elements contribute significantly to genome variability. Multiple genome comparison indicates that many strains named as B. pumilus likely belong to the B. safensis group.

In particular, we focus on the impact of ENSO on the onset of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) anticyclone. Using the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), we define climatologies (composites) of atmospheric circulation and composition in the months following El Nino and La Nina (boreal) winters and investigate how ENSO-related flow anomalies propagate into spring and summer. To quantify differences in the divergent and non-divergent parts of the flow, the velocity potential (VP) and the stream function (SF) are respectively calculated from the ERA-Interim reanalysis in the vicinity of the tropical tropopause at potential temperature level theta = 380 K. While VP quantifies the well-known ENSO anomalies of the Walker circulation, SF can be used to study the impact of ENSO on the formation of the ASM anticyclone, which turns out to be slightly weaker after El Nino winters than after La Nina winters. In addition, strato-spheric intrusions around the eastern flank of the anticyclone into the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) are weaker in the months after strong El Nino events due to more zonally symmetric subtropical jets than after La Nina winters. By using satellite (MLS) and in situ (SHADOZ) observations and model simulations (CLaMS) of ozone, we discuss ENSO-induced differences around the tropical tropopause. Ozone composites show more zonally symmetric features with less in-mixed ozone from the stratosphere into the TTL during and after strong El Nino events and even during the formation of the ASM anticyclone. These isentropic anomalies are overlaid with the well-known anomalies of the faster (slower) Hadley and Brewer-Dobson circulations after El Nino (La Nina) winter. The duration and intensity of El Nino-related anomalies may be reinforced through late summer and autumn if the El Nino conditions last until the following winter.

Distinct Microbial Assemblage Structure and Archaeal Diversity in Sediments of Arctic Thermokarst Lakes Differing in Methane Sources	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Developing a microbial ecological understanding of Arctic thermokarst lake sediments in a geochemical context is an essential first step toward comprehending the contributions of these systems to greenhouse gas emissions, and understanding how they may shift as a result of long term changes in climate. In light of this, we set out to study microbial diversity and structure in sediments from four shallow thermokarst lakes in the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Sediments from one of these lakes (Sukok) emit methane (CH4) of thermogenic origin, as expected for an area with natural gas reserves. However, sediments from a lake 10 km to the North West (Siqlukaq) produce CH4 of biogenic origin. Sukok and Siqlukaq were chosen among the four lakes surveyed to test the hypothesis that active CH4-producing organisms (methanogens) would reflect the distribution of CH4 gas levels in the sediments. We first examined the structure of the little known microbial community inhabiting the thaw bulb of arctic thermokarst lakes near Barrow, AK. Molecular approaches (PCR-DGGE and iTag sequencing) targeting the SSU rRNA gene and rRNA molecule were used to profile diversity, assemblage structure, and identify potentially active members of the microbial assemblages. Overall, the potentially active (rRNA dominant) fraction included taxa that have also been detected in other permafrost environments (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and others). In addition, Siqlukaq sediments were unique compared to the other sites, in that they harbored CH4-cycling organisms (i.e., methanogenic Archaea and methanotrophic Bacteria), as well as bacteria potentially involved in N cycling (e.g., Nitrospirae) whereas Sukok sediments were dominated by taxa typically involved in photosynthesis and biogeochemical sulfur (S) transformations. This study revealed a high degree of archaeal phylogenetic diversity in addition to CH4-producing archaea, which spanned nearly the phylogenetic extent of currently recognized Archaea phyla (e.g., Euryarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Woesearchaeota, Pacearchaeota, and others). Together these results shed light on expansive bacterial and archaeal diversity in Arctic thermokarst lakes and suggest important differences in biogeochemical potential in contrasting Arctic thermokarst lake sediment ecosystems.

Jovian lightning is thought to be generated in the mixed-phase (liquid-ice) region of convective water clouds through a charge-separation process between condensed liquid water and water-ice particles, similar to that of terrestrial (cloud-to-cloud) lightning(7-9). Unlike terrestrial lightning, which emits broadly over the radio spectrum up to gigahertz frequencies(10,11),lightning on Jupiter has been detected only at kilohertz frequencies, despite a search for signals in the megahertz range(12). Strong ionospheric attenuation or a lightning discharge much slower than that on Earth have been suggested as possible explanations for this discrepancy(13,14). Here we report observations of Jovian lightning sferics (broadband electromagnetic impulses) at 600 megahertz from the Microwave Radiometer(15) onboard the Juno spacecraft. These detections imply that Jovian lightning discharges are not distinct from terrestrial lightning, as previously thought. In the first eight orbits of Juno, we detected 377 lightning sferics from pole to pole. We found lightning to be prevalent in the polar regions, absent near the equator, and most frequent in the northern hemisphere, at latitudes higher than 40 degrees north. Because the distribution of lightning is a proxy for moist convective activity, which is thought to be an important source of outward energy transport from the interior of the planet(16,17,) increased convection towards the poles could indicate an outward internal heat flux that is preferentially weighted towards the poles(9,16,18). The distribution of moist convection is important for understanding the composition, general circulation and energy transport on Jupiter.

We have investigated the absorption enhancement of mixed-type aerosols over East Asia by using the Aerosol Robotic Network observations and radiative transfer model calculations. The mixed-type aerosols exhibit significantly enhanced absorbing ability than the corresponding unmixed dust and anthropogenic aerosols, as revealed in the spectral behavior of absorbing aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, and imaginary refractive index. The aerosol radiative efficiencies for the dust, mixed-type, and anthropogenic aerosols are -101.0, -112.9, and -98.3 Wm(-2) tau(-1) at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA); -42.3, -22.5, and -39.8 Wm(-2) tau(-1) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA); and 58.7, 90.3, and 58.5 Wm(-2) tau(-1) in the atmosphere (ATM), respectively. The BOA cooling and ATM heating efficiencies of the mixed-type aerosols are significantly higher than those of the unmixed aerosol types over the East Asia region, resulting in atmospheric stabilization. In addition, the mixed-type aerosols correspond to a lower TOA cooling efficiency, indicating that the cooling effect by the corresponding individual aerosol components is partially counteracted. We conclude that the interaction between dust and anthropogenic pollution not only represents a viable aerosol formation pathway but also results in unfavorable dispersion conditions, both exacerbating the regional air pollution in East Asia. Our results highlight the necessity to accurately account for the mixing state of aerosols in atmospheric models over East Asia in order to better understand the formation mechanism for regional air pollution and to assess its impacts on human health, weather, and climate.

The Ladder of Life Detection	ASTROBIOLOGY												We describe the history and features of the Ladder of Life Detection, a tool intended to guide the design of investigations to detect microbial life within the practical constraints of robotic space missions. To build the Ladder, we have drawn from lessons learned from previous attempts at detecting life and derived criteria for a measurement (or suite of measurements) to constitute convincing evidence for indigenous life. We summarize features of life as we know it, how specific they are to life, and how they can be measured, and sort these features in a general sense based on their likelihood of indicating life. Because indigenous life is the hypothesis of last resort in interpreting life-detection measurements, we propose a small but expandable set of decision rules determining whether the abiotic hypothesis is disproved. In light of these rules, we evaluate past and upcoming attempts at life detection. The Ladder of Life Detection is not intended to endorse specific biosignatures or instruments for life-detection measurements, and is by no means a definitive, final product. It is intended as a starting point to stimulate discussion, debate, and further research on the characteristics of life, what constitutes a biosignature, and the means to measure them.

Crystal chemistry of martian minerals from Bradbury Landing through Naukluft Plateau, Gale crater, Mars	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Crystal chemical algorithms were used to estimate the chemical composition of selected mineral phases observed with the CheMin X-ray diffractometer onboard the NASA Curiosity rover in Gale crater, Mars. The sampled materials include two wind-blown soils, Rocknest and Gobabeb, six mudstones in the Yellowknife Bay formation (John Klein and Cumberland) and the Murray formation (Confidence Hills, Mojave2, and Telegraph Peak), as well as five sandstones, Windjana and the samples of the unaltered Stimson formation (Big Sky and Okoruso) and the altered Stimson formation (Greenhorn and Lubango). The major mineral phases observed with the CheMin instrument in the Gale crater include plagioclase, sanidine,P2(1)/c and C2/c clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, spine], and alunite-jarosite group minerals. The plagioclase analyzed with CheMin has an overall estimated average of An(40(11)) with a range of An(30(2)) to An(63(6)). The soil samples, Rocknest and Gobabeb, have an average of An(56(8)) while the Murray, Yellowknife Bay, unaltered Stimson, and altered Stimson formations have averages of An(38(2)), An(37(5)), An(45(7)), and An(35(6)), respectively. Alkali feldspar, specifically sanidine, average composition is Or(74(17)) with fully disordered Al/Si. Sanidine is most abundant in the Windjana sample (similar to 26 wt% of the crystalline material) and is fully disordered with a composition of Or(87(5)). The P2(1)/c clinopyroxene pigeonite observed in Gale crater has a broad compositional range {[Mg0.95(2)-1.54(17)Fe0.18(17)-1.03(9)Ca0.00-0.28(6)](Sigma 2)Si2O6} with an overall average of Mg1.18(19)Fe0.72(7)Ca0.10(9)Si2O6. The soils have the lowest Mg and highest Fe compositions [Mg0.95(5)Fe1.02(7)Ca0.03(4)Si2O6] of all of the Gale samples. Of the remaining samples, those of the Stimson formation exhibit the highest Mg and lowest Fe [average = Mg1.45(7)Fe0.35(13)Ca0.19(6)Si2O6]. Augite, C2/c clinopyroxene, is detected in just three samples, the soil samples [average = Mg0.92(5)Ca0.72(2)Fe0.36(5)Si2O6] and Windjana (Mg1.03(7)Ca0.75(4)Fe0.21(9)Si2O6). Orthopyroxene was not detected in the soil samples and has an overall average composition of Mg0.79(6)Fe1.20(6)Ca0.21(9)Si2O6 and a range of [Mg0.69(7)-0.86(20)Fe1.14(20)-1.31(7)Ca0.00-4.04(4)](Sigma 2)Si2O6, with Big Sky exhibiting the lowest Mg content [Mg0.69(7)Fe1.31(7)Si2O6] and Okoruso exhibiting the highest [Mg0.86(20)Fe1.14(20)Si2O6]. Appreciable olivine was observed in only three of the Gale crater samples, the soils and Windjana. Assuming no Mn or Ca, the olivine has an average composition of Mg1.19(12)Fe0.81(12)SiO4 with a range of 1.08(3) to 1.45(7) Mg apfu. The soil samples [average = Mg1.11(4)Fe0.89SiO4] are significantly less magnesian than Windjana [Mg1.35(7)Fe0.65(7)SiO4]. We assume magnetite (Fe3O4) is cation-deficient (Fe3-x square xO4) in Gale crater samples [average = Fe-2.83(5)square O-0.1(4)4; range 2.75(5) to 2.90(5) Fe apfu], but we also report other plausible cation substitutions such as Al, Mg, and Cr that would yield equivalent unit-cell parameters. Assuming cation-deficient magnetite, the Murray formation [average = Fe-2.77(2)square O-0.23(4)] is noticeably more cation-deficient than the other Gale samples analyzed by CheMin. Note that despite the presence of Ti-rich magnetite in martian meteorites, the unit-cell parameters of Gale magnetite do not permit significant Ti substitution. Abundant jarosite is found in only one sample, Mojave2; its estimated composition is (K0.51(12)Na0.49)(Fe2.68(7)Al0.32)(SO4)(2)(OH)(6). In addition to providing composition and abundances of the crystalline phases, we calculate the lower limit of the abundance of X-ray amorphous material and the composition thereof for each of the samples analyzed with CheMin. Each of the CheMin samples had a significant proportion of amorphous SiO2, except Windjana that has 3.6 wt% SiO2. Excluding Windjana, the amorphous materials have an SiO2 range of 24.1 to 75.9 wt% and an average of 47.6 wt%. Windjana has the highest FeOT (total Fe content calculated as FeO) at 43.1 wt%, but most of the CheMin samples also contain appreciable Fe, with an average of 16.8 wt%. With the exception of the altered Stimson formation samples, Greenhorn and Lubango, the majority of the observed SO3 is concentrated in the amorphous component (average = 11.6 wt%). Furthermore, we provide average amorphous-component compositions for the soils and the Mount Sharp group formations, as well as the limiting element for each CheMin sample.																	0003-004X	1945-3027				JUN	2018	103	6					857	871		10.2138/am-2018-6124							WOS:000435340700004

Calibration and validation of Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) polarization measurements	APPLIED OPTICS												The Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), a precursor to the future Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols satellite instrument, is a remote-sensing instrument for the characterization of atmospheric aerosols and clouds. To help discriminate between different aerosol particle types, which is crucial to improve our understanding of their impact on climate and air quality, AirMSPI acquires imagery over multiple view angles in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared, and it employs dual photoelastic modulators (PEMs) to target an uncertainty requirement of +/- 0.005 in the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) at selected wavelengths. Laboratory polarimetric calibrations using a second-generation Polarization State Generator-2 (PSG-2) and validation measurements at 0 < DoLP < 1 demonstrate a systematic uncertainty of < 0.002. In-flight calibrations of the temperature sensitivity of the PEMs, which could otherwise introduce DoLP errors up to 0.02, are extracted from onboard "validator" measurements as well as from the AirMSPI imagery of the Earth. After this in-flight calibration, the stability of measurements of the validator's DoLP throughout the POlarimeter Definition EXperiment and Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys field campaigns is +/- 0.001. Comparisons of DoLP data from these campaigns with the Research Scanning Polarimeter show root-mean-square differences ranging between 0.003 and 0.006, while the regression slopes deviate from unity by currently unexplained values up to 0.024. The observed differences are the result of measurement errors in both instruments, as well as imperfections in the intercomparison. A complete polarimetric uncertainty model for AirMSPI is presented, including the effects of absolute calibration uncertainty, in-flight modulation uncertainty, and random noise.

We report new and re-reduced spectrophotometry of HR 8799 c, d, and e in the H and K bands. We discuss a strategy for choosing optimal KLIP PSF subtraction parameters by injecting simulated sources and recovering them over a range of parameters. The K1/K2 spectra for HR 8799 c and d are similar to previously published results from the same data set. We also present a K-band spectrum of HR 8799 e for the first time and show that our H-band spectra agree well with previously published spectra from the VLT/SPHERE instrument. We show that HR 8799 c and d show significant differences in their H and K spectra, but do not find any conclusive differences between d and e, nor between c and e, likely due to large error bars in the recovered spectrum of e. Compared to M-, L-, and T-type field brown dwarfs, all three planets are most consistent with mid- and late-L spectral types. All objects are consistent with low gravity, but a lack of standard spectra for low gravity limit the ability to fit the best spectral type. We discuss how dedicated modeling efforts can better fit HR 8799 planets' near-IR flux, as well as how differences between the properties of these planets can be further explored.

Spitzer Team; OGLE Collaboration; KMTNet Collaboration	Spitzer Opens New Path to Break Classic Degeneracy for Jupiter-mass Microlensing Planet OGLE-2017-BLG-1140Lb	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL												We analyze the combined Spitzer and ground-based data for OGLE-2017-BLG-1140 and show that the event was generated by a Jupiter-class (m(p) similar or equal to 1.6 M-Jup) planet orbiting a mid-late M dwarf (M similar or equal to 0.2 M-circle dot) that lies DLS similar or equal to 1.0 kpc in the foreground of the microlensed Galactic-bar source star. The planet-host projected separation is a(perpendicular to) similar or equal to 1.0 au, i.e., well beyond the snow line. By measuring the source proper motion mu(s) from ongoing long-term OGLE imaging and combining this with the lens-source relative proper motion mu(rel) derived from the microlensing solution, we show that the lens proper motion mu(l) = mu(rel) + mu(s) consistent with the lens lying in the Galactic disk, although a bulge lens is not ruled out. We show that while the Spitzer and ground-based data are comparably well fitted by planetary (i.e., binary-lens (2L1S)) and binary-source (1L2S) models, the combination of Spitzer and ground-based data decisively favors the planetary model. This is a new channel to resolve the 2L1S/1L2S degeneracy, which can be difficult to break in some cases.

OGLE Collaboration; KMTNET Collaboration; Spitzer Team; MiNDSTEp Collaboration	OGLE-2017-BLG-0329L: A Microlensing Binary Characterized with Dramatically Enhanced Precision Using Data from Space-based Observations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Mass measurements of gravitational microlenses require one to determine the microlens parallax pE, but precise pE measurement, in many cases, is hampered due to the subtlety of the microlens-parallax signal combined with the difficulty of distinguishing the signal from those induced by other higher-order effects. In this work, we present the analysis of the binary-lens event OGLE-2017-BLG-0329, for which pi(E) is measured with a dramatically improved precision using additional data from space-based Spitzer observations. We find that while the parallax model based on the ground-based data cannot be distinguished from a zero-pi(E) model at the 2 sigma level, the addition of the Spitzer data enables us to identify two classes of solutions, each composed of a pair of solutions according to the well-known ecliptic degeneracy. It is found that the space-based data reduce the measurement uncertainties of the north and east components of the microlens-parallax vector pE by factors similar to 18 and similar to 4, respectively. With the measured microlens parallax combined with the angular Einstein radius measured from the resolved caustic crossings, we find that the lens is composed of a binary with component masses of either (M-1, M-2) similar to (1.1, 0.8) M-circle dot or similar to(0.4, 0.3) M-circle dot according to the two solution classes. The first solution is significantly favored but the second cannot be securely ruled out based on the microlensing data alone.

A Holistic Perspective on the Dynamics of G035.39-00.33: The Interplay between Gas and Magnetic Fields	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Magnetic field plays a crucial role in shaping molecular clouds and regulating star formation, yet the complete information on the magnetic field is not well constrained owing to the limitations in observations. We study the magnetic field in the massive infrared dark cloud G035.39-00.33 from dust continuum polarization observations at 850 mu m with SCUBA-2/POL-2 at JCMT for the first time. The magnetic field tends to be perpendicular to the densest part of the main filament (F-M), whereas it has a less defined relative orientation in the rest of the structure, where it tends to be parallel to some diffuse regions. A mean plane-of-the-sky magnetic field strength of similar to 50 mu G for F-M is obtained using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. Based on (CO)-C-13 (1-0) line observations, we suggest a formation scenario of F-M due to large-scale (similar to 10 pc) cloud-cloud collision. Using additional NH3 line data, we estimate that F-M will be gravitationally unstable if it is only supported by thermal pressure and turbulence. The northern part of F-M, however, can be stabilized by a modest additional support from the local magnetic field. The middle and southern parts of F-M are likely unstable even if the magnetic field support is taken into account. We claim that the clumps in F-M may be supported by turbulence and magnetic fields against gravitational collapse. Finally, we identified for the first time a massive (similar to 200 M-circle dot, collapsing starless clump candidate, "c8," in G035.39-00.33. The magnetic field surrounding "c8" is likely pinched, hinting at an accretion flow along the filament.

Using the (CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-18 J = 1-0 lines and 850 mu m continuum observations, we investigated cloud fragmentation and evolution associated with star formation. We extracted 468 clumps and 117 cores from the (CO)-C-13 line and 850 mu m continuum maps, respectively. We made use of the Bayesian distance calculator and derived the distances of all 64 PGCCs. We found that in general, the mass-size plane follows a relation of m similar to r(1.67). At a given scale, the masses of our objects are around 1/10 of that of typical Galactic massive star-forming regions. Analysis of the clump and core masses, virial parameters, densities, and mass-size relation suggests that the PGCCs in our sample have a low core formation efficiency (similar to 3.0%), and most PGCCs are likely low-mass star-forming candidates. Statistical study indicates that the 850 mu m cores are more turbulent, more optically thick, and denser than the (CO)-C-13 clumps for star formation candidates, suggesting that the 850 mu m cores are likely more appropriate future star formation candidates than the (CO)-C-13 clumps.

It is possible to infer atmospheric HCHO concentrations using space-based observations, which may be useful for studying emissions and tropospheric chemistry at urban to global scales depending on the quality of the retrievals. In the near future, an unprecedented volume of satellite-based HCHO measurement data will be available from both geostationary and polar-orbiting platforms. Therefore, it is essential to develop retrieval methods appropriate for the next-generation satellites that measure at higher spatial and temporal resolution than the current ones. In this study, we examine the importance of fine spatial and temporal resolution a priori profile information on the retrieval by conducting approximately 45 000 radiative transfer (RT) model calculations in the Los Angeles Basin (LA Basin) megacity. Our analyses suggest that an air mass factor (AMF, a factor converting observed slant columns to vertical columns) based on fine spatial and temporal resolution a priori profiles can better capture the spatial distributions of the enhanced HCHO plumes in an urban area than the nearly constant AMFs used for current operational products by increasing the columns by similar to 50% in the domain average and up to 100% at a finer scale. For this urban area, the AMF values are inversely proportional to the magnitude of the HCHO mixing ratios in the boundary layer. Using our optimized model HCHO results in the Los Angeles Basin that mimic the HCHO retrievals from future geostationary satellites, we illustrate the effectiveness of HCHO data from geostationary measurements for understanding and predicting tropospheric ozone and its precursors.

The intermetallic phases with homogeneity ranges, La3-x,Te-4 and LaTe2-x, are modeled using a two-sublattice (La,Va)(3)(Te)(4) model and a three-sub lattice (La)(1)(Te)(1)(Te,Va)(1) model based on their structure features, respectively. The intermetallic phases, LaTe and LaTe3, are treated as stoichiometric compounds. The thermodynamic properties of the intermetallic compounds and their corresponding end members at finite temperatures are predicted using first-principles quasi harmonic approach. The associate solution model is used to describe the short-range ordering behavior of the liquid phase. The calculated phase diagram agrees well with the available phase equilibrium data in the literature.

Desiccation cracks provide evidence of lake drying on Mars, Sutton Island member, Murray formation, Gale Crater	GEOLOGY												Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover data are used to describe the morphology of desiccation cracks observed in ancient lacustrine strata at Gale crater, Mars, and to interpret their paleoenvironmental setting. The desiccation cracks indicate subaerial exposure of lacustrine facies in the Sutton Island member of the Murray formation. In association with ripple cross-stratification and possible eolian cross-bedding, these facies indicate a transition from longer-lived perennial lakes recorded by older strata to younger lakes characterized by intermittent exposure. The transition from perennial to episodically exposed lacustrine environments provides evidence for local to regional climate change that can help constrain Mars climate models.

Simultaneous In Situ Analysis of Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Ratios in Organic Matter by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry	GEOSTANDARDS AND GEOANALYTICAL RESEARCH												An insitu measurement method for simultaneous determination of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in organic matter was developed by secondary ion mass spectrometry with a spatial resolution of similar to 12m. Secondary ion intensities of C-12(2)-, (CC-)-C-12-C-13, (CN-)-C-12-N-14 and (CN-)-C-12-N-15 were simultaneously measured by three Faraday cups and one electron multiplier. Ions of (C2H-)-C-12 were measured to monitor hydride interferences and to correct for mass bias. The analytical precisions of C-13 and N-15 values of a reference material (UWLA-1 anthracite) were 0.16 parts per thousand and 0.56 parts per thousand, respectively (2s). A negative correlation was observed between the mass bias of carbon and (C2H-)-C-12/C-12(2)- ratios of examined reference materials. In contrast, there was no correlation between mass bias and hydrogen concentration for nitrogen. The C-13(VPDB) and N-15(Air) values of twenty-two individual globules of organic matter, found in carbonate rock of the 1878Ma Gunflint Formation, were determined by the new procedure, ranging from -33.8 parts per thousand to -33.3 parts per thousand and +4.2 parts per thousand to 5.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Means of C-13(VPDB) and N-15(Air) values, -33.5 +/- 0.25 parts per thousand and +5.2 +/- 0.81 parts per thousand, are consistent with reported values from bulk sample analysis within analytical precision.

Photochemistry, mixing and transport in Jupiter's stratosphere constrained by Cassini	ICARUS												In this work, we aim at constraining the diffusive and advective transport processes in Jupiter's stratosphere, using Cassini/CIRS observations published by Nixon et al. (2007,2010). The Cassini-Huygens flyby of Jupiter on December 2000 provided the highest spatially resolved IR observations of Jupiter so far, with the CIRS instrument. The IR spectrum contains the fingerprints of several atmospheric constituents and allows probing the tropospheric and stratospheric composition. In particular, the abundances of C2H2 and C2H6, the main compounds produced by methane photochemistry, can be retrieved as a function of latitude in the pressure range at which CIRS is sensitive to. CIRS observations suggest a very different meridional distribution for these two species. This is difficult to reconcile with their photochemical histories, which are thought to be tightly coupled to the methane photolysis. While the overall abundance of C2H2 decreases with latitude, C2H6 becomes more abundant at high latitudes. In this work, a new 2D (latitude-altitude) seasonal photochemical model of Jupiter is developed. The model is used to investigate whether the addition of stratospheric transport processes, such as meridional diffusion and advection, are able to explain the latitudinal behavior of C2H2 and C2H6. We find that the C2H2 observations are fairly well reproduced without meridional diffusion. Adding meridional diffusion to the model provides an improved agreement with the C2H6 observations by flattening its meridional distribution, at the cost of a degradation of the fit to the C2H2 distribution. However, meridional diffusion alone cannot produce the observed increase with latitude of the C2H6 abundance. When adding 2D advective transport between roughly 30 mbar and 0.01 mbar, with upwelling winds at the equator and downwelling winds at high latitudes, we can, for the first time, reproduce the C2H6 abundance increase with latitude. In parallel, the fit to the C2H2 distribution is degraded. The strength of the advective winds needed to reproduce the C2H6 abundances is particularly sensitive to the value of the meridional eddy diffusion coefficient. The coupled fate of these methane photolysis by-products suggests that an additional process is missing in the model. Ion-neutral chemistry was not accounted for in this work and might be a good candidate to solve this issue. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We base this interpretation on the similarity in the periods of the eddies and their seasonal variations with those observed in northern midlatitudes by Viking Lander 2 (VL-2) 18 Mars years earlier. Further support for this interpretation comes from global circulation modeling which shows similar behavior in the transient eddies at the grid points closest to Curiosity and VL-2. These observations provide the first in situ evidence that the frontal systems often associated with "Flushing Dust Storms" do cross the equator and extend into the Southern Hemisphere.

Each ChemCam passive sky observation acquires spectra at two different elevation angles. We fit these spectra with a discrete-ordinates multiple scattering radiative transfer model, using the correlated-k approximation for gas absorption bands. The retrieval proceeds by first fitting the continuum of the ratio of the two elevation angles to solve for aerosol properties, and then fitting the continuum-removed ratio to solve for gas abundances. The final step of the retrieval makes use of the observed CO2 absorptions and the known CO2 abundance to correct the retrieved water vapor abundance for the effects of the vertical distribution of scattering aerosols and to derive an aerosol scale height parameter. Our water vapor results give water vapor column abundance with a precision of 0.6 precipitable microns and systematic errors no larger than +/- 0.3 precipitable microns, assuming uniform vertical mixing. The ChemCam-retrieved water abundances show, with only a few exceptions, the same seasonal behavior and the same timing of seasonal minima and maxima as the TES, CRISM, and REMS-H data sets that we compare them to. However ChemCam-retrieved water abundances are generally lower than zonal and regional scale from-orbit water vapor data, while at the same time being significantly larger than pre-dawn REMS-H abundances. Pending further analysis of REMS-H volume mixing ratio uncertainties, the differences between ChemCam and REMS-H pre-dawn mixing ratios appear to be much too large to be explained by large scale circulations and thus they tend to support the hypothesis of substantial diurnal interactions of water vapor with the surface. Our preliminary aerosol results, meanwhile, show the expected seasonal pattern in dust particle size but also indicate a surprising interannual increase in water-ice cloud opacities.

The surface integral equations (SIEs) are formulated for dielectric surfaces using Green's functions of the air and the ocean permittivities with the surface tangential electric and magnetic fields as the unknowns. In solving the SIEs using the method of moment, a fast matrix solver of the sparse matrix canonical grid is used in conjunction with Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions. The computation has been implemented on a high-performance parallel computing cluster for problems with up to six million surface unknowns. Unlike the two-scale model (TSM) approximation, NMM3D does not require division of the surface spectrum into large-and small-scale ocean waves. The results of backscattering simulations are compared to Aquarius satellite radar measurements for wind speeds of 5, 8, and 10 m/s and for incidence angles of 29 degrees, 39 degrees, and 46 degrees. The results show that NMM3D ocean backscattering solutions at L-band are in good agreement with Aquarius satellite radar data for co-polarized VV, HH, and cross-polarized VH returns as well as for the VV/HH ratio. The azimuthal dependence of L-band backscatter is also assessed. Finally, NMM3D results are compared to TSM solutions and are shown to lie close to Aquarius data in observed VV/HH ratio, and their azimuthal dependencies.

Using the Deep Space Atomic Clock for Navigation and Science	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL												Routine use of one-way radiometric tracking for deep space navigation and radio science is not possible today because spacecraft frequency and time references that use state-of-the-art ultrastable oscillators introduce errors from their intrinsic drift and instability on timescales past 100 s. The Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC), currently under development as a NASA Technology Demonstration Mission, is an advanced prototype of a space-flight suitable, mercury-ion atomic clock that can provide an unprecedented frequency and time stability in a space-qualified clock. Indeed, the ground-based results of the DSAC space demonstration unit have already achieved an Allan deviation of 2 x 10(-15) at one day; space performance on this order will enable the use of one-way radiometric signals for deep space navigation and radio science.

Ibrahim			Soil erosion assessment on hillslope of GCE using RUSLE model	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												A new method for obtaining the C factor (i.e., vegetation cover and management factor) of the RUSLE model is proposed. The method focuses on the derivation of the C factor based on the vegetation density to obtain a more reliable erosion prediction. Soil erosion that occurs on the hillslope along the highway is one of the major problems in Malaysia, which is exposed to a relatively high amount of annual rainfall due to the two different monsoon seasons. As vegetation cover is one of the important factors in the RUSLE model, a new method that accounts for a vegetation density is proposed in this study. A hillslope near the Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE), Malaysia, is chosen as an experimental site whereby eight square plots with the size of and m are set up. A vegetation density available on these plots is measured by analyzing the taken image followed by linking the C factor with the measured vegetation density using several established formulas. Finally, erosion prediction is computed based on the RUSLE model in the Geographical Information System (GIS) platform. The C factor obtained by the proposed method is compared with that of the soil erosion guideline Malaysia, thereby predicted erosion is determined by both the C values. Result shows that the C value from the proposed method varies from 0.0162 to 0.125, which is lower compared to the C value from the soil erosion guideline, i.e., 0.8. Meanwhile predicted erosion computed from the proposed C value is between 0.410 and compared to 9.367 to range based on the C value of 0.8. It can be concluded that the proposed method of obtaining a reasonable C value is acceptable as the computed predicted erosion is found to be classified as a very low zone, i.e. less than whereas the predicted erosion based on the guideline has classified the study area as a low zone of erosion, i.e., between 10 and .

First Estimate of Wind Fields in the Jupiter Polar Regions From JIRAM-Juno Images	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												We present wind speeds at the similar to 1bar level at both Jovian polar regions inferred from the 5-m infrared images acquired by the Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Juno spacecraft during its fourth periapsis (2 February 2017). We adopted the criterion of minimum mean absolute distortion (Gonzalez & Woods, 2008) to quantify the motion of cloud features between pairs of images. The associated random error on speed estimates is 12m/s in the northern polar region and 9.8m/s at the south. Assuming that polar cyclones described by Adriani et al. (2018, ) are in rigid motion with respect to System III, tangential speeds in the interior of the vortices increase linearly with distance from the center. The annulus of maximum speed for the main circumpolar cyclones is located at approximatively 1,000km from their centers, with peak cyclonic speeds typically between 80 and 110m/s and similar to 50m/s in at least two cases. Beyond the annulus of maximum speed, tangential speed decreases inversely with the distance from the center within the Southern Polar Cyclone and somewhat faster within the Northern Polar Cyclone. A few small areas of anticyclonic motions are also identified within both polar regions.

Ionospheric Electron Content During Solar Cycle 23	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS												The solar minimum period between solar cycles 23 and 24 has generated extensive study, in part because the changes in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere were so dramatic. Thermospheric density during 2008-2009, at the benchmark 400-km altitude, was shown to be approximately 30% lower than the previous solar minimum during 1996, in observations and in model simulations. Ionospheric densities were also estimated to be lower, by 10% to 20%. However, earlier analyses using data from the global network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers did not find any significant reduction in global mean total electron content. Recent work reexamining those data using a limited set of receivers, but with consistent processing, identified a 19% reduction (Emmert et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JA023680). In this study, we compare model simulations of the thermosphere-ionosphere system during the 2008-2009 solar minimum to its predecessor and estimate a 16% reduction in global mean total electron content. This is consistent with the neutral thermosphere density change seen in model simulations and in satellite drag observations. In the model simulations, the primary driver is a 10% reduction in solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance, with a smaller contribution from lower geomagnetic activity, and a very small decrement due to increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Plain Language Summary The Sun goes through 11-year activity cycles, best known with regard to the number of sunspots. At solar minimum, when sunspots mostly vanish, the extreme ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum also diminishes. This causes lower temperature and density in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere above 100 km, where the extreme ultraviolet radiation is absorbed. Past solar minimum periods have seemed basically similar with regard to extreme ultraviolet radiation, and other manifestations of solar activity. However, the solar minimum during 2008-2009 was longer and had fewer sunspots than its predecessor during 1996, or than any minimum period in the past century. The thermosphere was also lower in density, and the ionosphere also appeared to be lower in density, but there were some contradictory measurements. Recent reanalysis of ionospheric measurements found better agreement with the thermospheric measurements. Modeling studies attempting to explain the changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere have suggested that they were caused by a decrease of about 10% in solar extreme ultraviolet radiation. Here we show that the model results and the ionospheric measurements are now in good agreement. This demonstrates that solar minima are not all the same and may have implications for understanding the Sun during extended periods of very low activity.

Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: cross-correlation redshifts - methods and systematics characterization	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We use numerical simulations to characterize the performance of a clustering-based method to calibrate photometric redshift biases. In particular, we cross-correlate the weak lensing source galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 sample with redMaGiC galaxies (luminous red galaxies with secure photometric redshifts) to estimate the redshift distribution of the former sample. The recovered redshift distributions are used to calibrate the photometric redshift bias of standard photo-z methods applied to the same source galaxy sample. We apply the method to two photo-z codes run in our simulated data: Bayesian Photometric Redshift and Directional Neighbourhood Fitting. We characterize the systematic uncertainties of our calibration procedure, and find that these systematic uncertainties dominate our error budget. The dominant systematics are due to our assumption of unevolving bias and clustering across each redshift bin, and to differences between the shapes of the redshift distributions derived by clustering versus photo-zs. The systematic uncertainty in the mean redshift bias of the source galaxy sample is Delta z less than or similar to 0.02, though the precise value depends on the redshift bin under consideration.

DES Collaboration	Cross-correlation redshift calibration without spectroscopic calibration samples in DES Science Verification Data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Galaxy cross-correlations with high-fidelity redshift samples hold the potential to precisely calibrate systematic photometric redshift uncertainties arising from the unavailability of complete and representative training and validation samples of galaxies. However, application of this technique in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) is hampered by the relatively low number density, small area, and modest redshift overlap between photometric and spectroscopic samples. We propose instead using photometric catalogues with reliable photometric redshifts for photo-z calibration via cross-correlations. We verify the viability of our proposal using redMaPPer clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to successfully recover the redshift distribution of SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. We demonstrate how to combine photo-z with cross-correlation data to calibrate photometric redshift biases while marginalizing over possible clustering bias evolution in either the calibration or unknown photometric samples. We apply our method to DES Science Verification (DES SV) data in order to constrain the photometric redshift distribution of a galaxy sample selected for weak lensing studies, constraining the mean of the tomographic redshift distributions to a statistical uncertainty of Delta z similar to +/- 0.01. We forecast that our proposal can, in principle, control photometric redshift uncertainties in DES weak lensing experiments at a level near the intrinsic statistical noise of the experiment over the range of redshifts where redMaPPer clusters are available. Our results provide strong motivation to launch a programme to fully characterize the systematic errors from bias evolution and photo-z shapes in our calibration procedure.

Losing mass since 1892, Tracy Glacier has dramatically accelerated, thinned, and retreated. Heilprin has retreated only slightly during the last century and has remained almost stationary in the most recent decade. Previous studies suggest that Tracy's base is deeper than Heilprin's at the calving front (over 600 m, as opposed to the 350 m depth at Heilprin), which exposes it to warmer subsurface waters, resulting in more rapid retreat. We investigate the local oceanographic conditions in Inglefield Gulf and their interactions with Tracy and Heilprin using data collected in 2016 and 2017 as part of NASA's Oceans Melting Greenland mission. Based on improved estimates of the fjord geometry and 20 temperature and salinity profiles near the fronts of these two glaciers, we find clear evidence that fjord waters are modified by ocean-ice interactions with Tracy Glacier. We find that Tracy thinned by 9.9 m near its terminus between 2016 and 2017, while Heilprin thinned by only 1.8 m. Using a simple subglacial plume model, we find that Tracy's deeper depth at the front results in a more vigorous entrainment of warm subsurface waters, leading to more rapid melting. Model results support the hypothesis that Tracy's deeper front results in faster glacier retreat, despite the presence of a shallow sill (similar to 300 m) that may prevent the warmest waters from reaching Tracy.

J	Nowicki, S; Seroussi, H				Nowicki, Sophie; Seroussi, Helene			Projections of Future Sea Level Contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets CHALLENGES BEYOND DYNAMICAL ICE SHEET MODELING	OCEANOGRAPHY												As Earth's climate warms, rising sea levels are becoming a great concern. Providing substantiated and well-informed guidance on the amount and rate of future sea level rise is important, but remains challenging. Observations of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets-Earth's largest freshwater reservoirs-reveal their ongoing, rapid, and complex changes in response to an evolving climate. The improved understanding of ice sheet behavior resulting from observations is driving the development of ice sheet models, and is allowing better simulation of past, present, and future ice sheet evolution. However, insight into future changes requires a better understanding of how ice sheets interact with other components of the Earth system and associated feedbacks. As climate models start to include dynamical ice sheet components, our understanding of such interactions and the feedback mechanisms will advance. These new developments in ice sheet modeling and their implementation in climate models are timely, as observations indicate an accelerating contribution of ice sheets to sea level rise.																	1042-8275					JUN	2018	31	2			SI		109	117		10.5670/oceanog.2018.216							WOS:000452824700018

Scientific rationale for Uranus and Neptune in situ explorations	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The ice giants Uranus and Neptune are the least understood class of planets in our solar system but the most frequently observed type of exoplanets. Presumed to have a small rocky core, a deep interior comprising-70% heavy elements surrounded by a more dilute outer envelope of H-2 and He, Uranus and Neptune are fundamentally different from the better-explored gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of the lack of dedicated exploration missions, our knowledge of the composition and atmospheric processes of these distant worlds is primarily derived from remote sensing from Earth-based observatories and space telescopes. As a result, Uranus's and Neptune's physical and atmospheric properties remain poorly constrained and their roles in the evolution of the Solar System not well understood. Exploration of an ice giant system is therefore a high-priority science objective as these systems (including the magnetosphere, satellites, rings, atmosphere, and interior) challenge our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Here we describe the main scientific goals to be addressed by a future in situ exploration of an ice giant. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level, about 5 scale heights beneath the tropopause, would yield insight into two broad themes: i) the formation history of the ice giants and, in a broader extent, that of the Solar System, and ii) the processes at play in planetary atmospheres. The probe would descend under parachute to measure composition, structure, and dynamics, with data returned to Earth using a Carrier Relay Spacecraft as a relay station. In addition, possible mission concepts and partnerships are presented, and a strawman ice-giant probe payload is described. An ice-giant atmospheric probe could represent a significant ESA contribution to a future NASA ice-giant flagship mission.

Laboratory Measurement of the Brighter-fatter Effect in an H2RG Infrared Detector	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC												The "brighter-fatter" (BF) effect is a phenomenon-originally discovered in charge coupled devices-in which the size of the detector point-spread function (PSF) increases with brightness. We present, for the first time, laboratory measurements demonstrating the existence of the effect in a Hawaii-2RG HgCdTe near-infrared (NIR) detector. We use JPL's Precision Projector Laboratory, a facility for emulating astronomical observations with UV/VIS/NIR detectors, to project about 17,000 point sources onto the detector to stimulate the effect. After calibrating the detector for nonlinearity with flat-fields, we find evidence that charge is nonlinearly shifted from bright pixels to neighboring pixels during exposures of point sources, consistent with the existence of a BF-type effect. NASAs Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will use similar detectors to measure weak gravitational lensing from the shapes of hundreds of million of galaxies in the NIR. The WFIRST PSF size must be calibrated to approximate to 0.1% to avoid biased inferences of dark matter and dark energy parameters; therefore further study and calibration of the BF effect in realistic images will be crucial.																	0004-6280	1538-3873				JUN	2018	130	988							065004	10.1088/1538-3873/aab820							WOS:000430971900001

Clay mineral diversity and abundance in sedimentary rocks of Gale crater, Mars	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Clay minerals provide indicators of the evolution of aqueous conditions and possible habitats for life on ancient Mars. Analyses by the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity show that similar to 3.5-billion year (Ga) fluvio-lacustrine mudstones in Gale crater contain up to similar to 28 weight % (wt %) clay minerals. We demonstrate that the species of clay minerals deduced from x-ray diffraction and evolved gas analysis show a strong paleoenvironmental dependency. While perennial lake mudstones are characterized by Fe-saponite, we find that stratigraphic intervals associated with episodic lake drying contain Al-rich, Fe3+-bearing dioctahedral smectite, with minor (3 wt %) quantities of ferripyrophyllite, interpreted as wind-blown detritus, found in candidate aeolian deposits. Our results suggest that dioctahedral smectite formed via near-surface chemical weathering driven by fluctuations in lake level and atmospheric infiltration, a process leading to the redistribution of nutrients and potentially influencing the cycling of gases that help regulate climate.

We apply the method to single metalloporphyrins adsorbed on Au(111) to image molecular charges, intramolecular polarization, local photoconductivity, atomically resolved hydrogen bonds, and surface electron density waves.

Nonlinear mean-field dynamo and prediction of solar activity	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS												We apply a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model which includes a budget equation for the dynamics of Wolf numbers to predict solar activity. This dynamo model takes into account the algebraic and dynamic nonlinearities of the alpha effect, where the equation for the dynamic nonlinearity is derived from the conservation law for the magnetic helicity. The budget equation for the evolution of the Wolf number is based on a formation mechanism of sunspots related to the negative effective magnetic pressure instability. This instability redistributes the magnetic flux produced by the mean-field dynamo. To predict solar activity on the time scale of one month we use a method based on a combination of the numerical solution of the nonlinear mean-field dynamo equations and the artificial neural network. A comparison of the results of the prediction of the solar activity with the observed Wolf numbers demonstrates a good agreement between the forecast and observations.

Process-Specific Contributions to Anomalous Java Mixed Layer Cooling During Positive IOD Events	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) events first appear in the seasonal upwelling zone along the southern coast of Java during May-July. The evolution of anomalous SSTs in this coastal region is analyzed by computing a temperature budget using output from a strongly eddy-active ocean general circulation model. The seasonal cooling south of Java in May-July is driven by a reduction in incoming shortwave radiation and by vertical mixing, consistent with earlier studies in the region; however, the model budget also shows an advective contribution that drives anomalous cooling at the onset of pIOD events. To identify which process(es) are responsible for the anomalous advective cooling during pIOD events, a novel process index regression method is used to estimate the contributions of wind stress, equatorial Kelvin waves, mesoscale eddies, and Lombok Strait flow to anomalous cooling south of Java. Using this method, wind stress forcing along the west coast of Sumatra is found to make the most substantial contribution to anomalous cooling south of Java, with lesser contributions from equatorially sourced Kelvin waves and local wind stress. Mesoscale eddies redistribute heat from the Lombok Strait outflow, and have an anomalous warming effect on the eastern side of the upwelling region. The process-specific temperature budget south of Java highlights the importance of wind stress forcing west of Sumatra relative to equatorial and local forcing, and explains most of the mixed layer temperature anomaly evolution associated with advection during pIOD events. Plain Language Summary Climate variations from year to year in much of the Indian Ocean region are controlled by a phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is similar to El Nino but centered on the Indian Ocean basin. The positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole, or pIOD, typically brings drought conditions to Indonesia and unusually heavy rainfall to east Africa. These pIOD events are caused in part by unusually strong cooling in sea surface temperatures south of the Indonesian island of Java, but the series of events that causes this strong cooling has not been well understood previously. This paper uses the results obtained from a high-resolution ocean model, together with a new method for analyzing these results, to study exactly how much sea surface cooling (or warming) is caused by specific processes in the Java region. The study finds that changes in wind patterns adjacent to the Indonesian island of Sumatra can explain nearly all of the unusual cooling that develops south of Java in years when these pIOD events happen. The analysis method introduced in this paper may be adapted to study how processes in the ocean or atmosphere cause changes in the Earth's climate system.

Semianalytical Estimation of Energy Deposition in the Ionosphere by Monochromatic Alfven Waves	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS												For the first time we derive an analytical expression for energy deposition by propagating monochromatic Alfven waves in the collisional ionosphere-thermosphere (IT). Based on empirical models of IT parameters, we show an approximately 10% increase in efficiency of energy deposition at high latitudes and about 150 km altitude by Alfven waves at 5Hz as compared to static fields of the same magnitude. We analyze the dependence of the wave energy deposition on geomagnetic activity through a Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) simulation of IT conditions during the 13-14 October 2016 geomagnetic storm. The peak Alfven wave contribution occurs in the E layer and lower part of the F layer. Wave-induced heating is shown to increase in the daytime and postdusk high-latitude F layer during the storm due to increased wave-modified conductivity. We estimate that the Alfven wave contribution to the IT energy budget can reach about 30% of the value of static Joule heating during a strong storm and that the actual percentage increase is dependent on latitude and altitude. This effect carries important implications for ionospheric dynamics, especially for density enhancement in the daytime cusp, heating in the vicinity of auroral arcs and ion outflow.

BAlSi-4 was first coated on Ti-6Al-4V by plasma welding, then alternating layers of Ni and Al were successfully deposited on BAlSi-4 up to 32.9 mu m thick with e-beam deposition. The joint microstructure was investigated and the AlNi and Ni5Al3 phases were identified in the RMF. The cause for the two phases was determined to be differences in the diffusivity of Ni and Al, ultrafast brazing time, and faster cooling at the interface between brazing filler metal and the RMF. The maximum temperature of 683 degrees C was reached in the brazed joint, with a total RMF thickness of 135 mu m, which is more than sufficient to melt the BAlSi-4 brazing material. The maximum bonding strength obtained was 10.6 MPa, with a self-power brazing procedure conducted in a minute. It is possible to further improve the bonding strength by using more ductile RMFs and/or modifying the bonding interface configuration.

Objective Characterization of Rain Microphysics: Validating a Scheme Suitable for Weather and Climate Models	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Improving the atmospheric component of hydrological models is beneficial for applications such as water resources assessment and hydropower operations. Within this goal, precise characterization of rain microphysics is key for climate and weather modeling, and thus for hydrometeorological applications. Such characterization can be achieved by analyzing the evolution in time of the particle size distribution (PSD) of hydrometeors, which can be measured at ground using disdrometers for validation. The estimation, however, depends on the choice of the PSD form (the shape) and on the parameters to define the exact shape. In the case of modeling rain microphysics, two approaches compete: the use of the number concentration of drops decoupled from the shape of the distribution (the [N-T, E(D), E(D-2)] and the {N-T, E(D), E[log(D)]} models), and the (N-0, , ) model that embeds in N-0 both the shape of the distribution and the number concentration of drops. Here we use a comprehensive dataset of disdrometer measurements to show that the N-T-based approaches allow a more precise characterization of the drop size distribution (DSD) and also a physically based modeling of the microphysical processes of rain since N-T is analytically independent of the shape of the DSD {parameterized by E(D), and E(D-2) or E[log(D)]}. The implication is that numerical models would benefit from decoupling the number of drops from the shape of distribution in their modules of precipitation microphysics in order to improve outputs that eventually feed hydrological models.

Geomagnetically Induced Currents Caused by Interplanetary Shocks With Different Impact Angles and Speeds	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The occurrence of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) poses serious threats to modern technological infrastructure. Large GICs result from sharp variations of the geomagnetic field (dB/dt) caused by changes of large-scale magnetospheric and ionospheric currents. Intense dB/dt perturbations are known to occur often in high-latitude regions as a result of storm time substorms. Magnetospheric compressions usually caused by interplanetary shocks increase the magnetopause current leading to dB/dt perturbations more evident in midlatitude to low-latitude regions, while they increase the equatorial electrojet current leading to dB/dt perturbations in dayside equatorial regions. We investigate the effects of shock impact angles and speeds on the subsequent dB/dt perturbations with a database of 547 shocks observed at the L1 point. By adopting the threshold of dB/dt = 100 nT/min, identified as a risk factor to power systems, we find that dB/dt generally surpasses this threshold when following impacts of high-speed and nearly frontal shocks in dayside high-latitude locations. The same trend occurs at lower latitudes and for all nightside events but with fewer high-risk events. Particularly, we found nine events in equatorial locations with dB/dt > 100 nT/min. All events were caused by high-speed and nearly frontal shock impacts and were observed by stations located around noon local time. These high-risk perturbations were caused by sudden strong and symmetric magnetospheric compressions, more effectively intensifying the equatorial electrojet current, leading to sharp dB/dt perturbations. We suggest that these results may provide insights for GIC forecasting aiming at preventing degradation of power systems due to GICs.

We report on the results of simulations of observations from a geostationary microwave sounder and, briefly, from a small cluster of low-earth-orbiting CubeSats. The geostationary simulations show a precision of better than 2 m/s for wind speed and 15 degrees for direction. Wind speed bias is about -1 m/s. The transfer function is largely linear.

An Advanced Forest Fire Danger Forecasting System: Integration of Remote Sensing and Historical Sources of Ignition Data	REMOTE SENSING												Forest fire is one of the major natural hazards/disasters in Canada and many ecosystems across the world. Here, our objective was to enhance the performance of an existing solely remote sensing-based forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS), and its implementation over the northern region of the Canadian province of Alberta. The modified FFDFS was comprised of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived daily surface temperature (Ts) and precipitable water (PW), and 8-day composite of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), where we assumed that cloud-contaminant pixels would reduce the risk of fire occurrences. In addition, we generated ignition cause-specific static fire danger (SFD) maps derived using the historical human- and lightning-caused fires during the period 1961-2014. Upon incorporating different combinations of the generated SFD maps with the modified FFDFS, we evaluated their performances against actual fire spots during the 2009-2011 fire seasons. Our findings revealed that our proposed modifications were quite effective and the modified FFDFS captured almost the same amount of fires as the original FFDFS, i.e., about 77% of the detected fires on an average in the top three fire danger classes of extremely high, very high, and high categories, where about 50% of the study area fell under low and moderate danger classes. Additionally, we observed that the combination of modified FFDFS and human-caused SFD map (road buffer) demonstrated the most effective results in fire detection, i.e., 82% of detected fires on an average in the top three fire danger classes, where about 46% of the study area fell under the moderate and low danger categories. We believe that our developments would be helpful to manage the forest fire in order to reduce its overall impact.

SSS responds to freshwater inputs from river discharge, sea ice change, precipitation and evaporation, and oceanic transport through the open straits of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. However, in situ SSS data in the Arctic Ocean are very sparse and insufficient to depict the large-scale variability to address the critical question of how climate variability and change affect the Arctic Ocean freshwater. The L-band microwave radiometer on board the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has been providing SSS measurements since April 2015, at approximately 60 km resolution with Arctic Ocean coverage in 1-2 days. With improved land/ice correction, the SMAP SSS algorithm that was developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is able to retrieve SSS in ice-free regions 35 km of the coast. SMAP observes a large-scale contrast in salinity between the Atlantic and Pacific sides of the Arctic Ocean, while retrievals within the Arctic Circle vary over time, depending on the sea ice coverage and river runoff. We assess the accuracy of SMAP SSS through comparative analysis with in situ salinity data collected by Argo floats, ships, gliders, and in field campaigns. Results derived from nearly 20,000 pairs of SMAP and in situ data North of 50 degrees N collocated within a 12.5-km radius and daily time window indicate a Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) less than similar to 1 psu with a correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a near unity regression slope over the entire range of salinity. In contrast, the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) has a smaller RMSD with Argo. However, there are clear systematic biases in the HYCOM for salinity in the range of 25-30 psu, leading to a regression slope of about 0.5. In the region North of 65 degrees N, the number of collocated samples drops more than 70%, resulting in an RMSD of about 1.2 psu. SMAP SSS in the Kara Sea shows a consistent response to discharge anomalies from the Ob' and Yenisei rivers between 2015 and 2016, providing an assessment of runoff impact in a region where no in situ salinity data are available for validation. The Kara Sea SSS anomaly observed by SMAP is missing in the HYCOM SSS, which assimilates climatological runoffs without interannual changes. We explored the feasibility of using SMAP SSS to monitor the sea surface salinity variability at the major Arctic Ocean gateways. Results show that although the SMAP SSS is limited to about 1 psu accuracy, many large salinity changes are observable. This may lead to the potential application of satellite SSS in the Arctic monitoring system as a proxy of the upper ocean layer freshwater exchanges with subarctic oceans.

Application of Multivariate Sensitivity Analysis Techniques to AGCM-Simulated Tropical Cyclones	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This work demonstrates the use of Sobol's sensitivity analysis framework to examine multivariate input-output relationships in dynamical systems. The methodology allows simultaneous exploration of the effect of changes in multiple inputs, and accommodates nonlinear interaction effects among parameters in a computationally affordable way. The concept is illustrated via computation of the sensitivities of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM)-simulated tropical cyclones to changes in model initial conditions. Specifically, Sobol's variance-based sensitivity analysis is used to examine the response of cyclone intensity, cloud radiative forcing, cloud content, and precipitation rate to changes in initial conditions in an idealized AGCM-simulated tropical cyclone (TC). Control factors of interest include the following: initial vortex size and intensity, environmental sea surface temperature, vertical lapse rate, and midlevel relative humidity. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates systematic increases in TC intensity with increasing sea surface temperature and atmospheric temperature lapse rates, consistent with many previous studies. However, there are nonlinear interactions among control factors that affect the response of the precipitation rate, cloud content, and radiative forcing. In addition, sensitivities to control factors differ significantly when the model is run at different resolution, and coarse-resolution simulations are unable to produce a realistic TC. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of a quantitative sensitivity analysis framework for the exploration of dynamic system responses to perturbations, and have implications for the generation of ensembles.

An empirical derivation of the X-ray optic transmission profile used in calibrating the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) for Mars 2020	POWDER DIFFRACTION												Calibration of the prototype Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) selected for Mars 2020 has commenced with an empirical derivation of the X-ray optic transmission profile. Through a straightforward method of dividing a measured "blank" spectrum over one calculated assuming no optic influence, a rudimentary profile was formed. A simple boxcar-smoothing algorithm was implemented to approximate the complete profile that was incorporated into PIQUANT. Use of this form of smoothing differs from the more conventional approach of using a parameter-based function to complete the profile. Comparison of element-specific correction factors, taken from a measurement of NIST SRM 610, was used to assess the accuracy of the new profile. Improvement in the low- to mid-energy portion of the data was apparent though the high-energy region diverged from unity, and thus, requires further refinement.(C)2018 International Centre for Diffraction Data.

J	Hennessy, J; Nikzad, S				Hennessy, John; Nikzad, Shouleh			Atomic Layer Deposition of Lithium Fluoride Optical Coatings for the Ultraviolet	INORGANICS												Lithium fluoride is an important material for ultraviolet optical systems, possessing among the largest optical bandgaps of dielectric materials. We report on the development of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process for lithium fluoride that is capable of depositing thin films in a self-limiting manner, with an approximate deposition rate of approximately 0.15 angstrom per ALD cycle at a substrate temperature of 150 degrees C. Films are characterized by spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and far ultraviolet reflectometry. For substrate temperatures of 150 degrees C and greater, films showed significant microroughness with a correlated reduction in effective refractive index. This behavior was mitigated by a reduction in substrate temperature to as low as 100 degrees C. Films deposited on silicon substrates were subjected to long-term storage testing to evaluate the environmental sensitivity of the deposited layers. Protected aluminum mirrors were also fabricated with ALD LiF overcoats, yielding a reflectance of 84% at a wavelength of 125 nm. The performance relative to state-of-the-art LiF thin films deposited by physical vapor deposition methods is discussed, along with the prospects for future optimization.

Exoplanet Biosignatures: Observational Prospects	ASTROBIOLOGY												Exoplanet hunting efforts have revealed the prevalence of exotic worlds with diverse properties, including Earth-sized bodies, which has fueled our endeavor to search for life beyond the Solar System. Accumulating experiences in astrophysical, chemical, and climatological characterization of uninhabitable planets are paving the way to characterization of potentially habitable planets. In this paper, we review our possibilities and limitations in characterizing temperate terrestrial planets with future observational capabilities through the 2030s and beyond, as a basis of a broad range of discussions on how to advance astrobiology with exoplanets. We discuss the observability of not only the proposed biosignature candidates themselves but also of more general planetary properties that provide circumstantial evidence, since the evaluation of any biosignature candidate relies on its context. Characterization of temperate Earth-sized planets in the coming years will focus on those around nearby late-type stars. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and later 30-meter-class ground-based telescopes will empower their chemical investigations. Spectroscopic studies of potentially habitable planets around solar-type stars will likely require a designated spacecraft mission for direct imaging, leveraging technologies that are already being developed and tested as part of the Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. Successful initial characterization of a few nearby targets will be an important touchstone toward a more detailed scrutiny and a larger survey that are envisioned beyond 2030.

The variometric approach to real-time high-frequency geodesy	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												High-frequency geodesy is here intended as the capability of retrieving information relevant to geodesy and geophysics at high frequency through geodetic measurements and methodologies. In particular, this short review work focuses on two aspects: fast ground motions, as those due to earthquakes, and fast ionospheric total electron content (TEC) disturbances, as those caused by tsunamis. This information can be retrieved, even in real time, from Global Navigation Satellite System observations collected at high rate (equal or higher than 1 Hz), and can significantly support geohazard understanding contributing in seismic moment estimation and tsunami early warning. Here, the real-time possibilities of the new variometric approach for high-frequency geodesy are summarized: the fundamental idea is to directly focus on the quantities of interest, which are "variations" (of positions, of ionospheric TEC) and can be properly estimated in real time. The work moves "from ground to ionosphere": with respect to the ground, the more consolidated application of the variometric approach to GNSS seismology (VADASE) is presented, up to the latest developments; with respect to the ionosphere, the brand new application named VARION for TEC disturbances computation is described, and the first results of the application to the Illapel, Chile earthquake (USGS M=8.3, 16 September 2015, 22:54:32 UTC) are shown.

Calibration and performance measurements for the nasa deep space network aperture enhancement project (daep)	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA												The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) has recently constructed two new 34-m antennas at the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC). These new antennas are part of the larger DAEP project to add six new 34-m antennas to the DSN, including two in Madrid, three in Canberra and one in Goldstone (California). The DAEP project included development and implementation of several new technologies for the X, and Ka (32 GHz) -band uplink and downlink electronics. The electronics upgrades were driven by several different considerations, including parts obsolescence, cost reduction, improved reliability and maintainability, and capability to meet future performance requirements. The new antennas are required to support TT&C links for all of the NASA deep-space spacecraft, as well as for several international partners. Some of these missions, such as Voyager 1 and 2, have very limited link budgets, which results in demanding requirements for system G/T performance. These antennas are also required to support radio science missions with several spacecraft, which dictate some demanding requirements for spectral purity, amplitude stability and phase stability for both the uplink and downlink electronics. After completion of these upgrades, a comprehensive campaign of tests and measurements took place to characterize the electronics and calibrate the antennas. Radiometric measurement techniques were applied to characterize, calibrate, and optimize the performance of the antenna parameters. These included optical and RF high-resolution holographic and total power radiometry techniques. The methodology and techniques utilized for the measurement and calibration of the antennas is described in this paper. Lessons learned (not all discussed in this paper) from the commissioning of the first antenna (DSS-35) were applied to the commissioning of the second antenna (DSS-36). These resulted in achieving antenna aperture efficiency of 66% (for DSS-36), at Ka-Band (32-Ghz), which is currently the highest operating frequency for these antennas. The other measurements and results described include antenna noise temperature, photogrammetry and holography alignment of antenna panels, beam-waveguide mirrors, and subreflector, antenna aperture efficiencies and G/T versus frequency, and antenna pointing models. The first antenna (DSS-35) entered into operations in October 2014 and the 2nd antenna (DSS-36) in October 2016. This paper describes the measurement techniques and results of the testing and calibration for both antennas, along with the driving requirements.																	0094-5765	1879-2030				JUN	2018	147						37	47		10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.03.011							WOS:000435626300004

So far, however, biodiversity monitoring has primarily focused on structural and compositional features of ecosystems despite growing evidence that ecosystem functions are key to elucidating the mechanisms through which biological diversity generates services to humanity. This monitoring gap can be traced to the current lack of consensus on what exactly ecosystem functions are and how to track them at scales beyond the site level. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by proposing the adoption of a set of definitions and a typology for ecosystem functions, and reviewing current opportunities and potential limitations for satellite remote sensing technology to support the monitoring of ecosystem functions worldwide. By clearly defining ecosystem processes, functions and services and their interrelationships, we provide a framework to improve communication between ecologists, land and marine managers, remote sensing specialists and policy makers, thereby addressing a major barrier in the field.

The method operates by developing a nominal model for the system through state-space identification and then modeling the resulting residual through an artificial neural network. The model for the residual is then folded back into the nominal system via Kalman filtering, allowing for forward computational simulation without any measurement information. The proposed identification method is applied to a three-degree-of-freedom system and a high-fidelity finite element model built in Abaqus. The proposed method provides reasonable predictions for time histories of excitations not seen during training or identification and produces useful predictions of the associated shock response spectra.

Relationships between unit-cell parameters and composition for rock-forming minerals on Earth, Mars, and other extraterrestrial bodies	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Mathematical relationships between unit-cell parameters and chemical composition were developed for selected mineral phases observed with the CheMin X-ray diffractometer onboard the Curiosity rover in Gale crater. This study presents algorithms for estimating the chemical composition of phases based solely on X-ray diffraction data. The mineral systems include plagioclase, alkali feldspar, Mg-Fe-Ca C2/c clinopyroxene, Mg-Fe-Ca P2(1)/c clinopyroxene, Mg-Fe-Ca orthopyroxene, Mg-Fe olivine, magnetite, and other selected spinel oxides, and alunite-jarosite. These methods assume compositions of Na-Ca for plagioclase, K-Na for alkali feldspar, Mg-Fe-Ca for pyroxene, and Mg-Fe for olivine; however, some other minor elements may occur and their impact on measured unit-cell parameters is discussed. These crystal-chemical algorithms can be applied to material of any origin, whether that origin is Earth, Mars, an extraterrestrial body, or a laboratory.

N.; Watkins, James M.; Liu, Yang			Ascent rates of rhyolitic magma at the onset of three caldera-forming eruptions	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Important clues to the initiation and early behavior of large (super-) eruptions lie in the records of degassing during magma ascent. Here we investigate the timescales of magma ascent for three rhyolitic supereruptions that show field evidence for contrasting behavior at eruption onset: (1) 650 km(3), 0.767 Ma Bishop Tuff, Long Valley; (2) 530 km(3), 25.4 ka Oruanui eruption, Taupo; and (3) 2500 km(3), 2.08 Ma Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, Yellowstone. During magma ascent, decompression causes volatile exsolution from the host melt into bubbles, leading to H2O and CO2 gradients in quartz-hosted re-entrants (REs; unsealed inclusions). These gradients are modeled to estimate ascent rates. We present best-fit modeled ascent rates for H2O and CO2 profiles for REs in early-erupted fall deposits from Bishop (n = 13), Oruanui (n = 9), and Huckleberry Ridge (n = 9). Using a Matlab script that includes an error minimization function, Bishop REs yield ascent rates of 0.6-13 m/s, overlapping with and extending beyond those of the Huckleberry Ridge (0.3-4.0 m/s). Re-entrants in Oruanui quartz crystals from the first two eruptive phases (of 10) yield the slowest ascent rates determined in this study (0.06-0.48 m/s), whereas those from phase three, which has clear field evidence for a marked increase in eruption intensity, are uniformly higher (1.4-2.6 m/s). For all three eruptions, the interiors of most REs appear to have re-equilibrated to lower H2O and CO2 concentrations when compared to co-erupted, enclosed melt inclusions in quartz. Such reequilibration implies the presence of an initial period of slower ascent, likely resulting from movement of magma from storage into a developing conduit system, prior to the faster (<1-2.5 h) final ascent of magma to the surface. This slower initial movement represents hours to several days of reequilibration, invalidating any assumption of constant decompression conditions from the storage region. However, the number of REs with deeper starting depths increases with stratigraphic height in all three deposits (particularly the Bishop Tuff), suggesting progressive elimination of the deep, sluggish ascent stage over time, which we interpret to be the result of maturing of the conduit system(s). Our results agree well with ascent rates estimated using theoretical approximations and numerical modeling for plinian rhyolitic eruptions (0.7-30 m/s), but overlap more with the slower estimates.

Assessing fossil fuel CO2 emissions in California using atmospheric observations and models	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Analysis systems incorporating atmospheric observations could provide a powerful tool for validating fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO(2)) emissions reported for individual regions, provided that fossil fuel sources can be separated from other CO2 sources or sinks and atmospheric transport can be accurately accounted for. We quantified ffCO(2) by measuring radiocarbon (C-14) in CO2, an accurate fossil-carbon tracer, at nine observation sites in California for three months in 2014-15. There is strong agreement between the measurements and ffCO(2) simulated using a high-resolution atmospheric model and a spatiotemporally-resolved fossil fuel flux estimate. Inverse estimates of total in-state ffCO(2) emissions are consistent with the California Air Resources Board's reported ffCO(2) emissions, providing tentative validation of California's reported ffCO(2) emissions in 2014-15. Continuing this prototype analysis system could provide critical independent evaluation of reported ffCO(2) emissions and emissions reductions in California, and the system could be expanded to other, more data-poor regions.

J	Barreir, A; Krause, E; Schmidt, F				Barreir, Alexandre; Krause, Elisabeth; Schmidt, Fabian			Complete super-sample lensing covariance in the response approach	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS												We derive the complete super-sample covariance (SSC) of the matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra using the power spectrum response formalism to accurately describe the coupling of super- to sub-survey modes. The SSC term is completely characterized by the survey window function, the nonlinear matter power spectrum and the full first-order nonlinear power spectrum response function, which describes the response to super-survey density and tidal field perturbations. Generalized separate universe simulations can efficiently measure these responses in the nonlinear regime of structure formation, which is necessary for lensing applications. We derive the lensing SSC formulae for two cases: one under the Limber and flat-sky approximations, and a more general one that goes beyond the Limber approximation in the super-survey mode and is valid for curved sky applications. Quantitatively, we find that for sky fractions f(sky) approximate to 0.3 and a single source redshift at z(s) = 1, the use of the flat-sky and Limber approximation underestimates the total SSC contribution by approximate to 10%. The contribution from super-survey tidal fields to the lensing SSC, which has not been included in cosmological analyses so far, is shown to represent about 5% of the total lensing covariance on multipoles l(1), l(2) greater than or similar to 300. The SSC is the dominant off-diagonal contribution to the total lensing covariance, making it appropriate to include these tidal terms and beyond flat-sky/Limber corrections in cosmic shear analyses.																	1475-7516					JUN	2018		6							015	10.1088/1475-7516/2018/06/015							WOS:000434991300002

Orographic Precipitation Response to Microphysical Parameter Perturbations for Idealized Moist Nearly Neutral Flow	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												This study explores the sensitivity of clouds and precipitation to microphysical parameter perturbations using idealized simulations of moist, nearly neutral flow over a bell-shaped mountain. Numerous parameters are perturbed within the Morrison microphysics scheme. The parameters that most affect cloud and precipitation characteristics are the snow fall speed coefficient As, snow particle density rho(s), rain accretion (WRA), and ice-cloud water collection efficiency (ECI). Surface precipitation rates are affected by A(s) and rho(s) through changes to the precipitation efficiency caused by direct and indirect impacts on snow fall speed, respectively. WRA and ECI both affect the amount of cloud water removed, but the precipitation sensitivity differs. Large WRA results in increased precipitation efficiency and cloud water removal below the freezing level, indirectly decreasing cloud condensation rates; the net result is little precipitation sensitivity. Large ECI removes cloud water above the freezing level but with little influence on overall condensation rates. Two environmental experiments are performed to test the robustness of the results: 1) reduction of the wind speed profile by 30% (LowU) and 2) decreasing the surface potential temperature to induce a freezing level below the mountain top (LowFL). Parameter perturbations within LowU result in similar mechanisms acting on precipitation, but a much weaker sensitivity compared to the control. The LowFL case shows rho(s) is no longer a dominant parameter and A(s) now induces changes to cloud condensation, since more of the cloud depth is present above the freezing level. In general, perturbations to microphysical parameters affect the location of peak precipitation, while the total amount of precipitation is more sensitive to environmental parameter perturbations.

Titan's cold case files - Outstanding questions after Cassini-Huygens	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The entry of the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft into orbit around Saturn in July 2004 marked the start of a golden era in the exploration of Titan, Saturn's giant moon. During the Prime Mission (2004-2008), ground-breaking discoveries were made by the Cassini orbiter including the equatorial dune fields (flyby T3, 2005), northern lakes and seas (T16, 2006), and the large positive and negative ions (T16 & T18, 2006), to name a few. In 2005 the Huygens probe descended through Titan's atmosphere, taking the first close-up pictures of the surface, including large networks of dendritic channels leading to a dried-up seabed, and also obtaining detailed profiles of temperature and gas composition during the atmospheric descent. The discoveries continued through the Equinox Mission (2008-2010) and Solstice Mission (2010-2017) totaling 127 targeted flybys of Titan M all. Now at the end of the mission, we are able to look back on the high-level scientific questions from the start of the mission, and assess the progress that has been made towards answering these. At the same time, new scientific questions regarding Titan have emerged from the discoveries that have been made. In this paper we review a cross-section of important scientific questions that remain partially or completely unanswered, ranging from Titan's deep interior to the exosphere.

We present a space mission concept, the Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E2T), which is dedicated to investigating the evolution and habitability of these Saturnian satellites. E2T is proposed as a medium-class mission led by ESA in collaboration with NASA in response to ESA's M5 Cosmic Vision Call. E2T proposes a focused payload that would provide in-situ composition investigations and high-resolution imaging during multiple flybys of Enceladus and Titan using a solar-electric powered spacecraft in orbit around Saturn. The E2T mission would provide high-resolution mass spectrometry of the plume currently emanating from Enceladus' south polar terrain and of Titan's changing upper atmosphere. In addition, high resolution infrared (IR) imaging would detail Titan's geomorphology at 50-100 m resolution and the temperature of the fractures on Enceladus' south polar terrain at meter resolution. These combined measurements of both Titan and Enceladus would enable the E2T mission scenario to achieve two major scientific goals: 1) Study the origin and evolution of volatile-rich ocean worlds; and 2) Explore the habitability and potential for life in ocean worlds. E2T's two high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometers would enable resolution of the ambiguities in chemical analysis left by the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini-Huygens mission regarding the identification of low-mass organic species, detect high-mass organic species for the first time, further constrain trace species such as the noble gases, and clarify the evolution of solid and volatile species. The high-resolution IR camera would reveal the geology of Titan's surface and the energy dissipated by Enceladus' fractured south polar terrain and plume in detail unattainable by the Cassini mission.

Inferring surface currents within submerged, vegetated deltaic islands and wetlands from multi-pass airborne SAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Water flow patterns across coastal and deltaic wetlands affect biogeochemical cycling, denitrification, organic carbon burial, and coastal landscape evolution. Our understanding of such patterns across these important landscapes is incomplete, however, because of the inherent difficulty of conducting spatially and temporally dense ground- or boat-based surveys in shallow, vegetated terrain. We conducted an airborne L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition campaign on Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA, in May 2015, to investigate whether water velocities and flow patterns over kilometer scales can be determined from remote sensing. Thirteen SAR flight lines over the delta region were acquired in 3 h with six different flight directions, concurrently with a small boat campaign. We show that SAR azimuth displacement due to Doppler shift can be used to estimate the surface water flow relative to the static and submerged vegetation interspersed on delta islands, using a simple Bragg wave scattering model and accounting for the Bragg wave's free velocity and wind drift. At Wax Lake Delta, we find that similar to 0.40 m/s water velocities within the main deltaic channels slow to 0.1-0.2 m/s as flow spreads laterally across, and converges within, the vegetated islands, coinciding with shallow (< 0.5 m) depths and heightened flow resistance. This SAR-based technique opens up new avenues for understanding shallow submerged, vegetated coastal wetlands and deltas.

Limited data on the magnitude of carbon losses and rates of carbon recovery following forest degradation have hindered carbon accounting efforts and contributed to incomplete national reporting to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). We combined annual time series of Landsat imagery and high-density airborne lidar data to characterize the variability, magnitude, and persistence of Amazon forest degradation impacts on aboveground carbon density (ACD) and canopy structure. On average, degraded forests contained 45.1% of the carbon stocks in intact forests, and differences persisted even after 15 years of regrowth. In comparison to logging, understory fires resulted in the largest and longest-lasting differences in ACD. Heterogeneity in burned forest structure varied by fire severity and frequency. Forests with a history of one, two, and three or more fires retained only 54.4%, 25.2%, and 7.6% of intact ACD, respectively, when measured after a year of regrowth. Unlike the additive impact of successive fires, selective logging before burning did not explain additional variability in modeled ACD loss and recovery of burned forests. Airborne lidar also provides quantitative measures of habitat structure that can aid the estimation of co-benefits of avoided degradation. Notably, forest carbon stocks recovered faster than attributes of canopy structure that are critical for biodiversity in tropical forests, including the abundance of tall trees. We provide the first comprehensive look-up table of emissions factors for specific degradation pathways at standard reporting intervals in the Amazon. Estimated carbon loss and recovery trajectories provide an important foundation for assessing the long-term contributions from forest degradation to regional carbon cycling and advance our understanding of the current state of frontier forests.

Tony			Towards the application of seismogeodesy in central Italy: a case study for the 2016 August 24 M-w 6.1 Italy earthquake modelling	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Dense strong motion and high-rate Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) networks have been deployed in central Italy for rapid seismic source determination and corresponding hazard mitigation. Different from previous studies for the consistency between two kinds of sensor at collocated stations, here we focus on the combination of high-rate GNSS displacement waveforms with collocated seismic strong motion accelerators, and investigate its application to image rupture history. Taking the 2016 August 24 M-w 6.1 Central Italy earthquake as a case study, we first generate more accurate and longer period seismogeodetic displacement waveforms by a Kalman filter, then model the rupture behaviour through a joint inversion including seismogeodetic waveforms and InSAR observations. Our results reveal that strong motion data alone can overestimate the magnitude and mismatch the GNSS observations, while 1 Hz sampling rate GNSS is insufficient and the displacement is too noisy to depict rupture process. By contrast, seismogeodetic data enhances temporal resolution and maintains the static offsets that provide vital constraint to the reliable estimation of earthquake magnitude. The obtained model is close to the jointly inverted one. Our work demonstrates the unique usefulness of seismogeodesy for fast seismic hazard response.

We use five years of global positioning system measurements to invert for afterslip and constrain a 3-D finite-element model that simulates viscoelastic relaxation. We find that afterslip cannot readily explain far-field displacements (more than 50 km from the epicentre). These displacements are best explained by viscoelastic relaxation of a horizontally and vertically heterogeneous lower crust and upper mantle. Lower viscosities beneath the Salton Trough compared to the Peninsular Ranges and other surrounding regions are consistent with inferred differences in the respective geotherms. Our inferred viscosity structure suggests that the depth of the Lithosphere/Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB) is similar to 65 km below the Peninsular Ranges and similar to 32 km beneath the Salton Trough. These depths are shallower than the corresponding seismic LAB. This suggests that the onset of partial melting in peridotite may control the depth to the base of the mechanical lithosphere. In contrast, the seismic LAB may correspond to an increase in the partial melt percentage associated with the change from a conductive to an adiabatic geotherm.

The evolution of Titan's high-altitude aerosols under ultraviolet irradiation	NATURE ASTRONOMY												The Cassini-Huygens space mission revealed that Titan's thick brownish haze is initiated high in the atmosphere at an altitude of about 1,000 km, before a slow transportation down to the surface. Close to the surface, at altitudes below 130 km, the Huygens probe provided information on the chemical composition of the haze. So far, we have not had insights into the possible photochemical evolution of the aerosols making up the haze during their descent. Here, we address this atmospheric aerosol aging process, simulating in the laboratory how solar vacuum ultraviolet irradiation affects the aerosol optical properties as probed by infrared spectroscopy. An important evolution was found that could explain the apparent contradiction between the nitrogen-poor infrared spectroscopic signature observed by Cassini below 600 km of altitude in Titan's atmosphere and a high nitrogen content as measured by the aerosol collector and pyrolyser of the Huygens probe at the surface of Titan.

Here we report on retrieved haze extinction profiles that reveal a depleted layer (having a diminished aerosol content), visually manifested as a gap between the main haze and a thin, detached upper layer. Our measurements show the disappearance of the feature in 2012 and its reappearance in 2016, as well as details after the reappearance. These observations highlight the dynamical nature of the detached haze. The reappearance seems congruent with earlier descriptions by climate models but more complex than previously described. It occurs in two steps, first as haze reappearing at 450 +/- 20 km and one year later at 510 +/- 20 km. These observations provide additional tight and valuable constraints about the underlying mechanisms, especially for Titan's mesosphere, that control Titan's haze cycle.				; Seignovert, Benoit/N-9805-2016	RANNOU, pascal/0000-0003-0836-723X; Turtle, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1423-5751; Seignovert, Benoit/0000-0001-6533-275X												2397-3366					JUN	2018	2	6					495	500		10.1038/s41550-018-0434-z							WOS:000434357700020

Ancient Martian aeolian processes and palaeomorphology reconstructed from the Stimson formation on the lower slope of Aeolis Mons, Gale crater, Mars	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental context of Martian sedimentary rocks is central to studies of ancient Martian habitability and regional palaeoclimate history. This paper reports the analysis of a distinct aeolian deposit preserved in Gale crater, Mars, and evaluates its palaeomorphology, the processes responsible for its deposition, and its implications for Gale crater geological history and regional palaeoclimate. Whilst exploring the sedimentary succession cropping out on the northern flank of Aeolis Mons, Gale crater, the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity encountered a decametre-thick sandstone succession, named the Stimson formation, unconformably overlying lacustrine deposits of the Murray formation. The sandstone contains sand grains characterized by high roundness and sphericity, and cross-bedding on the order of 1m in thickness, separated by sub-horizontal bounding surfaces traceable for tens of metres across outcrops. The cross-beds are composed of uniform thickness cross-laminations interpreted as wind-ripple strata. Cross-sets are separated by sub-horizontal bounding surfaces traceable for tens of metres across outcrops that are interpreted as dune migration surfaces. Grain characteristics and presence of wind-ripple strata indicate deposition of the Stimson formation by aeolian processes. The absence of features characteristic of damp or wet aeolian sediment accumulation indicate deposition in a dry aeolian system. Reconstruction of the palaeogeomorphology suggests that the Stimson dune field was composed largely of simple sinuous crescentic dunes with a height of ca 10m, and wavelengths of ca 150m, with local development of complex dunes. Analysis of cross-strata dip azimuths indicates that the general dune migration direction and hence net sediment transport was towards the north-east. The juxtaposition of a dry aeolian system unconformably above the lacustrine Murray formation represents starkly contrasting palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions. Stratigraphic relationships indicate that this transition records a significant break in time, with the Stimson formation being deposited after the Murray formation and stratigraphically higher Mount Sharp group rocks had been buried, lithified and subsequently eroded.

Species Entropies in the Kinetic Range of Collisionless Plasma Turbulence: Particle-in-cell Simulations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the forward cascade of decaying turbulence in the relatively short-wavelength kinetic range have been carried out as initial-value problems on collisionless, homogeneous, magnetized electron-ion plasma models. The simulations have addressed both whistler turbulence at beta(i) = beta(e) = 0.25 and kinetic Alfven turbulence at beta(i) = beta(e) = 0.50, computing the species energy dissipation rates as well as the increase of the Boltzmann entropies for both ions and electrons as functions of the initial dimensionless fluctuating magnetic field energy density epsilon(o) in the range 0 <= epsilon(o) <= 0.50. This study shows that electron and ion entropies display similar rates of increase and that all four entropy rates increase approximately as eo, consistent with the assumption that the quasilinear premise is valid for the initial conditions assumed for these simulations. The simulations further predict that the time rates of ion entropy increase should be substantially greater for kinetic Alfven turbulence than for whistler turbulence.					Gary, S.

Kuiper belt analogues in nearby M-type planet-host systems	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We present the results of a Herschel survey of 21 late-type stars that host planets discovered by the radial velocity technique. The aims were to discover new discs in these systems and to search for any correlation between planet presence and disc properties. In addition to the known disc around GJ 581, we report the discovery of two new discs, in the GJ 433 and GJ 649 systems. Our sample therefore yields a disc detection rate of 14 per cent, higher than the detection rate of 1.2 per cent among our control sample of DEBRIS M-type stars with 98 per cent confidence. Further analysis however shows that the disc sensitivity in the control sample is about a factor of two lower in fractional luminosity than for our survey, lowering the significance of any correlation between planet presence and disc brightness below 98 per cent. In terms of their specific architectures, the disc around GJ 433 lies at a radius somewhere between 1 and 30 au. The disc around GJ 649 lies somewhere between 6 and 30 au, but is marginally resolved and appears more consistent with an edge-on inclination. In both cases the discs probably lie well beyond where the known planets reside (0.06-1.1 au), but the lack of radial velocity sensitivity at larger separations allows for unseen Saturn-mass planets to orbit out to similar to 5 au, and more massive planets beyond 5 au. The layout of these M-type systems appears similar to Sun-like star + disc systems with low-mass planets.

Calibration of colour gradient bias in shear measurement using HST/CANDELS data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Accurate shape measurements are essential to infer cosmological parameters from large area weak gravitational lensing studies. The compact diffraction-limited point spread function (PSF) in space-based observations is greatly beneficial, but its chromaticity for a broadband observation can lead to new subtle effects that could hitherto be ignored: the PSF of a galaxy is no longer uniquely defined and spatial variations in the colours of galaxies result in biases in the inferred lensing signal. Taking Euclid as a reference, we show that this colour gradient bias (CG bias) can be quantified with high accuracy using available multicolour Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In particular we study how noise in the HST observations might impact such measurements and find this to be negligible. We determine the CG bias using HST observations in the F606W and F814W filters and observe a correlation with the colour, in line with expectations, whereas the dependence with redshift is weak. The biases for individual galaxies are generally well below 1 per cent, which may be reduced further using morphological information from the Euclid data. Our results demonstrate that CG bias should not be ignored, but it is possible to determine its amplitude with sufficient precision, so that it will not significantly bias the weak lensing measurements using Euclid data.

Mineral commodity markets are multidimensional as they are driven by the dynamic evolution of financial, technological, psychological and geopolitical factors. Thus, identifying the key features governing mineral commodity prices and modelling their long-term behaviour is an intricate problem that becomes even more complex when the relationship with time is also considered. Although several techniques are available to represent the behaviour and reduce the dimensionality of data sets, these techniques often neglect the temporal relationship and evolution of variables. In many cases, the selection of key variables is solely based on the correlation with each other, relevance and degree of variance, and the cause and effect behaviour of the time-relation of variables, is neglected. This is a critical issue in assessing dynamic systems, especially those involving human behaviour such as social sciences and biology where learning and cognition capacities evolve through time. In this sense, before any attempt to forecast mineral commodity prices, a proper understanding of the embedding dimension and time delay of the variables governing the system is fundamental to determining the number of key features driving the system and the extension of the delayed effects of changes in the initial conditions, respectively. Determining these parameters may become even more complicated because of data scarcity, since the high cost, technical or temporal limitations often hamper obtaining large data sets related to complex dynamic systems that occur in nature and the social sciences. Daily and monthly quotations have been commonly used to represent the dynamics of mineral commodity markets and predict prices, yet they are not sufficient to capture and understand the dynamic evolution of prices in the long-term. These quotations are too short as the delayed effects that reflect on the entire economy and arises from changes in macroeconomic variables can normally be perceived about a year ahead, and may last for up to six years. However, chaos theory has provided valuable tools to assess the dynamics of complex systems allowing the proper determination of the embedding parameters (dimension and time delay), even when using small data sets. This paper examines the long-term dynamics of mineral commodity prices via chaos theory based on a short data set of annual copper prices observed between 1900 and 2015. Copper was used as a study case because it is one of the most competitive markets and representative of mineral commodities traded worldwide. It was found that the dynamic-deterministic behaviour of annual copper prices is embedded in a high-dimensional space that fluctuates between five and seven, and a relatively short time delay between two and three periods. Our finding argues for the use of chaos theory as an important technique to assess the long-term behaviour of mineral commodity prices using short data sets because it improves the understanding of those complex dynamic systems and provides important guidelines that remarkably simplifies the forecasting task.

J	Utsumi, N; Kim, H				Utsumi, Nobuyuki; Kim, Hyungjun			Warm Season Satellite Precipitation Biases for Different Cloud Types Over Western North Pacific	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Two along-track (level 2) satellite precipitation retrievals by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) and the Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar Ku-band (DPR-Ku) and two multisatellite precipitation products, global satellite mapping of precipitation (GSMaP) and Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), are intercompared for different cloud types during warm season over the western North Pacific region. It is found that the biases of the precipitation measurements are systematically associated with cloud types. The best agreements of passive microwave (PMW) products and infrared-based (IR) products with satellite radar-based estimates are found for a relatively weak precipitation range for mid-low clouds (except over land) and high clouds, while similar agreement is found for heavier precipitation range for deep convection regardless of surface type. Precipitation from mid-low clouds over land is considerably underestimated by PMW and IR products over almost the entire intensity range. The IR-based precipitation estimates for deep convective clouds considerably overestimate the intensity for both weak precipitation and cases where precipitation was not detected by the DPR-Ku algorithm. The findings reveal the characteristics of the biases of the products depend on the associated cloud types, which suggests consideration of the cloud type information to improve satellite-based precipitation estimates.

J	Chiow, SW; Yu, N				Chiow, Sheng-wey; Yu, Nan			Compact atom interferometer using single laser	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS												A typical atom interferometer requires vastly different laser frequencies at different stages of operation, e.g., near resonant light for laser cooling and far detuned light for atom optics, such that multiple lasers are typically employed. The number of laser units constrains the achievable minimum size and power in practical devices for resource critical environments such as space. We demonstrate a compact atom interferometer accelerometer operated by a single diode laser. This is achieved by dynamically changing the laser output frequency in GHz range while maintaining spectroscopic reference to an atomic transition via a sideband generated by phase modulation. At the same time, a beam path sharing configuration is also demonstrated for a compact sensor head design, in which atom interferometer beams share the same path as that of the cooling beam. This beam path sharing also significantly simplifies three-axis atomic accelerometry in microgravity using single sensor head.																	0946-2171	1432-0649				JUN	2018	124	6							96	10.1007/s00340-018-6965-2							WOS:000432902100005

OCO-2 operational data processing uses optimal estimation (OE), a state-of-the-art approach to inference of atmospheric properties from satellite measurements. One of the main advantages of the OE approach is computational efficiency, but it only characterizes the first two moments of the posterior distribution of interest. Here we obtain samples from the posterior using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and compare this empirical estimate of the true posterior to the OE results. We focus on 600 simulated soundings that represent the variability of physical conditions encountered by OCO-2 between November 2014 and January 2016. We treat the two retrieval methods as ensemble and density probabilistic forecasts, where the MCMC yields an ensemble from the posterior and the OE retrieval result provide the first two moments of a normal distribution. To compare these methods, we apply both univariate and multivariate diagnostic tools and proper scoring rules. The general impression from our study is that when compared to MCMC, the OE retrieval performs reasonably well for the main quantity of interest, the column-averaged concentration , but not for the full state vector which includes a profile of concentrations over 20 pressure levels, as well as several other atmospheric properties.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

Detection of HOCO+ in the protostar IRAS 16293-2422	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												The protonated form of CO2, HOCO+, is assumed to be an indirect tracer of CO2 in the millimeter/submillimeter regime since CO2 lacks a permanent dipole moment. Here, we report the detection of two rotational emission lines (4(0,4)-3(0,3) and 5(0,5)-4(0.4)) of HOCO+ in IRAS 16293-2422. For our observations, we have used EMIR heterodyne 3 mm receiver of the IRAM 30 m telescope. The observed abundance of HOCO+ is compared with the simulations using the 3-phase NAUTILUS chemical model. Implications of the measured abundances of HOCO+ to study the chemistry of CO2 ices using JWST-MIRI and NIRSpec are discussed as well.				; Majumdar, Liton/F-6759-2014	Gratier, Pierre/0000-0002-6636-4304; Majumdar, Liton/0000-0001-7031-8039												0035-8711	1365-2966				JUN	2018	477	1					525	530		10.1093/mnras/sty703							WOS:000432660300035

Single sources in the low-frequency gravitational wave sky: properties and time to detection by pulsar timing arrays	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We calculate the properties, occurrence rates and detection prospects of individually resolvable 'single sources' in the low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. Our simulations use the population of galaxies and massive black hole binaries from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, coupled to comprehensive semi-analytic models of the binary merger process. Using mock pulsar timing arrays (PTA) with, for the first time, varying red-noise models, we calculate plausible detection prospects for GW single sources and the stochastic GW background (GWB). Contrary to previous results, we find that single sources are at least as detectable as the GW background. Using mock PTA, we find that these 'foreground' sources (also 'deterministic'/'continuous') are likely to be detected with similar to 20 yr total observing baselines. Detection prospects, and indeed the overall properties of single sources, are only moderately sensitive to binary evolution parameters namely eccentricity and environmental coupling, which can lead to differences of 5 yr in times to detection. Red noise has a stronger effect, roughly doubling the time to detection of the foreground between a white-noise only model (similar to 10-15 yr) and severe red noise (similar to 20-30 yr). The effect of red noise on the GWB is even stronger, suggesting that single source detections may be more robust. We find that typical signal-to-noise ratios for the foreground peak near f = 0.1 yr(-1), and are much less sensitive to the continued addition of new pulsars to PTA.

CARMA observations have been combined with single-dish data from the Nobeyama 45 m telescope to provide extended images at about 0.01 pc resolution, with a dynamic range of approximately 1200 in spatial scale. Here we describe the practical details of the data combination in uv space, including flux scale matching, the conversion of single-dish data to visibilities, and joint deconvolution of single-dish and interferometric data. A Delta-variance analysis indicates that no artifacts are caused by combining data from the two instruments. Initial analysis of the data cubes, including moment maps, average spectra, channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, excitation temperature, column density, and line ratio maps, provides evidence of complex and interesting structures such as filaments, bipolar outflows, shells, bubbles, and photo-eroded pillars. The implications for star formation processes are profound, and follow-up scientific studies by the CARMA-NRO Orion team are now underway.

Consistency of seven different GNSS global ionospheric mapping techniques during one solar cycle	JOURNAL OF GEODESY												In the context of the International GNSS Service (IGS), several IGS Ionosphere Associated Analysis Centers have developed different techniques to provide global ionospheric maps (GIMs) of vertical total electron content (VTEC) since 1998. In this paper we present a comparison of the performances of all the GIMs created in the frame of IGS. Indeed we compare the classical ones (for the ionospheric analysis centers CODE, ESA/ESOC, JPL and UPC) with the new ones (NRCAN, CAS, WHU). To assess the quality of them in fair and completely independent ways, two assessment methods are used: a direct comparison to altimeter data (VTEC-altimeter) and to the difference of slant total electron content (STEC) observed in independent ground reference stations (dSTEC-GPS). The main conclusion of this study, performed during one solar cycle, is the consistency of the results between so many different GIM techniques and implementations.

While it is largely characterized by equatorially eastward propagation during the boreal winter, MJO convection undergoes marked poleward movement over the Asian monsoon region during summer, producing a significant modulation of monsoon rainfall. In classical MJO theories that seek to interpret the distinct seasonality in MJO propagation features, the role of equatorial wave dynamics has been emphasized for its eastward propagation, whereas coupling between MJO convection and the mean monsoon flow is considered essential for its northward propagation. In this study, a unified physical framework based on the moisture mode theory, is offered to explain the seasonality in MJO propagation. Moistening and drying caused by horizontal advection of the lower-tropospheric mean moisture by MJO winds, which was recently found to be critical for the eastward propagation of the winter MJO, is also shown to play a dominant role in operating the northward propagation of the summer MJO. The seasonal variations in the mean moisture pattern largely shape the distinct MJO propagation in different seasons. The critical role of the seasonally varying climatological distribution of moisture for the MJO propagation is further supported by the close association between model skill in representing the MJO propagation and skill at producing the lower-tropospheric mean moisture pattern. This study thus pinpoints an important direction for climate model development for improved MJO representation during all seasons.

Using the ferroelectric/ferroelastic effect at cryogenic temperatures for set-and-hold actuation	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES												The ferroelectric and ferroelastic properties of lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) based stack actuators have been characterized at temperatures down to 25 K and under various levels of constant compressive stress. Experiments indicate that the coercive field and magnitude of strain at the coercive field display an inverse relationship with temperature. A factor of 5.5 increase in coercive field, and a factor of 4.3 increase in strain is observed at 25 K in comparison to the room-temperature conditions. This information was used to induce non-180 degrees domain wall motion in the material through the application of electric fields at or near the coercive field. The change in remanent strain accompanying these effects was shown to increase in magnitude as temperature decreased, reaching values of 2000 ppm at 25 K. This behavior was also shown to be temporally stable even under compressive loads. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the material can be returned to its original strain state through a repolarizing electric field. This switchable behavior could be exploited for future set-and-hold type actuators operating at cryogenic temperatures.

J	Moses, JI; Fletcher, LN; Greathouse, TK; Orton, GS; Hue, V				Moses, Julianne I.; Fletcher, Leigh N.; Greathouse, Thomas K.; Orton, Glenn S.; Hue, Vincent			Seasonal stratospheric photochemistry on Uranus and Neptune	ICARUS												A time-variable 1D photochemical model is used to study the distribution of stratospheric hydrocarbons as a function of altitude, latitude, and season on Uranus and Neptune. The results for Neptune indicate that in the absence of stratospheric circulation or other meridional transport processes, the hydrocarbon abundances exhibit strong seasonal and meridional variations in the upper stratosphere, but that these variations become increasingly damped with depth due to increasing dynamical and chemical time scales. At high altitudes, hydrocarbon mixing ratios are typically largest where the solar insolation is the greatest, leading to strong hemispheric dichotomies between the summer-to-fall hemisphere and winter to-spring hemisphere. At mbar pressures and deeper, slower chemistry and diffusion lead to latitude variations that become more symmetric about the equator. On Uranus, the stagnant, poorly mixed stratosphere confines methane and its photochemical products to higher pressures, where chemistry and diffusion time scales remain large. Seasonal variations in hydrocarbons are therefore predicted to be more muted on Uranus, despite the planet's very large obliquity. Radiative-transfer simulations demonstrate that latitude variations in hydrocarbons on both planets are potentially observable with future JWST mid infrared spectral imaging. Our seasonal model predictions for Neptune compare well with retrieved C2H2 and C2H6 abundances from spatially resolved ground-based observations (no such observations currently exist for Uranus), suggesting that stratospheric circulation which was not included in these models may have little influence on the large-scale meridional hydrocarbon distributions on Neptune, unlike the situation on Jupiter and Saturn.

Stepped fans and facies-equivalent phyllosilicates in Coprates Catena, Mars	ICARUS												Stepped fan deposits and phyllosilicate mineralogies are relatively common features on Mars but have not previously been found in association with each other. Both of these features are widely accepted to be the result of aqueous processes, but the assumed role and nature of any water varies. In this study we have investigated two stepped fan deposits in Coprates Catena, Mars, which have a genetic link to light toned material that is rich in Fe-Mg phyllosilicate phases. Although of different sizes and in separate, but adjacent, trough-like depressions, we identify similar features at these stepped fans and phyllosilicates that are indicative of similar formation conditions and processes. Our observations of the overall geomorphology, mineralogy and chronology of these features are consistent with a two stage formation process, whereby deposition in the troughs first occurs into shallow standing water or playas, forming fluvial or alluvial fans that terminate in delta deposits and interfinger with interpreted lacustrine facies, with a later period of deposition under sub-aerial conditions, forming alluvial fan deposits. We suggest that the distinctive stepped appearance of these fans is the result of aeolian erosion, and is not a primary depositional feature. This combined formation framework for stepped fans and phyllosilicates can also explain other similar features on Mars, and adds to the growing evidence of fluvial activity in the equatorial region of Mars during the Hesperian and Amazonian.

Impact of non-migrating tides on the low latitude ionosphere during a sudden stratospheric warming event in January 2010	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												The lower atmosphere contributes significantly to the day-to-day variability of the ionosphere, especially during solar minimum conditions. Ionosphere/atmosphere model simulations that incorporate meteorology from data assimilation analysis products can be critically important for elucidating the physical processes that have substantial impact on ionospheric weather. In this study, the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, extended version with specified dynamics (SD-WACCM-X) is coupled with an ionospheric model (Sami3 is Another Model of the Ionosphere) to study day-to-day variability in the ionosphere during January 2010. Lower atmospheric weather patterns are introduced into the SAMI3/SD-WACCM-X simulations using the 6-h Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System-Advanced Level Physics High Altitude (NOGAPS-ALPHA) data assimilation products. The same time period is simulated using the new atmospheric forecast model, the High Altitude Navy Global Environmental Model (HA-NAVGEM), a hybrid 4D-Var prototype data assimilation with the ability to produce meteorological fields at a 3-h cadence. Our study shows that forcing SD-WACCM-X with HA-NAVGEM better resolves the semidiurnal tides and introduces more day-to-day variability into the ionosphere than forcing with NOGAPS-ALPHA. The SAMI3/SD-WACCM-X/HA-NAVGEM simulation also more accurately captures the longitudinal variability associated with non-migrating tides in the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) region as compared to total electron content (TEC) maps derived from GPS data. Both the TEC maps and the SAMI3/SD-WACCM-X/HA-NAVGEM simulation show an enhancement in TEC over South America during 17-21 January 2010, which coincides with the commencement of a stratospheric warming event on 19 January 2010. Analysis of the SAMI3/SD-WACCM-X/HA-NAVGEM simulations indicates non-migrating tides (including DW4, DE2 and SW5) played a role during 17-21 January in shifting the phase of the wave-3 pattern in the ionosphere on these days. Constructive interference of wave-3 and wave-4 patterns in the E x B drifts contributed to the enhanced TEC in the South American longitude sector. The results of the study highlight the importance of high fidelity meteorology in understanding the day-to-day variability of the ionosphere.

The original SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) was corrected by modelling the respective effects of landform and land cover on its errors and then subtracted from a TanDEM-X DSM to produce a SAR CHM. Among all the landform factors, the terrain curvature had the largest effect on SRTM elevation errors, with a r(2) of 0.29. The NDSI was the best predictor of the residual SRTM land cover error, with a r(2) of 0.30. The final SAR CHM had a RMSE of 2.45 m, with a bias of 0.07 m, compared to a lidar-based CHM. An AGB prediction model was developed based on a combination of the SAR CHM, TanDEM-X coherence, Landsat 8 NDVI, and other vegetation indices of RVI, DVI, GRVI, EVI, LAI, GNDVI, SAVI, GVI, Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness. The best results were obtained using a Random forest regression algorithm, at the stand level, yielding a RMSE of 26 Mg ha (-1) (34% of average biomass), with a r(2) of 0.62. This method has the potential of creating spatially continuous biomass maps over entire biomes using only spaceborne sensors and requiring only low-intensity calibration.																	0303-2434					JUN	2018	68						202	213		10.1016/j.jag.2017.12.004							WOS:000429398500018

Observed diurnal variations in Mars Science Laboratory Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons passive mode data	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												The Mars Science Laboratory Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) experiment measures the martian neutron leakage flux in order to estimate the amount of water equivalent hydrogen present in the shallow regolith. When DAN is operating in passive mode, it is sensitive to neutrons produced through the interactions of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) with the regolith and atmosphere and neutrons produced by the rover's Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). During the mission, DAN passive mode data were collected over the full diurnal cycle at the locations known as Rocknest (sols 60-100) and John Klein (sols 166-272). A weak, but unexpected, diurnal variation was observed in the neutron count rates reported at these locations. We investigate different hypotheses that could be causing these observed variations. These hypotheses are variations in subsurface temperature, atmospheric pressure, the exchange of water vapor between the atmosphere and regolith, and instrumental effects on the neutron count rates. Our investigation suggests the most likely factors contributing to the observed diurnal variations in DAN passive data are instrumental effects and time-variable preferential shielding of alpha particles, with other environmental effects only having small contributions.

Here we quantify 34 trends in terrestrial water storage observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites during 2002-2016 and categorize their drivers as natural interannual variability, unsustainable groundwater consumption, climate change or combinations thereof. Several of these trends had been lacking thorough investigation and attribution, including massive changes in northwestern China and the Okavango Delta. Others are consistent with climate model predictions. This observation-based assessment of how the world's water landscape is responding to human impacts and climate variations provides a blueprint for evaluating and predicting emerging threats to water and food security.

The X-CO2, product has been validated with collocated ground-based measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) for almost 2 years of OCO-2 data from September 2014 to July 2016. We found that fitting an additive radiometric offset in all three spec tral bands of OCO-2 significantly improved the retrieval. Based on a small correlation of the X-CO2, error over land with goodness of fit, we applied an a posteriori bias correction to our OCO-2 retrievals. In overpass averaged results, X-CO2, retrievals have an SD of similar to 1.30 ppm and a station-tostation variability of similar to 0.40 ppm among collocated TCCON sites. The seasonal relative accuracy (SRA) has a value of 0.52 ppm. The validation shows relatively larger difference with TCCON over high-latitude areas and some specific regions like Japan.

Band Formation and Ocean-Surface Interaction on Europa and Ganymede	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Geologic activity in the outer H2O ice shells of Europa and Ganymede, Galilean moons of Jupiter, may facilitate material exchange between global water oceans and the icy surface, fundamentally affecting potential habitability and the future search for life. Spacecraft imagery reveals surfaces rich with tectonic bands, predominantly attributed to the extension of brittle ice overlaying a convecting ice layer. However, the details of band-forming processes and links to potential ocean-surface exchange have remained elusive. We simulate ice shell faulting and convection with two-dimensional numerical models and track the movement of "fossil" ocean material frozen into the base of the ice shell and deformed through geologic time. We find that distinct band types form within a spectrum of extensional terrains correlated to lithosphere strength, governed by lithosphere thickness and cohesion. Furthermore, we find that smooth bands formed in weak lithosphere promote exposure of fossil ocean material at the surface.

Exposed bright features on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko: distribution and evolution	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Since its arrival at the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014, the Rosetta spacecraft followed the comet as it went past the perihelion and beyond until September 2016. During this time there were many scientific instruments operating on board Rosetta to study the comet and its evolution in unprecedented detail. In this context, our study focusses on the distribution and evolution of exposed bright features that have been observed by OSIRIS, which is the scientific imaging instrument aboard Rosetta. Aims. We envisage investigating various morphologies of exposed bright features and the mechanisms that triggered their appearance. Methods. We co-registered multi-filter observations of OSIRIS images that are available in reflectance. The Lommel-Seeliger disk function was used to correct for the illumination conditions and the resulting colour cubes were used to perform spectrophotometric analyses on regions of interest. Results. We present a catalogue of 57 exposed bright features observed on the nucleus of the comet, all of which are attributed to the presence of H2O ice on the comet. Furthermore, we categorise these patches under four different morphologies and present geometric albedos for each category. Conclusions. Although the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko appears to be dark in general, there are localised H2O ice sources on the comet. Cometary activity escalates towards the perihelion passage and reveals such volatile ices. We propose that isolated H2O ice patches found in smooth terrains in regions, such as Imhotep, Bes, and Hapi, result from frost as an aftermath of the cessation of the diurnal water cycle on the comet as it recedes from perihelion. Upon the comet's return to perihelion, such patches are revealed when sublimation-driven erosion removes the thin dust layers that got deposited earlier. More powerful activity sources such as cometary outbursts are capable of revealing much fresher, less contaminated H2O ice that is preserved with consolidated cometary material, as observed on exposed patches resting on boulders. This is corroborated by our albedo calculations that attribute higher albedos for bright features with formations related to outbursts.

Photopolarimetric Sensitivity to Black Carbon Content of Wildfire Smoke: Results From the 2016 ImPACT-PM Field Campaign	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Detailed characterization of the aerosol content of wildfire smoke plumes is typically performed through in situ aircraft observations, which have limited temporal and spatial coverage. Extending such observations to regional or global scales requires new remote sensing approaches, such as retrievals that make use of spectropolarimetric, multiangle imaging. In this work measurements made during the Imaging Polarimetric Assessment and Characterization of Tropospheric Particulate Matter (ImPACT-PM) field campaign in a smoke plume near the town of Lebec in Southern California by the Navy Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies Twin Otter aircraft on 8 July 2016 are used in conjunction with near-coincident measurements from the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft to assess the sensitivity of spectropolarimetric measurements to the black carbon content of the plume. Tracking visible features in the smoke through the sequence of AirMSPI observations allowed the height of the plume to be estimated through geometric techniques. Then, by constraining the fractional amounts of the aerosol constituents with the in situ data, radiative closure was obtained through simulations performed with a polarimetric radiative transfer code, demonstrating the ability to constrain the black carbon mass fraction to approximately 5%, given the uncertainties in the AirMSPI measurements and the assumption of external mixing of aerosol components. The AirMSPI retrieval, made using a limited set of observations from the 470 nm polarimetric spectral band alone, was also generally consistent with operational retrievals of aerosol optical depth and surface reflectance made by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm at 1km resolution. Plain Language Summary The sensitivity of polarimetric remote sensing imagery to the black carbon content of wildfire smoke was demonstrated using the results of a NASA field campaign that took place over central California in July 2016. The chemical contents of the smoke plume were measured by an aircraft flying inside the smoke. This information was used to build a model of the smoke that was then used to estimate what would be observed by the remote sensing instrument. Good agreement was achieved in terms of the total amount of aerosol, the brightness of the underlying surface, and the fraction of black carbon in the plume.

The impact of transport model differences on CO2 surface flux estimates from OCO-2 retrievals of column average CO2	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We estimate the uncertainty of CO2 flux estimates in atmospheric inversions stemming from differences between different global transport models. Using a set of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), we estimate this uncertainty as represented by the spread between five different state-of-the-art global transport models (ACTM, LMDZ, GEOS-Chem, PCTM and TM5), for both traditional in situ CO2 inversions and inversions of XCO2 estimates from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO2). We find that, in the absence of relative biases between in situ CO2 and OCO-2 XCO2, OCO-2 estimates of terrestrial flux for TRANSCOM-scale land regions can be more robust to transport model differences than corresponding in situ CO2 inversions. This is due to a combination of the increased spatial coverage of OCO-2 samples and the total column nature of OCO-2 estimates. We separate the two effects by constructing hypothetical in situ networks with the coverage of OCO-2 but with only near-surface samples. We also find that the transport-driven uncertainty in fluxes is comparable between well-sampled northern temperate regions and poorly sampled tropical regions. Furthermore, we find that spatiotemporal differences in sampling, such as between OCO-2 land and ocean soundings, coupled with imperfect transport, can produce differences in flux estimates that are larger than flux uncertainties due to transport model differences. This highlights the need for sampling with as complete a spatial and temporal coverage as possible (e.g., using both land and ocean retrievals together for OCO-2) to minimize the impact of selective sampling. Finally, our annual and monthly estimates of transport-driven uncertainties can be used to evaluate the robustness of conclusions drawn from real OCO-2 and in situ CO2 inversions.

An absolute sodium abundance for a cloud-free 'hot Saturn' exoplanet	NATURE												Broad absorption signatures from alkali metals, such as the sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) resonance doublets, have long been predicted in the optical atmospheric spectra of cloud-free irradiated gas giant exoplanets(1-3). However, observations have revealed only the narrow cores of these features rather than the full pressure-broadened profiles(4-6). Cloud and haze opacity at the day-night planetary terminator are considered to be responsible for obscuring the absorption-line wings, which hinders constraints on absolute atmospheric abundances(7-9). Here we report an optical transmission spectrum for the 'hot Saturn' exoplanet WASP-96b obtained with the Very Large Telescope, which exhibits the complete pressure-broadened profile of the sodium absorption feature. The spectrum is in excellent agreement with cloud-free, solar-abundance models assuming chemical equilibrium. We are able to measure a precise, absolute sodium abundance of log epsilon(Na) = 6.9(-0.4)(+0.6), and use it as a proxy for the planet's atmospheric metallicity relative to the solar value (Z(p)/Z(circle dot) = 2.3(-1.7)(+8.9)). This result is consistent with the mass-metallicity trend observed for Solar System planets and exoplanets(10-12).

NANOGrav Collaboration	The NANOGrav 11 Year Data Set: Pulsar-timing Constraints on the Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the newly released 11. year data set from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). While we find no evidence for a GWB, we place constraints on a population of inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, a network of decaying cosmic strings, and a primordial GWB. For the first time, we find that the GWB constraints are sensitive to the solar system ephemeris (SSE) model used and that SSE errors can mimic a GWB signal. We developed an approach that bridges systematic SSE differences, producing the first pulsar-timing array PTA) constraints that are robust against SSE errors. We thus place a 95% upper limit on the GW-strain amplitude of AGWB. < 1.45 x 10(-15) at a frequency of f = 1 yr(-1) for a fiducial f(-2/3) power-law spectrum and with interpulsar correlations modeled. This is a factor of similar to 2 improvement over the NANOGrav nine-year limit calculated using the same procedure. Previous PTA upper limits on the GWB (as well as their astrophysical and cosmological interpretations) will need revision in light of SSE systematic errors. We use our constraints to characterize the combined influence on the GWB of the stellar mass density in galactic cores, the eccentricity of SMBH binaries, and SMBH-galactic-bulge scaling relationships. We constrain the cosmic-string tension using recent simulations, yielding an SSE-marginalized 95% upper limit of G mu < 5.3 x 10(-11) -a factor of similar to 2 better than the published NANOGrav nine-year constraints. Our SSE-marginalized 95% upper limit on the energy density of a primordial GWB (for a radiation-dominated post-inflation universe) is Omega(GWB) h(2) < 3.4 x 10(-10)				Pennucci, Timothy/J-3688-2018	Pennucci, Timothy/0000-0001-5465-2889; Nice, David/0000-0002-6709-2566; Ray, Paul/0000-0002-5297-5278; Spiewak, Renee/0000-0002-6730-3298; Ng, Cherry/0000-0002-3616-5160; Huerta, Eliu/0000-0002-9682-3604; Crawford, Fronefield/0000-0002-2578-0360; Chatterjee, Shami/0000-0002-2878-1502; Baker, Paul T./0000-0003-2745-753X; Kaplan, David/0000-0001-6295-2881; Pol, Nihan/0000-0002-8826-1285; Simon, Joseph/0000-0003-1407-6607; Cordes, James/0000-0002-4049-1882												0004-637X	1538-4357				MAY 20	2018	859	1							47	10.3847/1538-4357/aabd3b							WOS:000432981500007

The polarization vectors are used to identify the orientation of the magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky at a resolution of 0.01 pc. We identify 10 subregions with distinct polarization fractions and angles in the 0.2 pc rho Oph-A core; some of them can be part of a coherent magnetic field structure in the rho Oph region. The results are consistent with previous observations of the brightest regions of rho Oph-A, where the degrees of polarization are at a level of a few percent, but our data reveal for the first time the magnetic field structures in the fainter regions surrounding the core where the degree of polarization is much higher (>5%). A comparison with previous near-infrared polarimetric data shows that there are several magnetic field components that are consistent at near-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we also derive magnetic field strengths in several subcore regions, which range from approximately 0.2 to 5 mG. We also find a correlation between the magnetic field orientations projected on the sky and the core centroid velocity components.
