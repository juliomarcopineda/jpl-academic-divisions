The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ultraviolet and optical is usually at the few tens of per cent level over timescales of hours to weeks(1). Recently, rare, more dramatic changes to the emission from accreting SMBHs have been observed, including tidal disruption events(2-5), 'changing look' AGNs(6-9) and other extreme variability objects(10,11). The physics behind the 're-ignition', enhancement and 'shut-down' of accretion onto SMBHs is not entirely understood. Here we present a rapid increase in ultraviolet-optical emission in the centre of a nearby galaxy, marking the onset of sudden increased accretion onto a SMBH. The optical spectrum of this flare, dubbed AT 2017bgt, exhibits a mix of emission features. Some are typical of luminous, unobscured AGNs, but others are likely driven by Bowen fluorescence-robustly linked here with high-velocity gas in the vicinity of the accreting SMBH. The spectral features and increased ultraviolet flux show little evolution over a period of at least 14 months. This disfavours the tidal disruption of a star as their origin, and instead suggests a longer-term event of intensified accretion. Together with two other recently reported events with similar properties, we define a new class of SMBH-related flares. This has important implications for the classification of different types of enhanced accretion onto SMBHs.

Assessing regional drought impacts on vegetation and evapotranspiration: a case study in Guanacaste, Costa Rica	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						agricultural land management; Costa Rica; drought response; ecosystem sensitivity; evapotranspiration; Guanacaste; remote sensing; vegetation index	ATMOSPHERE WATER FLUX; PART II; SATELLITE; EVAPORATION; RAINFALL; AGROFORESTRY; MANAGEMENT; TRMM; VALIDATION; RESPONSES	This research investigates ecological responses to drought by developing a conceptual framework of vegetation response and investigating how multiple measures of drought can improve regional drought monitoring. We apply this approach to a case study of a recent drought in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. First, we assess drought severity with the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) based on a 64-yr precipitation record derived from a combination of Global Precipitation Climatology Center data and satellite observations from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and Global Precipitation Measurement. Then, we examine spatial patterns of precipitation, vegetation greenness, evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and evaporative stress index (ESI) during the drought years of 2013, 2014, and 2015 relative to a baseline period (2002-2012). We compute wet season (May-October) anomalies for precipitation at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 30-m spatial resolution, and ET, PET and ESI derived with the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model at 1-km spatial resolution. We assess patterns of landscape response across years and land cover types including three kinds of forest (deciduous, old growth, and secondary), grassland, and cropland. Results show that rainfall in Guanacaste reached an all-time low in 2015 over a 64-yr record (wet season SPI = -3.46), resulting in NDVI declines. However, ET and ESI did not show significant anomalies relative to a baseline, drought-free period. Forests in the region exhibited lower water stress compared to grasslands and had smaller declines, and even some increases, in NDVI and ET during the drought period. This work highlights the value of using multiple measures to assess ecosystem responses to drought. It also suggests that agricultural land management has an opportunity to integrate these findings by emulating some of the characteristics of drought-resilient ecosystems in managed systems.

J	El Chamie, M; Yu, Y; Acikmese, B; Ono, M				El Chamie, Mahmoud; Yu, Yue; Acikmese, Behcet; Ono, Masahiro			Controlled Markov Processes With Safety State Constraints	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						Markov processes; dynamic programming; agents and autonomous systems; stochastic optimal control; constrained control; Markov decision processes; controlled Markov chains	CHAINS	This paper considers a Markov decision process (MDP) model with safety state constraints, which specify polytopic invariance constraints on the state probability distribution (pd) for all time epochs. Typically, in the MDP framework, safety is addressed indirectly by penalizing failure states through the reward function. However, such an approach does not allow imposing hard constraints on the state pd, which could be an issue for practical applications where the chance of failure must be limited to prescribed bounds. In this paper, we explicitly separate state constraints from the reward function. We provide analysis and synthesis methods to impose generalized safety constraints at all time epochs, unlike current constrained MDP approaches where such constraints can only be imposed on the stationary distributions. We show that, contrary to the unconstrained MDP policies, optimal safe MDP policies depend on the initial state pd. We present novel algorithms for both finite- and infinite-horizon MDPs to synthesize feasible decision-making policies that satisfy safety constraints for all time epochs and ensure that the performance is above a computable lower bound. Linear programming implementations of the proposed algorithms are developed, which are formulated by using the duality theory of convex optimization. A swarm control simulation example is also provided to demonstrate the use of proposed algorithms.

J	Ma, C; Liu, Y				Ma, Chi; Liu, Yang			Discovery of a zinc-rich mineral on the surface of lunar orange pyroclastic beads	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						Lunar orange beads; volcanic gas; vapor condensates; the Moon; zinc-rich mineral; gordaite	VOLCANIC GLASSES; WATER; GORDAITE; PRODUCTS; DEPOSITS; SAMPLES; COPPER	We present the first discovery of a Zn-rich mineral on the pristine surface of orange pyroclastic beads from Apollo sample 74220. This Zn-rich mineral is wide occurring, trigonal or hexagonal in shape, with a normalized composition of similar to 59 wt% Zn, similar to 26 wt% O (calculated), similar to 6 wt% S, similar to 5 wt% Na, and similar to 4 wt% Cl. The crystal morphology, homogeneity, and chemistry of individual grains are most consistent with gordaite, a zinc chlorohydroxosulfate mineral, showing an empirical formula of Na1.02Zn3.98[(SO4)(0.84)(OH)(0.30)](OH)(6)[Cl-0.50(OH)(0.50)]center dot nH(2)O, albeit the exact amounts of OH and H2O are uncertain. The pristine 74220 sample used in this study was only directly exposed to air for a cumulative period of 18 days before our study. The same Zn-rich crystals, examined 12 to 15 months apart, show no visible physical and chemical changes. Thus, this zinc-rich mineral likely formed through rapid alteration (oxidation and hydration) by terrestrial air of the original vapor-deposited Zn, Cl, S, and Na-bearing solids. The composition of the zinc-rich mineral indicates that the vapor condensates consist of metallic Zn and metallic Na with either ZnS or native S, and either ZnCl2 or NaCl. This is the first direct evidence that metallic Zn and Na are key components in the vapor condensates of lunar volcanic gas, which implies lunar volcanic gas may be under higher pressure than previously thought, and the gas composition may be different than previously inferred. Our study is also relevant to the collection, handling, curation, and sample preparation of returned samples from other planetary bodies.

Modeling yields a unique physical solution: a mid-M+M-dwarf binary with M-prim = 0.20 +/- 0.01 M-circle dot and M-sec = 0.16 +/- 0.01 M-circle dot, with projected separation of 2.0 +/- 0.3 au. The lens is only D-LS = 0.41 +/- 0.06 kpc in front of the source, making OB140962 a bulge lens and the most distant Spitzer binary lens to date. In contrast, because the Einstein radius (theta(E) = 0.143 +/- 0.007 mas) is unusually small, a standard Bayesian analysis, conducted in the absence of parallax information, would predict a brown dwarf binary. We compare the results of Bayesian analysis using two commonly used Galactic model priors to the measured values for a set of Spitzer lenses. We find all models tested predict lens properties consistent with the Spitzer data.

Ice front retreat of marine-terminating glaciers may, for example, lead to a loss in resistive stress, which ultimately results in glacier acceleration and thinning. Over the past decade, it has been suggested that such retreats may be triggered by warm and salty Atlantic Water, which is typically found at a depth below 200-300 m. An increase in subglacial water discharge at glacier ice fronts due to enhanced surface runoff may also be responsible for an intensification of undercutting and calving. An increase in ocean thermal forcing or subglacial discharge therefore has the potential to destabilize marine-terminating glaciers along the coast of Greenland. It remains unclear which glaciers are currently stable but may retreat in the future and how far inland and how fast they will retreat. Here, we quantify the sensitivity and vulnerability of marine-terminating glaciers along the northwest coast of Greenland (from 72.5 to 76 degrees N) to ocean forcing and subglacial discharge using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We rely on a parameterization of undercutting based on ocean thermal forcing and subglacial discharge and use ocean temperature and salinity from high-resolution ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II) simulations at the fjord mouth to constrain the ocean thermal forcing. The ice flow model includes a calving law based on a tensile von Mises criterion. We find that some glaciers, such as Dietrichson Gletscher or Alison Glacier, are sensitive to small increases in ocean thermal forcing, while others, such as Illullip Sermia or Cornell Gletscher, are remarkably stable, even in a + 3 degrees C ocean warming scenario. Under the most intense experiment, we find that Hayes Gletscher retreats by more than 50 km inland by 2100 into a deep trough, and its velocity increases by a factor of 3 over only 23 years. The model confirms that ice-ocean interactions can trigger extensive and rapid glacier retreat, but the bed controls the rate and magnitude of the retreat. Under current oceanic and atmospheric conditions, we find that this sector of the Greenland ice sheet alone will contribute more than 1 cm to sea level rise and up to 3 cm by 2100 under the most extreme scenario.

Cometary nuclei, the solid centres of comets, erode by ice sublimation when they are sufficiently close to the Sun, but the importance of a comet's internal structure on its erosion is unclear. Here we present three-dimensional analyses of images from the Rosetta mission to illuminate the process that shaped the Jupiter-family bilobate comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko over billions of years. We show that the comet's surface and interior exhibit shear-fracture and fault networks, on spatial scales of tens to hundreds of metres. Fractures propagate up to 500 m below the surface through a mechanically homogeneous material. Through fracture network analysis and stress modelling, we show that shear deformation generates fracture networks that control mechanical surface erosion, particularly in the strongly marked neck trough of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, exposing its interior. We conclude that shear deformation shapes and structures the surface and interior of bilobate comets, particularly in the outer Solar System where water ice sublimation is negligible.

Possible climate transitions from breakup of stratocumulus decks under greenhouse warming	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							LARGE-EDDY SIMULATIONS; EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; CLOUDS; EQUILIBRIUM; ATMOSPHERE; DYNAMICS; PROFILE; FUTURE; PHASE	Stratocumulus clouds cover 20% of the low-latitude oceans and are especially prevalent in the subtropics. They cool the Earth by shading large portions of its surface from sunlight. However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm. In addition to the warming from rising CO2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8 K globally and 10 K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.

Dynamic models of supershear earthquakes, which are faster than the speed of shear waves, often start at subshear speed and later run faster than Eshelby's speed. Here we present robust evidence of an early and persistent supershear rupture at the sub-Eshelby speed of the 2018 magnitude 7.5 Palu, Indonesia, earthquake. Slowness-enhanced back-projection of teleseismic data provides a sharp image of the rupture process, along a path consistent with the surface rupture trace inferred by subpixel correlation of synthetic-aperture radar and satellite optical images. The rupture propagated at a sustained velocity of 4.1 km s(-1) from its initiation to its end, despite large fault bends. The persistent supershear speed is further validated by seismological evidence of far-field Rayleigh Mach waves. The unusual features of this earthquake probe the connections between the rupture dynamics and fault structure. An early supershear transition could be promoted by fault roughness near the hypocentre. Steady rupture propagation at a speed unexpected in homogeneous media could result from the presence of a low-velocity damaged fault zone.

Arecibo radar observations of near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon during the 2017 apparition	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Radar; Observations; Minor planets; Asteroids; Near-Earth asteroids; Phaethon	SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; OBJECTS	We report Arecibo S-band (2380 MHz; 12.6 cm) radar observations of near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon during the December 2017 apparition when Phaethon passed within 0.07 au of Earth. Radar images with a resolution of 75 m per pixel reveal a roughly spheroidal shape more than 6 km in diameter at the equator with several discernible surface features hundreds of meters in extent. These include a possible crater more than 1 km across located below 30' latitude and a roughly 600-m radar-dark region near one of the poles. Overall, the radar images of Phaethon are reminiscent of those of (101955) Bennu, target of the OSIRIS-REx mission. As such, the shape of Phaethon is suspected to have an equatorial ridge similar to the top-shaped models of several other radar-observed near-Earth asteroids as well as the optical images of (162173) Ryugu returned by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. Preliminary analysis of the radar data finds no satellites and gives no indication of a dusty coma at the time of these observations.

Spitzer Team; MOA Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration; KWITNet Collaboration	Spitzer Microlensing Parallax for OGLE-2016-BLG-1067: A Sub-Jupiter Orbiting an M Dwarf in the Disk	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems	GALACTIC BULGE; OGLE-III; MASS PLANET; CONFIRMATION; PHOTOMETRY; SYSTEMS; THEOREM; EVENTS; STARS	We report the discovery of a sub-Jupiter-mass planet orbiting beyond the snow line of an M dwarf most likely in the Galactic disk as part of the joint Spitzer and ground-based monitoring of planetary microlensing anomalies toward the Galactic bulge. Most of the microlensing parameters are strongly constrained by the light-curve modeling, and in particular there is a Spitzer-based measurement of the microlens parallax, pi(E). However, there are no caustic crossings, so the angular Einstein radius has only an upper limit based on the light-curve modeling alone. Additionally, the analysis leads us to identify eight degenerate configurations: the fourfold microlensing parallax degeneracy being doubled by a degeneracy in the caustic structure present at the level of the ground-based solutions. To calculate the physical parameters, and at the same time to break the parallax degeneracy, we make use of a series of arguments: the chi(2) hierarchy, the Rich argument (stating that the small-parallax solution is more likely), and a prior Galactic model. The preferred configuration, favored by a likelihood ratio of at least 4000, is for a host at D-L= 3.73(-0.67)(+0.66 )kpc with mass M-L = 0.30(-0.12)(+0.15)M(circle dot), orbited by a Saturn-like planet with M-planet = 0.43(-0.17)(+0.21) M-Jup at projected separation a(perpendicular to) = 1.70(-0.39)(+0.38)au, about 2.1 times beyond the system snow line. Therefore, it adds to the growing population of sub-Jupiter planets orbiting beyond the snow line of M dwarfs discovered by microlensing. Based on the rules of the real-time protocol for the selection of events to be followed up with Spitzer, this planet will not enter the sample for measuring the Galactic distribution of planets.

Ceres' Occator crater and its faculae explored through geologic mapping	ICARUS			English	Article							SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; SURFACE; DEPOSITS; ORIGIN; ICE	Occator crater is one of the most recognizable features on Ceres because of its interior bright regions, which are called the Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae. Here we use high-resolution images from Dawn (similar to 35m/pixel) to create a detailed geologic map that focuses on the interior of Occator crater and its ejecta. Occator's asymmetric ejecta indicates that the Occator-forming impactor originated from the northwest at an angle of similar to 30-45 degrees, perhaps closer to similar to 30 degrees Some of Occator's geologic units are analogous to the units of other complex craters in the region: the ejecta, crater terrace material, hummocky crater floor material and talus material. The geologic units that make Occator unique are the bright Occator pit/fracture material (this is the unit that corresponds to the Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae) and the extensive, well-preserved lobate materials. We propose that the lobate materials are a slurry of impact-melted and non-impact-melted target material, which flowed around the crater interior before solidifying to form deposits geomorphologically consistent with impact melts elsewhere in the Solar System. We sub-divide the lobate materials on the basis of their surface textures. It is likely that knobby or smooth lobate materials form if the lobate material entrains or does not entrain blocks, respectively. Post-impact inflation is suggested to form the hummocky lobate material. The Vinalia Faculae formed within the hummocky lobate material. We find that the knobby lobate material and the outer edge of the Cerealia Facula formed prior to the central pit. The central dome formed after the formation of the central pit, while the majority of the Cerealia Facula (besides the outer edge) could have formed, continued to form and/or have been modified after the formation of the central pit. The Cerealia Facula may have initially been emplaced in a similar process to the Vinalia Faculae, and the surface of the Cerealia Facula appear to have somewhat darkened over time. The insights into Occator crater and its faculae derived from our geologic mapping will be synthesized together with inputs from all of the studies in this special issue in Scully et al. (2018a).

Occator crater in color at highest spatial resolution	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids; Composition; Surfaces; Mineralogy; Spectroscopy	CERES; VESTA	The geology of the outstanding crater Occator on Ceres has been studied by combining highest resolution color images and other information from the DAWN mission. Thus, surface and sub-surface layers and geologic processes can be understood and interpreted in a consistent manner. In order to achieve this, morphometry, absolute surface unit ages, color, and the distribution of foci of activity were the key data. These data show that the ascent of brine from reservoir(s) at depth and deposition of its salts on the surface persisted much longer than initially thought possible as an immediate result of the primary impact. The youngest depositional processes of bright material occurred less than 2 Ma ago. Also, the bright Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae are not the only traces of this activity; updoming is present on the southwestern crater floor. Faculae coincide with fractures and vents and indicate complex mechanisms of the deposition of bright carbonate-rich material. Due to the large age difference between the Occator impact itself, modeled cooling times of heated crater material, and the recent activity at the faculae we conclude that endogenic forces were lately acting. The distribution and thickness of surface and sub-surface brine layers are far from homogeneous in the upper crust beneath Occator. Further evidence regarding the distribution of materials has been derived from the distribution of the ejecta and the transition of ejecta to background material outside the crater.

Tectonic analysis of fracturing associated with occator crater	ICARUS			English	Article							DOME CRATERS; CENTRAL PIT; EMPLACEMENT; INTRUSIONS; MECHANICS; GANYMEDE; IMPACT; CERES	Occator crater, a Ceres crater that hosts multiple bright spots on its floor, has several sets of fractures associated with it. A tectonic analysis of each of these fracture sets suggests that the concentric and radial fractures around the central pit and the concentric fractures high on the crater wall (near the rim) most likely formed due to well known impact cratering processes. Uplift of the crater floor due to magmatic injection is suggested to have resulted in the concentric floor fractures at the base of the crater wall, as well as the cross-cutting fractures in the lower part of the southwestern wall. A mathematical analysis shows that a cryomagmatic plume (diapir) could have both reached the height necessary to cause fracturing within Occator, and that the stresses required are reasonable. Expansion a lobate flow from beneath is proposed to have formed those linear fractures associated with the Vinalia Faculae. Circumferential fractures surrounding Occator appear to have formed due to the volumetric compaction of the ejecta blanket over the buried pre-existing topography. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The various ages of Occator crater, Ceres: Results of a comprehensive synthesis approach	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids; Planetesimals; Cratering; Impact processes; Geological processes	SECONDARY CRATERS; EJECTA DEPOSITS; 4 VESTA; SURFACE; CHRONOLOGY; MARS; CONSTRAINTS; VARIABILITY; DIAMETER	The 90.5-km Occator crater, with its peculiar and unique bright spots, is one of the most prominent and renowned feature on Ceres. Occator attracted broad public attention in scientific media as it is proposed to exhibit signs of post-impact cryovolcanic activity. In order to understand the time sequence of deposition, several attempts were made during DAWN's primary mission by different research groups to date geomorphologic key units using superposed crater densities. Resulting absolute model formation ages for Occator's ejecta and its interior lobate deposits range from 200 Ma to 78 Ma and about 100 Ma to 6.9 Ma, but were based on different cratering chronology models, measurements on image data at varying resolution, and different statistical and methodological approaches. Here we present the results of a comprehensive approach of determining absolute model formation ages for Occator. This is achieved by using the best resolved Framing Camera image data, by careful treatment of secondary crater admixture and the natural variability of crater detection and sizes by different crater analysts, and by applying appropriate, objective criteria for count area selection. In this context, we evaluate previously published model ages and explain why our results are likely to yield more consistent and robust information about the formation age of Occator. We also show that, in contrast to previous publications, CSFDs measured on Occator's less competent ejecta blanket, and its more competent cryovolcanic- or impact melt related interior lobate deposits (ILDs), are so similar to each other, that the slight differences might rather be explained by different scaling parameters in different target materials or that the ILDs have formed almost contemporaneously or only shortly after the Occator forming impact.

Mineralogy of Occator crater on Ceres and insight into its evolution from the properties of carbonates, phyllosilicates, and chlorides	ICARUS			English	Article							SURFACE; DEPOSITS; VESTA	Occator Crater on dwarf planet Ceres hosts the so-called faculae, several areas with material 5 to 10 times the albedo of the average Ceres surface: Cerealia Facula, the brightest and largest, and several smaller faculae, Vinalia Faculae, located on the crater floor. The mineralogy of the whole crater is analyzed in this work. Spectral analysis is performed from data of the VIR instrument on board the Dawn spacecraft. We analyse spectral parameters of all main absorption bands, photometry, and continuum slope. Because most of the absorption features are located in a spectral range affected by thermal emission, we developed a procedure for thermal removal. Moreover, quantitative modeling of the measured spectra is performed with a radiative transfer model in order to retrieve abundance and grain size of the identified minerals. Unlike the average Ceres surface that contains a dark component, Mg-Ca-carbonate, Mg-phyllosilicates, and NH4-phyllosilicates, the faculae contain mainly Na-carbonate, Al-phyllosilicates, and NH4-chloride. The present work establishes unambiguously the presence of NH4-chloride thanks to the high-spatial resolution data. Vinalia and Cerealia Faculae show significant differences in the concentrations of these minerals, which have been analyzed. Moreover, heterogeneities are also found within Cerealia Facula that might reflect different deposition events of bright material. An interesting contrast in grain size is found between the center (10-60 mu m) and the crater floor/peripheral part of the faculae (100-130 mu m), pointing to different cooling time of the grains, respectively faster and slower, and thus to different times of emplacement. This implies the faculae formation is more recent than the crater impact event, consistent with other observations reported in this special issue. For some ejecta, we derived larger concentrations of minerals producing the absorption bands, and smaller grains with respect to the surrounding terrain. This may be related to heterogeneities in the material pre-existent to the impact event. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Raponi, A.; De Sanctis, M. C.; Carrozzo, F.

Photometry of Ceres and Occator faculae as inferred from VIR/Dawn data	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids; Photometry; Spectroscopy	RESOLVED PHOTOMETRY; GALILEO PHOTOMETRY; DARK MATERIAL; VESTA; DAWN; SURFACE; LUTETIA	Spectral parameters of Ceres measured by the Dawn/VIR imaging spectrometer are studied as a function of illumination angles, by applying a semi-empirical method based on a statistical analysis of the VIR dataset acquired up to September 2016. The study also focuses on the photometry of the Occator faculae, i.e. the brightest spots of the Ceres surface, showing an albedo up to eight times the Ceres average. The considered semi-empirical approach takes into account the small extension (and hence small dataset) of this region and lays the groundwork to apply scattering models even on such a limited area. The behavior of Ceres visible and infrared reflectance with phase angle is similar to other asteroids belonging to its same spectral class, i.e. C-type. The depth of the bands at 2.7 mu m (phyllosilicates), 3.1 mu m (ammonium), 3.4 mu m (magnesium carbonates) and the infrared spectral slope linearly increase with phase angle, showing analogies with other asteroids and occurrence of phase reddening. The different behavior of the 3.9 mu m band depth (also due to Mg carbonates), independent of illumination angles, could indicate that other carriers contribute to the 3.4 mu m band and play a more important role in photometry outside the carbonate deposits. The phase function of the Occator faculae is much steeper than expected from its high albedo. Mixture of bright and dark material and larger roughness can be at the basis of this result. The phyllosilicate bands show a steeper increase with phase angle with respect to the Ceres average, due to the lower presence of dark materials, and/or again larger roughness. The absence of trends with phase angles of the two carbonate bands and of the spectral slope suggests that carbonates do not produce phase reddening. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Post-impact thermal structure and cooling timescales of Occator crater on asteroid 1 Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids Impact Processes	HYDROCODE SIMULATION; WATER ICE; STRENGTH; SURFACE; DEPOSITS; IMPACTS	Occator crater is perhaps the most distinct surface feature observed by NASA's Dawn spacecraft on the Cerean surface. Contained within the crater are the highest albedo features on the planet, Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae, and relatively smooth lobate flow deposits. We present hydrocode simulations of the formation of Occator crater, varying the water to rock ratio of our pre-impact Cerean surface. We find that at water to rock mass ratios up to 0.3, sufficient volumes of Occator's post-impact subsurface would be above the melting point of water to allow for the deposition of faculae-like deposits via impact-heat driven hydrothermal effusion of brines. This reservoir of hydrothermally viable material beneath the crater is composed of a mixture of impactor material and material uplifted from 10's of kilometers beneath the pre-impact surface, which could sample a deep subsurface volatile reservoir, if present. Using a conductive cooling model, we estimate that the lifetime of hydrothermal activity within such a system, depending on choice of material constants, is between 0.4 and 4 Myr. Our results suggest that impact heating from the Occator forming impact provides a viable mechanism for the creation of the observed faculae, with the proviso that the faculae formed within a relatively short time window after the crater itself formed.

C.; Castillo-Rogez, Julie; Raymond, Carol A.; Schenk, Paul M.; Sizemor, Hanna G.; Sykes, Mark, V			A Possible Brine Reservoir Beneath Occator Crater: Thermal and Compositional Evolution and Formation of the Cerealia Dome and Vinalia Faculae	ICARUS			English	Article							STEEP-SIDED DOMES; UPHEAVAL DOME; LAVA FLOWS; WATER; VOLCANISM; ERUPTION; CONSTRAINTS; TEMPERATURE; ENCELADUS; PLUMES	The Dawn spacecraft has imaged several putative cryovolcanic features on Ceres, and several lines of evidence point to past cryovolcanic activity at Occator crater. It is therefore possible that cryovolcanism played a key role in delivering sodium carbonate- and chloride-enriched brines to Ceres' surface in recent geological times. The detection of a 200 km x 200 km negative Bouguer anomaly beneath Occator suggests the presence of a low-density region beneath the crater. If this region is a residual, partially crystallized, cryomagma chamber, excess pressures caused by its gradual freezing, or stresses produced by the Occator-forming impact, could have facilitated the delivery of cryolavas to the surface in the geologically recent past. Here, the progressive solidification of a cryomagma chamber beneath Occator and implications for the delivery of cryolavas to the surface has been explored. Models for the behavior of cryolavas at Ceres' surface, and for the formation of the Cerealia Dome and Vinalia Faculae, are also presented. Minimal crystallization of a subsurface fluid reservoir located at the crust-mantle boundary could have driven cryolavas enriched in chloride salts and NH3 to Ceres' surface. However, cryolavas enriched in sodium carbonates would have had to have existed at shallower levels in the crust in order to be delivered to the surface via pressure-driven ascent. Depending on the size of the reservoir, cryolavas could have been driven to Ceres' surface for tens to hundreds of millions of years after cooling of the cryomagma chamber commenced. The mineralogy at Occator is suggestive of subsurface cryomagma reservoirs enriched in sodium carbonate and chloride salts. Aqueous solutions enriched in chloride salts and/or ammonia would have arrived at the surface at warm enough temperatures to erupt if transported in propagating fractures that traveled at least 10(-5) m/s. Additionally, if the Cerealia Dome was formed from viscous cryolava extrusions, bulk kinematic lava viscosities may have been between 10(6)-10(8)m(2)/s at the onset of relaxation. Plausible relaxation times to form the dome, which are linked to bulk cryolava rheology, are found to have ranged from 2.5 to 273 days. Moreover, the low volatile content necessary to drive explosive eruptions on Ceres supports the possibility that Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae were emplaced as a consequence of ballistic eruptions. The enigmatic geology of Occator crater is consistent with a diversity of exchange processes operating on Ceres in the geologically recent past. Further, the processes that have occurred at Occator could shed light on the changing geology associated with a relic ocean world. Future studies of Occator and Ceres should be undertaken with these results in mind.

J	Thomas, EC; Vu, TH; Hodyss, R; Johnson, PV; Choukroun, M				Thomas, Elena C.; Vu, Tuan H.; Hodyss, Robert; Johnson, Paul, V; Choukroun, Mathieu			Kinetic effect on the freezing of ammonium-sodium-carbonate-chloride brines and implications for the origin of Ceres' bright spots	ICARUS			English	Article						Raman; Infrared; Composition; Ceres; Occator	RICH	Prominent bright spots containing natrite (Na2CO3) and smaller amounts of NH4Cl or NH4HCO3 observed in Ceres' Occator crater have been proposed to originate from an internal reservoir, where subsurface brines freeze upon reaching the surface. Our group has previously examined the freezing of putative subsurface brines containing ammonium, sodium, carbonate, and chloride ions at a cooling rate of 30 K/min (Vu et al., 2017), and found support for this hypothesis. The present study investigates this further by examining the formation of minerals on Ceres' surface upon kinetic vs thermodynamic freezing. Using Infrared and Raman spectroscopies, flash frozen brines were found to form predominantly ammonium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate, even in sodium-dominated solutions. In contrast, hydrohalite (NaCl center dot 2H(2)O) only formed when sodium and/or chloride were present in excess in the brine solutions. Additionally, the effect of vacuum exposure on these frozen brines was further analyzed to simulate the surface conditions of Ceres. It was observed that the vacuum exposure did not affect speciation, although it did clarify spectral features and confirm the presence of the aforementioned species. Our results provide evidence that (i) ammonium-bearing materials are kinetically-favored products under fast-freezing conditions with these brine mixtures, and (ii) the bright spots on Ceres's surface likely originate from subsurface liquids, mobilized either by a cryovolcanic process or by the Occator-forming impact, and not by direct excavation.

The formation and evolution of bright spots on Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Impact processes; Surface; Faculae	SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; DARK MATERIAL; VESTA; CRATER	The otherwise homogeneous surface of Ceres is dotted with hundreds of anomalously bright, predominantly carbonate-bearing areas, termed "faculae," with Bond albedos ranging from similar to 0.02 to >0.5. Here, we classify and map faculae globally to characterize their geological setting, assess potential mechanisms for their formation and destruction, and gain insight into the processes affecting the Ceres surface and near-surface. Faculae were found to occur in four distinct geological settings, associated predominantly with impact craters: (1) crater pits, peaks, or floor fractures (floor faculae), (2) crater rims or walls (rim/wall faculae), (3) bright ejecta blankets, and (4) the mountain Ahuna Mons. Floor faculae were identified in eight large, deep, and geologically young (asteroid-derived model (ADM) ages of <420 +/- 60 Ma) craters: Occator, Haulani, Dantu, Ikapati, Urvara, Gaue, Ernutet, and Azacca. The geometry and geomorphic features of the eight craters with floor faculae are consistent with facula formation via impact-induced heating and upwelling of volatile-rich materials, upwelling/excavation of heterogeneously distributed subsurface brines or their precipitation products, or a combination of both processes. Rim/wall faculae and bright ejecta occur in and around hundreds of relatively young craters of all sizes, and the geometry of exposures is consistent with facula formation via the excavation of subsurface bright material, possibly from floor faculae that were previously emplaced and buried. A negative correlation between rim/wall facula albedo and crater age indicates that faculae darken over time. Models using the Ceres crater production function suggest initial production or exposure of faculae by large impacts, subsequent dissemination of facula materials to form additional small faculae, and then burial by impact-induced lateral mixing, which destroys faculae over timescales of less than 1.25 Gyr. Cumulatively, these models and the observation of faculae limited to geologically young craters indicate relatively modern formation or exposure of faculae, indicating that Ceres' surface remains active and that the near surface may support brines in the present day.

Compositional differences among Bright Spots on the Ceres surface	ICARUS			English	Article							REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; SPECTRA; DARK; MARS	At the beginning of the Ceres investigation, the Dawn-NASA mission discovered a large bright spot (BS) in the Occator crater floor. Several other smaller bright spots were discovered during the following phases of the mission. In this paper, a complete survey for the detection of BS on the Ceres surface have been made by using the hyperspectral data acquired by Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR). The hyperspectral images span the spectral range from 0.2 to 5 mu m, by using two channel, the VIS channel with a spectral sampling of 1.8 nm and a IR channel with a spectral sampling of 9.8 nm. Finally a catalogue of 92 BS has been compiled and their compositional properties have been examined. In particular, five spectral parameters have been applied to perform the analysis: the photometrically corrected reflectance and four band depths, related to spectral absorptions at 2.7 mu m (OH fundamental indicative of phyllosilicates), at 3.05 pm (due to ammoniated clays), at 3.4 and 4.0 mu m (carbonate overtones). The 90% of BS are impact-related features (ejecta, crater rim, crater floor, crater wall). The two brightest BS, Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae, are located on the Occator crater floor. Most of BSs show features similar to the average Ceres surface, which has low reflectance and is composed of Mg-phyllosilicates and ammoniated clays, with a reduced abundance of Mg-Ca carbonates. Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae are a peculiar BS family, with a high abundance of Na-carbonates and Al-rich phyllosilicates. Oxo and a companion bright spot represents a third category, depleted in phyllosilicates and with a high to moderate albedo. Carbonate composition ranges from Mg/Ca to Na components. Haulani, Ernutet, Kupalo, and other two BS's represent another group, with intermediate properties between the typical BS and the Oxo family: they are moderately rich in carbonates and slightly depleted in Mg- and ammoniated phyllosilicates. The four families probably explain a single evolutionary path followed by the BS from the formation to their maturity: initially the very fresh bright spots would possess characteristics similar to Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae; with time, salts and OH volatilize and a light mixing with surrounding material would produce Oxo-like BS's; additional strong mixing would form Haulani-like BS, which finally become a typical bright spots.

C.; Russell, Christopher T.; Castillo-Rogez, Julie C.; Raymond, Carol A.; Jaumann, Ralf		Dawn Sci Team	Synthesis of the special issue: The formation and evolution of Ceres' Occator crater	ICARUS			English	Article							BRIGHT; SUBLIMATION; DEPOSITS	The distinctive bright regions within Occator crater are one of the most remarkable discoveries of the Dawn mission's exploration of Ceres. The central region is named Cerealia Facula and the additional regions in the eastern crater floor are named Vinalia Faculae. Here we summarize and synthesize the results of this special issue, which aimed to identify the driving forces behind the formation of Occator and the faculae, and thus lead us to a new understanding of the processes and conditions that occurred in Ceres' past, and potentially in its present. The investigations presented here used Dawn data, theoretical modeling and laboratory experiments to deduce the sequence of events that led to the formation of Occator, Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae, which are broken into stages 1-3. Stage 1: Occator's ejecta blanket, terraces and hummocky crater floor material formed during and shortly after crater formation. These features are located in many Cerean complex craters. However, Occator also contains the lobate materials and faculae, which are unique to Occator. We interpret the lobate materials as a slurry of water, soluble salts and boulders of unmelted silicates/salts, which flowed around the crater interior before solidifying. At least portions of the lobate materials were solidified prior to the formation of the central pit, which is suggested to form via the 'melted uplift model' and provides insights into central pit formation across the Solar System. We propose the outer edge of Cerealia Facula formed shortly after the Occator-forming impact, via impact-induced hydrothermal brine deposition or via salt-rich water fountaining (perhaps sourced in a pre-existing reservoir). Stage 2: the majority of Cerealia Facula is located within the central pit and is interpreted to have formed later, at least similar to 18 Myr after the Occator-forming impact, via multiple depositional events. The Cerealia-Facula-forming brines may have flowed out of fractures in the walls of the central pit and/or been driven to the surface by freezing of a subsurface reservoir and/or deposited via salt-rich water fountains. Further investigations are required to identify whether the formation of the majority of Cerealia Facula is driven by processes triggered by an impact, i.e. an exogenic event, or by a combination of impact-driven and endogenic processes. Cryomagmatic intrusions are suggested to uplift the crater floor, resulting in concentric floor fractures and an asymmetric dome. Injection of a similar material is proposed to inflate part of the lobate materials, giving them a hummocky texture. The resulting stresses formed fractures in the hummocky lobate material, which allowed the Vinalia-Faculae-forming brines to travel to the surface, where they ballistically erupted. The central dome within the central pit was one of the last features to form, by laccolithic intrusion, or by volume expansion from freezing of volatiles, or by extrusion of brines. Stage 3: mixing with Ceres' average materials and/or space weathering darken the faculae over time. Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae are the brightest and freshest of the bright regions identified on Ceres' surface. Bright regions darken over time until their eventual erasure. Thus, it is likely that faculae formation has occurred throughout Ceres' history, but that Occator's faculae are visible today because they are geologically young. Through synthesis of the studies presented in this special issue, we find that entirely exogenic driving forces, triggered by the impact, or a combination of endogenic and impact-derived forces could explain the formation of Occator and its faculae. Whether activity is impact-triggered and/or endogenic in nature is a key question for all investigations of Ceres, and future studies may favor one possibility over the other. The investigations presented in our special issue indicate Ceres is an active world where brines have been mobile in the geologically recent past. As such, Ceres is an intriguing world that we have only begun to explore.	[Scully, Jennifer E. C.; Thomas, E.

In this approach, the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer data from the Terra and Aqua satellites are used to perform broad-scale monitoring for flood tracking at the regional level (250 m/pixel) to generate flood detections/alerts. Based on these alerts, the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) mission is autonomously tasked to acquire higher-resolution (10-30 m/pixel) advanced land imager data, and a number of other assets have imagery automatically requested, with yet further assets requested only in a semiautomated fashion. Based on these alerts, these data are then automatically processed to derive products such as surface water extent and volumetric water estimates in shapefile formats to enable interpretation in geographic information systems. These products are then automatically pushed to organizations in Thailand for use in damage estimation, relief efforts, and damage mitigation. To date, Terra, Aqua, EO-1, Landsat, Ikonos, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Radarsat-2 have been used in some fashion in the sensor web. The overall autonomous detection, tasking, data acquisition, and processing sensor web framework are described, as well as ongoing work to extend to in situ sensor networks. How the automatic triggering of targeted higher-resolution observations enables higher temporal and spatial resolution tracking of flooding events is also documented.

Microbially influenced formation of Neoarchean ooids	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Archean; biosignature; microbialite; ooid; Tumbiana Formation	PILBARA-CRATON; LAKE GENEVA; ORGANIC-MATTER; STROMATOLITES; SUPERGROUP; DIVERSITY; SEDIMENTS; BIOMARKERS; AUSTRALIA; MICROBES	Ooids are accretionary grains commonly reported from turbulent, shallow-water environments. They have long been associated with microbially dominated ecosystems and often occur in close proximity to, or embedded within, stromatolites, yet have historically been thought to form solely through physicochemical processes. Numerous studies have revealed both constructive and destructive roles for microbes colonizing the surfaces of modern calcitic and aragonitic ooids, but there has been little evidence for the operation of these processes during the Archean and Proterozoic, when both ooids and microbially dominated ecosystems were more widespread. Recently described carbonate ooids from the 2.9 Ga Pongola Supergroup, South Africa, include well-preserved examples composed of diagenetic dolomite interpreted to have formed from a high-Mg-calcite precursor. Spatial distributions of organic matter and elements associated with metabolic activity (N, S, and P) were interpreted as evidence for a biologically induced origin. Here, we describe exceptionally well-preserved ooids composed of calcite, collected from Earth's oldest known carbonate lake system, the similar to 2.72 Ga Meentheena Member (Tumbiana Formation), Fortescue Group, Western Australia. We used optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, SEM-EDS, LA-ICP-MS, EA-IRMS, and a novel micro-XRF instrument to investigate an oolite shoal deposited between stromatolites that preserve abundant evidence for microbial activity. We report an extremely fine, radial-concentric, calcitic microfabric that is similar to the primary and early diagenetic fabrics of calcitic ooids reported from modern temperate lakes. Early diagenetic silica has trapped isotopically light and thermally mature organic matter. The close association of organic matter with mineral phases and microfabrics related to primary and early diagenetic processes suggest incorporation of organic matter occurred during accretion, likely due to the presence of microbial biofilms. We conclude that the oldest known calcitic ooids were likely formed through processes similar to those that mediate the accretion of ooids in similar environments today, including formation within a microbial biosphere.

Nonlinear Attitude Control of a Spacecraft with Distributed Actuation of Solar Arrays	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							VIBRATION CONTROL; LINEAR-SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; PDE; FEEDBACK	This paper presents a novel control architecture and algorithm for precision attitude control of a one-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of a spacecraft. To achieve a parametric model-based control design approach for this new spacecraft actuation and control architecture, the nonlinear dynamics of the open-loop plant are modeled as an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-partial differential equation (PDE) system. The ODE describes the spacecraft single-axis rigid-body rotation, and the PDE describes the spatially continuous flexible dynamics of the solar array including an allocation for a multi-input distributed piezoelectric actuation system bonded on the solar array. This distributed actuation system is called strain-actuated solar arrays. Based on this plant model, a nonlinear ODE-PDE feedback controller for attitude trajectory tracking and slewing is presented with detailed stability proofs. From an end-to-end point of view, the controller drives the distributed piezoelectric actuator patches with voltages that induce bending deflections in the solar arrays, causing controlled reaction torques on the bus to yield target-following motions and precision spacecraft attitude control. The proposed algorithm can be extended to any distributed actuation system with appropriate control input to actuator input mapping. The benefits and limitations of the proposed attitude control method using strain actuation are discussed later in terms of solar array inertia and structural rigidity. This paper also reports experimental results that demonstrate command-following rotations of a cylindrical bus via closed-loop control of its flexible appendages.

DES Collaboration	Astrometry and Occultation Predictions to Trans-Neptunian and Centaur Objects Observed within the Dark Energy Survey	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrometry; ephemerides; Kuiper belt: general; occultations; surveys	STELLAR OCCULTATIONS; KUIPER-BELT; ALBEDO; SIZE; DISCOVERY; RADIUS; FRAME; SHAPE; RING	Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are a source of invaluable information to access the history and evolution of the outer solar system. However, observing these faint objects is a difficult task. As a consequence, important properties such as size and albedo are known for only a small fraction of them. Now, with the results from deep sky surveys and the Gaia space mission, a new exciting era is within reach as accurate predictions of stellar occultations by numerous distant small solar system bodies become available. From them, diameters with kilometer accuracies can be determined. Albedos, in turn, can be obtained from diameters and absolute magnitudes. We use observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) from 2012 November until 2016 February, amounting to 4,292,847 charge-coupled device (CCD) frames. We searched them for all known small solar system bodies and recovered a total of 202 TNOs and Centaurs, 63 of which have been discovered by the DES collaboration as of the date of submission. Their positions were determined using the Gaia Data Release 2 as reference and their orbits were refined. Stellar occultations were then predicted using these refined orbits plus stellar positions from Gaia. These predictions are maintained, and updated, in a dedicated web service. The techniques developed here are also part of an ambitious preparation to use the data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), that expects to obtain accurate positions and multifilter photometry for tens of thousands of TNOs.

Using example observations taken with the vortex coronagraph mode of Keck/NIRC2 in L' band, we demonstrate that RDI provides improved sensitivity to point sources at small angular separations compared to angular differential imaging (ADI). Applying RDI to images of the low-mass stellar companions HIP 79124 C (192 mas separation, Delta L'4.01) and HIP 78233 B (141 mas separation, Delta L' = 4.78), the latter a first imaging detection, increases the significance of their detections by up to a factor of 5 with respect to ADI. We compare methods for reference frame selection and find that pre-selection of frames improves detection significance of point sources by up to a factor of 3. In addition, we use observations of the circumstellar disks around MWC 758 and 2MASS J16042165-2130284 to show that RDI allows for accurate mapping of scattered light distributions without self-subtraction artifacts.

By combining geochemical measurements with microbiological analysis, we have investigated the microbial mats colonizing the intertidal areas of sabhka. The main aim of this study was to identify communities and conditions that are favorable for dolomite formation. We inspected and sampled two locations. The first site was colonized by microbial mats that graded vertically from photo-oxic to anoxic conditions and were dominated by cyanobacteria. The second site, with higher salinity, had mats with an uppermost photo-oxic layer dominated by filamentous anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (FAPB), which potentially act as a protective layer against salinity for cyanobacterial species within the deeper layers. Porewater in the uppermost layers of the both investigated microbial mats was supersaturated with respect to dolomite. Corresponding to the variation of the microbial community's vertical structure, a difference in crystallinity and morphology of dolomitic phases was observed: dumbbell-shaped proto-dolomite in the mats dominated by cyanobacteria and rhombohedral ordered-dolomite in the mat dominated by FAPB.

Microlensing has the potential to probe this hidden population, as it can measure both the mass and five of the six phase-space coordinates (all except the radial velocity) even of a dark isolated lens. However, the measurements of both the microlens-parallax and finite-source effects are needed in order to recover the full information. Here, we combine the Spitzer satellite parallax measurement with the ground-based light curve, which exhibits strong finite-source effects, of event OGLE-2017-BLG-0896. We find two degenerate solutions for the lens (due to the known satellite-parallax degeneracy), which are consistent with each other except for their proper motion. The lens is an isolated brown dwarf with a mass of either 18 +/- 1 M-J or 20 +/- 1 M-J. This is the lowest isolated-object mass measurement to date, only similar to 45% more massive than the theoretical deuterium-fusion boundary at solar metallicity, which is the common definition of a free-floating planet. The brown dwarf is located at either 3.9 +/- 0.1 kpc or 4.1 +/- 0.1 kpc toward the Galactic bulge, but with proper motion in the opposite direction of disk stars, with one solution suggesting it is moving within the Galactic plane. While it is possibly a halo brown dwarf, it might also represent a different, unknown population.

The Vertical Structure of Radiative Heating Rates: A Multimodel Evaluation Using A-Train Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Clouds; Climatology; Heating; Radiative fluxes; Satellite observations; Climate models	CLOUD DETECTION; WATER-VAPOR; MODIS; PROFILES; CALIPSO; UNCERTAINTY; ATMOSPHERE; PRODUCTS; MISSION; DARWIN	We assess the vertical distribution of radiative heating rates (RHRs) in climate models using a multimodel experiment and A-Train satellite observations, for the first time. As RHRs rely on the representation of cloud amount and properties, we first compare the modeled vertical distribution of clouds directly against lidar-radar combined cloud observations (i.e., without simulators). On a near-global scale (50 degrees S-50 degrees N), two systematic differences arise: an excess of high-level clouds around 200 hPa in the tropics, and a general lack of mid- and low-level clouds compared to the observations. Then, using RHR profiles calculated with constraints from A-Train and reanalysis data, along with their associated maximum uncertainty estimates, we show that the excess clouds and ice water content in the upper troposphere result in excess infrared heating in the vicinity of and below the clouds as well as a lack of solar heating below the clouds. In the lower troposphere, the smaller cloud amount and the underestimation of cloud-top height is coincident with a shift of the infrared cooling to lower levels, substantially reducing the greenhouse effect, which is slightly compensated by an erroneous excess absorption of solar radiation. Clear-sky RHR differences between the observations and the models mitigate cloudy RHR biases in the low levels while they enhance them in the high levels. Finally, our results indicate that a better agreement between observed and modeled cloud profiles could substantially improve the RHR profiles. However, more work is needed to precisely quantify modeled cloud errors and their subsequent effect on RHRs.	[Cesana, G.; Waliser, D. E.; Li, J. -L.

Supplementing K2 photometry with follow-up Spitzer transit observations refined the transit ephemerides of K2-3 b, c, and d by over a factor of 10. We analyze ground-based photometry from the Evryscope and Fairborn Observatory to determine the characteristic stellar activity timescales for our Gaussian Process fit, including the stellar rotation period and activity region decay timescale. The stellar rotation signals for both stars are evident in the radial velocity data and is included in our fit using a Gaussian process trained on the photometry. We find the masses of K2-3 b, K2-3 c, and GJ3470 b to be 6.48(-0.93)(+0.99), 2.14(-1.04)(+1.08), and 12.58(-1.28)(+1.31) M-circle plus, respectively. K2-3 d was not significantly detected and has a 3 sigma upper limit of 2.80 M-circle plus. These two systems are training cases for future TESS systems; due to the low planet densities (rho < 3.7 g cm(-3)) and bright host stars (K < 9 mag), they are among the best candidates for transmission spectroscopy in order to characterize the atmospheric compositions of small planets.

We describe here various machine learning (ML) implementations and plans to make the maximal use of the large data set by taking advantage of the temporal nature of the data, and further combining it with other data sets. We start with the initial steps of separating bogus candidates from real ones, separating stars and galaxies, and go on to the classification of real objects into various classes. Besides the usual methods (e.g., based on features extracted from light curves) we also describe early plans for alternate methods including the use of domain adaptation, and deep learning. In a similar fashion we describe efforts to detect fast moving asteroids. We also describe the use of the Zooniverse platform for helping with classifications through the creation of training samples, and active learning. Finally we mention the synergistic aspects of ZTF and LSST from the ML perspective.

Watershed-scale mapping of fractional snow cover under conifer forest canopy using lidar	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Fractional snow cover; Snow disappearance; Snow ablation; Conifer forests; Mountain forests; Lidar; Distributed temperature sensing; Snow-vegetation interactions; Canopy correction for fSCA; Sagehen experimental watershed; Sierra Nevada	INCOMING LONGWAVE RADIATION; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; IMAGING SPECTROMETER; SIERRA-NEVADA; GRAIN-SIZE; ACCUMULATION; EQUIVALENT; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; INTERCEPTION	The distribution of snow cover is critical for predicting ecohydrological processes and underpins mountain water supplies in ranges like the Sierra Nevada in the Western United States. Many key water supply areas are covered by montane forests, which have substantial effects on the amount and timing of snowmelt. In-situ observations of snow-forest interactions have limited spatial coverage and remote sensing using optical sensors (e.g. MODIS) cannot observe snow cover below the canopy. In this study, we developed and verified a lidar-based method to detect snow cover under canopy, investigated how fractional snow covered area (fSCA) varies with topography in open versus under canopy areas and developed a correction factor that could be used to improve satellite derived fSCA products. We developed our new method using three snow-on lidar overflights and verified it with in-situ distributed temperature sensor (DTS) observations at Sagehen Creek watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. DTS validation of lidar classifications showed excellent agreement at 85-96%, including high agreement and large number of returns in under canopy locations. The lidar-derived fSCA observations generally showed earlier snow disappearance under the canopy than in open positions, which is consistent with relatively warm temperatures and greater longwave radiation. However, in contrast to expectations, areas with high solar exposure (i.e. high southwestness) exhibited higher fSCA under the canopy. Results indicated that the k factor (the ratio of under canopy fSCA to open fSCA) varied systematically with southwestness and elevation. Using this factor to correct the study domain fSCA indicated that the typical assumption that k = 1 could lead to an up to similar to 0.05 bias (in fSCA units) towards overestimation. However, within 10 and 100-m individual pixels the fSCA overprediction bias can be 25-30% for higher fSCA values. Although uncertainty would be reduced using higher snow-on lidar point densities, our method shows promise to improve the typical assumption that snow disappearance is identical in under the canopy and in the open (k = 1). Future applications of our lidar-based method at different sites with varying climate, topography and vegetation structure has the dual potential to expand understanding of snow-forest interactions in complex terrain and improve operational fSCA products.

Hierarchical mapping of annual global land cover 2001 to present: The MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover product	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Global land cover; MODIS; Classification; Hidden Markov models	EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; VEGETATION INDEX; CARBON; WATER; SATELLITE; PARAMETERIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; GREENNESS; DISCOVER	Land cover and land use maps provide an important basis for characterizing the ecological state and biophysical properties of Earth's land areas. The Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, initially released in 2010, was produced at annual time steps and has been widely used in the land science community. In this paper we describe refinements and improvements, in both the algorithm and the resulting map data sets, that have been implemented in the MODIS Collection 6 Global land Cover Type product. Unlike the Collection 5 product, which was based on the 17-class International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) legend, the Collection 6 algorithm uses a hierarchical classification model where the classes included in each level of the hierarchy reflect structured distinctions between land cover properties. The resulting suite of nested classifications is combined to create eight distinct classification schemes including the five legacy schemes included in Collection 5, and three new legends based on the FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LEGS) that distinguish between land cover, land use, and surface hydrologic state. The Collection 6 algorithm also incorporates a state-space multitemporal modeling framework based on hidden Markov models that reduce spurious land cover changes introduced by classification uncertainty in individual years. Among other changes, relative to Collection 5, the Collection 6 product includes less area mapped as forests, open shrublands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, and more area mapped as woodlands and grasslands. Accuracy assessment indicates that the Collection 6 product has an overall accuracy of 73.6% for the primary LCCS layer and that the amount of spurious land cover change has been substantially reduced in Collection 6 relative to Collection 5 (1.6% in C6 and 11.4% in C5).

Detection of Rotational Acceleration of Bennu Using HST Light Curve Observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						asteroids; YORP; OSIRIS-REx; Bennu; Hubble Space Telescope	PHOTOMETRY; YORP	We observed the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu from the ground in 1999 and 2005, and with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2012, to constrain its rotation rate. The data reveal an acceleration of 2.641.05x10(-6)deg/day(2), which could be due to a change in the moment of inertia of Bennu or to spin up from the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack effect or other source of angular momentum. The best solution is within 1 sigma of the period determined by Nolan et al. (2013, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.05.028.). The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission will determine the rotation state independently in 2019. Those measurements should show whether the change in rotation rate is a steady increase (due, e.g., to the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack effect) or some other phenomenon. The precise shape and surface properties measured by the OSIRIS-REx science team will allow for a better understanding of variations in rotation rate of small asteroids. Plain Language Summary We observed near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennuthe target of the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft missionusing ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope. Our measurements show that its rotation has been speeding up since 1999. This change could be due to a change in the shape of Bennu or to the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack effect: As the sunlight received by an asteroid is reflected or radiated back to space, the change in direction of the light coming in and going out pushes on the asteroid and can cause it to spin faster or slower, depending on its shape and orientation. The specific properties of the surface, such as the position of boulders, can have a large influence on the outcome. In the next few years, the OSIRIS-REx team will study Bennu and independently measure its rotation, helping us to better understand the structure and dynamical evolution of small asteroids.

Conditions for the Long-Term Preservation of a Deep Brine Reservoir in Ceres	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; EVOLUTION; VIEW	We propose a new internal evolution model for the dwarf planet Ceres matching the constraints on Ceres' present internal state from the Dawn mission observations. We assume an interior differentiated into a volatile-dominated crust and rocky mantle, and with remnant brines in the mantle, all consistent with inferences from the Dawn geophysical observations. Simulations indicate Ceres should preserve a warm crust until present if the crust is rich in clathrate hydrates. The temperature computed at the base of the crust exceeds 220K for a broad range of conditions, allowing for the preservation of a small amount of brines at the base of the crust. However, a temperature 250K, for which at least 1wt.% sodium carbonate gets in solution requires a crustal abundance of clathrate hydrates greater than 55 vol.%, a situation possible for a narrow set of evolutionary scenarios. Plain Language Summary We search internal evolution models of dwarf planet Ceres that match the observations returned by the Dawn mission. A key feature to be reproduced is the long-term persistence of liquid below the crust, at about 40km depth, as suggested by the observed topography. The possibility for the occurrence of liquid in Ceres at present depends on the presence of insulating material in the crust, for example, in the form of gas hydrates. The latter are also suggested from geophysical and geological observations and geochemical modeling. Our modeling shows in these conditions that liquid can be preserved for a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.

We present an empirical framework that quantifies the relative importance of the various factors that influence critical transitions in TC intensities. Our analysis of model simulations of recent TCs over the Bay of Bengal identifies the following variables within the vortex as the biggest influence on TC rapid intensity changes: the amplitudes of wave number 1 of 700- to 850-mb horizontal moisture flux convergence and precipitation in the rainband region and the amplitude of wave number 0 of precipitation within the radius of maximum winds. Likewise, the most important environmental variables identified are the angle between the driest air and the shear vector and the magnitude of vertical wind shear. These findings provide guidance on guidance for future observational efforts and data assimilation into TC forecasting models.

J	Petuya, C; Desmedt, A				Petuya, Claire; Desmedt, Arnaud			Revealing CO-Preferential Encapsulation in the Mixed CO-N-2 Clathrate Hydrate	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CARBON-MONOXIDE; GUEST MOLECULES; HIGH-PRESSURES; NITROGEN; RAMAN; AIR; N-2; METHANE; OXYGEN; N-2-CLATHRATE	In addition to their various applications in the environment, energy and technology fields, gas clathrate hydrates, called gas hydrates (inclusion compounds composed of a H-bonded water network forming cages, inside of which gaseous guest molecules are trapped), are hypothetically involved in the formation of planetesimals, comets, and other planets (e.g., the Saturn's moon or the Jupiter-family comets). In these issues, CO and N-2 molecular species often occur. In this work, we have elucidated the molecular selectivity and the guest partitioning of the CO and N-2 molecules within mixed CO-N-2 gas hydrate (the two guest species are encapsulated within the cages) as a function of the gas mixture composition at 270 K and 200 bar. By means of micro-Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that CO molecules are preferentially encapsulated within the hydrate cages, with a better selective efficiency for gas mixture below 35% CO in N-2 gas. In addition, the present Raman investigation gives clear indications about the formation of both SI and SII clathrate structures, depending on the gas mixture composition: below 35% CO, the mixed hydrate is mainly of type SII, whereas above this limit, the formed mixed hydrate is mainly of type SI. Moreover, no preferential CO/N-2 fractioning in the various types of hydrate cages is observed. In addition to the interest for gas separation technology (e.g., flue gas), such experimental results corroborate, for the first time, theoretical and modeling prediction, showing that the formation of clathrate hydrate could explain the potential N-2 depletion observed in Jupiter-family comets (e.g., 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko).

Because of this, they have found applications in optical instruments of various types including interferometers, segmented reflectors, and coronagraphs. In this paper, we present two prototypes of flight-qualifiable inchworm actuators developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. These actuators have two sets of brake piezoceramic (PZT) stacks and an extension PZT stack used for mobility. By proper phasing of the signals to these PZTs, a walking gait can be achieved that moves a runner attached via a flexure to the optic to be moved. A model of these devices, based on first principles, is developed as well as an estimation and control scheme for precise positioning. The estimator estimates physical parameters of the device as well as a self-induced motion disturbance caused by the brakes. Simulations and test data are presented that demonstrate nanometer-level positioning precision as well as the cause of variations in the brake-induced disturbance.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the scattering characteristics of an all-carbon exciton-plasmon nanohybrid which was made by coupling an elliptical GNF resonator to a semiconducting CNT gain element. We analytically model the nanohybrid as an open quantum system using cavity quantum electrodynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the dipole moment operator and the dipole response field of the GNF and characterize the Rayleigh scattering spectrum of the nanohybrid. These analytical expressions are valid for any arbitrary ellipsoidal nanoresonator coupled to a quantum emitter. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis, the results of which indicate that the GNF-CNT nanohybrid exhibits enhanced and versatile scattering capabilities compared to the individual constituents. We show that the spectral signatures of the nanohybrid are highly tunable using a multitude of system parameters such as Fermi energy of the GNF, component dimensions, GNF-CNT separation distance and the permittivity of the submerging medium. We finally demonstrate the prospect of using the proposed nanohybrid to reconstruct the permittivity profile of a tumour. The high biocompatibility and high sensitivity to the dielectric properties of the environment make the proposed GNF-CNT nanohybrid an ideal candidate for such biosensing applications.

Using a suite of models from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), we assessed modeled net primary productivity (NPP) response to, and recovery from, drought events against a benchmark derived from tree ring observations between 1948 and 2008 across forested regions of the US and Europe. We find short lag times (0-6 months) between climate anomalies and modeled NPP response. Although models accurately simulate the direction of drought legacy effects (i.e. NPP decreases), projected effects are approximately four times shorter and four times weaker than observations suggest. This discrepancy between observed and simulated vegetation recovery from drought reveals a potential critical model deficiency. Since productivity is a crucial component of the land carbon balance, models that underestimate drought recovery time could overestimate predictions of future land carbon sink strength and, consequently, underestimate forecasts of atmospheric CO2.

Closing the gap between Earth-based and interplanetary mission observations: Vesta seen by VLT/SPHERE	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: image processing; methods: observational; minor planets, asteroids: individual: Vesta	PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; FIELD; DAWN; DECONVOLUTION; SPECTROSCOPY; IMAGES; SHAPE	Context. Over the past decades, several interplanetary missions have studied small bodies in situ, leading to major advances in our understanding of their geological and geophysical properties. These missions, however, have had a limited number of targets. Among them, the NASA Dawn mission has characterised in detail the topography and albedo variegation across the surface of asteroid (4) Vesta down to a spatial resolution of similar to 20 m pixel(-1) scale. Aims. Here our aim was to determine how much topographic and albedo information can be retrieved from the ground with VLT/SPHERE in the case of Vesta, having a former space mission (Dawn) providing us with the ground truth that can be used as a benchmark. Methods. We observed Vesta with VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our ESO large programme (ID 199.C-0074) at six different epochs, and deconvolved the collected images with a parametric point spread function (PSF). We then compared our images with synthetic views of Vesta generated from the 3D shape model of the Dawn mission, on which we projected Vesta's albedo information. Results. We show that the deconvolution of the VLT/SPHERE images with a parametric PSF allows the retrieval of the main topographic and albedo features present across the surface of Vesta down to a spatial resolution of similar to 20-30 km. Contour extraction shows an accuracy of similar to 1 pixel (3.6 mas). The present study provides the very first quantitative estimate of the accuracy of ground-based adaptive-optics imaging observations of asteroid surfaces. Conclusions. In the case of Vesta, the upcoming generation of 30-40m telescopes (ELT, TMT, GMT) should in principle be able to resolve all of the main features present across its surface, including the troughs and the north-south crater dichotomy, provided that they operate at the diffraction limit.

A deep X-ray view of the bare AGN Ark 120 V. Spin determination from disc-Comptonisation efficiency method	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						X-rays: individuals: Ark 120; galaxies: active; quasars: general; radiation mechanisms: general; accretion, accretion disks	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLE SPIN; QUASI-PERIODIC OSCILLATIONS; SEYFERT 1 GALAXIES; XMM-NEWTON; ACCRETION DISK; IRON LINE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; MASS; CONTINUUM	Context. The spin of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be determined from spectral signature(s) of relativistic reflection such as the X-ray iron K alpha line profile, but this can be rather uncertain when the line of sight intersects the so-called warm absorber and/or other wind components as these distort the continuum shape. Therefore, AGN showing no (or very weak) intrinsic absorption along the line-of-sight such as Ark 120, a so-called bare AGN, are the ideal targets for SMBH spin measurements. However, in our previous work on Ark 120, we found that its 2014 X-ray spectrum is dominated by Comptonisation, while the relativistic reflection emission only originates at tens of gravitational radii from the SMBH. As a result, we could not constrain the SMBH spin from disc reflection alone. Aims. Our aim is to determine the SMBH spin in Ark 120 from an alternative technique based on the global energetics of the disccorona system. Indeed, the mass accretion rate ((M)over dot) through the outer disc can be measured from the optical-UV emission, while the bolometric luminosity (L-bol) can be fairly well constrained from the optical to hard X-rays spectral energy distribution, giving access to the accretion efficiency eta = L-bol/((M)over dot c(2)) which depends on the SMBH spin. Methods. The spectral analysis uses simultaneous XMM-Newton (OM and pn) and NuSTAR observations on 2014 March 22 and 2013 February 18. We applied the OPTXCONV model (based on OPTXAGNF) to self consistently reproduce the emission from the inner corona (warm and hot thermal Comptonisation) and the outer disc (colour temperature corrected black body), taking into account both the disc inclination angle and relativistic effects. For self-consistency, we modelled the mild relativistic reflection of the incident Comptonisation components using the XILCONV convolution model. Results. We infer a SMBII spin of 0.83(-0.03)(+0.05) adopting the SMBH reverberation mass of 1.50 x 10(8) M-circle dot. In addition, we find that the coronal radius decreases with increasing flux (by about a factor of two), from 85(-10)(+13) R-g in 2013 to 14 +/- 3 R-g in 2014. Conclusions. This is the first time that such a constraint is obtained for a SMBH spin from this technique, thanks to the bare properties of Ark 120, its well determined SMBH reverberation mass, and the presence of a mild relativistic reflection component in 2014 which allows us to constrain the disc inclination angle. We caution that these results depend on the detailed disc-corona structure, which is not yet fully established. However, the realistic parameter values (e.g. L-bol/L-Edd, disc inclination angle) found suggest that this is a promising method to determine spin in moderate-(M)over dot AGN.

We present continuum polarimetric and photometric measurements of this region at 53, 89, 154, and 214 mu m at angular resolutions of 5", 8", 14", and 19" for the four bands, respectively. The photometric maps enable the computation of improved spectral energy distributions for the region. We find that at the longer wavelengths, the inferred magnetic field configuration matches the "hourglass" configuration seen in previous studies, indicating magnetically regulated star formation. The field morphology differs at the shorter wavelengths. The magnetic field inferred at these wavelengths traces the bipolar structure of the explosive Becklin-Neugebauer/Kleinman-Low outflow emerging from OMC-1 behind the Orion Nebula. Using statistical methods to estimate the field strength in the region, we find that the explosion dominates the magnetic field near the center of the feature. Farther out, the magnetic field is close to energetic equilibrium with the ejecta and may be providing confinement to the explosion. The correlation between polarization fraction and the local polarization angle dispersion indicates that the depolarization as a function of unpolarized intensity is a result of intrinsic field geometry as opposed to decreases in grain alignment efficiency in denser regions.

Age Determination in Upper Scorpius with Eclipsing Binaries	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; binaries: spectroscopic; Hertzsprung-Russell and C-M diagrams; open clusters and associations: individual (Upper Scorpius); stars: evolution; stars: pre-main sequence	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; LOW-MASS STARS; EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARF DESERT; EQUATION-OF-STATE; DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION; SPECTROSCOPIC BINARY; STELLAR EVOLUTION; ACCURATE MASSES; MAGNETIC-FIELDS	The Upper Scorpius OB association is the nearest region of recent massive star formation and thus an important benchmark for investigations concerning stellar evolution and planet formation timescales. We present nine eclipsing binaries (EBs) in Upper Scorpius, three of which are newly reported here and all of which were discovered from K2 photometry. Joint fitting of the eclipse photometry and radial velocities from newly acquired Keck I/HIRES spectra yields precise masses and radii for those systems that are spectroscopically double-lined. The binary orbital periods in our sample range from 0.6 to 100 days, with total masses ranging from 0.2 to 8 M-circle dot. At least 33% of the EBs reside in hierarchical multiples, including two triples and one quadruple. We use these EBs to develop an empirical mass-radius relation for pre-main-sequence stars and evaluate the predictions of widely used stellar evolutionary models. We report evidence for an age of 5-7 Myr, which is self-consistent in the mass range of 0.3-5 M-circle dot and based on the fundamentally determined masses and radii of EBs. Evolutionary models including the effects of magnetic fields imply an age of 9-10 Myr. Our results are consistent with previous studies that indicate that many models systematically underestimate the masses of low-mass stars by 20%-60% based on Hertzsprung-Russell diagram analyses. We also consider the dynamical states of several binaries and compare with expectations from tidal dissipation theories. Finally, we identify RIK 72 b as a long-period transiting brown dwarf (M = 59.2 +/- 6.8 M-Jup, R = 3.10 +/- 0.31 R-Jup, P approximate to 97.8 days) and an ideal benchmark for brown dwarf cooling models at 5-10 Myr.

Mass Calibration of Optically Selected DES Clusters Using a Measurement of CMB-cluster Lensing with SPTpol Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; galaxies: clusters: general; gravitational lensing: weak	GALAXY CLUSTERS; DARK ENERGY; MODEL; CONSTRAINTS; GIANTS	We use cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps from the 500 deg(2) SPTpol survey to measure the stacked lensing convergence of galaxy clusters from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year-3 redMaPPer (RM) cluster catalog. The lensing signal is extracted through a modified quadratic estimator designed to be unbiased by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. The modified estimator uses a tSZ-free map, constructed from the SPTpol 95 and 150 GHz data sets, to estimate the background CMB gradient. For lensing reconstruction, we employ two versions of the RM catalog: a flux-limited sample containing 4003 clusters and a volume-limited sample with 1741 clusters. We detect lensing at a significance of 8.7 sigma(6.7 sigma) with the flux (volume)-limited sample. By modeling the reconstructed convergence using the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we find the average lensing masses to be M-200 m =(1.62(-0.25)(+0.35) [stat.] +/- 0.04 [sys.] and (1.28(-0.18)(+0.14) [stat.] +/- 0.03 [sys.] x 10(14) M-circle dot for the volume- and flux-limited samples, respectively. The systematic error budget is much smaller than the statistical uncertainty and is dominated by the uncertainties in the RM cluster centroids. We use the volume-limited sample to calibrate the normalization of the mass-richness scaling relation, and find a result consistent with the galaxy weak-lensing measurements from DES.

DES Collaboration	First Cosmology Results using Type Ia Supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey: Constraints on Cosmological Parameters	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						dark energy; dark matter	LIGHT CURVES; LEGACY SURVEY; REDSHIFT; GALAXIES; SPECTROSCOPY; PHOTOMETRY; PEGASE; AGE	We present the first cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN). The analysis uses a subsample of 207 spectroscopically confirmed SNe. Ia from the first three years of DES-SN, combined with a low-redshift sample of 122 SNe from the literature. Our "DES-SN3YR" result from these 329 SNe. Ia is based on a series of companion analyses and improvements covering SN. Ia discovery, spectroscopic selection, photometry, calibration, distance bias corrections, and evaluation of systematic uncertainties. For a flat Lambda CDM model we find a matter density Omega(m) = 0.331 +/- 0.038. For a flat wCDM model, and combining our SN. Ia constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we find a dark energy equation of state w = -0.978 +/- 0.059, and Omega(m) = 0.321 +/- 0.018. For a flat w(0)w(a)CDM model, and combining probes from SN. Ia, CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, we find w(0) = -0.885 +/- 0.114 and w(a) = -0.387 +/- 0.430. These results are in agreement with a cosmological constant and with previous constraints using SNe. Ia (Pantheon, JLA).	[Abbott, T. M. C.; Walker, A.

Investigating the presence of two belts in the HD 15115 system	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planetary systems; stars: individual: HD15115; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: polarimetric; techniques: image processing; infrared: planetary systems	DEBRIS DISK; IMAGING POLARIMETRY; DUST	Context. High-contrast instruments like SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch) enable spatial resolution of young planetary systems and allow us to study the connection between planets and the dust contained in debris discs by the gravitational influence a planet can have on its environment. Aims. We present new observations of the edge-on debris disc around HD15115 (F star at 48.2 pc) obtained in the near-IR. We search for observational evidence for a second inner planetesimal ring in the system. Methods. We obtained total intensity and polarimetric data in the broad bands J and H and processed the data with differential imaging techniques achieving an angular resolution of about 40 mas. A grid of models describing the spatial distribution of the grains in the disc is generated to constrain the geometric parameters of the disc and to explore the presence of a second belt. We perform a photometric analysis of the data and compare disc brightness in two bands in scattered and in polarized light. Results. We observe an axisymmetric planetesimal belt with a radius of similar to 2 '', an inclination of 85.8 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees and position angle of 278.9 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees. The photometric analysis shows that the west side is similar to 2.5 times brighter in total intensity than the east side in both bands, while for polarized light in the J band this ratio is only 1.25. We also find that the J-H colour of the disc appears to be red for the radial separations r less than or similar to 2 '' and is getting bluer for the larger separations. The maximum polarization fraction is 15-20% at r similar to 2.5 ''. The polarized intensity image shows some structural features inside the belt which can be interpreted as an additional inner belt. Conclusions. The apparent change of disc colour from red to blue with an increasing radial separation from the star could be explained by the decreasing average grain size with distance. The presence of an inner belt slightly inclined with respect to the main planetesimal belt is suspected from the data but the analysis and modelling presented here cannot establish a firm conclusion due to the faintness of the disc and its high inclination.

Interpreting contemporary trends in atmospheric methane	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						methane trends; greenhouse gas mitigation; tropospheric oxidative capacity	HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; CH4 EMISSIONS; FOSSIL-FUEL; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; SOURCE ATTRIBUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GAS-PRODUCTION; GROWTH-RATE; TANSO-FTS	Atmospheric methane plays a major role in controlling climate, yet contemporary methane trends (19822017) have defied explanation with numerous, often conflicting, hypotheses proposed in the literature. Specifically, atmospheric observations of methane from 1982 to 2017 have exhibited periods of both increasing concentrations (from 1982 to 2000 and from 2007 to 2017) and stabilization (from 2000 to 2007). Explanations for the increases and stabilization have invoked changes in tropical wetlands, livestock, fossil fuels, biomass burning, and the methane sink. Contradictions in these hypotheses arise because our current observational network cannot unambiguously link recent methane variations to specific sources. This raises some fundamental questions: (i) What do we know about sources, sinks, and underlying processes driving observed trends in atmospheric methane? (ii) How will global methane respond to changes in anthropogenic emissions? And (iii), What future observations could help resolve changes in the methane budget? To address these questions, we discuss potential drivers of atmospheric methane abundances over the last four decades in light of various observational constraints as well as process-based knowledge. While uncertainties in the methane budget exist, they should not detract from the potential of methane emissions mitigation strategies. We show that net-zero cost emission reductions can lead to a declining atmospheric burden, but can take three decades to stabilize. Moving forward, we make recommendations for observations to better constrain contemporary trends in atmospheric methane and to provide mitigation support.

Histogram of oriented gradients: a technique for the study of molecular cloud formation	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: atoms; ISM: molecules; ISM: structure; radio lines: ISM; galaxies: ISM	NARROW SELF-ABSORPTION; COLD H-I; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; COLUMN DENSITIES; DARK CLOUDS; WARM; TRANSITION; EMISSION; GAS; SIMULATIONS	We introduce the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), a tool developed for machine vision that we propose as a new metric for the systematic characterization of spectral line observations of atomic and molecular gas and the study of molecular cloud formation models. In essence, the HOG technique takes as input extended spectral-line observations from two tracers and provides an estimate of their spatial correlation across velocity channels. We characterized HOG using synthetic observations of HI and (CO)-C-13(J = 1 -> 0) emission from numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence leading to the formation of molecular gas after the collision of two atomic clouds. We found a significant spatial correlation between the two tracers in velocity channels where v(HI) approximate to v(13CO), almost independent of the orientation of the collision with respect to the line of sight. Subsequently, we used HOG to investigate the spatial correlation of the HI, from The HI/OH/recombination line survey of the inner Milky Way (THOR), and the (CO)-C-13(J = 1 -> 0) emission from the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS), toward the portion of the Galactic plane 33.degrees 75 <= l <= 35.degrees 25 and vertical bar b vertical bar <= 1.degrees 25. We found a significant spatial correlation between the two tracers in extended portions of the studied region. Although some of the regions with high spatial correlation are associated with HI self-absorption (HISA) features, suggesting that it is produced by the cold atomic gas, the correlation is not exclusive to this kind of region. The HOG results derived for the observational data indicate significant differences between individual regions: some show spatial correlation in channels around v(HI) approximate to v(13CO) while others present spatial correlations in velocity channels separated by a few kilometers per second. We associate these velocity offsets to the effect of feedback and to the presence of physical conditions that are not included in the atomic-cloud-collision simulations, such as more general magnetic field configurations, shear, and global gas infall.

Observational Evidence for Summer Rainfall at Titan's North Pole	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SURFACE; DRIZZLE; CLOUDS; LAKES	Methane rain on Saturn's moon Titan makes it the only place, other than Earth, where rain interacts with the surface. When and where that rain wets the surface changes seasonally in ways that remain poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a bright ephemeral feature covering an area of 120,000 km(2) near Titan's north pole in observations from Cassini's near-infrared instrument, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on 7 June 2016. Based on the overall brightness, spectral characteristics, and geologic context, we attribute this new feature to specular reflections from a rain-wetted solid surface like those off of a sunlit wet sidewalk. The reported observation is the first documented rainfall event at Titan's north pole and heralds the arrival of the northern summer (through climatic evidence), which has been delayed relative to model predictions. This detection helps constrain Titan's seasonal change and shows that the "wet-sidewalk effect can be used to identify other rain events."

Thermal Evolution of the Impact-Induced Cryomagma Chamber Beneath Occator Crater on Ceres	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SURFACE; ICE; TRANSPORT; DEPOSITS; SYSTEM	The faculae in Occator Crater on dwarf planet Ceres are an accumulation of salts that have been interpreted as cryovolcanic products. Current age estimates from crater counting suggest a maximum 18-Ma difference between the crater forming impact and the formation of Cerealia Facula, the central and most recent region in the crater. Here we model the thermal evolution of the potential impact-induced cryomagma chamber beneath Occator Crater and show that it cools in less than 12 Ma. To reach cooling times of 18 Ma requires initial melt volumes exceeding 11,000 km(3). However, simulations suggest that smaller initial cryomagma chambers may lead to partial melting of the lower crust. This may allow recharge of the magma chamber by deep brines located in the porous upper mantle of Ceres and may extend the longevity of cryovolcanic activity.	[Hesse, M.

The wave pattern has a wave number of 18 and spans similar to 5 degrees in latitude. One bright crest remains stationary in System III longitude, while the remaining crests move slowly westward. The bright and dark regions of the near-infrared wave pattern are caused by variations in the vertical location of the upper tropospheric haze layer. A comparison with thermal infrared observations shows a correlation with temperature anomalies in the upper troposphere. The results are consistent with a Rossby wave, generated by flow around a stationary vortex.

High-Resolution Global Contiguous SIF of OCO-2	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; REFLECTANCE; ECOSYSTEMS; MECHANISMS; MISSION; MODIS; CYCLE	The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) collects solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) at high spatial resolution along orbits ((SIF) over bar oco(2_orbit)), but its discontinuous spatial coverage precludes its full potential for understanding the mechanistic SIF-photosynthesis relationship. This study developed a spatially contiguous global OCO-2 SIF product at 0.05 degrees and 16-day resolutions ((SIF) over bar (oco2_005)) using machine learning constrained by physiological understandings. This was achieved by stratifying biomes and times for training and predictions, which accounts for varying plant physiological properties in space and time. (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) accurately preserved the spatiotemporal variations of SIFoco2_orbit across the globe. Validation of (SIf) over bar (oco2_005) with Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer airborne measurements revealed striking consistency (R-2 = 0.72; regression slope = 0.96). Further, without time and biome stratification, (1) (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) of croplands, deciduous temperate, and needleleaf forests would be underestimated during the peak season, (2) (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) of needleleaf forests would be overestimated during autumn, and (3) the capability of (SIF) over bar (oco2_005) to detect drought would be diminished. Plain Language Summary Newly available observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from satellite sensors represent a major step toward quantifying photosynthesis globally in real time. However, existing satellite SIF records are restricted to low spatial resolutions, sparse data acquisition, or both. These limitations impede the full capability of SIF for improving our understanding of dynamics of photosynthesis and its response to environmental changes (particularly in heterogeneous landscapes) to better support carbon source/sink attribution and verification. This study developed a novel high-resolution time series of spatially contiguous SIF for the globe, leveraging NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 measurements. We combined machine learning algorithms with known physiological constraints for this effort. Comparison with independent airborne SIF measurements revealed strong consistency, confirming the high quality of this new SIF data set. The high-resolution and global contiguous coverage of this data set will greatly enhance the synergy between satellite SIF and photosynthesis measured on the ground at consistent spatial scales. Potential applications with this data set include advancing dynamic drought monitoring and mitigation, informing agricultural planning and yield estimation in a more spatially explicit way, and providing a benchmark for upcoming satellite missions with SIF capabilities at higher spatial resolutions.

Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll Fluorescence in the Ocean Using Imaging Spectrometry: Toward a Vertical Profile of Fluorescence	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PHYTOPLANKTON; TERRESTRIAL; ALGORITHMS; RESOLUTION; ONBOARD	Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements provide valuable information on phytoplankton abundance and physiology. High spectral resolution measurements from the aircraft-mounted Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) allow for a more robust and informative fluorescence measurement than previous methods. An increase in radiation in the fluorescence wavelength range is approximated by a skew-normal distribution. Positive skew suggests the influence of water attenuation and motivates the use of an inverse retrieval model to solve for the most likely vertical distribution of fluorescence quantum yield. This approach is tested with theoretical fluorescence profiles and applied to a PRISM flightline located in southern Drake Passage, Southern Ocean during austral summer. The resulting profiles suggest vertical structure in fluorescence quantum yield in the upper 10 m, which matches expectations from in situ studies. The framework developed in this paper can be applied to current and future satellite missions, providing more information on phytoplankton concentrations, vertical profiles, and physiology. Plain Language Summary When chlorophyll molecules absorb light in the visible wavelengths, part of the energy is released in the form of light (fluorescence) in far-red and near-infrared wavelengths. Measurements of this fluorescence provide an independent estimate of the amount of photosynthesis occurring in the water, compared with other methods related to measuring the absorption of light by chlorophyll. Importantly, the theoretical "spectral shape," or the amount of light released at each wavelength, of fluorescence is well known. Here we report measurements of the spectral shape of fluorescence in the ocean from aircraft measurements. The actual spectral shape is different from theoretical expectations. However, fluorescence emanating from chlorophyll at shallow depths (less than 10 m) is modified by interactions with the water column above it, leading to differences in the spectral shape observed by aircraft. We use an algorithm that finds the vertical profile of fluorescence in the ocean that best matches the observations. This best match corresponds to a subsurface maximum in fluorescence, consistent with common profiles measured in situ.	[Erickson, Z. K.; Frankenberg, C.; Thompson, A.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							UNTANGLING MICROPHYSICAL IMPACTS; CUMULUS CLOUD ENSEMBLE; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATIONS; DEEP CONVECTION; INTERFACE INSTABILITY; PART I; PARAMETERIZATION; SCHEME; SOUNDPROOF	The key assumption underlying convection parameterizations is that rising plumes develop in a horizontally homogeneous environment. With this in mind, we investigate the impact of environmental cloud layer heterogeneities on shallow convection using large-eddy simulation that applies a master-slave methodology. In the master-slave approach, two independent sets of thermodynamic variables (master and slave) are driven by one dynamics (coupled with the master) to remove the impact of internal variability of the dynamical system considered. The two thermodynamic sets include either a realistic heterogeneous environment or an environment that is homogenized outside clouds. The key is that homogenization also excludes subsiding shells surrounding cumulus clouds. The results show a small impact of the homogenization on cloud field properties. The physical explanation highlights the role of the subsiding shell shielding a shallow cumulus cloud from its environment. Plain Language Summary Coarse-resolution weather and climate models need to use convection parameterizations for representing vertical transport by ascending plumes or bubbles. Those parameterizations typically assume that convective elements develop in a homogeneous environment. This key assumption was recently questioned in a study showing that plume properties critically depend on the local environment in which they rise. The current study revisits this assumption by explicitly simulating the development of shallow convective clouds using a method that facilitates comparing the same portions of cloudy air undergoing two different scenarios: mixing either with a heterogeneous or homogeneous environment. The results highlight an insignificant impact of environmental temperature and moisture perturbations on the cloud development and strongly support the homogeneous environment assumption in convection parameterizations.

Impact of 3-D Radiation-Topography Interactions on Surface Temperature and Energy Budget Over the Tibetan Plateau in Winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						3-D radiative transfer; topographic effect; CMIP5; Tibetan Plateau	SNOW COVER; SOLAR-RADIATION; SIERRA-NEVADA; MODEL; CMIP5; SIMULATION; FORMULATION; MOUNTAINS; HYDROLOGY; MONSOON	We incorporate a parameterization to quantify the effect of three-dimensional (3-D) radiation-topography interactions on the solar flux absorbed by the surfaces, including multiple reflections between surfaces and differences in sunward/shaded slopes, in the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). A sensitivity experiment is carried out using CCSM4 with the prescribed sea surface temperature for year 2000 to investigate its impact on energy budget and surface temperature over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results show that the topographic effect reduces the upward surface shortwave flux and, at the same time, enhance snowmelt rate over the central and southern parts of TP. Comparing to observations and the ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), we found that CMIP5 models have a strong cold bias of 3.9K over TP, partially induced by the strong reflection of shortwave fluxes. We show that the inclusion of topographic effect reduces the substantial biases of upward shortwave fluxes and surface air temperatures over TP by 13% in the CCSM4 model. Plain Language Summary We have developed a program to calculate the impact of shadow and multiple reflections on sunlight absorbed by the surface in mountainous areas for application to climate models. The results show that this impact can increase the amount of solar energy absorbed by the surface and produce a higher temperature. Because no climate model considers this effect currently, we believe it is why most global models severely underestimate the temperature over the Tibetan Plateau.

An Assessment of the Impacts of Cloud Vertical Heterogeneity on Global Ice Cloud Data Records From Passive Satellite Retrievals	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						ice cloud; vertical heterogeneity; ice water path; reflective shortwave radiation; outgoing longwave radiation	LIQUID WATER PATH; OPTIMAL ESTIMATION ALGORITHM; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; OPTICAL-THICKNESS; PART I; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; A-TRAIN; EFFECTIVE RADIUS; COLLECTION 6; MODIS ICE	Spaceborne passive instruments are widely used to infer long-term ice cloud properties due to their large temporal and spatial coverage. Although observations from active instruments demonstrate ice particle variability in the vertical dimension, a pragmatic assumption made in passive cloud retrieval algorithms is that the observed scene consists of a plane-parallel cloud. In this study, a theoretical exploration on how ice cloud vertical heterogeneity (ICVH) influences passive retrievals (i.e., cloud optical thickness, cloud effective radius, and ice water path, IWP) is implemented at the pixel scale. Specifically, with an established ice cloud profile database inferred from 1-year Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation/CloudSat, we quantitatively estimate ICVH-induced biases on monthly averaged cloud macrophysical and radiative properties. Results show an average underestimation (-35%) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly IWP due to the ICVH for global ice clouds over ocean. The ICVH impacts are enhanced at large IWPs (e.g., > 500g/m(2)) and solar zenith angles, resulting in a profound underestimation of MODIS IWP (up to -50%) in deep convective regions and middle to high-latitude regions in the winter hemisphere. The global-averaged ice cloudy-sky reflected solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation derived from MODIS retrievals are slightly overestimated, suggesting that the ICVH has little impact on cloud radiative properties. Relatively large reflected solar radiation (0.3W/m(2)) and outgoing longwave radiation (0.1W/m(2)) flux differences occur at high and low IWPs, respectively. The largest total flux difference (similar to 2W/m(2)), mainly contributed by shortwave part, is associated with deep convection where the typical IWP is greater than 2,000g/m(2).

To identify and quantify major sources of ambient PM is important for pollution mitigation strategies, especially on a city scale. We developed two source apportionment methods to make the first-order estimates of local primary contribution ratio (LCR) of PM2.5 (PM with diameter less than 2.5m) using the high-density (about 1/km(2)) network observations with high sampling frequency (about 1hr). Measurements of PM2.5 mass concentration from 169 sites within a 20kmx20km domain are analyzed. The two methods developed here are mainly based on the spatial and temporal variations of PM2.5 within an urban area. The accuracy of our developed methods is subject to the assumptions on the spatial heterogeneity of primary and secondary formed aerosols as well as those from long-range transport to a city. We apply these two methods to a typical industrial city in China in winter of 2015 with frequent severe haze events. The local primary pollution contributions calculated from the two methods agree with each other that they are often larger than 0.4. The LCR range is from 0.4 to 0.7, with an average value of 0.63. Our study indicates the decisive role of locally emitted aerosols in the urban severe haze formation during the winter time. It further suggests that reductions of local primary aerosol emissions are essential to alleviate the severe haze pollution, especially in industrial cities.

A systematic blind search for new lensed systems	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: data analysis; catalogs	DARK-MATTER; QUASAR; GALAXY; DISCOVERY	Aims. In this work, we aim to provide a reliable list of gravitational lens candidates based on a search performed over the entire Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2). We also aim to show that the astrometric and photometric information coming from the Gaia satellite yield sufficient insights for supervised learning methods to automatically identify strong gravitational lens candidates with an efficiency that is comparable to methods based on image processing. Methods. We simulated 106 623 188 lens systems composed of more than two images, based on a regular grid of parameters characterizing a non-singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model in the presence of an external shear. These simulations are used as an input for training and testing our supervised learning models consisting of extremely randomized trees (ERT5). These trees are finally used to assign to each of the 2 129 659 clusters of celestial objects extracted from the Gaia DR2 a discriminant value that reflects the ability of our simulations to match the observed relative positions and fluxes from each cluster. Once complemented with additional constraints, these discriminant values allow us to identify strong gravitational lens candidates out of the list of clusters. Results. We report the discovery of 15 new quadruply-imaged lens candidates with angular separations of less than 6 '' and assess the performance of our approach by recovering 12 of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems with all their components detected in Gaia DR2 with a misclassification rate of fortuitous clusters of stars as lens systems that is below 1% Similarly, the identification capability of our method regarding quadruply-imaged systems where three images are detected in Gaia DR2 is assessed by recovering 10 of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems having one of their constituting images discarded. The associated misclassification rate varies between 5.83% and 20%, depending on the image we decided to remove.

By computing the boundary limits of outgoing rays, the optical caustic structures (termed rainbow and hyperbolic umbilic fringes) for tilted drops are calculated and compared with those for aligned (untilted) drops. The curvature of the rainbow fringe and the shifts of cusp caustics are discussed as well. The observed properties of the caustics can potentially be used for drop measurements. The model could also be applied to compute the optical caustics for drops with arbitrary shape, arbitrary orientation, and shaped beam illumination.

Calcium signals are necessary to establish auxin transporter polarity in a plant stem cell niche	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CA2+ INCREASES; ABSCISIC-ACID; ARABIDOPSIS; PH; OSCILLATIONS; GRAVITROPISM; EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; PATTERNS; CHANNELS	In plants mechanical signals pattern morphogenesis through the polar transport of the hormone auxin and through regulation of interphase microtubule (MT) orientation. To date, the mechanisms by which such signals induce changes in cell polarity remain unknown. Through a combination of time-lapse imaging, and chemical and mechanical perturbations, we show that mechanical stimulation of the SAM causes transient changes in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration (Ca2+) and that transient Ca2+ response is required for downstream changes in PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) polarity. We also find that dynamic changes in Ca2+ occur during development of the SAM and this Ca2+ response is required for changes in PIN1 polarity, though not sufficient. In contrast, we find that Ca2+ is not necessary for the response of MTs to mechanical perturbations revealing that Ca2+ specifically acts downstream of mechanics to regulate PIN1 polarity response.

Operational approaches utilize relationships between VWC and satellite vegetation indices for broad categories of vegetation, i.e., "agricultural crops," based on climatological databases. Determining crop type-specific equations for water content could lead to improvements in the soil moisture retrievals. Data to address this issue are lacking, and as a part of the calibration and validation program for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission, field experiments are conducted in northern central Iowa and southern Manitoba to investigate the performance of the SMAP soil moisture products for these intensive agricultural regions. Both sites are monitored for soil moisture, and the calibration and validation assessments had indicated performance issues in both domains. One possible source could be the characterization of the vegetation. In this investigation, Landsat 8 data are used to compute a normalized difference water index for the entire summer of 2016 that is then integrated with extensive VWC sampling to determine how to best characterize daily estimates of VWC for improved algorithm implementation. In Iowa, regression equations for corn and soybean are developed that provided VWC with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 1.37 and 1.10 kg/m(2), respectively. In Manitoba, corn and soybean equations are developed with RMSE values of 0.55 and 0.25 kg/m(2). Additional crop-specific equations are developed for winter wheat (RMSE of 0.07 kg/m(2)), canola (RMSE of 0.90 kg/m(2)), oats (RMSE of 0.74 kg/m(2)), and black beans (RMSE of 0.31 kg/m(2)). Overall, the conditions are judged to be typical with the exception of soybeans, which had an exceptionally high biomass as a result of significant rainfall as compared to previous studies in this region. Future implementation of these equations into algorithm development for satellite and airborne radiative transfer modeling will improve the overall performance in agricultural domains.

The Planet Formation Potential around a 45 Myr Old Accreting M Dwarf	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: individual (WISE J080822.18-644357.3); submillimeter: planetary systems	LOW-MASS STARS; DEBRIS DISKS; DUST; YOUNG; NEARBY; GAS; DISCS; SEARCH; CO; DESTRUCTION	Debris disk detections around M dwarfs are rare, and so far no gas emission has been detected from an M dwarf debris disk. This makes the 45 Myr old M dwarf WISE J080822.18-644357.3 a bit of a curiosity; it has a strong infrared excess at an age beyond the lifetime of a typical planet-forming disk, and also exhibits broad H alpha emission consistent with active accretion from a gaseous disk. To better understand the cold gas and dust properties of this system, we obtained ALMA observations of the 1.3 mm continuum and the CO/(CO)-C-13/C(18)OJ = 2-1 emission lines. No cold CO gas is detected from this system, ruling out a gas-rich protoplanetary disk. Unresolved dust continuum emission is detected at a flux of 198 +/- 15 mu Jy, consistent with 0.057 +/- 0.006 M-circle plus worth of optically thin dust, and consistent with being generated through a collisional cascade induced by large bodies at radii <16 au. With a sufficiently strong stellar wind, dust grains released in the outer disk can migrate inward via PR drag, potentially serving as a source of grains for the strong infrared excess.

J	Serabyn, E				Serabyn, E.			Pupil segmentation in the light-field camera and its relation to 3D object positions and the reconstructed depth of field	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							DISTANCE; OPTICS	A ray-trace simulation of the light-field camera is used to calculate point source responses as a function of 3D source positions. Each point source location yields a unique and well-determined segmented-pupil pattern in the lenslet array's focal plane, with lateral object offsets changing the pattern's location and symmetry, and defocus distances altering the pattern's diameter. Segmented-pupil images can thus be used to infer point sources' 3D locations. Numerical simulations show that the centroids and widths of segmented pupil images can be used to deduce lateral image positions to the size a detector pixel, and image defocus to the accuracy of the lenslet focal length. In sparse-source cases, such as, e.g., fluorescence microscopy or particle tracking, 3D point-source locations can thus be accurately determined from the observed point source response patterns. The degree of pupil segmentation also directly constrains the ability to refocus light-field images-for image defocus distances large enough that the number of pupil segments exceeds the number of pixels within a "whole" pupil behind a single lenslet, the image can no longer be brought to focus numerically, thus defining the light-field camera's depth of field. This constraint implies a depth of field larger than the usual imaging depth of focus by a factor of the number of detector pixels per lenslet, consistent with the general expectation.

IC 1396A is a cometary globule that contains the Class 0 source IC 1396A-PACS-1, which was discovered with Herschel. Aims. We use IRAM 30m telescope and Gaia DR2 data to explore the star formation history of IC 1396A and investigate the possibilities of triggered star formation. Methods. IRAM and Herschel continuum data were used to obtain dust temperature and column density maps. Heterodyne data reveal the velocity structure of the gas. Gaia DR2 proper motions for the stars complete the kinematics of the region. Results. IC 1396A-PACS-1 presents molecular emission similar to a hot corino with warm carbon chain chemistry due to the UV irradiation. The source is embedded in a dense clump surrounded by gas at velocities that are significantly different from the velocities of the Tr 37 cluster. CN emission reveals photoevaporation, while continuum data and high-density tracers ((CO)-O-18, HCO, DCO+, and N2D+) reveal distinct gaseous structures with a range of densities and masses. Conclusions. By combining the velocity, column density, and temperature information and Gaia DR2 kinematics, we confirm that the globule has experienced various episodes of star formation. IC 1396A-PACS-1 is probably the last intermediate-mass protostar that will form within IC 1396A; it shows evidence of being triggered by radiation-driven implosion. Chemical signatures such as CCS place IC 1396A-PACS-1 among the youngest known protostars. Gaia DR2 data reveal velocities in the plane of the sky similar to 4 km s(-1) for IC 1396A with respect to Tr 37. The total velocity difference (8 km s(-1)) between the Tr 37 cluster and IC 1396A is too small for IC 1396A to have undergone substantial rocket acceleration, which imposes constraints on the distance to the ionizing source in time and the possibilities of triggered star formation. The three stellar populations in the globule reveal that objects located within relatively close distances (<0.5 pc) can be formed in various star-forming episodes within similar to 1-2 Myr. Once the remaining cloud disperses, we expect substantial differences in evolutionary stage and initial conditions for the resulting objects and their protoplanetary disks, which may affect their evolution. Finally, evidence for short-range feedback from the embedded protostars, and in particular, the A-type star V390 Cep, is also observed.

While these sliding behaviours are well-described by commonly used mechanical models developed from laboratory testing (e.g., critical-state soil mechanics and rate-and-state friction), less is known about the field-scale environmental conditions or kinematic behaviours that occur during the transition from stable to unstable sliding. Here we use radar interferometry (InSAR) and a simple 1D hydrological model to characterize 8 years of stable sliding of the Mud Creek landslide, California, USA, prior to its rapid acceleration and catastrophic failure on May 20, 2017. Our results suggest a large increase in pore-fluid pressure occurred during a shift from historic drought to record rainfall that triggered a large increase in velocity and drove slip localization, overcoming the stabilizing mechanisms that had previously inhibited landslide acceleration. Given the predicted increase in precipitation extremes with a warming climate, we expect it to become more common for landslides to transition from stable to unstable motion, and therefore a better assessment of this destabilization process is required to prevent loss of life and infrastructure.

Drivers of Mercury Cycling in the Rapidly Changing Glacierized Watershed of the High Arctic's Largest Lake by Volume (Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC MERCURY; INORGANIC MERCURY; ELLESMERE-ISLAND; MARINE WATERS; RIVER-BASIN; MASS-LOSS; METHYLMERCURY; METHYLATION; SEDIMENT; TUNDRA	Across the Arctic, glaciers are melting and permafrost is thawing at unprecedented rates, releasing not only water to downstream aquatic systems, but also contaminants like mercury, archived in ice over centuries. Using concentrations from samples collected over 4 years and calibrated modeled hydrology, we calculated methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (THg) mass balances for Lake Hazen, the world's largest High Arctic lake by volume, for 2015 and 2016. Glacial rivers were the most important source of MeHg and THg to Lake Hazen, accounting for up to 53% and 94% of the inputs, respectively. However, due to the MeHg and THg being primarily particle-bound, Lake Hazen was an annual MeHg and THg sink. Exports of MeHg and THg out the Ruggles River outflow were consequently very low, but erosion and permafrost slumping downstream of the lake increased river MeHg and THg concentrations significantly before entering coastal waters in Chandler Fjord. Since 2001, glacial MeHg.and THg inputs to Lake Hazen have increased by 0.01 and 0.400 kg yr(-1), respectively, in step with dramatic increases in glacial melt. This study highlights the potential for increases in mercury inputs to arctic ecosystems downstream of glaciers despite recent reductions in global mercury emissions.	[St. Pierre, K.

Reaction of Perfluorooctanoic Acid with Criegee Intermediates and Implications for the Atmospheric Fate of Perfluorocarboxylic Acids	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; PERFLUORINATED ACIDS; VAPOR-PRESSURE; POLYFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS; FLUOROTELOMER ALCOHOLS; CARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; POTENTIAL SOURCE; CHEMISTRY; STABILITY; TRANSPORT	The reaction of perfluorooctanoic acid with the smallest carbonyl oxide Criegee intermediate, CH2OO, has been measured and is very rapid, with a rate coefficient of (4.9 +/- 0.8) X 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1), similar to that for reactions of Criegee intermediates with other organic acids. Evidence is shown the formation of hydroperoxymethyl perfluorooctanoate as a product. With such a large rate coefficient, reaction with Criegee intermediates can be a substantial contributor to atmospheric removal of perfluorocarboxylic acids. However, the atmospheric fates of the ester product largely regenerate the initial acid reactant. Wet deposition regenerates the perfluorocarboxylic acid via condensed-phase hydrolysis. Gas-phase reaction with OH is expected principally to result in formation of the acid anhydride, which also hydrolyzes to regenerate the acid, although a minor channel could lead to destruction of the perfluorinated backbone.

Microstructural evolution during laser metal deposition of bismuth chalcogenides (Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3)	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Laser metal deposition; Bismuth chalcogenides (Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3); Thermoelectric materials; Microstructural evolution	THERMOELECTRIC PROPERTIES; COATINGS	This paper reports the first-ever results obtained during laser metal deposition (LMD) of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, assisting to develop semiconducting and thermoelectric materials (recently finding the applications as Topological Insulators) through additive manufacturing. Bismuth-based chalcogenides, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, are deposited on an Aluminum 6061 substrate using laser metal deposition process (LMD) and are heat-treated at 400 degrees C for 4 h under Argon gas. The microstructural characterization of the as-deposited and heat-treated samples of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 are investigated using a scanning electron microscope and electron dispersive spectroscopy. Thereafter, the corresponding phases (along with the Miller indices and lattice parameters of individual phases) are identified with X-ray diffraction method. The asymmetric elemental evaporation of Se and Te are observed in Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, respectively, during the LMD process. This results in a change of overall composition with the formation of uncommon phases along with Bi-rich phases. After the heat-treatment process, these Bi-rich phases are disappeared, and the dissolution of these peaks are observed in the XRD analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Adapa, V. S.

Vertical Feedback Mechanism of Winter Arctic Amplification and Sea Ice Loss	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							POLAR AMPLIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; DECLINE; EOFS	Sea ice reduction is accelerating in the Barents and Kara Seas. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the accelerated loss of Arctic sea ice, which remains to be controversial. In the present study, detailed physical mechanism of sea ice reduction in winter (December-February) is identified from the daily ERA interim reanalysis data. Downward longwave radiation is an essential element for sea ice reduction, but can primarily be sustained by excessive upward heat flux from the sea surface exposed to air in the region of sea ice loss. The increased turbulent heat flux is used to increase air temperature and specific humidity in the lower troposphere, which in turn increases downward longwave radiation. This feedback process is clearly observed in the Barents and Kara Seas in the reanalysis data. A quantitative assessment reveals that this feedback process is being amplified at the rate of similar to 8.9% every year during 1979-2016. Availability of excessive heat flux is necessary for the maintenance of this feedback process; a similar mechanism of sea ice loss is expected to take place over the sea-ice covered polar region, when sea ice is not fully recovered in winter.

The main objective of this paper is to show that relevant parameters of the PolInSAR coherence region can be used to invert forest structure indicators computed from the airborne LIDAR sensor Laser Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS). The method relies on the shape of the observed generalized PolInSAR coherence region that is related to the three-dimensional structure of the scene. In addition to parameters describing the coherence shape, we consider the impact of acquisition parameters such as the interferometric baseline, ground elevation and local surface slope. We use the parameters as input a multilayer perceptron model to infer canopy features as estimated from LIDAR waveform. The output features are canopy height, cover and vertical profile class. Canopy height and canopy cover are estimated with a normalized RMSE of 13%, 15% respectively. The vertical profile was divided into 3 distinct classes with 66% accuracy.

The primary goal is to understand the lunar resource potential for future human exploration of the Moon. To this end, the LF spacecraft will carry an active multi-band reflectometer, based on an optical receiver aligned with four high-power diode lasers emitting in the 1 to 2-m shortwave infrared band, to measure the reflectance of the lunar surface from orbit near water ice absorption peaks. We present the detailed optical, mechanical, and thermal design of the receiver, which is required to fabricate this instrument within very demanding CubeSat resource allocations. The receiver has been optimized for solar stray light rejection from outside its field of view, and utilizes a 70 x 70-mm, aluminum, off-axis paraboloidal mirror with a focal length of 70 mm, which collects the reflected light from the Moon surface onto a single-pixel InGaAs detector with a 2-mm diameter, hence providing a 20-mrad field of view. The characterization of the flight receiver is also presented, and the results are in agreement with the expected performance obtained from simulations. Planned to be launched by NASA on the first Space Launch System (SLS) test flight, this highly mass-constrained and volume-constrained instrument payload will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first instruments onboard a CubeSat performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit, and the first planetary mission to use multi-band active reflectometry from orbit.

In this letter, we present evidence that we have made the first detection of such a bubble, associated with the hyperluminous quasar HE 0515-4414. The SZE detection is corroborated by the presence of extended emission line gas at the same position angle as the wind. Our detection appears on only one side of the quasar, consistent with the SZE signal arising from a combination of thermal and kinetic contributions. Estimates of the energy in the wind allow us to constrain the wind luminosity to the lower end of theoretical predictions,similar to 0.01 per cent of the bolometric luminosity of the quasar. However, the age we estimate for the bubble, similar to 0.1 Gyr, and the long cooling time, similar to 0.6 Gyr, means that such bubbles may be effective at providing feedback between bursts of quasar activity.

Teleconnection between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Sea Level in the Mediterranean Sea	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							EAST-COAST; VARIABILITY; WIND; MECHANISMS; TEMPERATURE; AMERICAN; IMPACT; RISE	The Mediterranean Sea can be viewed as a "barometer'' of the North Atlantic Ocean, because its sea level responds to oceanic-gyre-scale changes in atmospheric pressure and wind forcing, related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The climate of the North Atlantic is influenced by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) as it transports heat from the South Atlantic toward the subpolar North Atlantic. This study reports on a teleconnection between the AMOC transport measured at 26.58N and the Mediterranean Sea level during 2004-17: a reduced/increased AMOC transport is associated with a higher/lower sea level in the Mediterranean. Processes responsible for this teleconnection are analyzed in detail using available satellite and in situ observations and an atmospheric reanalysis. First, it is shown that onmonthly to interannual time scales theAMOC and sea level are both driven by similar NAO-like atmospheric circulation patterns. During a positive/negative NAO state, stronger/weaker trade winds (i) drive northward/southward anomalies of Ekman transport across 26.58N that directly affect the AMOC and (ii) are associated with westward/eastward winds over the Strait of Gibraltar that force water to flow out of/into theMediterranean Sea and thus change its average sea level. Second, it is demonstrated that interannual changes in theAMOC transport can lead to thermosteric sea level anomalies near the North Atlantic eastern boundary. These anomalies can (i) reach the Strait of Gibraltar and cause sea level changes in the Mediterranean Sea and (ii) represent a mechanism for negative feedback on the AMOC.

Physical Parameters of the Asteroid 2017 VR12 from Radar and Photometric Observations	ASTRONOMY LETTERS-A JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND SPACE ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						NEAs; asteroids; radar observations; photometry		Results of radar and photometric observations of the asteroid 2017 VR12 are presented. The observations were carried out during the asteroid's close approach to the Earth in 2018 on March 5 with 32-m radio telescopes at the Zelenchukskaya and Badary Observatories and on March 6 with a 0.65-m optical telescope at the Ussuriysk Astrophysical Observatory. The asteroid's radar observations were performed in the bistatic mode at a frequency of 8.56 GHz in combination with the 70-m Goldstone antenna. The echo power spectra for the asteroid were obtained as a result of the observations. The poleon silhouette breadth of this asteroid is 138 +/- 14 m. We have estimated the radar albedos, 0.32 +/- 0.04 and 0.31 +/- 0.04, and the circular polarization ratios, 0.36 +/- 0.02 and 0.34 +/- 0.01, for the Zelenchukskaya and Badary Observatories, respectively. Based on our photometric observations, we have obtained the asteroid's light curve, determined its rotation period, 1.378 +/- 0.03 h, and constructed a two-dimensional surface contour.

Previous work has characterized the photometric properties of LabSphere Spectralon targets. Here, we measure the visible and shortwave infrared (VSWIR; 0.4 to 2.5 mu m) reflectance at multiple angles and determine the photometric properties of materials manufactured by Lucideon and Avian Technologies for potential use as calibration target materials for the Mars 2020 Mastcam-Z instrument. The Lucideon black, gray 33, green, and cyan samples are found to be significantly forward scattering. The yellow, red, and gray 70 samples are found to be weakly forward scattering. The Avian Technologies AluWhite98 sample was found to be weakly backward scattering. We characterize the absorptions observable and note the occurrence of wavelength-dependent photometric properties. The reflectance and photometric data collected and released here enable the use of these color standards for calibration of data from Mastcam-Z and other Mars-2020 rover instruments as well as provide key information for many other imaging and spectroscopy applications that require the calibration of data from multiple lighting or viewing geometries.

Observations of plant diversity-responsive to changes in climate, disturbance, and land use, and ecologically linked to soil, biogeochemistry, and organisms-result in NEON data products that cross a range of organizational levels. Collections include samples of plant tissue to enable investigations of genetics, plot-based observations of incidence and cover of native and non-native species, observations of plant functional traits, archived vouchers of plants, and remote sensing airborne observations. Spatially integrating many ecological observations allows a description of the relationship of plant diversity to climate, land use, organisms, and substrates. Repeating the observations over decades and across the United States will iteratively improve our understanding of those relationships and allow for the testing of system-level hypotheses as well as the development of predictions of future conditions.

The terrestrial organism and biogeochemistry spatial sampling design for the National Ecological Observatory Network	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						National Ecological Observatory Network; sampling terrestrial organisms and biogeochemistry; spatial sample design; Special Feature: NEON Design	NATURAL-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELEVATION; INFERENCE; TRENDS; TERM; ASSIMILATION; DYNAMICS; GRADIENT; FOREST	The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) seeks to facilitate ecological prediction at a continental scale by measuring processes that drive change and responses at sites across the United States for thirty years. The spatial distribution of observations of terrestrial organisms and soil within NEON sites is determined according to a "design-based" sample design that relies on the randomization of sampling locations. Development of the sample design was guided by high-level NEON objectives and the multitude of data products that will be subjected to numerous analytical approaches to address the causes and consequences of ecological change. A requirement framework permeates the NEON design, ensuring traceability from each facet of the design to the high-level requirements that make the NEON mission statement actionable. Requirements were developed for the terrestrial sample design to guide the key components of the design: 1. Randomizing the sample locations ensures the unbiased collection of data, is appropriate for organisms and soil, and provides data suitable for a variety of analyses. 2. Stratification increases efficiency and allows sampling to focus on those parts of the landscape measured by other NEON observation platforms. 3. Attention to the sample size and spatial plot allocation ensures that data products will be sufficient to inform questions asked of the data and the NEON objectives. 4. Establishing a framework with the capacity for re-evaluate and design iteration allows for adaption to unexpected challenges and optimization of the sample design based on early data returns. The utility of the NEON sampling design is highlighted by its application across terrestrial systems. The data generated from this unique design will be used to quantify patterns in: the abundance and diversity of small mammals, breeding birds, insects, and soil microbes; vegetation structure, biomass, productivity, and diversity; and soil biogeochemistry.

Crustal Shear Wave Velocity Structure of Central Idaho and Eastern Oregon From Ambient Seismic Noise: Results From the IDOR Project	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							BLUE MOUNTAINS PROVINCE; JURASSIC TERRANE ACCRETION; METAMORPHIC CORE COMPLEXES; NORTHERN ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY; SNAKE RIVER PLAIN; WINDERMERE SUPERGROUP; NORTHEASTERN OREGON; TECTONIC EVOLUTION	We developed 3-D isotropic crustal seismic velocity models of central Idaho and eastern Oregon from the IDOR (western IDaho and eastern ORegon) Passive seismic data. Ambient noise tomography yielded crustal velocity structure from vertical component Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity measurements. Results include a strong shear wave velocity contrastfaster in accreted Blue Mountains terranes west of the western Idaho shear zone (WISZ), slower in the Idaho batholith, emplaced within the Archean Grouse Creek block east of the WISZrestricted to the upper-to-middle crust. In deeper crust not affected by mafic underplating during Columbia River Flood Basalt magmatism, the shear wave velocity of the Mesozoic Olds Ferry continental arc terrane is indistinguishable from that of the Archean Grouse Creek block basement. Crustal columns of the Olds Ferry terrane and the Permian-Jurassic Wallowa intraoceanic arc terrane are characterized by low seismic velocities, consistent with felsic lithologies down to approximate to 20km. West of the WISZ, the Bourne and Greenhorn subterranes of the Baker terrane, an accretionary complex between the arc terranes, have distinct shallow crustal seismic velocities. The Greenhorn subterrane to midcrustal depths is in an overthrust geometry relative to the Bourne subterrane. Lack of mafic lower crust in our results of the Wallowa or Olds Ferry arcs may be due to imbrication of upper crustal felsic plutonic complexes of these arcs. Shortening and thickening of the Blue Mountains arc terranes crust to >30km, and subduction or delamination of their mafic lower crustal sections is a viable mechanism for growth of a felsic continental crust.

The environments of luminous radio-WISE selected infrared galaxiess	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; infrared: galaxies	STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; HIGH-REDSHIFT; PROTO-CLUSTER; SUBMILLIMETER OBSERVATIONS; PROTOCLUSTERS; OVERDENSITIES; RESOLUTION; VARIANCE; SEARCH; ORIGIN	We have observed the environments of a population of 33 heavily dust obscured, ultraluminous, high-redshift galaxies, selected using Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and NRAO 1.4 GHz VLA Sky Survey atz > 1.3 with the infrared array camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope over 5.12 arcmin x 5.12 arcmin fields. Colour selections are used to quantify any potential overdensities of companion galaxies in these fields. We find no significant excess of galaxies with the standard colour selection for IRAC colours of [3.6] - [4.5] > -0.1 consistent with galaxies atz > 1.3 across the whole fields with respect to wide-area Spitzer comparison fields, but there is a > 2 sigma statistical excess within 0.25 arcmin of the central radio-WISE galaxy. Using a colour selection of [3.6] - [4.5] > 0.4, 0.5 magnitudes redder than the standard method of selecting galaxies atz > 1.3, we find a significant overdensity, in which 76 per cent (33 per cent) of the 33 fields have a surface density greater than the 3 sigma (5 sigma) level. There is a statistical excess of these redder galaxies within 0.5 arcmin, rising to a central peak similar to 2-4 times the average density. This implies that these galaxies are statistically linked to the radio-WISE selected galaxy, indicating similar structures to those traced by red galaxies around radio-loud active galactic nuclei.

The mass-loss is Delta M = 10.5 +/- 3.4.10(9) kg, about 0.1 per cent of the nucleus mass. Almost 50 per cent of the mass-loss occurred during the 32 d before and 62 d after perihelion. The nucleus mass combined with the new very precise nucleus volume of 18.56 +/- 0.02 km(3) yields a bulk density of 537.8 +/- 0.6 kg m(-3). This low bulk density suggests that the nucleus is highly porous. The porosity is constrained by the observed bulk density, the density of ices, mostly water ice, and the density of compacted nucleus dust material. For a range of compacted dust material density from 2000 to 3500 kg m(-3), the porosity varies between 65-79 per cent when the dust-to-ice mass ratio F-nucleus for the nucleus body lies in the range 3 <= F-nucleus <= 7. The nucleus is thus a highly porous very dusty body with very little ice. The total mass-loss Delta M puts hard constraints on the models of interpretation of the observations from other instruments on Rosetta. The loss from gas, based on ROSINA and MIRO observations, suggests that F-coma, the dust-to-gas mass ratio of cometary matter in the coma beyond the Hill sphere of the nucleus is of the order of F-coma <= 0.5 and therefore at least six times, and perhaps as much as 14 times, smaller than F-nucleus. It seems that the lost gas mass was overestimated by the instruments. The lost gas mass shall be 5.25 x 10(9) kg for F-coma = 1. For any other gas mass values > 5.25 x 10(9) kg F-coma is < 1. Most of the lifted dust mass will not leave the cometary Hill sphere but falls back to the nucleus. For 3 <= F-nucleus <= 7 and F-coma = 0.5, the fallback mass is between 1.8.Delta M and 4.3.Delta M.

To this purpose we employ a large set of 300 realizations of the same cosmology for each method, run with matching initial conditions in order to reduce the contribution of cosmic variance to the comparison. In addition, we compare how the error on cosmological parameters such as linear and non-linear bias parameters depends on the approximate method used for the determination of the bispectrum variance. As general result, most methods provide errors within 10 per cent of the errors estimated from N-body simulations. Exceptions are those methods requiring calibration of the clustering amplitude but restrict this to 2-point statistics. Finally we test how our results are affected by being limited to a few hundreds measurements from N-body simulation by comparing with a larger set of several thousands of realizations performed with one approximate method.

APPROX - mutual approximations between the Galilean moons: the 2016-2018 observational campaign	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; astrometry; planets and satellites: individual: Callisto; planets and satellites: individual: Europa; planets and satellites: individual: Ganymede; planets and satellites: individual: Io	ACCURATE EPHEMERIDES; JOVIAN PLANETS; MASSIVE RINGS; SATELLITES; JUPITER; OCCULTATIONS; PRECISION; ECLIPSES; METHANE; TITAN	The technique of mutual approximations accurately gives the central instant of the maximum apparent approximation of two moving natural satellites in the plane of the sky. This can be used in ephemeris fitting to infer the relative positions of satellites with high precision. Only mutual phenomena - occultations and eclipses - can achieve better results. However, mutual phenomena only occur every six years in the case of Jupiter. Mutual approximations do not have this restriction and can be observed at any time in the year as long as the satellites are visible. In this work, we present 104 central instants determined from the observations of 66 mutual approximations between the Galilean moons carried out at different sites in Brazil and France during the period 2016-2018. For 28 events, we have at least two independent observations. All telescopes were equipped with a narrow-band filter centred at 889 nm with a width of 15 nm to eliminate the scattered light from Jupiter. The telescope apertures ranged between 25 and 120 cm. For comparison, the precision of the positions obtained with classical CCD astrometry is about 100 mas, for mutual phenomena it can be 10 mas or less, and the average internal precision obtained with mutual approximations is 11.3 mas. This new type of simple, yet accurate, observations can significantly improve the orbits and ephemeris of Galilean satellites and thus it can be very useful for the planning of future space missions to the Jovian system.

Predicting Wave-Induced Sediment Resuspension at the Perimeter of Lakes Using a Steady-State Spectral Wave Model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake Tahoe; wind waves; sediment resuspension; littoral; limnology	WATER CLARITY; SHALLOW; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; PHYTOPLANKTON; DRIVEN; ZONE	A steady-state spectral wave model, STWAVE, is evaluated as a tool for predicting wave-induced sediment resuspension in lake littoral zones. Steady-state wave height and bed-shear stress estimates are tested against 2years of high-frequency wave height and turbidity data from six littoral measurement stations in Lake Tahoe. Average wave and sediment resuspension response to a broad range of wind conditions are well captured by the model. Despite steady-state assumptions, the model reproduces patterns in wave height and sediment resuspension under time-varying wind conditions at sites with different wave exposure. Model results are insensitive to the measurement location of wind data input among six offshore meteorological buoys. Uniform and variable wind field assumptions yield similar resuspension predictions. Results representing the steady-state response to spatially uniform wind speed-direction combinations enable output from a single set of model runs to serve as a reasonable static reference for hindcasting and predicting wave resuspension patterns. This obviates the need for repeated model runs, making STWAVE output an efficient tool for exploring long-term spatio-temporal patterns in nearshore wave forcing. Application of this tool is limited by wave height overprediction for short fetches and presumably by the validity of uniform wind field assumptions over very long fetches. Applied successfully at Lake Tahoe, we find that the north and east shores, exposed to the prevailing southwesterly winds, see resuspension conditions upward of 3,000hr/year, while the south and west shores typically see less than 500. Location-specific resuspension hours can vary by upward of 200hr/year due to shifting interannual wind patterns. Plain Language Summary A tool that describes lake-wide wave conditions as a function of combinations of wind speeds and directions is tested using 2years of wave height and water clarity data from six nearshore locations at Lake Tahoe. The data confirm the modeling tool's ability to predict wave-driven resuspension of lake bed sediments. An example application details seasonal and interannual variability in wind wave influence at the perimeter of Lake Tahoe. Due to the prevailing southwesterly winds, exposed sections of the north and east shores of the lake can see in excess of 3,000hr of sediment resuspension-inducing wave conditions per year, while the south and west shores are comparatively calm. In representative year 2016, wave forcing was more prevalent in the fall and winter seasons.	[Roberts, D. C.; Moreno-Casas, P.; Bombardelli, F. A.; Schladow, S.

The Microstructural Evolution of Water Ice in the Solar System Through Sintering	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						sintering; ice; icy satellites; comets; surface processes	DRY SNOW METAMORPHISM; SELF-DIFFUSION; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SURFACE-PROPERTIES; GRAIN-BOUNDARY; MODEL; STRENGTH; DENSIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; EMISSIVITY	Ice sintering is a form of metamorphism that drives the microstructural evolution of an aggregate of grains through surface and volume diffusion. This leads to an increase in the grain-to-grain contact area (neck) and density of the aggregate over time, resulting in the evolution of its strength, porosity, thermal conductivity, and other properties. This process plays an important role in the evolution of icy planetary surfaces, though its rate and nature are not well constrained. In this study, we explore the model of Swinkels and Ashby (1981, ) and assess the extent to which it can be used to quantify sintering timescales for water ice. We compare predicted neck growth rates to new and historical observations of ice sintering and find agreement to some studies at the order of magnitude level. First-order estimates of neck growth timescales on planetary surfaces show that ice may undergo significant modification over geologic timescales, even in the outer solar system. Densification occurs over much longer timescales, suggesting that some surfaces may develop cohesive, but porous, crusts. Sintering rates are extremely sensitive to temperature and grain size, occurring faster in warmer aggregates of smaller grains. This suggests that the microstructural evolution of ices may vary not only throughout the solar system but also spatially across the surface and in the near surface of a given body. Our experimental observations of complex grain growth and mass redistribution in ice aggregates point to components of the model that may benefit from improvement and areas where additional laboratory studies are needed. Plain Language Summary Ice sintering is a process that occurs to fresh ice grains deposited onto a planetary surface, which causes them to stick to each other and diffuse together. The contact regions (or necks) between individual grains and the density of the aggregate increases, leading the ice to become stronger and more cohesive over time. This process plays an important role in how ice surfaces evolve, which has implications for predicting their surface characteristics, interpreting spacecraft and telescopic observations, and developing technology to land on and sample these bodies. In this study, we use a numerical model to calculate the rate that sintering occurs in ice grains of varying size and temperature. We compare the predicted sintering rates to experimental observations and calculate estimates of sintering timescales on planetary surfaces. Our results suggest that that ice on planetary surfaces can undergo significant modification over geologic timescales, even in the outer solar system where the cold temperatures result in slow sintering rates. We find that many bodies may develop a cohesive, but porous, surface crusts. Due to the temperature dependence of the process, the evolution of ices is likely to vary significantly throughout the solar system, as well as spatially across a given surface.	[Molaro, J.

The focus of this overview is on the last five Earth years (2005-2010) of Spirit's mission in Gusev crater, supplementing the previous overview of the first 450 sols of the Spirit MI investigation. Updates to radiometric calibration using in-flight data and improvements in high-level processing are summarized. Released data products are described, and a table of MI observations, including target/feature names and associated data sets, is appended. The MI observed natural and disturbed exposures of rocks and soils as well as magnets and other rover hardware. These hand-lens-scale observations have provided key constraints on interpretations of the formation and geologic history of features, rocks, and soils examined by Spirit. MI images complement observations by other Spirit instruments, and together show that impact and volcanic processes have dominated the origin and evolution of the rocks in Gusev crater, with aqueous activity indicated by the presence of silica-rich rocks and sulfate-rich soils. The textures of some of the silica-rich rocks are similar to terrestrial hot spring deposits, and observations of subsurface cemented layers indicate recent aqueous mobilization of sulfates in places. Wind action has recently modified soils and abraded many of the rocks imaged by the MI, as observed at other Mars landing sites. Plain Language Summary The Microscopic Imager (MI) on NASA's Spirit rover returned the highest-resolution images of the Martian surface available at the time of the 2004-2010 mission. Designed to survive 90 Mars days (sols) and search for evidence of water in the past, Spirit returned data for 2210 sols, far exceeding all expectations. This paper summarizes the scientific insights gleaned from the thousands of MI images acquired during the last 5years of the mission, supplementing the summary of the first 450 sols of the Spirit MI investigation published previously (Herkenhoff et al., ). Along with data from the other instruments on Spirit, MI images guided the scientific interpretation of the geologic history of the rocks and soils observed in Gusev crater on Mars. We conclude that the geologic history of the area explored by Spirit has been dominated by impacts and volcanism, and that water, perhaps very hot water, was involved in the evolution of some of the rocks and soils. More recently, winds have moved soil particles and abraded rocks, as observed elsewhere on Mars. These results have improved our understanding of Mars' history and informed planning of future missions to Mars.

J	Luo, YD; Liu, Z				Luo, Yingdi; Liu, Zhen			Slow-Slip Recurrent Pattern Changes: Perturbation Responding and Possible Scenarios of Precursor toward a Megathrust Earthquake	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						slow-slip event; rate-and-state friction; subduction model; mega thrust earthquake; stress perturbation; earthquake prediction	EPISODIC TREMOR; NANKAI TROUGH; EVENTS; FRICTION; DEFORMATION; SEISMICITY; STABILITY; SHIKOKU; FAULTS; JAPAN	Advances in geodetic techniques enable us to detect slow-earthquake transients (e.g., slow-slip events, SSEs) with improving accuracy and coverage. Recent observations reveal intriguing changes of SSE behavior before and/or after earthquakes. However, the physics behind these observations remain largely unknown. How does SSE pattern change during megathrust earthquake super-cycle? How do SSEs respond to external tectonic perturbations such as stress perturbation from earthquakes, or nontectonic forces such as tidal modulation and seasonal loading? Can SSE pattern changes shed light on the onset of a large earthquake? To address these questions, we employ laboratory-based rate-and-state frictional law on subduction zone faults with realistic frictional properties incorporating megathrust earthquake and SSE regions. We conduct 2-D/3-D quasi-dynamic earthquake cycle simulations to study the intrinsic SSE pattern changes as how it evolves at different stages of the earthquake cycle, versus the changes in SSE pattern responding to external stress perturbations. Our results suggest that, despite both intrinsic and perturbation models are capable to introduce large variability in SSE pattern, there are considerable observable characteristics that can be used to differentiate these two models. Without external perturbation the SSE patterns change intrinsically during the super-cycle. The recurrence interval and peak slip rate of SSEs decrease significantly right before megathrust earthquake and could be used as a potential warning sign. Whereas SSE patterns can vary significantly when perturbed by an earthquake or other tectonic/nontectonic sources. Recurring SSEs can be advanced or delayed by external perturbations, and multiple SSEs can be affected if perturbation is long-lasting. Plain Language Summary Slow-slip event (SSE) is a new kind of faulting behavior that is very different from regular earthquakes. It is slow in nature and can only be detected by geodetic methods like GPS. SSEs have been observed in multiple subduction zones and some of them repeat regularly, yet those regular repeating patterns show interesting changes before and/or after large earthquakes. We model such changes with numerical simulations of simplified subduction zone fault model incorporating both megathrust earthquake and SSE regions. We find that due to the interaction between the SSE and megathrust earthquake regions, SSE become more frequent before megathrust earthquake, in line with observations. Our results suggest such distinctive SSE pattern change might serve as a potential precursor for future large earthquakes. We also find that repeating SSEs are sensitive to stress perturbations, which can cause SSEs to advance or delay after large earthquakes.

The Beaufort Gyre Extent, Shape, and Location Between 2003 and 2014 From Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Arctic oceanography; Beaufort Gyre; dynamic ocean topography; freshwater	NORTHERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; WESTERN ARCTIC-OCEAN; FRESH-WATER CONTENT; SEA-ICE; CANADA BASIN; GEOSTROPHIC CURRENTS; CIRCULATION; SURFACE; PACIFIC; VARIABILITY	The Beaufort Gyre is a significant reservoir of freshwater in the Arctic. It is thought to play a key role in regulating Arctic freshwater discharge to the North Atlantic, and in recent decades its freshwater content has increased in a time of rapid Arctic change. Despite this, its exact dynamical behavior is not fully understood. Here, we make use of an Arctic-wide dataset of dynamic ocean topography, including data under sea ice, to characterize the time-varying extent, shape, and location of the Beaufort Gyre. We show that the gyre expanded toward the northwest between 2003 and 2014, resulting in increased proximity to the Chukchi Plateau and Mendeleev Ridge by 2014. We find that the gyre strength and maximum dynamic ocean topography both respond readily to changes in intensity of the surface forcing, but the gyre area is additionally affected by the location of the Beaufort Sea High. This results in expansion over the Chukchi Plateau and increased asymmetry of the gyre as it becomes constrained by the shallow bathymetry. The gyre strength is correlated with the integrated surface stress on the ocean over the previous 3months. We discuss the implications of the expansion over shallow bathymetry on gyre dynamical behavior and the potential impacts on the physical properties in the Canada Basin. Plain Language Summary The Beaufort Gyre, in the Canadian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, contains a large amount of the total freshwater held in the Arctic and is thought to be important in controlling freshwater exported out into the North Atlantic and thus affects the oceanography there. Recently, the freshwater in the gyre has increased, but the gyre itself and the effect of this change are not well understood. We use a satellite dataset to describe, in detail, the size, shape, and position of the gyre, and how it changed over 2003-2014. We found that the gyre circulation increases when winds strengthen, with a delayed response of 3 months. The spatial distribution of the wind also affects the position and shape of the gyre. The gyre expanded toward the northwest until it reached shallow bathymetry, which limited free expansion and caused its shape to become asymmetrical. We discuss the potential effects of this on the gyre's circulation and freshwater storage, as well as impacts on the surrounding ocean.

Processing Choices Affect Ocean Mass Estimates From GRACE	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						ocean mass; GRACE; inversion	SEA-LEVEL BUDGET; HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; MANTLE VISCOSITY; ICE-SHEET; UPLIFT	Accurate estimates of ocean mass change are necessary to infer steric sea level change from sea level changes measured with satellite altimeters. Published studies using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission indicated a large range in trends (approximate to 1-2mm/year) with reported standard errors of 0.1-0.3mm/year. Here we show that a large part of this discrepancy (up to 0.6mm/year) can be explained by which model is used to account for the effect of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The second largest contribution (0.3-0.4mm/year) is related to the way how different studies have restored atmospheric and oceanic signals which have been removed during the GRACE gravity estimation process. Here two processing strategies, which previously resulted in differing ocean mass trends, are considered. The direct method uses the standard GRACE Stokes coefficients, while the inverse method applies a joint inversion of data from GRACE and altimetry. After accounting for differences in processing corrections, global mean ocean mass estimates from the direct, the mascon, and inverse approach agree with each other on global scales within less than 0.1mm/year. Using the A et al. (2013; ) GIA model, we provide a reconciled monthly time series of global mean ocean mass, which suggests that ocean mass has increased by 1.43mm/year over 2002.6-2014.5, with an amplified rate of 1.75mm/year over 2002.6-2016.5 which covers almost the complete GRACE time span. However, we note that estimates as low as 1.05mm/year cannot be ruled out when other published GIA corrections with lower mass-equivalent signals over Antarctica are used. Plain Language Summary Since 1993, it is possible to estimate highly accurate global sea level rise (currently about 3.2mm/year) from satellite altimetry. However, partitioning the measured total sea level change into steric (volumetric) and mass contributions is challenging. Here we study the computation of the integrated mass contribution, that is, the sum of melting and mass imbalance of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, of the land glaciers, and variations in terrestrial water storages. We investigate two different approaches which previously provided diverging estimates of ocean mass change of up to 1mm/year: (1) the direct approach which estimates ocean mass change directly from satellite gravity data collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and (2) the inverse approach which combines the GRACE gravity data with satellite altimetry data in a joint estimation. We identify the reason for the differences between the approaches by showing that certain individual processing corrections were applied for each method differently. After applying these corrections consistently, ocean mass rates from both approaches agreed well within less than 0.1mm/year and we were able to provide a consistent ocean mass rate of 1.43mm/year for the period 2002-2014. These results have direct implications for estimating the global warming of the oceans.	[Uebbing, B.; Kusche, J.; Rietbroek, R.] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Bonn, Germany; [Landerer, F.

Space Weather Modeling Capabilities Assessment: Auroral Precipitation and High-Latitude Ionospheric Electrodynamics	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							BIRKELAND CURRENTS; PEDERSEN; EVENT; HALL	As part of its International Capabilities Assessment effort, the Community Coordinated Modeling Center initiated several working teams, one of which is focused on the validation of models and methods for determining auroral electrodynamic parameters, including particle precipitation, conductivities, electric fields, neutral density and winds, currents, Joule heating, auroral boundaries, and ion outflow. Auroral electrodynamic properties are needed as input to space weather models, to test and validate the accuracy of physical models, and to provide needed information for space weather customers and researchers. The working team developed a process for validating auroral electrodynamic quantities that begins with the selection of a set of events, followed by construction of ground truth databases using all available data and assimilative data analysis techniques. Using optimized, predefined metrics, the ground truth data for selected events can be used to assess model performance and improvement over time. The availability of global observations and sophisticated data assimilation techniques provides the means to create accurate ground truth databases routinely and accurately.

Impacts of climate warming on maximum aviation payloads	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							EXTREME TEMPERATURES; CYCLE; AIR	The increasing importance of aviation activities in modern life coincides with a steady warming climate. However, the effect of climate warming on maximum aircraft carrying capacity or payload has been unclear. Here we clarify this issue using primary atmospheric parameters from 27 fully coupled climate models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) archive, utilizing the direct proportionality of near-surface air density (NSAD) to maximum take-off total weight (MTOW). Historical (twentieth century) runs of these climate models showed high credibility in reproducing the reanalysis period (1950-2015) of NSAD. In particular, the model simulated trends in NSAD are highly aligned with the reanalysis values. This reduction in NSAD is a first order global signal, just as is the warming itself, that continues into the future. To examine the statistical significance of the density reduction, a t-test was performed for two 20-year periods 75years apart (2080-2100 vs. 2005-2025), using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Most continental areas easily passed the test at a P-value of 0.05. These future changes of NSAD will likely have significant economic impacts on the aviation industry. For these two 20-year periods that we examined, the most extreme changes are in the Northern hemisphere in high latitudes, i.e., a 5% decrease in MTOW, or 8.5-19% (aircraft-dependent) reduction in payload. The global average change is about 1%. For the busy North Atlantic Corridor (NAC), the reduction in MTOW is generally greater than 1% and that of payload several times larger.

Global climatology of planetary boundary layer top obtained from multi-satellite GPS RO observations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						PBL; GPSRO; COSMIC; Radiosonde; Refractivity; Temperature	RADIO OCCULTATION DATA; TROPICAL STATION; HEIGHT; SATELLITE; MISSION; TEMPERATURE; DEPTH; PACIFIC; CHAMP; MODEL	Accurate estimation of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) top is essential for air quality prediction, weather forecast, and assessment of regional and global climate models. In this article, the long-term climatology of seasonal, global distribution of PBL is presented by using global positioning system radio occultation (GPSRO) based payloads such as Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS), TerraSAR-X, and The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) from the year 2006-2015. We used Wavelet Covariance Transform (WCT) technique for precise PBL top identification. The derived PBL top from GPSRO data is rigorously evaluated with GPS radiosonde data over Gadanki. Significant seasonal variation is noticed in both radiosonde and GPSRO observations. Further, we compared the PBL obtained GPS RO with global radiosonde network and observed very good correlation. The number of occultations reaching down to 500m and retrieval rate of PBL top from WCT method is very high in mid-latitudes compared to tropical latitudes. The global distribution of PBL top shows significant seasonal variation with higher during summer followed by spring, fall, and minimum in winter. In the vicinity of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the PBL top is high over eastern Pacific compared to other regions. The ERA-Interim reanalysis data underestimate the PBL top compared to GPS RO observations due to different measurement techniques. The seasonal variation of global averaged PBL top over land and ocean shows contrasting features at different latitude bands.	[Basha, Ghouse; Ratnam, M. Venkat; Babu, S.

Oil Slick Characterization Using a Statistical Region-Based Classifier Applied to UAVSAR Data	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						oil slicks characterization; oil thickness; polarized SAR data; polarimetric SAR data (PolSAR); statistical region-based classification; uncertainty maps; UAVSAR	STOCHASTIC DISTANCES; SURFACE SLICKS; SAR; IMAGERY; SPILLS	During emergency responses to oil spills on the sea surface, quick detection and characterization of an oil slick is essential. The use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in general and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) in particular to detect and discriminate mineral oils from look-alikes is known. However, research exploring its potential to detect oil slick characteristics, e.g., thickness variations, is relatively new. Here a Multi-Source Image Processing System capable of processing optical, SAR and PolSAR data with proper statistical models was tested for the first time for oil slick characterization. An oil seep detected by NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) in the Gulf of Mexico was used as a study case. This classifier uses a supervised approach to compare stochastic distances between different statistical distributions (fx) and hypothesis tests to associate confidence levels to the classification results. The classifier was able to detect zoning regions within the slick with high global accuracies and low uncertainties. Two different classes, likely associated with the thicker and thinner oil layers, were recognized. The best results, statistically equivalent, were obtained using different data formats: polarimetric, intensity pair and intensity single-channel. The presence of oceanic features in the form of oceanic fronts and internal waves created convergence zones that defined the shape, spreading and concentration of the thickest layers of oil. The statistical classifier was able to detect the thicker oil layers accumulated along these features. Identification of the relative thickness of spilled oils can increase the oil recovery efficiency, allowing better positioning of barriers and skimmers over the thickest layers.

Mineral-Filled Fractures as Indicators of Multigenerational Fluid Flow in the Pahrump Hills Member of the Murray Formation, Gale Crater, Mars	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						hydrofracture; fluid flow; postdepositional diagenesis; veins; Gale crater; Mars; multigenerational	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; CRACK-SEAL; CALCIUM-SULFATE; OPPAMINDA CREEK; FIBROUS VEINS; MOUNT SHARP; ROCK MASS; CHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; MISSION	Mineral-filled fractures (veins) are valuable indicators of deformation and fluid flow within a sedimentary package. Information obtained from vein morphology, texture, and chemistry may elucidate the sequence and nature of postdepositional fluid events. Additional information from vein patterns and interactions between veins and host rock provides insight into fracture formation mechanism(s). The widespread occurrence of veins and other diagenetic features in the sedimentary rock record preserved in Gale crater, Mars, indicates that postdepositional fluids were regionally active considerably later in time than the primary fluviolacustrine environments responsible for the deposition of Mount Sharp strata. Here we report a suite of veins within the Murray formation at the Pahrump Hills locality that were investigated using the scientific payload of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. Based on an analysis of vein color, morphology, and texture, and corroborated by vein chemistry, we interpret three distinct vein types at Pahrump Hills: gray veins, white veins, and dark-toned veins. These veins represent distinct, separate episodes of postdepositional fluid flow, suggesting a protracted history of fluid stability in Gale crater. Additionally, we utilize vein patterns across multiple lithologies at the Pahrump Hills field site to suggest hydrofracture as the primary mechanism of fracture formation.	[Kronyak, R. E.; Kah, L.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder Obs4MIPs Version 2 Data Set	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						AIRS; Obs4MIPs; CMIP; AMSU-A	MOIST THERMODYNAMIC STRUCTURE; WATER; TEMPERATURE; MISSION; CMIP5; RETRIEVALS; HUMIDITY; SCIENCE; DESIGN; BIASES	The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Obs4MIPs (Observations for Model Intercomparison Projects) Version 2 data set includes monthly mean tropospheric air temperature, specific humidity, and relative humidity for each calendar month from September 2002 to September 2016, on a global 1 degrees x1 degrees latitude-longitude spatial grid and on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project eight mandatory vertical pressure levels from 1,000 to 300hPa. It also includes standard error and number of observations, for an estimate of AIRS data retrieval error and sampling uncertainty. Three new technical notes describe the data set. This data set is designed for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project climate model evaluation and has been published at Earth System Grid Federation data centers since April 2018. It adds new monthly mean tropospheric relative humidity data to Obs4MIPs and updates and extends the monthly mean tropospheric air temperature and specific humidity data in AIRS Obs4MIPs Version 1 data set. The data source for this data set is the AIRS Version 6 Level 3 standard monthly mean air temperature, specific humidity, and relative humidity data products in the TqJoint grids from the AIRS and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A combined physical retrievals. This paper documents this data set in terms of motivation for this data set, data description, data origin and processing procedures, major improvements from the previous version, and caveats for its use in climate model evaluation. Plain Language Summary We have published a new data set designed for climate model evaluation from the infrared and microwave atmospheric sounding system (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A) on the NASA Aqua satellite. In this paper, we briefly describe the reasons for providing this data set, its detailed data structure, the original data and processing procedures used to generate this data set, major improvements in comparison to the previous version, and the issues to be considered for climate model evaluation with it.

J	Madson, A; Fielding, E; Sheng, YW; Cavanaugh, K				Madson, Austin; Fielding, Eric; Sheng, Yongwei; Cavanaugh, Kyle			High-Resolution Spaceborne, Airborne and In Situ Landslide Kinematic Measurements of the Slumgullion Landslide in Southwest Colorado	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						synthetic aperture radar (SAR); unmanned aircraft systems (UAS); structure from motion (SfM); pixel offsets; landslide kinematics	TIME-SERIES; NORTHERN APENNINES; OFFSET-TRACKING; IMAGE CORRELATION; DEFORMATION; MOTION; FIELD; INTERFEROMETRY; DISPLACEMENTS; EARTHFLOWS	The Slumgullion landslide, located in southwestern Colorado, has been active since the early 1700s and current data suggests that the most active portion of the slide creeps at a rate of similar to 1.5-2.0 cm/day. Accurate deformation measurement techniques are vital to the understanding of persistent, yet slow-moving landslides like the Slumgullion. The factors that affect slope movements at the Slumgullion are on-time scales that are well suited towards a remotely sensed approach to constrain the 12 different kinematic units that make up the persistent creeping landslide. We derive a time series of motion vectors (magnitude and direction) using subpixel offset techniques from very high resolution TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight ascending/descending data as well as from a novel high-resolution amalgamation of airborne lidar and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) Structure from Motion (SfM) digital surface model (DSM) hillshades. Deformation rates calculated from the spaceborne and airborne datasets show high agreement (mean difference of similar to 0.9 mm/day), further highlighting the potential for the monitoring of ongoing mass wasting events utilizing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) We compare pixel offset results from an 11-day synthetic aperture radar (SAR) pair acquired in July of 2016 with motion vectors from a coincident low-cost L1 only Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) field campaign in order to verify the remotely sensed results and to derive the accuracy of the azimuth and range offsets. We find that the average azimuth and range pixel offset accuracies utilizing the methods herein are on the order of 1/18 and 1/20 of their along-track and slant range focused ground pixel spacing values of 16.8 cm and 45.5 cm, respectively. We utilize the SAR offset time series to add a twelfth kinematic unit to the previously established set of eleven unique regions at the site of an established minislide within the main landslide itself. Lastly, we compare the calculated rates and direction from all spaceborne- and airborne-derived motion vectors for each of the established kinematic zones within the active portion of the landslide. These comparisons show an overall increased magnitude and across-track component (i.e., more westerly angles of motion) for the descending SAR data as compared to their ascending counterparts. The processing techniques and subsequent results herein provide for an improved knowledge of the Slumgullion landslide's kinematics and this increased knowledge has implications for the advancement of measurement techniques and the understanding of globally distributed creeping landslides.

Significant relationships between soil moisture and different land surface-atmosphere fields (Precipitation, surface air temperature, total cloud cover, and total water storage) were studied, using maximum covariance analysis (MCA) to extract dominant interactions that maximize the covariance between two fields. The first leading mode of MCA explained 56%, 87%, 81%, and 79% of the squared covariance function (SCF) between soil moisture with precipitation (PR), surface air temperature (TEM), total cloud count (TCC), and total water storage (TWS), respectively, with correlation coefficients of 0.65, -0.72, 0.71, and 0.62. Furthermore, the covariance analysis of total water storage showed contrasting patterns with soil moisture, especially over northwest, northeast, and west coast regions. In addition, the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual trends of soil moisture in India was estimated using a robust regression technique for the very first time. For most regions in India, significant positive trends were noticed in all seasons. Meanwhile, a small negative trend was observed over southern India. The monthly mean value of AMSR soil moisture trend revealed a significant positive trend, at about 0.0158 cm(3)/cm(3) per decade during the period ranging from 2002 to 2017.

In recent years, tide gauge records for the Eastern coast of Korea have revealed rapid increases in sea level rise compared with the global mean. Pohang Tide Gauge Station has shown a +3.1 cm/year sea level rise since 2013. This study aims to estimate the vertical land motion that influences relative sea level rise observations at Pohang by applying a multi-track Persistent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) time-series analysis to Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired during 2015-2017. The results, which were obtained at a high spatial resolution (10 m), indicate vertical ground motion of -2.55 cm/year at the Pohang Tide Gauge Station; this was validated by data from a collocated global positioning system (GPS) station. The subtraction of InSAR-derived subsidence rates from sea level rise at the Pohang Tide Gauge Station is 6 mm/year; thus, vertical land motion significantly dominates the sea level acceleration. Natural hazards related to the sea level rise are primarily assessed by relative sea level changes obtained from tide gauges; therefore, tide gauge records should be reviewed for rapid vertical land motion along the vulnerable coastal areas.

Zeolite-loaded aerogel as a primary vacuum sorption pump in planetary instruments	ADSORPTION-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL ADSORPTION SOCIETY			English	Article						InSight mission; Seismometer; SEIS; Planetary instruments; Vacuum; Sorption pump; Getter; Zeolite; Zeolite-loaded aerogel	ADSORPTION; NITROGEN; CLOCK; GASES; ION; CO2	Zeolite-loaded aerogel (ZLA) getters were devised and developed for maintaining vacuum in the Seismic Experience for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument on the NASA InSight mission to Mars. The ZLA are very lightweight compound materials (similar to 0.1g/cm(3)) with tunable density and high surface area (similar to 500m(2)/g), capable of maintaining high vacuum (HV, <10(-3)mbar) for extended periods of time at room temperature without any maintenance or consumption of power. Low temperatures, such as the surface environments on Mars and the icy worlds, enhance the ZLA adsorption by orders of magnitude, extending their capacity to the deep HV range sustainable over multi-year missions. Selective adsorption properties for species of interest can be further enhanced by cation exchange (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Pd2+, etc.) prior to the zeolite incorporation in the material. The sol-gel process was formulated to produce homogeneously dispersed micron-sized zeolite particles embedded in the aerogel matrix. The ZLA liquid precursor can be cast in practically any shape prior to the formation of the solid wet gel, which is then dried supercritically. The resulting mesoporous aerogel network provides excellent molecular transport to the zeolite particles. For particle sensitive instruments such as SEIS, the ZLA adsorbers can be isolated by sub-micron filters without noticeable effects on their performance.

We have selected the study area that covers some surface types such as water, sand, agricultural (vegetated) land, and clouds. Results of the current study show the reasonable geographical distribution of surface temperature over land and water similar to the pattern of the MASTER L2 surface temperature. The thorough quantitative validation of surface temperature retrieved from this study is somehow limited due to the lack of in-situ measurements. One point comparison at the Salton Sea buoy shows that the present estimate is 1.8 K higher than the field data. Further comparison with the MASTER L2 surface temperature over the study area reveals statistically good agreement with mean differences of 4.6 K between two estimates. We further analyze the surface temperature differences between two estimates and find primary factors to be emissivity and atmospheric correction.

Improving slip prediction on Mars using thermal inertia measurements	AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS			English	Article						Space robotics; Traversability prediction; Terramechanics; Computer vision	GROUND TEMPERATURE SENSOR; TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION; TRAVERSABILITY	Rovers operating on Mars have been delayed, diverted, and trapped by loose granular materials. Vision-based mobility prediction cannot reliably distinguish hazardous sand from safe sand based on appearance alone. Unlike surface appearance, the thermal inertia of terrain is directly correlated to the same geophysical properties that control slip. This paper presents a quantitative analysis that shows improvement in rover slip prediction when considering thermal inertia based on data from the Curiosity rover. Thermal inertia is estimated for each slip measurement in sand using both on-board and orbital instruments. Slip models are learned using a mixture of experts approach where the experts are identified using thermal inertia. Two-expert models are compared to a single-expert, vision-only model to show that slip predictions are improved by separating high-slip, low thermal inertia sand from low-slip, high thermal inertia sand. Simulated experiments are also presented to show that thermal inertia has the potential to identify sand even when it is beneath a thin layer of surface duricrust. These results support the hypothesis that the consideration of thermal inertia improves mobility estimates for rovers on Mars.

International Space Station conditions alter genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in Aspergillus nidulans	APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Aspergillus nidulans; International Space Station; Genomics; Proteomics; Metabolomics	FILAMENTOUS FUNGI; GENE CLUSTERS; CELL-WALL; MICROBIAL-CONTAMINATION; IONIZING-RADIATION; MESSENGER-RNAS; SECONDARY; DEGRADATION; EXPRESSION; REGULATOR	The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and three mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments.	[Romsdahl, Jillian; Blachowicz, Adriana; Chiang, Yi-Ming; Yaegashi, Junko; Wang, Clay C.

J	Turyshev, SG; Toth, VT				Turyshev, Slava G.; Toth, Viktor T.			Optical properties of the solar gravitational lens in the presence of the solar corona	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS			English	Article							ELECTRON-DENSITIES; PLASMA; SUN	We investigate the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) in the presence of the solar corona. For this, we consider the combined influence of the static spherically symmetric gravitational field of the Sun modeled within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity and of the solar corona modeled as a generic, static, spherically symmetric free electron plasma. We study the propagation of monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) waves through the solar system and develop a Mie theory that accounts for the refractive properties of the gravitational field of the Sun and that of the free electron plasma in the extended solar system. We establish a compact, closed-form solution to the boundary value problem and demonstrate that the presence of the solar plasma affects all characteristics of an incident unpolarized light. The affected properties include the direction of the EM wave propagation, its amplitude and its phase, leading to a reduction of the light amplification of the SGL and to a broadening of the corresponding point spread function. The wavelength-dependent plasma effect is critically important at radio frequencies, where it drastically reduces both the amplification factor of the SGL and also its angular resolution. However, for optical and shorter wavelengths, the plasma's contribution to the EM wave leaves the plasma-free optical properties of the SGL practically unaffected. We discuss the applicability of the SGL for direct high-resolution multipixel imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of exoplanets.

A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis. CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels. Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for "return to Earth". Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed. Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data. Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90% of participants "somewhat agreeing" or "strongly agreeing" that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.

The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. I. Survey Overview and a Catalog of >2000 Galaxy Clusters at z similar or equal to 1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: distances and redshifts; galaxies: evolution; surveys	SUPERCOSMOS SKY SURVEY; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; INTERACTION CROSS-SECTION; DARK-MATTER; X-RAY; HIGH-REDSHIFT; XMMXCS J2215.9-1738; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; DENSITY RELATION; EVOLUTION	We present the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS), a search for galaxy clusters at 0.7 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 1.5 based upon data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission. MaDCoWS is the first cluster survey capable of discovering massive clusters at these redshifts over the full extragalactic sky. The search is divided into two regions-the region of the extragalactic sky covered by Pan-STARRS (delta > - 30 degrees) and the remainder of the southern extragalactic sky at delta < -30 degrees for which shallower optical data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey is available. In this paper, we describe the search algorithm, characterize the sample, and present the first MaDCoWS data release-catalogs of the 2433 highest amplitude detections in the WISE-Pan-STARRS region and the 250 highest amplitude detections in the WISE-SuperCOSMOS region. A total of 1723 of the detections from the WISE-Pan-STARRS sample have also been observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope, providing photometric redshifts and richnesses, and an additional 64 detections within the WISE-SuperCOSMOS region also have photometric redshifts and richnesses. Spectroscopic redshifts for 38 MaDCoWS clusters with IRAC photometry demonstrate that the photometric redshifts have an uncertainty of sigma(z)/(1 + z) similar or equal to 0.036. Combining the richness measurements with Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations of MaDCoWS clusters, we also present a preliminary mass-richness relation that can be used to infer the approximate mass distribution of the full sample. The estimated median mass for the WISE-Pan-STARRS catalog is M-500 = 1.6(-0.8)(+0.7) x 10(14) M-circle dot, with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich data confirming that we detect clusters with masses up to M-500 similar to 5 x 10(14) M-circle dot (M-200 similar to 10(15) M-circle dot).

Role of agricultural activity on land subsidence in the San Joaquin Valley, California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Agriculture activity; Central valley; Subsidence; InSAR; Water supply; Groundwater wells		The center of the San Joaquin Valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US. Farmers rely heavily on surface-water diversions to meet irrigation water demand. However, the 2007-2010 and 2012-2017 droughts have caused strong increases in groundwater pumping causing land subsidence with strong variability in location, magnitude (total subsidence) and rate of subsidence. In this study, we try to understand what caused these variations. We focus our analyses on three areas: (i) the Westland water district where subsidence was very small during the two drought periods, (ii) 'El Nido' area where the greatest subsidence rate was monitored from 2008 to 2010, and (iii) the' Kings-Tulare counties' area where the subsidence was small during the 2008-2010 and the largest during 2015-2017 droughts. Our main finding is that land subsidence is located in areas where the water demand for agriculture and the density of groundwater wells is the highest, whereas the rate of subsidence is strongly affected the amount of local and imported surface water and by groundwater resources. Based on these simple observations, we propose using continuous satellite-based ground deformation monitoring and geomechanical modeling to (i) localize areas most prone for future subsidence and (ii) to estimate and manage groundwater resources.

This paper examines a Bayesian nearest neighbor approach for prognostic detection of precipitation and its phase using passive microwave observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite. The method uses the weighted Euclidean distance metric to search through an a priori database populated with coincident GPM radiometer and radar observations as well as ancillary snow-cover data. The algorithm performance is evaluated using data from GPM official precipitation products, ground-based radars, and high-fidelity simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. Using the presented approach, we demonstrate that the hit probability of terrestrial precipitation detection can reach to 0.80, while the probability of false alarm remains below 0.11. The algorithm demonstrates higher skill in detecting snowfall than rainfall, on average by 10%. In particular, the probability of precipitation detection and its solid phase increases by 11% and 8%, over dry snow cover, when compared to other surface types. The main reason is found to be related to the ability of the algorithm in capturing the signal of increased liquid water content in snowy clouds over radiometrically cold snow-covered surfaces.

An aqueously altered carbon-rich Ceres	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							MODAL MINERALOGY; LUNAR CATACLYSM; ORGANIC-MATTER; EVOLUTION; SURFACE; RAY; CONSTRAINTS; DEPENDENCE; ABUNDANCE; CARRIER	The surface mineralogy of dwarf planet Ceres appears to be dominated by products of rock-fluid interactions, such as phyllosilicates-some of which are NH4-bearing-and carbonates(1-3). Elemental concentrations derived from the inferred mineral mixing fractions, however, do not match measurements of H, C, K and Fe on Ceres(4). A complicating factor in assessing Ceres's unique surface composition is the secular accretion of asteroids typical of chondritic compositions. Here we show that Ceres's mineral and elemental data can be explained by the presence of carbonaceous chondritic-like materials (similar to 50-60 vol%), possibly due to infalling asteroids, admixed with aqueously altered endogenic materials that contain higher-than-chondritic concentrations of carbon. We find that Ceres's surface may contain up to 20 wt% of carbon, which is more than five times higher than in carbonaceous chondrites. The coexistence of phyllosilicates, magnetite, carbonates and a high carbon content implies rock-water alteration played an important role in promoting widespread carbon chemistry. These findings unveil pathways for the synthesis of organic matter, with implications for their transport across the Solar System.

Searching for the Donor Stars of ULX Pulsars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						infrared: stars; stars: neutron; X-rays: individual (M82 X-2, NGC 5907 X-1, NGC 5907 ULX-2)	X-RAY SOURCE; BLACK-HOLE; NEUTRON-STARS; DISCOVERY; MASS; LUMINOSITY; CONSTRAINTS; COUNTERPART; PULSATIONS; CANDIDATE	We report on our search for the optical counterparts of two ultraluminous X-ray pulsars with known orbital periods, M82 X-2 and NGC 5907 X-1, in new and archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, in an effort to characterize the donor stars in these systems. We detect five near-infrared sources consistent with the position of M82 X-2 that are too bright to be single stars. We also detect seven sources in the WFC3/UVIS F336W image whose photometry matches that of 10-15 M-circle dot stars turning off the main sequence. Such stars have densities consistent with the properties of the donor star of M82 X-2 as inferred from X-ray timing analysis, although it is also possible that the donor is a lower-mass star below our detection limit or that there is a significant contribution from the accretion disk to the optical emission. We detect three candidate counterparts to NGC 5907 X-1 in the near-infrared. All of these are too bright to be the donor star of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), which, based on its orbital period, is a red giant. The high background at the location of NGC 5907 X-1 precludes us from detecting this expected donor star. The recently discovered NGC 5907 ULX-2 also falls within the field of view of the near-infrared imaging; we detect four sources in the error circle, with photometry that matches asymptotic giant branch stars. The star suggested to be the counterpart of NGC 5907 ULX-2 by Pintore et al. falls outside our 2 sigma error circle.	[Heida, M.; Harrison, F.

Two sets of stacks are investigated: one uses a thin film piezoelectric material with a bottom electrode on GaN substrate (i.e., AlN/Mo/GaN) and another includes a piezoelectric thin film with bottom metal on a Si substrate (i.e., AlN/Mo/Si). A vibrating BAW transducer induces a SAW in the substrate and between two sets of interdigitated transducers improving the coupling efficiency by a factor of >= 8x as compared to the conventional SAW. The performance of the coupled BAW/SAW resonators using each of the Si and GaN substrates is compared using FEM analysis. By using FEM, coupling efficiency of the hybrid BAW/SAW with AlN/Mo/Si stack is 2.4%, whereas it is 3.2% for the SAW using AlN/Mo/GaN stack.

Synthesis of Amorphous/Crystalline Laminated Metals via Accumulative Roll Bonding	JOM			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DEFORMATION; GLASSES; ALLOY; CRYSTALLIZATION; PLASTICITY; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; HARDNESS; STATE	Bulk metallic glasses (BMG) are best known for their high strength and hardness; however, due to their limited tensile plasticity, they are undesirable for many structural applications. Nano-laminated amorphous/crystalline metals fabricated via deposition techniques have been shown to deform homogeneously while demonstrating extraordinary mechanical properties, including high strength and ductility; however, their fabrication is limited in size and scalability potential. Here, accumulative roll bonding has been demonstrated as a scalable fabrication technique for the processing of nanolaminated Zr-based BMG/Ni composites. The rolling was performed at elevated temperatures, utilizing the thermoplastic formability of the BMG in its supercooled liquid region. Microhardness measurements were utilized to investigate the thermo-mechanical history of the BMG phase. Refined BMG layers with thicknesses as small as 34nm have been characterized using transmission electron microscopy techniques. The resulting amorphous/crystalline interface has been demonstrated to have an effective interface width of 3-4nm.

Here we analyze Jupiter's rotational light curves at 12 wavelengths from the ultraviolet (UV) to the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The peak-to-peak amplitudes of Jupiter's light curves range from subpercent to 4% at most wavelengths, but the amplitude exceeds 20% at 5 mu m, a wavelength sensing Jupiter's deep troposphere. Jupiter's rotational modulations are primarily caused by discrete patterns in the cloudless belts instead of the cloudy zones. The light-curve amplitude is controlled by the sizes and brightness contrasts of the Great Red Spot (GRS), expansions of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), patchy clouds in the North Temperate Belt (NTB), and a train of hot spots in the NEB. In reflection, the contrast is controlled by upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes, clouds, and chromophores in the clouds. In thermal emission, the small rotational variability is caused by the spatial distribution of temperature and opacities of gas and aerosols; the large variation is caused by the NH3 cloud holes and thin-thick clouds. The methane-band light curves exhibit opposite-shape behavior compared with the UV and visible wavelengths, caused by a wavelength-dependent brightness change of the GRS. Light-curve evolution is induced by periodic events in the belts and longitudinal drifting of the GRS and patchy clouds in the NTB. This study suggests several interesting mechanisms related to distributions of temperature, gas, hazes, and clouds for understanding the observed rotational modulations on brown dwarfs and exoplanets.

In-flight Characterization and Calibration of the Juno-ultraviolet Spectrograph (Juno-UVS)	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: spectrographs; methods: data analysis; stars: general; techniques: imaging spectroscopy; ultraviolet: stars	RECALIBRATION; ALICE	Juno is the first polar orbiter around Jupiter. Juno possesses a suite of instruments designed to measure the electron and ion populations in the Jupiter magnetosphere, leading to the powerful Jovian aurorae. The Ultraviolet Spectrograph onboard Juno (Juno-UVS) is a photon-counting imaging spectrograph (68-210 nm), designed to observe and characterize Jupiter's far-ultraviolet aurorae. The instrument borrows heavily from previous Alice and UVS instruments led by Southwest Research Institute (New Horizons and Rosetta Alices, LRO-LAMP), with several major improvements. The pointing flexibility offered by the UVS scan mirror combined with Juno's spin allows UVS access to half of the sky at any given moment. This paper describes how we leverage this extensive database to track the evolution of Juno-UVS calibration with time throughout the mission. UVS observes 7.2 degrees x 360 degrees-long swaths of the sky for each rotation of the spacecraft (nominally 2 rpm). This paper describes how the very substantial amount of stellar spectra has been used to monitor the health of the instrument over the mission. As of PJ14 (2018 July 16), more than 8700 spectra of O, A, and B stars have been extracted in the V-magnitude range of similar to 0-7, and more than 99% of the sky was mapped. Selected stars among this list were used to calibrate the UVS bandpass, using observations from the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the Hubble Space Telescope. The retrieved effective area of the instrument is 0.30 +/- 0.03 cm(2) at 125 nm, 0.15 +/- 0.02 cm(2) at 140 nm, and 0.05 +/- 0.01 cm(2) at 160 nm.	[Hue, Vincent; Gladstone, G.

The lens is composed of very-low-mass brown dwarfs (BDs) with M-1 = 21(-5)(+12) M-J and M-2 = 9(-2)(+5) M-J, and it is located in the Galactic disk D-L = 2.85(-0.50)(+0.88) kpc. This is the fifth binary brown dwarf discovered by microlensing, and the BD binary is moving counter to the orbital motion of disk stars. Constraints on the lens physical properties come from late-time, non-caustic-crossing features of the Spitzer light curve. Thus, MOA-2016-BLG-231 shows how Spitzer plays a crucial role in resolving the nature of BDs in binary BD events with short timescales (less than or similar to 10 days).

Here, we present the results of a first laboratory experimental simulation of photochemistry in carbon-rich exoplanet atmospheres at elevated temperatures. The evolution of gas-phase molecular composition was quantitatively monitored with infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We found that H-2/CO gas compositions can change significantly from thermal equilibria compositions when irradiated with Ly alpha photons at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1500 K. Carbon dioxide and water were found to be the main products caused by photolysis, while the formation of methane was also observed to a lesser extent. We find that photochemistry efficiency is strongly correlated with increasing temperature. Our finding that water is efficiently produced by photochemistry in a supersolar C/O = 1 environment, representing C enhancement relative to solar values C/O ratio = 0.54, has significant implications for the interpretation of many exoplanet transmission spectra. We also find the formation of an organic solid condensate at 1500 K and under Ly alpha UV radiation, confirming the possibility of forming photochemical hazes in hot-Jupiter exoplanet atmospheres with an enhanced C/O ratio compared to solar.

Jansky Very Large Array to determine the radio morphologies of extended radio sources and the properties of their host-galaxies in 10 massive galaxy clusters at z similar to 1, an epoch in which clusters are assembling rapidly. These clusters are drawn from a parent sample of WISE-elected galaxy clusters that were cross-correlated with the VLA Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters survey to identify extended radio sources within 1' of the cluster centers. Out of the 10 targeted sources, 6 are FR II sources, 1 is an FR I source, and 3 have undetermined morphologies. Eight radio sources have associated Spitzer data, 75% presenting infrared counterparts. A majority of these counterparts are consistent with being massive galaxies. The angular extent of the FR sources exhibits a strong correlation with the cluster-centric radius, which warrants further investigation with a larger sample.

CCS and HC7N Chemistry and Three Modes of Star Formation in the Filaments	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; radio lines: ISM; stars: formation; surveys	DENSE CORES; DARK CLOUDS; VLBA DETERMINATION; GAS; DYNAMICS; COLLAPSE; N2H+; NH3; EVOLUTION; DISTANCE	We present deep CCS and HC7N observations of the L1495-B218 filaments in the Taurus molecular cloud obtained using the K-band focal plane array on the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. We observed the L1495-B218 filaments in CCS J(N) = 2(1)-1(0) and HC7N J = 21-20 with a spectral resolution of 0.038 km s(-1) and an angular resolution of 31" We observed strong CCS emission in both evolved and young regions and weak emission in two evolved regions. HC7N emission is observed only in L1495A-N and L1521D. We find that CCS and HC7N intensity peaks do not coincide with NH3 or dust continuum intensity peaks. We also find that the fractional abundance of CCS does not show a clear correlation with the dynamical evolutionary stage of dense cores. Our findings and chemical modeling indicate that the fractional abundances of CCS and HC7N are sensitive to the initial gas-phase C/O ratio, and they are good tracers of young condensed gas only when the initial C/O is close to solar value. Kinematic analysis using multiple lines, including NH3, HC7N, CCS, CO, HCN, and HCO+, suggests that there may be three different star formation modes in the L1495-B218 filaments. At the hub of the filaments, L1495A/B7N has formed a stellar cluster with large-scale inward flows (fast mode), whereas L1521D, a core embedded in a filament, is slowly contracting because of its self-gravity (slow mode). There is also one isolated core that appears to be marginally stable and may undergo quasi-static evolution (isolated mode).

Preliminary Trigonometric Parallaxes of 184 Late-T and Y Dwarfs and an Analysis of the Field Substellar Mass Function into the "Planetary" Mass Regime	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						brown dwarfs; parallaxes; solar neighborhood; stars: distances; stars: luminosity function, mass function	HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; PROPER-MOTION SURVEY; ALL-SKY SURVEY; EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; SPECTRAL TYPE-L; NEARBY L-DWARF; 0.9 M PROGRAM; BROWN DWARF; ULTRACOOL DWARFS; COOL NEIGHBORS	We present preliminary trigonometric parallaxes of 184 late-T and Y dwarfs using observations from Spitzer (143), the U.S. Naval Observatory (18), the New Technology Telescope (14), and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (9). To complete the 20 pc census of >= T6 dwarfs, we combine these measurements with previously published trigonometric parallaxes for an additional 44 objects and spectrophotometric distance estimates for another 7. For these 235 objects, we estimate temperatures, sift into five 150 K wide T-eff bins covering the range 300-1050 K, determine the completeness limit for each, and compute space densities. To anchor the high-mass end of the brown dwarf mass spectrum, we compile a list of early- to mid-L dwarfs within 20 pc. We run simulations using various functional forms of the mass function passed through two different sets of evolutionary code to compute predicted distributions in T-eff. The best fit of these predictions to our L, T, and Y observations is a simple power-law model with alpha approximate to 0.6 (where dN/dM proportional to M-alpha), meaning that the slope of the field substellar mass function is in rough agreement with that found for brown dwarfs in nearby star-forming regions and young clusters. Furthermore, we find that published versions of the log-normal form do not predict the steady rise seen in the space densities from 1050 to 350 K. We also find that the low-mass cutoff to formation, if one exists, is lower than similar to 5 M-Jup, which corroborates findings in young, nearby moving groups and implies that extremely low-mass objects have been forming over the lifetime of the Milky Way.

This region, dubbed CMa-l224, is located in the Canis Major OB1 association. CMa-l224 is relatively faint in the mid-infrared, but it shines brightly at the far-infrared wavelengths as revealed by the Herschel Space Observatory data from the Hi-GAL survey. Using the 3.6 and 4.5 mu m data from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE360 survey, combined with the JHK(s) Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the 70-500 mu m Herschel/Hi-GAL data, we develop young stellar object (YSO) selection criteria based on color-color cuts and fitting of the YSO candidates' spectral energy distributions with YSO 2D radiative transfer models. We identify 293 YSO candidates and estimate physical parameters for 210 sources well fit with YSO models. We select an additional 47 sources with GLIMPSE360-only photometry as "possible YSO candidates." The vast majority of these sources are associated with high H-2 column density regions and are good targets for follow-up studies. The distribution of YSO candidates at different evolutionary stages with respect to Herschel filaments supports the idea that stars are formed in the filaments and become more dispersed with time. Both the supernova-induced and spontaneous star formation scenarios are plausible in the environmental context of CMa-l224. However, our results indicate that a spontaneous gravitational collapse of filaments is a more likely scenario. The methods developed for CMa-l224 can be used for larger regions in the Galactic plane where the same set of photometry is available.

Each of the sensing approaches has distinct advantages and disadvantages. There is increasing interest in combining active and passive measurements in order to realize the advantages and alleviate the disadvantages. In order to combine active and passive measurements, their covariations with respect to soil moisture need to be known. The covariation is dependent on how the active and passive microwaves interact with vegetation canopy and soil surface. In this paper, we introduce a physics-based model for the covariation of active and passive microwaves over soil surfaces with vegetation cover. The analytical form for a covariation function is derived which depends on the scattering and absorption of microwaves by soil and vegetation with different orientations, structures, and water contents. The main finding is that the covariation function beta is related to the roughness and vegetation losses in the two measurements. An increase in soil roughness or in vegetation cover leads to less negative values of beta, which is pronounced for dense and moist vegetation. Both the soil and vegetation components introduce a polarization dependence of beta that is caused by polarization-induced differences in soil scattering and oriented plant structures. The forward modeled covariations are plotted together with statistically derived covariation estimates from two months of global active and passive L-band observations of the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The physically modeled and statistically derived estimates of covariation are comparable in magnitude and scale.

Data Processing and Analysis Approach to Retrieve Carbon Dioxide Weighted-Column Mixing Ratio and 2-mu m Reflectance With an Airborne Laser Absorption Spectrometer	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Atmosphere; carbon dioxide; data processing; laser absorption spectrometer; lidar	1.57 MU-M; LIDAR REFLECTANCE; SPACE	We describe the data processing and analysis algorithms used for high-precision retrievals of CO2 weighted-column mixing ratio and 2-mu m surface reflectance from the Carbon Dioxide Laser Absorption Spectrometer (CO(2)LAS). The CO(2)LAS at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA, is one of the instruments designed to demonstrate capabilities needed for the NASA Active Sensing over Nights, Days, and Seasons mission concept. The integrated path differential absorption technique is used in CO2 retrieval. The along-track spatial resolution for the airborne measurements described here ranges from 10 m to 1 km. Our approach employs heterodyne detection of two laser signals reflected off earth's surface. Frequency domain processing enables return signal peak detection and high-fidelity power estimation. We compensate for range to ground variations using a digital elevation model and emphasize the importance of reflectance weighting in time averaging of the surface elevation. Quality control filters are applied, as well as a statistical methodology to filter laser speckle fluctuations. Reflectance is also retrieved on the scale of a few meters of ground track. Our data processing workflow and example retrievals are presented.

Comparison of data products from IceBridge and CryoSat-2 is complicated by the fact that they use different geophysical corrections: reference ellipsoid, geoid model, tide model, and atmospheric corrections to derive surface elevation and sea-ice freeboard. In this paper, we compare sea-ice surface elevation and freeboard using eight coincident CryoSat-2, Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), and Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) observations with direct IceBridge underflights of CryoSat-2 ground tracks. We apply identical geophysical corrections to CryoSat-2 and IceBridge data to eliminate elevation biases due to these differences and focus on differences due to retracker performance. The IceBridge ATM and LVIS elevation and freeboard and Snow Radar snow depth data sets are averaged to each CryoSat-2 footprint for comparison. With snow depth measurements, we are able to compare elevations and freeboards at the snow/ice interface for five different CryoSat-2 retrackers (ESA, GSFCv1, AWI, JPL, and GSFCv2) and IceBridge. The overall mean of freeboard differences between GSFCv2, ESA, AWI, JPL retrackers, and ATM are in agreement within 0.05 m. However, the five different CryoSat-2 retrackers show distinct differences in mean elevation over leads and over floes. This suggests that the physical interpretation of the different retrackers needs to be considered depending on usage, for example, elevations from CryoSat-2 retrackers need to be carefully calibrated before comparing with elevation from other satellites for long-term surface elevation trends.

Indeed, aerosol particles constitute a highly variable atmospheric component characterized by a large number of parameters describing particle sizes, morphologies (including shape and internal structure), absorption and scattering properties, amounts, horizontal and vertical distribution, etc. Reliable monitoring of all these parameters is very challenging, and therefore the aerosol effects on climate and environment are considered to be among the most uncertain factors in climate and environmental research. In this regard, observations that provide both the angular distribution of the scattered atmospheric radiation as well as its polarization state at multiple wavelengths covering the UV-SWIR spectral range carry substantial implicit information on the atmospheric composition. Therefore, high expectations in improving aerosol characterization are associated with detailed passive photopolarimetric observations. The critical need to use space-borne polarimetry for global accurate monitoring of detailed aerosol properties was first articulated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By now, several orbital instruments have already provided polarization observations from space, and a number of advanced missions are scheduled for launch in the coming years by international and national space agencies. The first and most extensive record of polarimetric imagery was provided by POLDER-I, POLDER-II, and POLDER/PARASOL multi-angle multi-spectral polarization sensors. Polarimetric observations with the POLDER-like design intended for collecting extensive multi-angular multi-spectral measurements will be provided by several instruments, such as the MAI/TG-2, CAPI/TanSat, and DPC/GF-5 sensors recently launched by the Chinese Space Agency. Instruments such as the 3MI/MetOp-SG, MAIA, SpexOne and HARP2 on PACE, POSP, SMAC, PCF, DPC-Lidar, ScanPol and MSIP/Aerosol-UA, MAP/Copernicus CO2 Monitoring, etc. are planned to be launched by different space agencies in the coming decade. The concepts of these future instruments, their technical designs, and the accompanying algorithm development have been tested intensively and analyzed using diverse airborne prototypes. Certain polarimetric capabilities have also been implemented in such satellite sensors as GOME-2/MetOp and SGLI/GCOM-C. A number of aerosol retrieval products have been developed based on the available measurements and successfully used for different scientific applications. However, the completeness and accuracy of aerosol data operationally derived from polarimetry do not yet appear to have reached the accuracy levels implied by theoretical sensitivity studies that analyzed the potential information content of satellite polarimetry. As a result, the dataset provided by MODIS is still most frequently used by the scientific community, yet this sensor has neither polarimetric nor multi-angular capabilities. Admittedly polarimetric multi-angular observations are highly complex and have extra sensitivities to aerosol particle morphology, vertical variability of aerosol properties, polarization of surface reflectance, etc. As such, they necessitate state-of-the-art forward modeling based on first-principles physics which remains rare, and conventional retrieval approaches based on look-up tables turn out to be unsuitable to fully exploit the information implicit in the measurements. Several new-generation retrieval approaches have recently been proposed to address these challenges. These methods use improved forward modeling of atmospheric (polarized) radiances and implement a search in the continuous space of solutions using rigorous statistically optimized inversions. Such techniques provide more accurate retrievals of the main aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness and yield additional parameters such as aerosol absorption. However, the operational implementation of advanced retrieval approaches generally requires a significant extra effort, and the forward-modeling part of such retrievals still needs to be substantially improved. Ground-based passive polarimetric measurements have also been evolving over the past decade. Although polarimetry helps improve aerosol characterization, especially of the fine aerosol mode, the operators of major observational networks such as AERONET remain reluctant to include polarimetric measurements as part of routine retrievals owing to their high complexity and notable increase in effort required to acquire and interpret polarization data. In addition to remote-sensing observations, polarimetric characteristics of aerosol scattering have been measured in situ as well as in the laboratory using polar nephelometers. Such measurements constitute direct observations of single scattering with no contributions from multiple scattering effects and therefore provide unique data for the validation of aerosol optical models and retrieval concepts. This article overviews the above-mentioned polarimetric observations, their history and expected developments, and the state of resulting aerosol products. It also discusses the main achievements and challenges in the exploitation of polarimetry for the improved characterization of atmospheric aerosols. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Two factors suggested in the literature to be essential for the development of convective plumes are investigated: surface conditions and lateral entrainment. The model consistently decomposes the subgrid vertical mixing into convective plumes and the nonconvective environment. The modeled convection shows low sensitivity to the surface plume area. The results indicate that plume development in the subcloud layer is controlled by both surface conditions and lateral entrainment. Their impact significantly changes in the cloud layer where the surface conditions are no longer important. The development of shallow convection is dominated by the interactions between the plumes and the large-scale field and is sensitive to the representation of the variability of thermodynamic properties between the plumes. A simple two-layer model of steady-state convection is proposed to help understand the role of these processes in shaping the properties of moist convection.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Forest Tundra Ecotone; Northern treeline; MODIS; Photoperiod; PRI; Solar radiation; Climate change; Photosynthetic phenology	TUNDRA-TAIGA INTERFACE; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; ENERGY-DISSIPATION; OPTICAL INDICATOR; XANTHOPHYLL CYCLE; DIURNAL CHANGES; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TEMPERATURE; PIGMENTS	Relatively little is known of how the world's largest vegetation transition zone the Forest Tundra Ecotone (FTE) is responding to climate change. Newly available, satellite-derived time-series of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) across North America and Europe could provide new insights into the physiological response of evergreen trees to climate change by tracking changes in foliar pigment pools that have been linked to photosynthetic phenology. However, before implementing these data for such purpose at these evergreen dominated systems, it is important to increase our understanding of the fine scale mechanisms driving the connection between PRI and environmental conditions. The goal of this study is thus to gain a more mechanistic understanding of which environmental factors drive changes in PRI during late-season phenological transitions at the FTE including factors that are susceptible to climate change (i.e., air- and soil-temperatures), and those that are not (photoperiod). We hypothesized that late-season phenological changes in foliar pigment pools captured by PRI are largely driven by photoperiod as opposed to less predictable drivers such as air temperature, complicating the utility of PRI time-series for understanding climate change effects on the FTE. Ground-based, time series of PRI were acquired from individual trees in combination with meteorological variables and photoperiod information at six FTE sites in Alaska. A linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to determine the significance (alpha = 0.001) and effect size (i.e., standardized slope b*) of environmental factors on late-seasonal changes in the PRI signal. Our results indicate that photoperiod had the strongest, significant effect on late season changes in PRI (b* = 0.08, p < 0.001), but environmental variables susceptible to climate change were also significant (i.e., daily mean solar radiation (b* = 0.03, p < 0.001) and daily mean soil temperature (b* = 0.02, p < 0.001)). These results suggest that interpreting PRI time-series of late-season phenological transitions may indeed facilitate our understanding of how northern treeline responds to climate change.

Evaluation of SMAP downscaled brightness temperature using SMAPEx-4/5 airborne observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAP; Downscaled brightness temperature; Validation; Field experiment	SOIL-MOISTURE; MICROWAVE EMISSION; MODEL	The Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission, launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on 31st January 2015, was designed to provide global soil moisture every 2 to 3 days at 9 km resolution by downscaling SMAP passive microwave observations obtained at 36 km resolution using active microwave observations at 3 km resolution, and then retrieving soil moisture from the resulting 9 km brightness temperature product. This study evaluated the SMAP Active/Passive (AP) downscaling algorithm together with other resolution enhancement techniques. Airborne passive microwave observations acquired at 1 km resolution over the Murrumbidgee River catchment in south-eastern Australia during the fourth and fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiments (SMAPEx-4/5) were used as reference data. The SMAPEx-4/5 data were collected in May and September 2015, respectively, and aggregated to 9 km for direct comparison with a number of available resolution-enhanced brightness temperature estimates. The results show that the SMAP AP downscaled brightness temperature had a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.84 and Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of similar to 10 K, while SMAP Enhanced, Nearest Neighbour, Weighted Average, and the Smoothing Filter-based Modulation (SFIM) brightness temperature estimates had somewhat better performance (RMSEs of similar to 7 K and an R exceeding 0.9). Although the SFIM had the lowest unbiased RMSE of similar to 6 K, the effect of cloud cover on Ka-band observations limits data availability.	[Ye, N.; Walker, J.

The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 +/- 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.

This is the first test of InGaAs as a cost-effective alternative to HgCdTe for research-grade astronomical observations. The camera exhibits a background of 113 e(-1) s(-1)/pixel (dark + thermal) at operating sensor temperature T = -40 degrees C, maintained by a simple thermoelectric cooler. The optomechanical structure floats at ambient temperature with no cold stop, unlike most IR instruments which must be cooled to mitigate thermal backgrounds. Measurements of the night sky using a reimager scaled at 0.'' 4/pixel show that the sky flux in Y is comparable to the dark current. At J the sky exceeds dark current by a factor of four, dominating the noise budget. The read noise (similar to 43 e(-)) falls below sky + dark noise for exposures of t > 7 s in Y and 3.5 s in J. We observed several representative science targets, including two supernovae, a z = 6.3 quasar, two local galaxies monitored for IR transients, and a galaxy cluster at z = 0.87. We observe a partial transit of the hot Jupiter HATS-34b, demonstrating the photometric stability to detect a 1.2% transit. A tiling of larger-format sensors would produce an IR survey instrument with significant cost savings relative to HgCdTe-based cameras, if one is willing to forego the K band. Such a camera would be sensitive for a week or more to isotropic emission from r-process kilonova ejecta similar to that observed in GW170817, over the full 190 Mpc horizon of Advanced LIGO.

During that time the rover successfully drilled three full depth drill holes into the Martian surface and analyzed the recovered material using onboard instruments, giving us new insights into the potential habitability of ancient Mars. These drill targets are known as 'John Klein' (Sol 182) and 'Cumberland' (Sol 279), which lie in the mudstones of the Yellowknife Bay formation, and 'Windjana' (Sol 621), which lies in the sandstones of the Kimberley formation. In this paper we will discuss what was necessary to procure these samples, including: 1) an overview of the sampling hardware; 2) the steps taken to ensure sampling hardware is safe when drilling into a target (i.e., evaluation of rock type, rover stability, prior testbed experience, etc.); and 3) the drilling parameters used to acquire these samples. We will also describe each target individually and discuss why each sample was desired, the triage steps taken to ensure it could be safely acquired, and the telemetry obtained for each. Finally, we will present scientific highlights obtained from each site utilizing MSL's onboard instrumentation (SAM & CheMin), results enabled by the drills ability to excavate sample at depth and transfer it to these instruments.

Tidal stress modeling of Ganymede: Strike-slip tectonism and Coulomb failure	ICARUS			English	Article							NONSYNCHRONOUS ROTATION; GROOVED TERRAIN; GALILEO OBSERVATIONS; LAPLACE RESONANCE; CRATERING RATES; IMPACT FEATURES; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SHEAR FAILURE; POLAR WANDER; EUROPA	High-resolution Galileo data of Ganymede's complex surface provide strong and ubiquitous evidence of strike-slip motion: en echelon structures, strike-slip duplexes, laterally offset pre-existing features, and strained craters. In a previous study, we performed a detailed mapping of these strike-slip morphologies within nine regions of Ganymede: Dardanus Sulcus, Tiamat Sulcus, Nun Sulci, Byblus Sulcus, Nippur and Philus Sulci, the Transitional Terrain of Northern Marius Regio, Anshar Sulcus, Arbela Sulcus, and Uruk Sulcus. Strike-slip indicators were inferred in various combinations at each site, in addition to extensional processes. However, the prominence of strike-slip indicators suggests shearing has been an important process to the structural development of Ganymede's surface. Moreover, tidal stresses on Ganymede, under particular circumstances, may have been sufficient to induce Coulomb failure and generate strike-slip faulting. Here we investigate the role of both diurnal and non-synchronous rotation (NSR) tidal stresses on Ganymede using the numerical code SatStress. We resolve normal and shear tractions onto discrete fault segments of specified orientation and assess Coulomb failure potential for the nine inferred fault zones. Testing a range of subsurface fault depths (z = 0-5 km) and ice friction (mu(f) = 0.2-0.6), we find that tidal stress models of combined diurnal and NSR stress readily promote Coulomb failure within each studied fault zone. High friction (mu(f) = 0.6) limits failure depths to similar to 1 km, while low friction (mu(f) = 0.2) extends failure depths to similar to 2 km, consistent with elastic thickness estimates. We also compare each fault zones predicted shear sense to the inferred shear sense from our structural mapping efforts and find compatible senses of shear among six of the nine regions that exhibit notable fault offset and/or prevalent inferences of en echelon, duplexes, and strained craters. In addition, principal stress orientations and failure feasibility computed on a global scale suggest that combined diurnal and NSR tidal stresses promote Coulomb failure within the shallow (< 2 km) icy lithosphere across much of Ganymede. Coulomb failure is limited near the equator by large compressive NSR stresses, but stresses at mid- to high-latitudes readily promote Coulomb failure along a wide range of fault orientations. Based on these results, we infer that nonsynchronous rotation may have assisted the formation and evolution of strike-slip structures on Ganymede.

The Cassini VIMS archive of Titan: From browse products to global infrared color maps	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Titan surface; Image processing; Infrared observations	PHOTOMETRIC FUNCTION; SURFACE; RADAR; CLOUD; LAKES; FEATURES	We have analyzed the complete Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data archive of Titan. Our objective is to build global surface cartographic products, by combining all the data gathered during the 127 targeted flybys of Titan into synthetic global maps interpolated on a grid at 32 pixels per degree (similar to 1.4 km/pixel at the equator), in seven infrared spectral atmospheric windows. Multispectral summary images have been computed for each single VIMS cube in order to rapidly identify their scientific content and assess their quality. These summary images are made available to the community on a public website (vims.univ-nantes.fr). The global mapping work faced several challenges due to the strong absorbing and scattering effects of the atmosphere coupled to the changing observing conditions linked to the orbital tour of the Cassini mission. We determined a surface photometric function which accounts for variations in incidence, emergence and phase angles, and which is able to mitigate brightness variations linked to the viewing geometry of the flybys. The atmospheric contribution has been reduced using the subtraction of the methane absorption band wings, considered as proxies for atmospheric haze scattering. We present a new global three color composite map of band ratios (red: 1.59/1.27 mu m; green: 2.03/1.27 mu m; blue: 1.27/1.08 mu m), which has also been empirically corrected from an airmass (the solar photon path length through the atmosphere) dependence. This map provides a detailed global color view of Titan's surface partially corrected from the atmosphere and gives a global insight of the spectral variability, with the equatorial dunes fields appearing in brownish tones, and several occurrences of bluish tones localized in areas such as Sinlap, Menvra and Selk craters. This kind of spectral map can serve as a basis for further regional studies and comparisons with radiative transfer outputs, such as surface albedos, and other additional data sets acquired by the Cassini Radar (RADAR) and Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) instruments.

Part II: Wind probability distributions	ICARUS			English	Article						Martian atmosphere modeling; Atmospheric characterization; Weibull wind distribution; NASA Mars science laboratory; REMS data	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS; WEIBULL; SPEED; SIMULATION	The characterization of Martian surface wind speed as a function of time of day and season at one location can increase our knowledge of Mars surface conditions and assist in planning for future unmanned and manned missions, since the probability of the wind speed exceeding a given value is often required for both engineering and geophysical applications. Wind speeds are also useful for assessing the aeolian impact of the circulation. The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover has been measuring Martian winds since 2012, thus has provided more than two Mars years of wind data in the first Martian landing site with significant topography. Unfortunately, dust debris during the MSL landing stage damaged the sensor, making difficult to extract useful wind data. This paper complements the characterization performed in the companion paper, by producing a wind speed characterization based on probability distribution models. Significant diurnal and seasonal wind speed variability is found, due to complex interactions between the synoptic flow, the regional and local slope winds and microscale flow around MSL. The highest wind speed probabilities are found in general during the midday period, particularly around the equinoxes. In addition, the REMS data suggest strong flows during the summer nighttime, which could be related to the increased aeolian activity detected then by MSL.

How dielectric breakdown may contribute to the global weathering of regolith on the moon	ICARUS			English	Article						Moon; Regoliths; Cosmic rays	PROTON FLUENCE MODEL; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; LUNAR SOIL; ACCELERATION; CONDUCTIVITY; ENVIRONMENT; DISCHARGES	Space weathering is an important process on airless bodies, and it must be considered when interpreting data from planetary missions. Previous work has shown that solar energetic particles may cause dielectric breakdown in regolith within permanently shadowed regions near the poles of the Moon. Here, we predict that dielectric breakdown weathering could have melted and/or vaporized 2 - 9% of gardened (i.e., thoroughly mixed) regolith at the equator and 5 - 11% near the poles. If so, then similar to 3 - 10% of all gardened regolith on the Moon may have experienced dielectric breakdown, and this process must be considered when analyzing remote sensing data or soil samples returned by the Luna and Apollo missions.

High-resolution shape model of Ceres from stereophotoclinometry using Dawn Imaging Data	ICARUS			English	Article						Ceres shape; Ceres topography; Ceres spin pole; Ceres rotation; Stereophotoclinometry using Dawn data; Dawn gravity science	GRAVITY-FIELD; ROTATION PERIOD; SPIN POLE; TRACKING; VESTA; MISSION; SURFACE; ALBEDO	We present a high-resolution global shape model of Ceres determined using the stereophotoclinometry technique developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by processing Dawn's Framing Camera data acquired during Approach to post-Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) phases of the mission. A total of about 38,000 images were processed with pixel resolutions ranging from 35.6 km/pixel to 35 m/pixel and the final global shape model was produced with 100-m grid spacing. The final SPC-derived topography was computed relative to the (482 km, 482 km, 446 km) mean ellipsoid, which ranges from -7.3 km to 9.5 km. For the purpose of validation, we performed various error analyses to assess and quantify realistic uncertainties in the derived topography, such as dividing the data into different subsets and re-computing the entire topography. Based on these studies, we show that the average total height error of the final global topography model is 10.2 m and 88.9% of the surface has the total height error below 20 m. We also provide improved estimates of several physical parameters of Ceres. The resulting GM estimate is (62.62905 +/- 0.00035) km(3)/s(2), or the mass value of (938.392 +/- 0.005) x 10(18) kg. The volume estimate is (434.13 +/- 0.50) x 10(6) km(3) with a volumetric mean radius of 469.72 km. Combined with the mass estimate, the resulting bulk density is (2161.6 +/- 2.5) kg/m(3). Other improved parameters include the pole right ascension, alpha(o) = (291.42763 +/- 0.0002)degrees , pole declination, delta(0) = (66.76033 +/- 0.0002)degrees, and prime meridian and rotation rate of (W-0 = 170.309 +/- 0.011)degrees and (dW/dt = 952.1532635 +/- 0.000002) deg/day, respectively. Also, for geophysical and geological studies, we provide spherical harmonic coefficients and a gravitational slope map derived from the global shape model.	[Park, R. S.; Vaughan, A. T.; Konopliv, A.

Martian surface winds vary greatly with location, and even at a particular landing site show a high degree of diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variability. Thus characterizing surface wind speeds and directions requires a long time series, which is rarely obtained on Mars. The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover has been measuring Martian winds since 2012, thus has provided more than two Martian years of wind data at the first Martian landing site to have significant topography, in the trench of Gale Crater. Unfortunately, likely debris impacts during landing damaged the wind sensor, making it difficult to extract useful wind data. The first part of this paper presents a new retrieval that allows "good" wind measurements to be extracted from the raw dataset obtained under such conditions. In addition, a characterization of wind speeds and directions in Gale Crater is presented, after processing the full dataset of wind data in order to obtain the representative winds for different diurnal timeslots and seasons. Results suggest complex wind patterns and great variability depending on local time and season. Also, a significant influence by the synoptic scale circulation in the wind patterns is observed, although the local-scale circulation is suggested to be the major contributor to the observed surface winds in Gale Crater.

Here, we present K2-288, a low-mass binary system (M2.0 +/- 1.0; M3.0 +/- 1.0) hosting a small (R-p = 1.9 R-circle plus), temperate (T-eq = 226 K) planet observed in K2 Campaign 4. The candidate was first identified by citizen scientists using Exoplanet Explorers hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Follow-up observations and detailed analyses validate the planet and indicate that it likely orbits the secondary star on a 31.39-day period. This orbit places K2-288Bb in or near the habitable zone of its low-mass host star. K2-288Bb resides in a system with a unique architecture, as it orbits at >0.1 au from one component in a moderate separation binary (a(proj) similar to 55 au), and further follow-up may provide insight into its formation and evolution. Additionally, its estimated size straddles the observed gap in the planet radius distribution. Planets of this size occur less frequently and may be in a transient phase of radius evolution. K2-288 is the third transiting planet system identified by the Exoplanet Explorers program and its discovery exemplifies the value of citizen science in the era of Kepler, K2, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

The damage caused by a single cycle is quantified, in accordance with Hall's concept, by the hysteresis loop area of the inelastic strain energy. The suggested methodology is illustrated by a numerical example. It is shown how the operational lifetime of the material can be predicted from the FOAT data.

Superlattice-enhanced silicon soft X-ray and charged particle detectors with nanosecond time response	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Silicon detectors; Pulsed power; Electron detectors; Soft X-ray detectors; ICF; HED physics	QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; PHOTODIODES; ENERGY	Silicon detectors are an essential measurement tool for Inertial Confinement Fusion and High-Energy-Density Physics Applications, where temporal response of the order of nanoseconds is essential. Soft X-rays (<1 keV), Ultraviolet light, and low-energy electrons (<10 keV) can provide essential information in diagnosing rapidly changing plasma conditions, but reducing the detector dead layer is essential to improving detector response for these shallowly absorbed particles. This paper details a study of silicon detector surface preparation methods such as ion implant parameters, and the addition of a quantum 2D superlattice, to produce fast detectors that are highly sensitive to shallowly absorbed radiation. Measurements of visible light quantum efficiency, electron responsivity, and pulsed x-ray response indicate that detectors with a 2-layer superlattice enjoy a significant benefit over equivalent detectors using an ion implant at the illuminated surface.

This paper evaluates the use of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR) to calculate tunnelling-induced deformations of buildings. The paper introduces a step-by-step procedure to use InSAR displacements as an input to the structural damage assessment. After a comparison between traditional and InSAR monitoring data for the London area during the Crossrail excavation, the high resolution, high density InSAR-based displacements were used to evaluate the building deformations for a number of case studies. Results demonstrate the quality of information provided by InSAR data on soil-structure interaction mechanisms. Such information, essential to evaluate current damage assessment procedures, is typically only collected for relatively few buildings due to the cost of traditional monitoring. A comparison between damage indicators derived from greenfield assumptions and building displacements quantifies the practical benefit of the proposed step-by-step procedure. This work aims at filling the gap between the most recent advances in remote sensing and the civil engineering practice, defining the first step of an automated damage assessment procedure which can impact large scale underground projects in urban areas.

WIRC plus Pol: A Low-resolution Near-infrared Spectropolarimeter	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						instrumentation: polarimeters; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; techniques: polarimetric	WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE; POLARIZATION	WIRC+Pol is a newly commissioned low-resolution (R similar to 100), near-infrared (J and H bands) spectropolarimetry mode of the Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRC) on the 200 inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. The instrument utilizes a novel polarimeter design based on a quarter-wave plate and a polarization grating (PG), which provides full linear polarization measurements (Stokes I, Q, and U) in one exposure. The PG also has high transmission across the J and H bands. The instrument is situated at the prime focus of an equatorially mounted telescope. As a result, the system only has one reflection in the light path providing minimal telescope induced polarization. A data reduction pipeline has been developed for WIRC+Pol to produce linear polarization measurements from observations. WIRC+Pol has been on-sky since 2017 February. Results from the first year commissioning data show that the instrument has a high dispersion efficiency as expected from the polarization grating. We demonstrate the polarimetric stability of the instrument with rms variation at 0.2% level over 30 minutes for a bright standard star (J = 8.7). While the spectral extraction is photon noise limited, polarization calibration between sources remain limited by systematics, likely related to gravity dependent pointing effects. We discuss instrumental systematics we have uncovered in the data, their potential causes, along with calibrations that are necessary to eliminate them. We describe a modulator upgrade that will eliminate the slowly varying systematics and provide polarimetric accuracy better than 0.1%.

Biogenic volatile organic compounds such as terpenoids emitted from plants are important secondary organic aerosol precursors with isoprene dominating the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds globally. However, the particle mass from isoprene oxidation is generally modest compared to that of other terpenoids. Here we show that isoprene, carbon monoxide and methane can each suppress the instantaneous mass and the overall mass yield derived from monoterpenes in mixtures of atmospheric vapours. We find that isoprene 'scavenges' hydroxyl radicals, preventing their reaction with monoterpenes, and the resulting isoprene peroxy radicals scavenge highly oxygenated monoterpene products. These effects reduce the yield of low-volatility products that would otherwise form secondary organic aerosol. Global model calculations indicate that oxidant and product scavenging can operate effectively in the real atmosphere. Thus highly reactive compounds (such as isoprene) that produce a modest amount of aerosol are not necessarily net producers of secondary organic particle mass and their oxidation in mixtures of atmospheric vapours can suppress both particle number and mass of secondary organic aerosol. We suggest that formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere need to be considered more realistically, accounting for mechanistic interactions between the products of oxidizing precursor molecules (as is recognized to be necessary when modelling ozone production).

Here, we investigate decadal sea-level trends during the altimetry era and pin down the associated ocean circulation changes. We find that decadal subpolar gyre cooling (warming), strengthening (weakening), widening (shrinking) since the mid-2000s (early 1990s) resulted in negative (positive) sea level trends of -7.1 mm/yr +/- 1.3 mm/yr (3.9 mm/yr +/- 1.5 mm/yr). These large-scale changes further coincide with steric sea-level trends, and are driven by decadal-scale ocean circulation variability. Sea level on the European shelf, however, is found to correlate well with along-slope winds (R = 0.78), suggesting it plays a central role in driving the associated low-frequency dynamic sea level variability. Furthermore, when the North Atlantic is in a cooling (warming) period, the winds along the eastern boundary are predominantly from the North (South), which jointly drive a slowdown (rapid increase) in shelf and coastal sea level rise. Understanding the mechanisms that produce these connections may be critical for interpreting future regional sea-level trends.

A robust positive trend in observed liquid water path (LWP) over the last two decades across the warming Southern Ocean supports the negative shortwave cloud feedback predicted by GCMs. This feature has been proposed to be due to transitions from ice to liquid with warming. To gain insight into the shortwave cloud feedback we examine extratropical cyclone variability and the response of extratropical cyclones to transient warming in GCM simulations. Multi-Sensor Advanced Climatology Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) microwave observations of cyclone properties from the period 1992-2015 are contrasted with GCM simulations, with horizontal resolutions ranging from 7 km to hundreds of kilometers. We find that inter-cyclone variability in LWP in both observations and models is strongly driven by the moisture flux along the cyclone's warm conveyor belt (WCB). Stronger WCB moisture flux enhances the LWP within cyclones. This relation-ship is replicated in GCMs, although its strength varies substantially across models. It is found that more than 80% of the enhancement in Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical cyclone LWP in GCMs in response to a transient 4K warming can be predicted based on the relationship between the WCB moisture flux and cyclone LWP in the historical climate and their change in moisture flux between the historical and warmed climates. Further, it is found that that the robust trend in cyclone LWP over the Southern Ocean in observations and GCMs is consistent with changes in the moisture flux. We propose two cloud feedbacks acting within extratropical cyclones: a negative feedback driven by Clausius-Clapeyron increasing water vapor path (WVP), which enhances the amount of water vapor available to be fluxed into the cyclone, and a feedback moderated by changes in the life cycle and vorticity of cyclones under warming, which changes the rate at which existing moisture is imported into the cyclone. Both terms contribute to increasing LWP within the cyclone. While changes in moisture flux predict cyclone LWP trends in the current climate and the majority of changes in LWP in transient warming simulations, a portion of the LWP increase in response to climate change that is unexplained by increasing moisture fluxes may be due to phase transitions. The variability in LWP within cyclone composites is examined to understand what cyclonic regimes the mixed-phase cloud feedback is relevant to. At a fixed WCB moisture flux cyclone LWP increases with increasing sea surface temperature (SST) in the half of the composite poleward of the low and decreases in the half equatorward of the low in both GCMs and observations. Cloud-top phase partitioning observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) indicates that phase transitions may be driving increases in LWP in the poleward half of cyclones.

Diffraction of light by the gravitational field of the Sun and the solar corona	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTRON-DENSITIES; TERMINATION SHOCK; SCATTERING; LENS; APPROXIMATION; SCINTILLATION; DISTANCE; MOMENTS; PLASMA; WAVES	We study the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) under the combined influence of the static spherically symmetric gravitational field of the Sun-modeled within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity-and of the solar corona-modeled as a generic, steadystate, spherically symmetric free electron plasma. For this, we consider the propagation of monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) waves near the Sun and develop a Mie theory that accounts for the refractive properties of the gravitational field of the Sun and that of the free electron plasma in the extended Solar System. We establish a compact, closed-form solution to the boundary value problem, which extends previously known results into the new regime where gravity and plasma are both present. Relying on the wave-optical approach, we consider three different regions of practical importance for the SGL, including the shadow region directly behind the Sun, the region of geometrical optics and the interference region. We demonstrate that the presence of the solar plasma affects all characteristics of an incident unpolarized light, including the direction of the EM wave propagation, its amplitude, and its phase. We show that the presence of the solar plasma leads to a reduction of the light amplification of the SGL and to a broadening of its point spread function. We also show that the wavelength-dependent plasma effect is important at radio frequencies, where it drastically reduces both the amplification factor of the SGL and also its angular resolution. However, for optical and shorter wavelengths, the plasma's contribution to the EM wave is negligibly small, leaving the plasma-free optical properties of the SGL practically unaffected.

Characterization of the in-flight properties of the Planck telescope	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						telescopes; methods: data analysis; space vehicles: instruments		The European Space Agency's Planck satellite was launched on 14 May 2009, and surveyed the sky stably and continuously between August 2009 and October 2013. The scientific analysis of the Planck data requires understanding the optical response of its detectors, which originates partly from a physical model of the optical system. In this paper, we use in-flight measurements of planets within similar to 1 degrees of boresight to estimate the geometrical properties of the telescope and focal plane. First, we use observed grating lobes to measure the amplitude of mechanical dimpling of the reflectors, which is caused by the hexagonal honeycomb structure of the carbon fibre reflectors. We find that the dimpling amplitude on the two reflectors is larger than expected from the ground, by 20% on the secondary and at least a factor of 2 on the primary. Second, we use the main beam shapes of 26 detectors to investigate the alignment of the various elements of the optical system, as well as the large-scale deformations of the reflectors. We develop a metric to guide an iterative fitting scheme, and are able to determine a new geometric model that fits the in-flight measurements better than the pre-flight prediction according to this metric. The new alignment model is within the mechanical tolerances expected from the ground, with some specific but minor exceptions. We find that the reflectors contain large-scale sinusoidal deformations most probably related to the mechanical supports. In spite of the better overall fit, the new model still does not fit the beam measurements at a level compatible with the needs of cosmological analysis. Nonetheless, future analysis of the Planck data would benefit from taking into account some of the features of the new model. The analysis described here exemplifies some of the limitations of in-flight retrieval of the geometry of an optical system similar to that of Planck, and provides useful information for similar efforts in future experiments.

Percent-level subcomponents of the dark matter can evade the most stringent CMB bounds by mimicking the behavior of baryons, allowing for larger couplings and novel experimental signatures. However, in this Letter, we will show that such tightly coupled subcomponents leave a measurable imprint on the CMB that is well approximated by a change to the helium fraction, Y-He. Using the existing CMB constraint on YHe, we derive a new upper limit on the fraction of tightly coupled dark matter, f(TCDM), of f(TCDM) < 0.006 (95% C.I.). We show that future CMB experiments can reach f(TCDM) < 0.001 (95% C.I.) and confirm that the bounds derived in this way agree with the results of a complete analysis. These bounds provide an example of how CMB constraints on YHe have applications beyond studying big bang nucleosynthesis, since tightly coupled dark matter plays no direct role in the formation of light nuclei. We briefly comment on the implications for model building, including millicharged dark matter.

The technology involves the capture of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power stations and other point sources, compression of the CO2 into a fluid, transporting it and injecting it deep beneath the Earth's surface into depleted petroleum reservoirs and other porous formations. Once injected, the CO2 must be monitored to ensure that it is emplaced and assimilated as planned and that none leaks back to surface. A variety of methods have been deployed to monitor the CO2 storage site and many such methods have been adapted from oilfield practice. However, such methods are commonly indirect, episodic, require active signal generation and remain expensive throughout the monitoring period that may last for hundreds of years. A modelling framework was developed to concurrently simulate CO2 geostorage conditions and background cosmic-ray muon tomography, in which the potential was assessed for using variations in muon attenuation, due to changes in CO2 abundance, as a means of CO2 detection. From this, we developed a passive, continuous monitoring method for CO2 storage sites using muon tomography, the tools for which can be deployed during the active drilling phase (development) of the storage site. To do this, it was necessary to develop a muon detector that could be used in the hostile environment (saline, high temperature) of the well bore. A prototype detector has been built and tested at the 1.1 km deep Boulby potash mine on the northeast coast of England, supported by the existing STFC Boulby Underground Laboratory on the site. The detector is now ready to be commercialized. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Cosmic-ray muography'.

Sensitivity of seasonal Snowfall Attribution to Atmospheric Rivers and Their Reanalysis-Based Detetcion	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SIERRA-NEVADA; VARIABILITY; CALIFORNIA; SATELLITE	We characterize the sensitivity of atmospheric river (AR)-derived seasonal snowfall estimates to their atmospheric reanalysis-based detection over Sierra Nevada, USA. We use an independent snow data set and the ARs identified with a single detection method applied to multiple atmospheric reanalyses of varying horizontal resolutions, to evaluate orographic relationships and contributions of individual ARs to the seasonal cumulative snowfall (CS). Spatial resolution differences have relatively minor effects on the number of ARs diagnosed, with higher-resolution data sets identifying four more AR days per year, on average, during the 1985-2015 winters. However, this can lead to similar to 10% difference in AR attribution to the mean domain-wide seasonal CS and differences up to 47% snowfall attribution at the seasonal scale. We show that identifying snow-bearing ARs provides more information about the seasonal CS than simply knowing how many ARs occurred. Overall, we find that higher-resolution atmospheric reanalyses imply greater attribution of seasonal CS to ARs. Plain Language Summary While it is known that elongated moisture-rich atmospheric features, known as atmospheric rivers (ARs), play an important role in the water resources of the mountainous western United States, less is known about how the atmospheric data sets used to diagnose the presence of ARs influence the amount of AR-attributed snowfall estimated each winter. Nonetheless, this missing information can be important for managing water resources and improving seasonal snowfall forecasts for areas depending on AR-derived snowfall. We show that using a single AR detection algorithm, applied to multiple atmospheric reanalyses to identify ARs, higher-resolution atmospheric reanalyses diagnose up to four more ARs per winter implying 10% greater AR attribution to the mean seasonal snowfall across Sierra Nevada, USA. Understanding how different atmospheric reanalyses play a role in our interpretation of AR impacts for hydrologic studies and water resources management, as we investigate here, is important especially as more ARs are projected to occur in a warmer future atmosphere.

Sensing Heavy Precipitation With GNSS Polarimetric Radio Occultations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WATER-VAPOR	This study presents, for the first time ever, occulting signals of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) acquired at two polarizations from a Low Earth Orbiter, and it shows that they sense heavy precipitation. The data sets are obtained from early stages of the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ satellite, launched in February 2018 and activated in May 2018. Preliminary calibration algorithms are applied to remove other systematic effects, and the resulting vertical profiles of polarimetric phase shift observations are compared to precipitation information from other missions. The analysis of the data shows consistency between Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ satellite polarimetric phase shift measurements and presence of hydrometeors, with strong signatures from heavy precipitation. The polarimetric measurements also capture vertical features consistent with the vertical structures of precipitation. Plain Language Summary When the satellites of the navigation systems (like GPS) set below the horizon, their signals can be used to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity of the atmosphere at different altitudes (an observation called radio occultation). For the first time, a satellite has collected these setting GPS signals at two polarizations, that is, separating two different orientations of the electromagnetic field (horizontal and vertical with respect to the receiving antenna). It is the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard PAZ satellite, launched in February 2018 and activated in May 2018. Previous theoretical studies have shown that intense rain crossing the path of the GPS signals would introduce a delay of the horizontal component with respect to the vertical one. This study shows the analysis of the polarimetric delays, and it confirms that they are related to the presence of rain, in particular intense precipitation. The measurement of polarimetric delays at different altitudes is consistent with the presence of rain structures at different heights. No other technique captures profiles of both thermodynamics and hydrometeor content in intense rain phenomena, and therefore, the Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ satellite data could provide a new tool to understand extreme precipitation, with potential to improve its difficult prediction.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with integrated impedance-matching taper	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article								Conventional readout of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) sets an upper bound on the output voltage to be the product of the bias current and the load impedance, I-B x Z(load), where Z(load) is limited to 50 Omega in standard r.f. electronics. Here, we break this limit by interfacing the 50 Omega load and the SNSPD using an integrated superconducting transmission line taper. The taper is a transformer that effectively loads the SNSPD with high impedance without latching. At the expense of reduced maximum counting rate, it increases the amplitude of the detector output while preserving the fast rising edge. Using a taper with a starting width of 500 nm, we experimentally observed a 3.6 x higher pulse amplitude, 3.7 x faster slew rate, and 25.1 ps smaller timing jitter. The results match our numerical simulation, which incorporates both the hotspot dynamics in the SNSPD and the distributed nature in the transmission line taper. The taper studied here may become a useful tool to interface high-impedance superconducting nanowire devices to conventional low-impedance circuits. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

Although station-based PM monitoring has been conducted around the world, it is still challenging to provide spatially continuous PM information for vast areas at high spatial resolution. Satellite-derived aerosol information such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been frequently used to investigate ground-level PM concentrations. In this study, we combined multiple satellite-derived products including AOD with model-based meteorological parameters (i. e., dew-point temperature, wind speed, surface pressure, planetary boundary layer height, and relative humidity) and emission parameters (i. e., NO, NH3, SO2, primary organic aerosol (POA), and HCHO) to estimate surface PM concentrations over South Korea. Random forest (RF) machine learning was used to estimate both PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations with a total of 32 parameters for 2015-2016. The results show that the RF-based models produced good performance resulting in R-2 values of 0.78 and 0.73 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 17.08 and 8.25 mu gm(-3) for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. In particular, the proposed models successfully estimated high PM concentrations. AOD was identified as the most significant for esti-mating ground-level PM concentrations, followed by wind speed, solar radiation, and dew-point temperature. The use of aerosol information derived from a geostationary satellite sensor (i. e., Geostationary Ocean Color Imager, GOCI) resulted in slightly higher accuracy for estimating PM concentrations than that from a polar-orbiting sensor system (i. e., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS). The proposed RF models yielded better performance than the process-based approaches, particularly in improving on the underestimation of the process-based models (i. e., GEOS-Chem and the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System, CMAQ).

In support of the validation of these missions, major upgrades to the tropospheric ozone lidar located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Table Mountain Facility (TMF) were recently performed. These modifications include the full automation of the system, which now allows unattended measurements during frequent satellite overpasses, and a new receiver that extends the measurement capabilities of the system down to 100m above surface. The automation led to the systematic operation of the lidar during daily TROPOMI overpasses, providing more than 139 reference profiles since January 2018. Ozone profiles retrieved using the new lidar receiver were compared to ozonesonde profiles obtained from a co-located tethered balloon. An agreement of about 5% with the ozonesonde down to an altitude range of 100m a.g.l. was observed. Furthermore, the stability of the receiver configuration was investigated. Comparisons between the lowest point retrieved by the lidar and a co-located surface ozone photometer showed no sign of drift over a 2-month test period and an agreement better than 10 %. Finally, measurements from a 24 h intensive measurement period during a stratospheric intrusion event showed good agreement with two free-flying ozonesondes. These comparisons revealed localized differences between sonde and lidar, possibly owing to the differing vertical resolutions (between 52 and 380m for lidar and about 100m for the sonde).

Contemporary GCM Fidelity in Representing the Diurnal Cycle of Precipitation Over the Maritime Continent	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						diurnal cycle of convection; Maritime Continent; GCM; precipitation; multiscale interactions	MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; VERTICAL STRUCTURE; PHYSICAL PROCESSES; MJO; CLIMATE; PREDICTABILITY; RAINFALL; SATELLITE; TROPICS; WAVES	This paper presents a multimodel assessment of fidelity in representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Maritime Continent (MC). Daily mean precipitation rate and amplitude and phase of the diurnal cycle are utilized to validate General Circulation Model (GCM) performance with respect to multiyear annual mean and seasonal cycle. The analysis shows that models' 6-hourly temporal resolution and 2.5 degrees spatial resolution is sufficient to depict key characteristic of diurnal precipitation. Results show that most models are sensitive to the existence of the MC and show different characteristics of subdaily precipitation. However, 19 out of 20 models underestimate the daily mean precipitation over the eastern Indian Ocean and most of them underestimate both daily mean precipitation and amplitude of the diurnal cycle, especially over islands within the region. Observations show that within the MC the diurnal cycle is higher over land than over ocean. Many models decrease this land-sea contrast. Most models recognize difference in phase of the diurnal cycle between MC islands and surrounding ocean, but some of them show opposite phasing of the diurnal cycle. Results show that modern models perform better than past generation, sometimes comparably to regional models' run in much higher resolution. Although models perform well with respect to the seasonal cycle of the daily mean precipitation, they fail to realistically represent the seasonal evolution of the diurnal cycle amplitude. Additionally, models show no coherence in land-ocean contrast derived from a multiyear average of daily mean precipitation and amplitude of the diurnal cycle.

Neglecting plant-microbe symbioses leads to underestimation of modeled climate impacts	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON COST; NITROGEN; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; RESPONSES; DRIVERS; CYCLES; CO2	The extent to which terrestrial ecosystems slow climate change by sequestering carbon hinges in part on nutrient limitation. We used a coupled carbon-climate model that accounts for the carbon cost to plants of supporting nitrogen-acquiring microbial symbionts to explore how nitrogen limitation affects global climate. To do this, we first calculated the reduction in net primary production due to the carbon cost of nitrogen acquisition. We then used a climate model to estimate the impacts of the resulting increase in atmospheric CO2 on temperature and precipitation regimes. The carbon costs of supporting symbiotic nitrogen uptake reduced net primary production by 8.1 PgC yr(-1), with the largest absolute effects occurring in tropical forest biomes and the largest relative changes occurring in boreal and alpine biomes. Globally, our model predicted relatively small changes in climate due to the carbon cost of nitrogen acquisition with temperature increasing by 0.1 degrees C and precipitation decreasing by 6 mm yr(-1). However, there were strong regional impacts, with the largest impact occurring in boreal and alpine ecosystems, where such costs were estimated to increase temperature by 1.0 degrees C and precipitation by 9 mm yr(-1). As such, our results suggest that carbon expenditures to support nitrogen-acquiring microbial symbionts have critical consequences for Earth's climate, and that carbon-climate models that omit these processes will overpredict the land carbon sink and underpredict climate change.

The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kilauea Volcano	SCIENCE			English	Article							FISSURE ERUPTION; CALDERA COLLAPSE; SLOW SLIP; HAWAII; DEFORMATION; ZONE; SPECTROMETER; ISLAND	In 2018, Klauea Volcano experienced its largest lower East Rift Zone *(LERZ) eruption and caldera collapse in at least 200 years. After collapse of the Pu'u 'O' O vent on 30 April, magma propagated downrift. Eruptive fissures opened in the LERZ on 3 May, eventually extending -6.8 kilometers. A 4 May earthquake [moment magnitude *(Mw) 6.9] produced -5 meters of fault slip. Lava erupted at rates exceeding 100 cubic meters per second, eventually covering 35.5 square kilometers. The summit magma system partially drained, producing minor explosions and near-daily collapses releasing energy equivalent to Mw 4.7 to 5.4 earthquakes. Activity declined rapidly on 4 August. Summit collapse and lava flow volume estimates are roughly equivalent-about 0.8 cubic kilometers. Careful historical observation and monitoring of Kilauea enabled successful forecasting of hazardous events.	[Neal, C. A.; Brantley, S. R.; Antolik, L.; Babb, J.

HIP 79124 is a member of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, consisting of an A0V primary with two low-mass companions at a projected separation of <1 ''. Thanks to the high quality wavefront corrections provided by SCExAO, both companions are decisively detected without the employment of any PSF-subtraction algorithm to eliminate quasi-static noise. The spectrum of the outer C object is very well matched by Upper Scorpius M4 +/- 0.5 standard spectra, with a T-eff = 2945 +/- 100 K and a mass of similar to 350 M-Jup. HIP 79124 B is detected at a separation of only 180 mas in a highly-correlated noise regime, and it falls in the spectral range M6 +/- 0.5 with T-eff = 2840 +/- 190 K and similar to 100 M-Jup. Previous studies of stellar populations in Sco-Cen have highlighted a discrepancy in isochronal ages between the lower-mass and higher-mass populations. This could be explained either by an age spread in the region, or by conventional isochronal models failing to reproduce the evolution of low-mass stars. The HIP 79124 system should be coeval, and therefore it provides an ideal laboratory to test these scenarios. We place the three components in a color-magnitude diagram and find that the models predict a younger age for the two low-mass companions (similar to 3 Myr) than for the primary star (similar to 6 Myr). These results imply that the omission of magnetic effects in conventional isochronal models inhibit them from reproducing early low-mass stellar evolution, which is further supported by the fact that new models that include such effects provide more consistent ages in the HIP 79124 system.

The distribution of ionized gas appears to be affected by feedback processes from the star clusters in W49A. The velocity structure of the RRLs shows a complex behavior with respect to the molecular gas. We find a shell-like distribution of ionized gas as traced by RRL emission surrounding the central cluster of OB stars in W49A. We describe the evolution of the shell with the recent feedback model code WARPFIELD that includes the important physical processes and has previously been applied to the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The cloud structure and dynamics of W49A are in agreement with a feedback-driven shell that is re-collapsing. The shell may have triggered star formation in other parts of W49A. We suggest that W49A is a potential candidate for star formation regulated by feedback-driven and re-collapsing shells.	[Rugel, M. R.; Beuther, H.; Wang, Y.; Soler, J. D.; Mottram, J.

Sensitivity of active-layer freezing process to snow cover in Arctic Alaska	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							NEAR-SURFACE PERMAFROST; BAND RADAR RETRIEVAL; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER EQUIVALENT; HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; LIDAR MEASUREMENT; UNFROZEN WATER; ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS	The contribution of cold-season soil respiration to the Arctic-boreal carbon cycle and its potential feedback to the global climate remain poorly quantified, partly due to a poor understanding of changes in the soil thermal regime and liquid water content during the soil-freezing process. Here, we characterized the processes controlling active-layer freezing in Arctic Alaska using an integrated approach combining in situ soil measurements, local-scale (similar to 50 m) long-wave radar retrievals from NASA airborne P-band polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) and a remote-sensing-driven permafrost model. To better capture landscape variability in snow cover and its influence on the soil thermal regime, we downscaled global coarse-resolution (similar to 0.5 degrees) MERRA-2 reanalysis snow depth data using finer-scale (500 m) MODIS snow cover extent (SCE) observations. The downscaled 1 km snow depth data were used as key inputs to the permafrost model, capturing finer-scale variability associated with local topography and with favorable accuracy relative to the SNOTEL site measurements in Arctic Alaska (mean RMSE = 0.16 m, bias = 0.01 m). In situ tundra soil dielectric constant (epsilon) profile measurements were used for model parameterization of the soil organic layer and unfrozen-water content curve. The resulting model-simulated mean zero-curtain period was generally consistent with in situ observations spanning a 2 degrees latitudinal transect along the Alaska North Slope (R: 0.6 +/- 0.2; RMSE: 19 +/- 6 days), with an estimated mean zero-curtain period ranging from 61 +/- 11 to 73 +/- 15 days at 0.25 to 0.45m depths. Along the same transect, both the observed and model-simulated zero-curtain periods were positively correlated (R > 0.55, p < 0.01) with a MODIS-derived snow cover fraction (SCF) from September to October. We also examined the airborne P-band radar-retrieved epsilon profile along this transect in 2014 and 2015, which is sensitive to near-surface soil liquid water content and freezethaw status. The epsilon difference in radar retrievals for the surface (similar to<0.1 m) soil between late August and early October was negatively correlated with SCF in September (R = 0.77, p < 0.01); areas with lower SCF generally showed larger epsilon reductions, indicating earlier surface soil freezing. On regional scales, the simulated zero curtain in the upper (< 0.4 m) soils showed large variability and was closely associated with variations in early cold-season snow cover. Areas with earlier snow onset generally showed a longer zero-curtain period; however, the soil freeze onset and zero-curtain period in deeper (> 0.5 m) soils were more closely linked to maximum thaw depth. Our findings indicate that a deepening active layer associated with climate warming will lead to persistent unfrozen conditions in deeper soils, promoting greater cold-season soil carbon loss.

We compare the results with a surface mass balance model to deduce the ice sheet mass balance. The total mass loss increased from 40 +/- 9 Gt/y in 1979-1990 to 50 +/- 14 Gt/y in 1989-2000, 166 +/- 18 Gt/y in 1999-2009, and 252 +/- 26 Gt/y in 2009-2017. In 2009-2017, the mass loss was dominated by the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea sectors, in West Antarctica (159 +/- 8 Gt/y), Wilkes Land, in East Antarctica (51 +/- 13 Gt/y), and West and Northeast Peninsula (42 +/- 5 Gt/y). The contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica averaged 3.6 +/- 0.5 mm per decade with a cumulative 14.0 +/- 2.0 mm since 1979, including 6.9 +/- 0.6 mm from West Antarctica, 4.4 +/- 0.9 mm from East Antarctica, and 2.5 +/- 0.4 mm from the Peninsula (i.e., East Antarctica is a major participant in the mass loss). During the entire period, the mass loss concentrated in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface, circumpolar deep water (CDW), that is, consistent with enhanced polar westerlies pushing CDW toward Antarctica to melt its floating ice shelves, destabilize the glaciers, and raise sea level.

Plasma simulations in 2-D (r-z) geometry for the assessment of pole erosion in a magnetically shielded Hall thruster	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; ELECTRON SOURCES; WEAR MECHANISMS; ION PROPULSION	Magnetic shielding of Hall thrusters has been shown to reduce erosion of the channel walls by at least a few orders of magnitude, thereby enabling the use of these devices in deep space missions. Wear tests of magnetically shielded thrusters, such as the H6 and HERMeS, have revealed that some sputtering occurs at the surface of the inner pole, a phenomenon not observed in unshielded thrusters. Even though the sputtering rates measured at the inner pole during ground testing are typically an order of magnitude lower than those found in the acceleration channel of unshielded thrusters, it is critical to understand how the source(s) of this erosion may change with operating conditions during flight. Hall2De is a 2-D axisymmetric code that makes use of a hydrodynamics formulation for both electrons and ions and assumes a quasi-neutral plasma. Since its computational domain is large enough to account for the discharge channel, poles, cathode, and plume regions, Hall2De can be used to investigate the physical mechanisms that produce the erosion of the poles. The simulation results are compared with experimental laser-induced fluorescence measurements of the ion velocity along the discharge channel of the H6 thruster. We find that the erosion of the poles in the magnetically shielded H6 is a result of the acceleration region moving outside of the discharge channel, which in turn is a consequence of a shift in the location of the maximum magnetic field along the channel centerline that occurs when magnetic shielding is implemented. When the acceleration region moves downstream, the plasma potential contours at the edges of the beam allow for high energy ions to be accelerated radially toward the pole surfaces.

Implications of the Warm Corona and Relativistic Reflection Models for the Soft Excess in Mrk 509	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; black hole physics; galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (Mrk 509); galaxies: nuclei	X-RAY-SPECTRUM; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; XMM-NEWTON VIEW; BLACK-HOLE; ACCRETION DISKS; SEYFERT-1 GALAXY; HIGH-DENSITY; COLD MATTER; LINE; EMISSION	We present the analysis of the first Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array observations (similar to 220 ks), simultaneous with the last Suzaku observations (similar to 50 ks), of the active galactic nucleus of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509. The time-averaged spectrum in the 1-79 keV X-ray band is dominated by a power-law continuum (Gamma similar to 1.8-1.9), a strong soft excess around 1 keV, and signatures of X-ray reflection in the form of Fe K emission (similar to 6.4 keV), an Fe K absorption edge (similar to 7.1 keV), and a Compton hump due to electron scattering (similar to 20-30 keV). We show that these data can be described by two very different prescriptions for the soft excess: a warm (kT similar to 0.5-1 keV) and optically thick (tau similar to 10-20) Comptonizing corona or a relativistically blurred ionized reflection spectrum from the inner regions of the accretion disk. While these two scenarios cannot be distinguished based on their fit statistics, we argue that the parameters required by the warm corona model are physically incompatible with the conditions of standard coronae. Detailed photoionization calculations show that even in the most favorable conditions, the warm corona should produce strong absorption in the observed spectrum. On the other hand, while the relativistic reflection model provides a satisfactory description of the data, it also requires extreme parameters, such as maximum black hole spin, a very low and compact hot corona, and a very high density for the inner accretion disk. Deeper observations of this source are thus necessary to confirm the presence of relativistic reflection and further understand the nature of its soft excess.	[Garcia, Javier A.; Connors, Riley M.

The observations were taken at six ground-based telescopes, including the West Mountain Observatory 0.91 m telescope, the 0.76 m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, 0.6 m Super-LOTIS at Kitt Peak, the Palomar 60 inch telescope, and the 2 m Faulkes telescopes North and South. The V-band light curves measure the continuum variability of our sample of Seyferts on an almost daily cadence for 2-3 months. We use image-subtraction software to isolate the variability of the Seyfert nucleus from the constant V-band flux of the host galaxy for the most promising targets, and we adopt standard aperture photometry techniques for the targets with smaller levels of variability. These V-band light curves will be used, with measurements of the broad emission line flux, to measure supermassive black hole masses and to constrain the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region through dynamical modeling techniques.

A Search for Water Vapor Plumes on Europa using SOFIA	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						planets and satellites: individual (Europa)	ATMOSPHERES; PLANETARY; OCEAN	We present mid-infrared Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)/Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (EXES) spectroscopy of Europa, seeking direct evidence of the presence of water vapor arising from plumes venting from the surface. We place quantitatively useful upper limits on the strength of water vibrational-rotational emission lines. Conversion to water mass limits is dependent on the rotational temperature of the vapor. For low rotational temperature, the limits lie below the inferred water mass from previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) plume observations. For higher temperatures, the limits are comparable. We also present coordinated HST transit observations obtained close in time to the SOFIA observations. There is evidence for a feature close to the location of the previously seen feature north of the crater Pwyll in one of the HST images, although it was not observable by EXES given its location. We conclude that if a water plume had been active at the time of the SOFIA observation, with the strength implied by previous HST observations, then under the right Earth atmospheric and geometric conditions, the plume could have been detected by EXES; however, no infrared water vibrational-rotational emission was detected.

J	Ueda, T; Flock, M; Okuzumi, S				Ueda, Takahiro; Flock, Mario; Okuzumi, Satoshi			Dust Pileup at the Dead-zone Inner Edge and Implications for the Disk Shadow	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; planets and satellites: formation; protoplanetary disks	PLANETESIMAL FORMATION; PROTOPLANETARY; TURBULENCE; PLANETS	We perform simulations of the dust and gas disk evolution to investigate the observational features of a dust pileup at the dead-zone inner edge. We show that the total mass of accumulated dust particles is sensitive to the turbulence strength in the dead zone, alpha(dead), because of the combined effect of turbulence-induced particle fragmentation (which suppresses particle radial drift) and turbulent diffusion. For a typical critical fragmentation velocity of silicate dust particles of 1ms(-1), the stress-to-pressure ratio adead needs to be lower than 3 x 10(-4) for dust trapping to operate. The obtained dust distribution is postprocessed using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate infrared scattered-light images of the inner part of protoplanetary disks with a dust pileup. We find that a dust pileup at the dead-zone inner edge, if present, casts a shadow extending out to similar to 10 au. In the shadowed region the temperature significantly drops, which in some cases yields even multiple water snow lines. We also find that even without a dust pileup at the dead-zone inner edge, the disk surface can become thermally unstable, and the excited waves can naturally produce shadows and ring-like structures in observed images. This mechanism might account for the ring-like structures seen in the scattered-light images of some disks, such as the TW Hya disk.

PODEX supported the pre-formulation NASA Aerosol- Cloud-Ecosystem (ACE) mission, which calls for an imaging polarimeter in polar orbit (among other instruments) for the remote sensing of aerosols, oceans, and clouds. Several polarimeter concepts exist as airborne prototypes, some of which were deployed during PODEX as a capabilities test. Two of those instruments to date have successfully produced Level 1 (georegistered, calibrated radiance and polarization) data from that campaign: the Airborne Multiangle Spectropolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). We compared georegistered observations of a variety of scene types by these instruments to test whether Level 1 products agreed within stated uncertainties. Initial comparisons found radiometric agreement, but polarimetric biases beyond measurement uncertainties. After subsequent updates to calibration, georegistration, and the measurement uncertainty models, observations from the instruments now largely agree within stated uncertainties. However, the 470 nm reflectance channels have a roughly +6% bias of AirMSPI relative to RSP, beyond expected measurement uncertainties. We also find that observations of dark (ocean) scenes, where polarimetric uncertainty is expected to be largest, do not agree within stated polarimetric uncertainties. Otherwise, AirMSPI and RSP observations are consistent within measurement uncertainty expectations, providing credibility for the subsequent creation of Level 2 (geophysical product) data from these instruments, and comparison thereof. The techniques used in this work can also form a methodological basis for other intercomparisons, for example, of the data gathered during the recent Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) field campaign, carried out in October and November of 2017 with four polarimeters (including AirMSPI and RSP).

Comparing Electron Energetics and UV Brightness in Jupiter's Northern Polar Region During Juno Perijove 5	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Juno; Jupiter's aurora; polar auroral region; polar UV emissions; precipitating electrons; electron energy flux	MODEL	We compare electron and UV observations mapping to the same location in Jupiter's northern polar region, poleward of the main aurora, during Juno perijove 5. Simultaneous peaks in UV brightness and electron energy flux are identified when observations map to the same location at the same time. The downward energy flux during these simultaneous observations was not sufficient to generate the observed UV brightness; the upward energy flux was. We propose that the primary acceleration region is below Juno's altitude, from which the more intense upward electrons originate. For the complete interval, the UV brightness peaked at 240kilorayleigh (kR); the downward and upward energy fluxes peaked at 60 and 700mW/m(2), respectively. Increased downward energy fluxes are associated with increased contributions from tens of keV electrons. These observations provide evidence that bidirectional electron beams with broad energy distributions can produce tens to hundreds of kilorayleigh polar UV emissions. Plain Language Summary Jupiter's ultraviolet (UV) aurora is produced by electrons that precipitate into the planet's atmosphere and interact with hydrogen molecules. A number of different UV auroral emission regions have been identified such as the main aurora, the aurora associated with Jupiter's satellites, and the polar aurora located poleward of the main aurora. We examine electron and UV observations from Juno in Jupiter's northern polar region to investigate the processes responsible for producing Jupiter's polar aurora. We show electrons and UV emissions having simultaneous enhancements during a time when they map to the same location of Jupiter's upper atmosphere at the same time. We present evidence that electrons with energies between 0.1 and 100 kilo electron volts (keV) are capable of producing the polar UV emissions studied here and that further acceleration of these electrons may be occurring at altitudes below the spacecraft.

The Mars Science Laboratory team planned and executed a science campaign lasting approximately 100 Martian sols to study the storm involving an enhanced cadence of environmental monitoring using the rover's meteorological sensors, cameras, and spectrometers. Mast Camera 880-nm optical depth reached 8.5, and Rover Environmental Monitoring Station measurements indicated a 97% reduction in incident total ultraviolet solar radiation at the surface, 30K reduction in diurnal range of air temperature, and an increase in the semidiurnal pressure tide amplitude to 40Pa. No active dust-lifting sites were detected within Gale Crater, and global and local atmospheric dynamics were drastically altered during the storm. This work presents an overview of the mission's storm observations and initial results. Plain Language Summary The 2018 Mars global dust storm was observed by six spacecraft in orbit and two rovers on the surface. This paper provides an overview and description of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover's observations during the storm. For approximately 100 Martian days (sols), the rover conducted an enhanced cadence of environmental observations to study the storm. These are the first observations of a Martian global dust storm with meteorological sensors near the equator. Atmospheric opacity reached a peak of 8.5, attenuating 97% of the total solar ultraviolet radiation at the surface. Most of the dust was sourced from outside Gale Crater, with no indications of dust lifting within the crater during the height of the storm. Meteorological conditions were substantially altered, with changes to the pressure, temperature, and humidity patterns. Dust devil activity ceased for several weeks due to the reduction in temperature contrast between the surface and atmosphere. There was no indication of unusual aeolian transport, suggesting Martian global dust storms are not a major cause of sand dune movement.	[Guzewich, Scott D.; Khayat, A.; Smith, M.

Normal Faults on Ceres: Insights Into the Mechanical Properties and Thermal History of Nar Sulcus	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Dawn; Ceres; extension; faulting; elastic thickness; heat flux	GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; LITHOSPHERIC FLEXURE; GROUND ICE; WATER ICE; HEAT-FLOW; CONSTRAINTS; EVOLUTION; RIGIDITY; FRICTION; GRAVITY	We characterized two sets of extensional faults that comprise the Nar Sulcus region of Ceres by applying a cantilever model for fault related flexure and derived flexural rigidity values for Nar Sulcus between 2.0 <bold> </bold>10(15) and 1.8 <bold> </bold>10(16)N<bold>m</bold>. This range of flexural rigidity makes Nar Sulcus mechanically akin to extensional structures on Ganymede, Europa, and Enceladus. We combine these observations with an inferred strength profile for the upper mechanical layer of Ceres and estimate its thickness to be 2.9-9.5km. Surface heat fluxes at Nar Sulcus during its formation were likely 10mW/m(2) for estimated strain rates of 10(-17)-10(-14)s(-1), which is at least one order of magnitude larger than the current estimated global average. For geologically plausible heat fluxes between 10 and 100mW/m(2), we estimate an upper bound of 30vol.% mechanically silicate-like phases in the near surface at Nar Sulcus, neglecting the effects of porosity. Plain Language Summary In March 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dawn spacecraft began orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Research has shown that a major volume fraction of the subsurface of Ceres may be composed of water ice. Knowing how water ice is distributed in the upper layer of Ceres is essential to understanding how the surface and interior have evolved over time. The Nar Sulcus region consists of two sets of extensional faults that we characterized in this study. We modeled the topography of these extensional faults in order to determine the elastic properties of the region. The properties we derived for Ceres' uppermost mechanical layer are similar to those of many of the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Furthermore, they were used to help constrain three key parameters of this upper layer at Nar Sulcus: its mechanical thickness, its heat flow during the formation of the faults, and its water ice volume fraction.

Heterogeneous Changes in Western North American Glaciers Linked to Decadal Variability in Zonal Wind Strength	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						glacier change; mass balance; zonal wind	MASS-BALANCE MEASUREMENTS; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; WATER-RESOURCES; CASCADE RANGE; PEYTO GLACIER; CLIMATE; CANADA; WASHINGTON; STREAMFLOW	Western North American (WNA) glaciers outside of Alaska cover 14,384km(2) of mountainous terrain. No comprehensive analysis of recent mass change exists for this region. We generated over 15,000 multisensor digital elevation models from spaceborne optical imagery to provide an assessment of mass change for WNA over the period 2000-2018. These glaciers lost 11742gigatons (Gt) of mass, which accounts for up to 0.320.11mm of sea level rise over the full period of study. We observe a fourfold increase in mass loss rates between 2000-2009 [-2.93.1Gt yr(-1)] and 2009-2018 [-12.34.6Gt yr(-1)], and we attribute this change to a shift in regional meteorological conditions driven by the location and strength of upper level zonal wind. Our results document decadal-scale climate variability over WNA that will likely modulate glacier mass change in the future. Plain Language Summary Glaciers in western North America provide important thermal and flow buffering to streams when seasonal snowpack is depleted. We used spaceborne optical satellite imagery to produce thousands of digital elevation models to assess recent mass loss for glaciers in western North America outside of Alaska. Our analysis shows that glacier loss over the period 2009-2018 increased fourfold relative to the period 2000-2009. This mass change over the last 18years is partly explained by changes in atmospheric circulation. Our results can be used for future modeling studies to understand the fate of glaciers under future climate change scenarios.

Significant subseasonal week 3-5 correlation skill exists over a large portion of the global land domain, and the predictability originates primarily from the eight most predictable SAT modes. The first three modes, identified as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation mode, the North Atlantic Oscillation mode, and the Eurasia Meridional Dipole mode, can be skillfully predicted more than 5weeks in advance. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Eurasia Meridional Dipole modes are strongly correlated with the initial stratospheric polar vortex strength, highlighting the role of stratosphere in subseasonal prediction. Interestingly, the Madden-Julian Oscillation is not essential for the subseasonal land SAT prediction in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The spatial correlation skill exhibits considerable intraseasonal and interannual fluctuations, indicative of the importance to identify the time window of opportunity for subseasonal prediction. Plain Language Summary Subseasonal prediction has important societal and economic impacts, while it remains very challenging as a prediction frontier. In this study, we use a dynamic model with simple initialization method to investigate the subseasonal week 3-5 prediction of the surface air temperature (SAT) in boreal winter. It is encouraging to note that the model has a significant week 3-5 SAT prediction skill over a large portion of the land regions. Using a statistical method, we further examine the potential predictability sources and find eight most predictable modes with the first three identified as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Eurasia Meridional Dipole Mode. Interestingly, although the Madden-Julian Oscillation is the dominant intraseasonal mode over the tropics, it has relatively weak impacts on the SAT prediction in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The strong fluctuation of the prediction skill varies from week to week and year to year highlighting the importance to identify the time window of opportunity for subseasonal prediction. The role of stratospheric polar vortex in subseasonal SAT prediction is also shown.

J	Jacobson, MZ; Nghiem, SV; Sorichetta, A				Jacobson, Mark Z.; Nghiem, Son V.; Sorichetta, Alessandro			Short-Term Impacts of the Megaurbanizations of New Delhi and Los Angeles Between 2000 and 2009	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						land use change; megacities; urbanization; air pollution; heat island effect; climate change	URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; POLLUTION MODELING SYSTEM; AIR-POLLUTION; POTENTIAL ENSTROPHY; COVER CHANGE; LAND-COVER; GATOR-GCMM; OPENSTREETMAP; VEGETATION; WATER	Urban areas are expanding worldwide due to increasing population, standard of living, and migration from rural areas. This study uses satellite and road data to quantify the urbanization of two megacities, New Delhi and Los Angeles, between 2000 and 2009. It then estimates, with a three-dimensional nested global-through-urban climate, weather, and air pollution model, Gas, Aerosol, Transport, Radiation, General Circulation, Mesoscale, and Ocean Model, the short-term atmospheric impacts of such urbanization alone. The simulations account for changes in meteorologically driven natural emissions, but not anthropogenic emissions, between 2000 and 2009. New Delhi's urban extent, defined based on the physical existence of its built structures and the transitional gradient from buildings to rural areas rather than on abrupt administrative borders, increased by similar to 80% and Los Angeles's by similar to 22.5% between 2000 and 2009. New Delhi experienced a larger increase in its urban extent relative to its population during this period than did Los Angeles. In both megacities, urbanization increased surface roughness, increasing shearing stress and vertical turbulent kinetic energy, decreasing near-surface and boundary layer wind speed, contributing to higher column pollution levels. Urbanization may also have increased downward solar plus thermal infrared radiation fluxes to the ground and consequently upward latent and sensible heat fluxes from the ground to the air, increasing near-surface air temperatures. As such, urbanization alone may have had notable impacts on both meteorology and air quality. Plain Language Summary This study quantifies, with satellite and road data, the changes in urban extent of two megacities between 2000 and 2009. During that period, the urban extent of New Delhi was found to have increased by similar to 80%, and that of Los Angeles's, by similar to 22.5%. The study then estimates, with a three-dimensional model nesting from the globe to each urban area, the short-term impacts of such urbanization alone. In both megacities, urbanization increased near-surface air temperatures and decreased wind speeds while increasing vertical turbulence and the column abundance of several pollutants due to the wind stagnation. As such, urbanization may impact both meteorology and air quality notably.

The Cloudy Nature of Tropical Rains	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						tropical rain; precipitation occurrence; precipitation rate; rain diabatic heating; weather states; cluster analysis	MEASURING MISSION TRMM; PRECIPITATION REGIMES; WESTERN PACIFIC; WEATHER STATES; MODEL; PARAMETERIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; FEEDBACKS; SATELLITE; IMPACTS	Four years of CloudSat cloud and precipitation observations are combined with CALIPSO lidar, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance, and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation data to document the cloud properties of precipitation confined to latitudes between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S. The relations between two different cloud top heights (CTHs) and precipitation are examined. The maximum CTH observed in the column is one measure (referred to as the highest CTH, HCTH) and the second is the minimum CTH within the same raining column, interpreted to be the tops of the rain-bearing clouds in the column (referred to as the raining cloud top height, RCTH). Although a broad relation between rain intensity and CTH is shown to exist, especially for shallower warm clouds, the HCTH of the deepest, raining clouds in the tropics is shown to be a poor indicator of precipitation intensity. The implication of the difference between HCTH and RCTH is that for all but the deepest convection, the height of raining clouds is significantly overestimated from observing systems that cannot see below upper cloud layers. The vertical profile of CTHs is shown to be distinctly bimodal with RCTH profiles having a large maximum associated with shallow precipitating clouds, whereas the HCTH distribution has its maximum in the upper troposphere. The influence of this vertical profile information on radiative and latent heating profiles results in a nonnegligible shift in latent heating from an upper level maximum to a more bimodal profile reflecting the increased contribution of shallow raining clouds. Plain Language Summary That precipitation falls from clouds is obvious. Our global modeling and observing systems, however, have for the most part dealt with precipitation as a physical system separate from clouds. This circumstance changed with the observations available from the A-Train constellation of satellites offering cloud properties observed jointly with precipitation. The study examines the cloud structures of precipitation confined between the latitudes of 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S and reveals significantly more rain occurring from shallower raining clouds under higher cloud layers. The implications of this new view of precipitation on the radiative and latent heating of the atmosphere are explored.	[Stephens, G. L.; Smalley, M. A.; Lebsock, M.

Balance of Emission and Dynamical Controls on Ozone During the Korea-United States Air Quality Campaign From Multiconstituent Satellite Data Assimilation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						data assimilation; satellite; air quality; ozone; Asia; emission	LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; CHEMISTRY-CLIMATE MODEL; CARBON-MONOXIDE; TROPOSPHERIC NO2; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; INTERIM REANALYSIS; OMI OBSERVATIONS; SO2; RESOLUTION	Global multiconstituent concentration and emission fields obtained from the assimilation of the satellite retrievals of ozone, CO, NO2, HNO3, and SO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2, Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere, Microwave Limb Sounder, and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)/OMI are used to understand the processes controlling air pollution during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Estimated emissions in South Korea were 0.42TgN for NOx and 1.1Tg CO for CO, which were 40% and 83% higher, respectively, than the a priori bottom-up inventories, and increased mean ozone concentration by up to 7.51.6ppbv. The observed boundary layer ozone exceeded 90ppbv over Seoul under stagnant phases, whereas it was approximately 60ppbv during dynamical conditions given equivalent emissions. Chemical reanalysis showed that mean ozone concentration was persistently higher over Seoul (75.107.6ppbv) than the broader KORUS-AQ domain (70.59.2ppbv) at 700hPa. Large bias reductions (>75%) in the free tropospheric OH show that multiple-species assimilation is critical for balanced tropospheric chemistry analysis and emissions. The assimilation performance was dependent on the particular phase. While the evaluation of data assimilation fields shows an improved agreement with aircraft measurements in ozone (to less than 5ppbv biases), CO, NO2, SO2, PAN, and OH profiles, lower tropospheric ozone analysis error was largest at stagnant conditions, whereas the model errors were mostly removed by data assimilation under dynamic weather conditions. Assimilation of new AIRS/OMI ozone profiles allowed for additional error reductions, especially under dynamic weather conditions. Our results show the important balance of dynamics and emissions both on pollution and the chemical assimilation system performance. Plain Language Summary Global multi-constituent concentration and emission fields obtained from the assimilation of the satellite retrievals are used to understand the processes controlling air pollution during the Korea U.S.-Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Our results show the important balance of dynamics and emissions both on pollution and the chemical assimilation system performance.

We evaluate posterior CO2 concentration profiles against observations from the High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) aircraft campaigns over the mid-Pacific in 2009-2011. Although the models differ in inverse approaches, assimilated observations, prior fluxes, and transport models, their broad latitudinal separation of land fluxes has converged significantly since the Atmospheric Carbon Cycle Inversion Intercomparison (TransCom 3) and the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP) projects, with model spread reduced by 80% since TransCom 3 and 70% since RECCAP. Most modeled CO2 fields agree reasonably well with the HIPPO observations, specifically for the annual mean vertical gradients in the Northern Hemisphere. Northern Hemisphere vertical mixing no longer appears to be a dominant driver of northern versus tropical (T) annual flux differences. Our newer suite of models still gives northern extratropical land uptake that is modest relative to previous estimates (Gurney et al., 2002; Peylin et al., 2013) and near-neutral tropical land uptake for 2009-2011. Given estimates of emissions from deforestation, this implies a continued uptake in intact tropical forests that is strong relative to historical estimates (Gurney et al., 2002; Peylin et al., 2013). The results from these models for other time periods (2004-2014, 2001-2004, 1992-1996) and re-evaluation of the TransCom 3 Level 2 and RECCAP results confirm that tropical land carbon fluxes including deforestation have been near neutral for several decades. However, models still have large disagreements on ocean-land partitioning. The fossil fuel (FF) and the atmospheric growth rate terms have been thought to be the best-known terms in the global carbon budget, but we show that they currently limit our ability to assess regional-scale terrestrial fluxes and ocean-land partitioning from the model ensemble.

Crustal rheology of southern Tibet constrained from lake-induced viscoelastic deformation	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						viscosity; elastic thickness; paleoshorelines; Tibet	HOLOCENE SHORELINE DEFLECTION; UPPER-MANTLE; SILING CO; EASTERN MARGIN; VISCOSITY; STRENGTH; BENEATH; MIDDLE; FLOW; PLATEAU	We probe the rheology of the Tibetan lithosphere using the rebound that accompanied climate-driven lake level variations. At the modern decadal time scale, we used deformation around Siling Tso measured from InSAR. At the millennial time scale, we use Holocene paleoshorelines around Siling Tso and Zhari Nam Tso. We use chronological constraints from the literature and Digital Elevation Models to constrain their ages and geometry. We observe a small post-highstand subsidence of the area near the center of mass of the paleolake-load and a low-amplitude short-wavelength outer bulge. In the context of a model consisting of an elastic lid over a viscous channel with a rigid base, these observations preclude the existence of a thick low viscosity channel and require a thin elastic lid. Based on Monte Carlo inversion, we constrain the range of possible equivalent elastic thickness of the lid (<5 km), the viscosity (2 x 10(18)-10(20) Pa.s) and thickness of the crustal channel (<10-20 km). By contrast, the modern data requires a stiffer lid with equivalent elastic thickness >20 km and a >20 km thick channel with lower crustal viscosity (< 5 x 10(18) Pa.s). The different rheologies inferred at these different time-scales could be explained by a Burgers body rheology of the middle and lower crust, with a short-term viscosity of 10(18) Pa.s and long-term viscosity of 1020 Pa.s, or even better by vertical variations of viscosity. To illustrate the latter claim, we show that the observations at the decadal and Holocene time scales can be reconciled by assuming a low viscosity zone (1018 Pa.s) at mid-crustal depth (between 10 and 30 km depth) embedded in a higher viscosity crust (>10(20) Pa.s). In both cases, the interferences in space of the deformation signals induced by the lakes geometry, and in time through the viscoelastic response to the lake level variations results in limited distortion of the paleo-shorelines. While the elastic lid in the upper crust needs in any case to be thin (<10 km), the low amplitude distortion requires significant viscoelastic support from the lower crust and upper mantle; this explains the relatively high effective elastic thickness (>20 km) inferred in some previous studies of Holocene paleoshorelines. In the longer term, the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere must drop asymptotically to the value of the elastic lid in the upper crust (<10 km); this explains the low effective elastic thickness derived from gravity studies.

For mangroves, which are highly susceptible to climate change, the spatial scale of dispersal remains largely unknown. Here we use a high-resolution, eddy- and tide-resolving numerical ocean model to simulate mangrove propagule dispersal across the global ocean and generate connectivity matrices between mangrove habitats using a range of floating periods. We find high rates of along-coast transport and transoceanic dispersal across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. No connectivity is observed between populations on either side of the American and African continents. Archipelagos, such as the Galapagos and those found in Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia, act as critical stepping-stones for dispersal across the Pacific Ocean. Direct and reciprocal dispersal routes across the Indian Ocean via the South Equatorial Current and seasonally reversing monsoon currents, respectively, allow connectivity between western Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific sites. We demonstrate the isolation of the Hawaii Islands and help explain the presence of mangroves on the latitudinal outlier Bermuda. Finally, we find that dispersal distance and connectivity are highly sensitive to the minimum and maximum floating periods. We anticipate that our findings will guide future research agendas to quantify biophysical factors that determine mangrove dispersal and connectivity, including the influence of ocean surface water properties on metabolic processes and buoyancy behavior, which may determine the potential of viably reaching a suitable habitat. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of global mangrove species distributions and their response to changing climate conditions.

The spectral parameter maps of Ceres from NASA/DAWN VIR data	ICARUS			English	Article						Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Ceres; NASA/Dawn; GIS	VESTA	This article presents the spectral parameter maps used in this Surface Composition of Ceres Special Issue. The definition and use of spectral parameters has always played a fundamental role in understanding the properties and composition of a planetary surface. Mapping proper spectral parameters shows the global mineralogical diversity across Ceres. In this work, we discuss the production process of Ceres spectral parameter maps derived by the data of the Visible and Infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR) onboard NASA's Dawn mission. We describe the data processing of the VIR spectra and the procedure to retrieve the geometries (latitude, longitude and illumination angles) of the acquired data. Spectra and geometries are used to project and mosaic this data to produce Geographic Information System-compatible spectral parameters maps of Ceres. An overview of the variability of the data across the quadrangles is given, addressing the specific analysis to each quadrangle mapping paper included in this special issue.

Exposed H2O-rich areas detected on Ceres with the dawn visible and infrared mapping spectrometer	ICARUS			English	Article						Dwarf planet Ceres; Surface composition; Exposed H2O ice; Reflectance spectroscopy	WATER ICE; SURFACE; SUBLIMATION; TEMPERATURE; PREDICTIONS; REGIME; VESTA; MODEL	H2O-rich materials are locally exposed at the surface of Ceres as discovered from infrared reflectance spectra of the Visible and InfraRed mapping spectrometer (VIR) of the Dawn mission. Nine locations on Ceres exhibit diagnostic absorption bands of the H2O molecule at 2.00, 1.65 and 1.28 mu m. The detections are all consistent with H2O ice mixed with low-albedo components. All the reported H2O exposures occur at latitudes poleward of 30 degrees in fresh craters near rim shadows, have a surface area < 7 km(2), and are associated with one or more surface features such as a morphological flow or landslide, fractures, high albedo, or a pole-facing slope (one case is confirmed to be adjacent to persistent shadow). In four occurrences, these detections are associated with small (<0.1 km(2)) high-albedo areas that can be recognized in high-resolution imagery (similar to 35 m/pixel) from the Framing Camera (FC). Since all these observations are compatible with an H2O-rich subsurface, the replenishment of surficial H2O likely comes from the ice that is present underneath. In four other occurrences, H2O is detected on walls and floors of fresh impact craters, either in the shadow or adjacent to shadows, which suggests that local thermodynamical conditions may also favor the concentration of H2O in these areas.

Elemental composition and mineralogy of Vesta and Ceres: Distribution and origins of hydrogen-bearing species	ICARUS			English	Article							SOLAR-SYSTEM ABUNDANCES; DAWNS GAMMA-RAY; DARK MATERIAL; ORGANIC-MATTER; GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; MAGMA OCEAN; WATER ICE; SURFACE; CONSTRAINTS; CHRONOLOGY	Combined analyses of the surface elemental composition and mineralogy of Vesta and Ceres provide insights into their interior evolution, crustal formation, and regolith processes. Compositional data acquired by Dawn's Visible to Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR) and Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND) are sensitive to different depths and spatial scales. To compare these data sets, high-resolution maps of absorption band strengths from VIR are degraded to the broad spatial scales sampled by GRaND using a physics-based smoothing algorithm that accounts for the shape and topography of Vesta and Ceres. On Vesta, the distributions of elemental hydrogen and hydroxyl are similar, which implies that hydrogen is primarily in the form of hydroxyl, likely as phyllosilicates delivered by the infall of carbonaceous chondrite impactors. Small differences in the spatial patterns of hydroxyl and hydrogen imply that hydrogen is layered in some locations. In Vesta's dark hemisphere, hydrogen deposits are more extensive than hydroxyl, which indicates higher concentrations of hydrated minerals at depth. In contrast, the distributions of elemental hydrogen and hydrogen-bearing species (OH and NH4+) on Ceres are dissimilar. High concentrations of hydrogen in the Ceres' polar regions (approaching 30 wt.% equivalent H2O) indicate the presence of subsurface ice as predicted by ice stability theory. The concentration of iron follows a water-dilution trend when plotted as a function of regolith hydrogen content, consistent with the presence of subsurface water ice. The VIR and GRaND data jointly constrain aspects of Ceres' surface chemistry and evolution. GRaND iron measurements place a firm upper bound on magnetite content, which supports graphitized carbon as an alternative to magnetite as a darkening agent. Lower-bounds on the concentration of carbon in carbonates implied by VIR, together with the ratio of carbonates to organics in carbonaceous chondrite meteorite analogs suggest high concentrations of carbon within Ceres' regolith. GRaND neutron measurements permit elevated carbon concentrations, equal to or in excess of that found in CI chondrites (greater than a few wt.%). Organic matter, detected by VIR at Ernutet crater, might be widespread and may have been converted to graphite, e.g. via UV exposure, elsewhere on the surface. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of carbonaceous material can explain the difference between iron and hydrogen concentrations measured by GRaND and the CI carbonaceous chondrites, which are representative of the materials from which Ceres accreted. The elemental measurements indicate that ice and rock fractionated during Ceres' evolution producing a crust that differs in composition from the whole body. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ceres' impact craters - Relationships between surface composition and geology	ICARUS			English	Article							DEPOSITS; ORIGIN	Impact craters of different geological ages, sizes and morphologies are not only the most obvious surface features on Ceres' surface. The investigation of their spectral properties in combination with Ceres' geology and topography reveals not only lateral compositional variations in Ceres' surface material but also possible stratigraphic differences within Ceres' crust. Spectral properties of impact craters with different ages do show distinct trends implying variations with increasing exposure duration of the impact material onto Ceres' surface. Local concentrations of H2O ice and carbonates are associated with the youngest, either recently emplaced or excavated, surface deposits. On the contrary, regionally higher amounts of ammoniated phyllosilicates originate from deeper regions of Ceres' crust and strengthen the theory of ammonia being a primordial constituent of Ceres. The blue spectral slope, clearly associated with relatively weak absorptions of OH-bearing and/or ammoniated phyllosilicates, is limited to fresh impact material. Either, the blue spectral slope diminishes slowly with increasing geologic age due to space weathering processes, or shortly as a result of gravitation-induced slumping, forming a fine and loosely consolidated regolith.

VIR Team	Spectral analysis of the Cerean geological unit crater central peak material as an indicator of subsurface mineral composition	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Mineralogy; Spectroscopy; Ceres interiors	REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; SURFACE; IMPACT; CHRONOLOGY; EVOLUTION; COMETARY; DEPOSITS; RECORD; VESTA	The dwarf planet Ceres is a heavily cratered rocky body, and complex craters with a central peak are widely observed on its surface. These types of craters form when a large body impacts the surface, generating extreme temperatures and pressures. During the impact event a large volume of rock is raised from the subsurface and a central uplift is formed. The material composing the central uplift is called crater central peak material (ccp) and the spectral analysis of such geologic areas can provide information about the composition of Ceres' subsurface. Reflectance spectra of 32 ccps, acquired by the VIR spectrometer on board the NASA/Dawn spacecraft, were analyzed and shows absorption bands located at about 2.7, 3.1, 3.4 and 4.0 mu m which are also common on the Cerean surface. These absorptions are related, respectively, to Mg-phyllosilicates, NH4-phyllosilicates and Mg/Ca-carbonates. The spectral parameters considered in this work are: spectral slopes estimated between 1.2 mu m and 1.9 mu m, band depths at 2.7-, 3.1-, 3.4- and 4.0-mu m, and band centers near 4.0-mu m. The ccps spectral parameters were analyzed in conjunction with other Cerean parameters, such as the estimated depth of excavation of the material composing the central peak, in order to search for correlations and information about Ceres' subsurface. Central peak material located polewards show stronger 2.7- and 3.1-mu m band depths with respect to those at the equatorial region, suggesting that subsurface deposits closer to poles are probably richer in Mg- and NH4-phyllosilicates. The 3.4-mu m spectral feature is also deeper in ccps located at poleward latitudes, similar to the phyllosilicates. Conversely, the 4.0-mu m band does not show this trend with latitude. An increase in both 3.1- and 3.4-mu m band depths with the estimated depth of excavation indicates that the spectral feature at 3.4-mu m is the result of different contributions from carbonates and NH4-phyllosilicates, as expected. However, depending on their relative influence, the shape of the 3.4-mu m spectral feature can vary. Phyllosilicates and carbonates are the resulting products of aqueous alteration of chondritic material and, given the increasing abundance of such minerals (in particular ammoniated phyllosilicates) with depth of excavation, it is likely that our investigation involved subsurface layers nearby the boundary between the volatilerich crust and the silicate-rich mantle. Na-carbonate is found in the crater central peak material of Emutet, Haulani and Ikapati, characterized by an estimated depth of excavation of about 6-9 km, where deposits of sodium carbonates could be locally present.

Mineralogical mapping of Coniraya quadrangle of the dwarf planet Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article							VARIABILITY; SURFACE; VESTA	Ceres has been explored by NASA/Dawn spacecraft, which allowed for the discovery of the main mineralogical and compositional characteristics of Ceres' surface. Here, we use mainly data from the Visible and InfraRed imaging spectrometer (VIR) in order to investigate the main spectral characteristics of the quadrangle Ac-H-2 Coniraya, one of the 15 quads in which Ceres' surface has been divided. Coniraya quadrangle is characterized by the presence of mostly highly degraded impact craters of diameters between 50 and 200 km and clusters of small to midsize impact craters. Although the composition over the quadrangle appears to be quite uniform, significant differences have been detected between different craters by spectral parameters analysis and spectral modeling. Ernutet crater presents two regions with very peculiar band at 3.4 mu m, typical of organics aliphatic material. One region result to be correlated with larger amount of carbonates, the other region does not present such correlation. lkapati crater shows strong absorption bands at 4.0 mu m, indicating the presence of Na-carbonates in the floor and ejecta. lkapati, Gaue and other craters present smaller spectral features of NH4 and/or OH stretching, suggesting a volatile depletion process induced by the heating of the impact event.

The surface composition of Ceres' Ezinu quadrangle analyzed by the Dawn mission	ICARUS			English	Article						Dwarf planet Ceres; Surface composition; Mineralogy; Spectroscopy	REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; WATER REGIME; VESTA; ASTEROIDS; SPECTRA; DARK; SIZE; ICE	We studied the surface composition of Ceres within the limits of the Ezinu quadrangle in the ranges 180-270 degrees E and 21-66 degrees N by analyzing data from Dawn's visible and near-infrared data from the Visible and InfraRed mapping spectrometer and from multispectral images from the Framing Camera. Our analysis includes the distribution of hydroxylated minerals, ammoniated phyllosilicates, carbonates, the search for organic materials and the characterization of physical properties of the regolith. The surface of this quadrangle is largely homogenous, except for small, high-albedo carbonate-rich areas, and one zone on dark, lobate materials on the floor of Occator, which constitute the main topics of investigation. (1) Carbonate-rich surface compositions are associated with H2O ice rich crust. Weaker absorption bands of hydroxylated and ammoniated minerals over the carbonate-rich areas can be explained by higher abundances of carbonates at the topmost surface. (2) Dark, smooth lobate materials at the foot of Occator's northeastern wall possibly reveal fresh slumping of phyllosilicate-rich materials with fine grain size, or local enrichment in carbon-rich materials such as tholins. (3) The deeper absorption band depth of OH and NH4, on the rim of several impact craters, is one observation that is consistent with a stratification of the phyllosilicate abundance that has been inferred previously from global investigations.

Mineralogy mapping of the Ac-H-5 Fejokoo quadrangle of Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article						Dwarf planet; Asteroids; Surface composition; Spectroscopy	AQUEOUS ALTERATION; DAWN; SURFACE; CRATER	This paper focuses on the identification and distribution of compositional units and their stratigraphic relationships in the Fejokoo quadrangle of Ceres (Ac-5) located between 21-66 degrees N and 270-360 degrees E and named after one of its prominent and well-preserved impact craters, Fejokoo (centered at 26 degrees N and 312 degrees E). In this quadrangle, we observed that hydroxylated- (OH-rich) and ammoniated- (NH4-rich) phyllosilicates are present everywhere, in various abundances; low abundance is observed on bright terrains and higher abundances are observed on lobate materials associated with craters. Carbonates are mostly correlated with the high-albedo areas surrounding Oxo (359.7 degrees E, 42.2 degrees N) and other major craters, and are mixed with Ceres' most common surface composition type (i.e. low albedo, phyllosilicate-rich material). There are a few locations where carbonates and phyllosilicates co-exist, indicating a range of geological or chemical processes produced them in coexistence. No correlation between the surface composition and the age of the craters was found. Instead, the composition observed on impact craters depends on the size of the impact and the composition of the different stratigraphic layers excavated. The compositional interpretation inferred from Dawn's visible-infrared spectrometer data of the Fejokoo quadrangle is consistent with the presence of an internal ocean that produced carbonates and phyllosilicates via aqueous alteration of minerals.

Dawn Sci Team	Mineralogical analysis of the Ac-H-6 Haulani quadrangle of the dwarf planet Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids surfaces; Asteroid Ceres; Spectrophotometry; Infrared observations	REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; WATER ICE; SURFACE; VESTA; DARK	Ac-H-6 'Haulani' is one of five quadrangles that cover the equatorial region of the dwarf planet Ceres. This quadrangle is notable for the broad, spectrally distinct ejecta that originate from the crater Haulani, which gives the name to the quadrangle. These ejecta exhibit one of the most negative ('bluest') visible to near infrared spectral slope observed across the entire body and have distinct color properties as seen in multispectral composite images. Besides Haulani, here we investigate a broader area that includes other surface features of interest, with an emphasis on mineralogy as inferred from data obtained by Dawn's Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer (VIR), combined with multispectral image products from the Dawn Framing Camera (FC) so as to enable a clear correlation with specific geologic features. Our analysis shows that crater Haulani stands out compared to other surface features of the quadrangle. Albedo maps obtained in the near infrared range at 1.2 mu m and 1.9 mu m reveal that the floor and ejecta of Haulani are indeed a patchwork of bright and dark material units. Visible to near-infrared spectral slopes display negative values in crater Haulani's floor and ejecta, highlighting bluish, younger terrains. Diagnostic spectral features centered at similar to 2.7 pm and similar to 3.1 mu m respectively indicate a substantial decrease in the abundances of magnesium-bearing phyllosilicates and ammoniated phyllosilicates in crater Haulani's floor and bright ejecta. Similar, but less prominent, spectral behavior is observed in other geologic features of this quadrangle, while the general trend in quadrangle Ac-H-6 for these two mineral species is to increase from the northwest to the southeast. However, it is worth noting that the correlation between the similar to 2.7 mu m and similar to 3.1 mu m spectral parameters is generally strong in the Haulani crater's area, but much weaker elsewhere, which indicates a variable degree of mixing between these two major mineral phases in moving away from the crater. Finally, the region of crater Haulani displays a distinct thermal signature and a local enhancement in calcium and possibly sodium carbonate minerals, which is hardly found in the rest of the quadrangle and is likely the result of intense hydrothermal processes following the impact event. These evidences all together confirm the young age of crater Haulani, as they have not been erased or made elusive by space weathering processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mineralogical mapping of the Kerwan quadrangle on Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article								The Ceres surface is globally composed of Mg-phyllosilicates, ammoniated clays, carbonates and dark components. To obtain a more detailed mineralogical and geological investigation, the dwarf planet surface has been divided into fifteen quadrangles. The aim of this work is to investigate the abundance of phyllosilicates and ammoniated clays in the Kerwan quadrangle, classified as Ac-H-7 and spanning from 22 degrees S to 22 degrees N in latitude and from 72 degrees E to 144 degrees E in longitude. Maps of band depth distribution at 2.7 mu m and 3.1 mu m have been performed and compared with a map of geometric albedo estimated at 1.2 mu m. Phyllosilicates and ammoniated clays generally correlate in the Kerwan quadrangle, even if departure from this behavior is observed in the floor of Kerwan, Inamahari and Homsuk craters. The greatest abundance of ammoniated phyllosilicates is found in Rao and Kerwan ejecta, while Bonsu and Tafakula floors are the most depleted in volatile, as well as Inamahari and Dantu ejecta. Six bright spots are detected in the Kerwan quadrangle, and the one richest in carbonate is related to Dantu ejecta in the southeast region. Some younger features (such as Rao or Kerwan ejecta) show deeper band depths than older terrain, a contrast trend with respect to the entire Ceres surface. Since this correlation is observed in a few other places on other quadrangles but not on the entire Ceres surface, it is possible that recent impact events could have been masked this correlation.

The mineralogy of Ceres' Nawish quadrangle	ICARUS			English	Article							CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; SURFACE; WATER	Quadrangle Ac-H-08 Nawish is located in the equatorial region of Ceres (Lat 22 degrees S-22 degrees N, Lon 144 degrees E- 216 degrees E), and it has variable mineralogy and geology. Here, we report on the mineralogy using spectra from the Visible and InfraRed (VIR) mapping spectrometer onboard the NASA Dawn mission. This quadrangle has two generally different regions: the cratered highlands of the central and eastern sector, and the eastern lowlands. We find this dichotomy is also associated with differences in the NH4-phyllosilicates distribution. The highlands, in the eastern part of the quadrangle, appear depleted in NH4-phyllosilicates, conversely to the lowlands, in the north-western side. The Mg-phyllosilicates distribution is quite homogeneous across Nawish quadrangle, except for few areas. The 2.7 mu m band depth is lower in the south-eastern part, e.g. in the Azacca ejecta and Consus crater ejecta, and the band depth is greatest for the Nawish crater ejecta, and indicates the highest content of Mg-phyllosilicates of the entire quadrangle. Our analysis finds an interesting relationship between geology, mineralogy, topography, and the age in this quadrangle. The cratered terrains in the highlands, poor in NH4 phyllosilicates, are older (-2 Ga). Conversely, the smooth terrain, such as with Vindimia Planitia, is richer in ammonia-bearing phyllosilicates and is younger (-1 Ga). At the local scale, Ac-H-8 Nawish, displays several interesting mineralogical features, such as at Nawish crater, Consus crater, Dantu and Azzacca ejecta, which exhibit localized Na-carbonates deposits. This material is superimposed on the cratered terrains and smooth terrains and shows the typical depletion of phyllosilicates, already observed on Ceres in the presence of Na-carbonates.

Mineralogy of the Occator quadrangle	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid ceres; Asteroids; Spectroscopy	REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; VESTA; SURFACE	We present an analysis of the areal distribution of spectral parameters derived from the VIR imaging spectrometer on board NASA/Dawn spacecraft. Specifically we studied the Occator quadrangle of Ceres, which is bounded by latitudes 22 degrees S to 22 degrees N and longitudes 214 degrees E to 288 degrees E, as part of the overall study of Ceres' surface composition reported in this special publication. The spectral parameters used are the photometrically corrected reflectance at 1.2 mu m, the infrared spectral slope (1.1-1.9 mu m), and depths of the absorption bands at 2.7 mu m and 3.1 mu m that are ascribed to hydrated and ammoniated materials, respectively. We find an overall correlation between 2.7 mu m and 3.1 mu m band depths, in agreement with Ceres global behavior, and band depths are shallower and the spectral slope is flatter for younger craters, probably due to physical properties of regolith such as grain size. Spectral variations correlated with the tali geological unit also suggest differences in physical properties. The deepest band, indicating enrichment of ammoniated phyllosilicates, are associated with ejecta generated by impacts that occurred in southern quadrangles. The most peculiar region of this quadrangle is the Occator crater (20 degrees N 240 degrees E). The internal crater area contains two faculae, which are the brightest areas on Ceres due to exposure of sodium carbonates, and by two types of ejecta, dark and bright, with different spectral properties, probably due to different formation, evolution or age.

Dawn Sci Team	Mineralogical analysis of quadrangle Ac-H-10 Rongo on the dwarf planet Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article							AQUEOUS ALTERATION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SURFACE; WATER	Quadrangle Ac-H-10 'Rongo' (Lat 22 degrees S to 22 degrees N, Lon 288 degrees-360 degrees E) shows a fairly homogeneous topography, with the presence of notable elevations such as Ahuna Mons, Liberalia Mons, and part of Samhain and Uhola Catenae. The deepest areas correspond to the Rongo crater region, the areas between Samhain and Uhola catenae, and the region of the quadrangle south of Ahuna Mons. A substantial variability in the 2.7-mu m band depth distribution is observed across the Rongo quadrangle, indicating an east-west gradient in the abundance of Mg-phyllosilicates. The NH4-phyllosilicates distribution appears quite homogeneous, except some localized regions, such as crater Haulani's ejecta, the flanks of Ahuna Mons, and crater Begbalel. The two band depths at 2.7 and 3.1 mu m display an overall low correlation, suggesting a variable degree of mixing between Mg-phyllosilicates and NH4-phyllosilicates. At the local scale, mineralogical phases other than phyllosilicates are observed. Quadrangle Rongo includes sodium carbonate-rich regions, such as the flanks of Ahuna Mons, the ejecta of Xevioso crater located in the southern edge of Liberalia Mons, and crater Begbalel, which often display a reduction in both the 2.7- and 3.1-mu m band depths, associated with an increased band depth at similar to 4 mu m, related to the presence of Na-rich carbonate phases. This suggests recent hydrothermal activity in this area, due to several episodes of cryovolcanism, or impacts that unveiled a peculiar composition in the shallow subsurface. Alternatively, the crust in this region might show a variable degree of compactness, such that the formation of Na-carbonates is favored only in specific locations (De Sanctis et al., 2016; Ruesch et al., 2016; Zambon et al., 2017). From a geological standpoint, quadrangle Ac-H-10 Rongo shows a correlation between its two main geologic units (Platz et al., 2017) and the distribution of Mg-phyllosilicates, suggesting a link between geology and mineralogy in this area.

Ac-H-11 Sintana and Ac-H-12 Toharu quadrangles: Assessing the large and small scale heterogeneities of Ceres' surface	ICARUS			English	Article						Dwarf planet Ceres; Surface composition; H2O ice; Carbonates; Phyllosilicates; Reflectance spectroscopy	SPECTROSCOPY; MIXTURES; MINERALS; BANDS; VESTA	Mineralogical maps of the Ac-H-11 Sintana and the Ac-H-12 Toharu quadrangles of the dwarf planet Ceres were produced in order to access the composition of this planetary body. We used data from NASA's Dawn spacecraft, in particular the spectra returned by VIR, the imaging spectrometer on board. Different spectral parameters in the infrared range have been computed to study the composition of this portion of Ceres' surface and its large and small scale variability. We studied the variation and distribution of the phyllosilicate bands at 2.73 mu m and 3.07 mu m, the reflectance at 1.2 mu m, and the overall spectrum in specific locations. We did not observe variations of the center of the bands at 2.73 mu m and 3.07 mu m, with the exception of a few pixels in the Kupalo crater. We found that this southern region, extending from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and from 21 degrees S to 66 degrees S, show an overall increase of phyllosilicate band intensity from the equatorial areas to the southern areas. Superimposed to the large-scale trend, we observe many smaller localized variations of band intensity. The observed variations can indicate large and small-scale heterogeneities in the abundance of the different species in the Ceres subsurface. However, the small-scale variation that is mostly associated with young craters, can be also due to processes related with impacts, such as dehydration or delivery of exogenous material that, mixed with the original surface, could change the band intensity. Several craters, such as Kupalo and Juling, show a different composition with respect to the background, displaying water ice and sodium carbonates. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mineralogy of the Urvara-Yalode region on Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids; Spectroscopy		We studied the distribution in the Urvara-Yalode region of Ceres (latitudes 21-66 degrees S, longitudes 180-360 degrees E) of main spectral parameters derived from the VIR imaging spectrometer onboard the NASA/Dawn spacecraft, as an overall study of Ceres mineralogy reported in this special issue. In particular, we analyzed the distribution of reflectance at 1.2 mu m, band depth at 2.7 and 3.1 mu m, ascribed to magnesium and ammoniated phyllosilicates, respectively. Whereas the average band depths of this region are lower than eastern longitudes, reflecting the E-W dichotomy of abundance of phyllosilicates on Ceres, spectral variations inside this region are observed in the following units: (a) the central peak of the Urvara crater (45.9 degrees S, 249.2 degrees E, 170 km in diameter), showing a deep 3.1 mu m band depth, indicating an ammonium enrichment; (b) the cratered terrain westwards of the Yalode basin (42.3 degrees S, 293.6 degrees E, 260 km in diameter), where absorption bands are deeper, probably due to absence of phyllosilicates depletion following the Yalode impact; (c) the hummocky cratered floor of Yalode and Besua (42.4 degrees S, 300.2 degrees E) craters, characterized by lower albedo and band depths, probably due to different roughness; (d) Consus (21 degrees S 200 degrees E) and Tawals (39.1 degrees S, 238 degrees E) craters, whose albedo and band depths decreasing could be associated to different grain size or abundance of dark materials. Twenty-two small scale (i.e., lower than 400 m) bright spots are observed: because their composition is similar to the Ceres average, a strong mixing may have occurred since their formation.

The evolution of the grounding line indeed plays a major role in ice sheet dynamics, as it is a fundamental control on marine ice sheet stability. Numerical modeling of a grounding line requires significant computational resources since the accuracy of its position depends on grid or mesh resolution. A technique that improves accuracy with reduced computational cost is the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) approach. We present here the implementation of the AMR technique in the finite element Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) to simulate grounding line dynamics under two different benchmarks: MISMIP3d and MISMIP+. We test different refinement criteria: (a) distance around the grounding line, (b) a posteriori error estimator, the Zienkiewicz-Zhu (ZZ) error estimator, and (c) different combinations of (a) and (b). In both benchmarks, the ZZ error estimator presents high values around the grounding line. In the MISMIP+ setup, this estimator also presents high values in the grounded part of the ice sheet, following the complex shape of the bedrock geometry. The ZZ estimator helps guide the refinement procedure such that AMR performance is improved. Our results show that computational time with AMR depends on the required accuracy, but in all cases, it is significantly shorter than for uniformly refined meshes. We conclude that AMR without an associated error estimator should be avoided, especially for real glaciers that have a complex bed geometry.

However, the relative contribution of the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts to dust loadings through long-range transport remains unaddressed in any observational study. Here, the climatology of Asian dust activation and potential for transport is investigated using stereo observations of dust sources from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument combined with observation-initiated trajectory modeling. MISR-derived dust plume top height and dust plume motion vectors confirm the peak of dust activation and transport potential in spring over the Gobi Desert and in both spring and summer over the Taklamakan Desert. The long-range trajectory patterns of Asian dust, including the influence on North America through trans-Pacific transport, are assessed using extensive forward trajectories initiated by MISR dust plume observations. The trajectory analysis reveals latitude-dependent spread of dust trajectories from the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts, with Taklamakan dust dominantly affecting to the south of 50 degrees N and Gobi dust primarily affecting to the north of 50 degrees N in North America. The Asian dust activation and transport potential exhibit substantial seasonal and interannual variability, motivating future studies on the potential drivers.

Here, we quantify the variability in the lower stratospheric BDC induced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), using satellite trace gas measurements and simulations with the Lagrangian chemistry transport model, CLaMS, driven by ERA-Interim and JRA-55 reanalyses. We show that despite discrepancies in the deseasonalized ozone (O-3) mixing ratios between CLaMS simulations and satellite observations, the patterns of changes in the lower stratospheric O-3 anomalies induced by ENSO agree remarkably well over the 2005-2016 period. Particularly during the most recent El Nino in 2015-2016, both satellite observations and CLaMS simulations show the largest negative tropical O-3 anomaly in the record. Regression analysis of different metrics of the BDC strength, including mean age of air, vertical velocity, residual circulation, and age spectrum, shows clear evidence of structural changes in the BDC in the lower stratosphere induced by El Nino, consistent with observed O-3 anomalies. These structural changes during El Nino include a weakening of the transition branch of the BDC between about 370 and 420K (similar to 100-70 hPa) and equatorward of about 60 degrees and a strengthening of the shallow branch at the same latitudes and between about 420 and 500K (similar to 70-30 hPa). The slowdown of the transition branch is due to an upward shift in the dissipation height of the large-scale and gravity waves, while the strengthening of the shallow branch results mainly from enhanced gravity wave breaking in the tropics-subtropics combined with enhanced planetary wave breaking at high latitudes. The strengthening of the shallow branch induces negative tropical O-3 anomalies due to enhanced tropical upwelling, while the weakening of the transition branch combined with enhanced downwelling due to the strengthening shallow branch leads to positive O-3 anomalies in the extratropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS). Our results suggest that a shift in the ENSO basic state toward more frequent El Nino-like conditions in a warmer future climate will substantially alter UTLS trace gas distributions due to these changes in the vertical structure of the stratospheric circulation.

J	Dutta, D; Schimel, DS; Sun, Y; van der Tol, C; Frankenberg, C				Dutta, Debsunder; Schimel, David S.; Sun, Ying; van der Tol, Christiaan; Frankenberg, Christian			Optimal inverse estimation of ecosystem parameters from observations of carbon and energy fluxes	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							LEAF-AREA INDEX; VEGETATION BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS; CANOPY REFLECTANCE DATA; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC PARAMETERS; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CO2 ASSIMILATION; BALANCE CLOSURE	Canopy structural and leaf photosynthesis parameterizations such as maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), slope of the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model (BBslope) and leaf area index (LAI) are crucial for modeling plant physiological processes and canopy radiative transfer. These parameters are large sources of uncertainty in predictions of carbon and water fluxes. In this study, we develop an optimal moving window nonlinear Bayesian inversion framework to use the Soil Canopy Observation Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model for constraining V-cmax, BBslope and LAI with observations of coupled carbon and energy fluxes and spectral reflectance from satellites. We adapted SCOPE to follow the biochemical implementation of the Community Land Model and applied the inversion framework for parameter retrievals of plant species that have both the C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways across three ecosystems. We present comparative analysis of parameter retrievals using observations of (i) gross primary productivity (GPP) and latent energy (LE) fluxes and (ii) improvement in results when using flux observations along with reflectance. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the approach in terms of capturing the seasonal variability and posterior error reduction (40 %-90 %) of key ecosystem parameters. The optimized parameters capture the diurnal and seasonal variability in the GPP and LE fluxes well when compared to flux tower observations (0.95 > R-2 > 0.79). This study thus demonstrates the feasibility of parameter inversions using SCOPE, which can be easily adapted to incorporate additional data sources such as spectrally resolved reflectance and fluorescence and thermal emissions.

High-velocity Bullets from V Hydrae, an Asymptotic Giant Branch Star in Transition: Ejection History and Spatio-kinematic Modeling	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: AGB and post-AGB; stars: jets; stars: individual (V Hydrae); stars: mass-loss	PLANETARY-NEBULAE; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; MASS-LOSS; OUTFLOW; BIPOLAR; WIND; ENVELOPE; DISK; JET; KNOTTY	The carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya) provides new insight into the nature of the launching mechanism of jet-like outflows that are believed to be the cause of the poorly understood transition phase of asymptotic giant branch stars into aspherical planetary nebulae. V Hya has been shown to periodically eject collimated gas blobs at high velocities ("bullets"). By analyzing data from Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph 2D spectra, obtained at six epochs spaced over a decade that show four successively ejected bullets with a spacing of 8.5 yr, we have created kinematic models of the dynamical evolution of a specific bullet (#1) for the first three observed epochs (2002, 2003, 2004) using a 3D spatio-kinematic code, SHAPE. Using these models, we fit the observed morphology, line-of-sight velocity, proper motion, and intensity for the extended, gaseous bullet as a function of time over a period of 2 yr, in order to constrain its 3D movement and the evolution of its physical properties over this period. Our results suggest that although bullet #1's motion is predominantly ballistic, there are small but significant changes in the position angle and inclination angle of the long (symmetry) axis of the bullet that tilt it progressively toward the symmetry axis of the bipolar molecular nebula around V Hya. In contrast, bullet #3 shows strong acceleration soon after ejection. We discuss the possibilities that bullet acceleration is caused by a nonradial magnetic field and/or by hydrodynamic interaction with the ambient gas through which the bullet is traveling.

Plasma propagation and expansion are dealt with via the variable change of the EBM. In this way the large separation between scales of interest and domain size is addressed by including solar wind propagation and expansion as time-dependent coupling terms and coordinate stretching. The semi-implicit discretization, in the widely used Implicit Moment Method (IMM) flavor, promises to increase the simulated domain size and duration with respect to explicit discretization. The EBM IMM equations are derived and tested against expected behavior of expanding plasma.

A unique experimental design during the 2013 NASA Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS) field mission allowed for collocated airborne sampling by the high spectral resolution Lidar (HSRL), the Airborne Multi-angle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), up/down shortwave (SW) and infrared (IR) broadband radiometers, as well as NASA A-Train support from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to attempt direct aerosol forcing closure. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of modeled fields to aerosol radiative fluxes and heating rates, specifically in the SW, as induced in this event from transported smoke and regional urban aerosols. Limitations are identified with respect to aerosol attribution, vertical distribution, and the choice of optical and surface polarimetric properties, which are discussed within the context of their influence on numerical weather prediction output that is particularly important as the community propels forward towards inline aerosol modeling within global forecast systems.

DES Collaboration; SPT Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: Methodology and projections for joint analysis of galaxy clustering, galaxy lensing, and CMB lensing two-point functions	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							CROSS-CORRELATION; COSMIC SHEAR; HALO MODEL; COSMOLOGY; DEPENDENCE; CONSTRAINTS; ALIGNMENTS; LUMINOSITY; EFFICIENT; BIAS	Optical imaging surveys measure both the galaxy density and the gravitational lensing-induced shear fields across the sky. Recently, the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration used a joint fit to two-point correlations between these observables to place tight constraints on cosmology (T. M. C. Abbott et al. (Dark Energy Survey Collaboration), Phys. Rev. D 98, 043526 (2018)). In this work, we develop the methodology to extend the DES Year 1 joint probes analysis to include cross-correlations of the optical survey observables with gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background as measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. Using simulated analyses, we show how the resulting set of five two-point functions increases the robustness of the cosmological constraints to systematic errors in galaxy lensing shear calibration. Additionally, we show that contamination of the SPT+Planck cosmic microwave background lensing map by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is a potentially large source of systematic error for two-point function analyses but show that it can be reduced to acceptable levels in our analysis by masking clusters of galaxies and imposing angular scale cuts on the two-point functions. The methodology developed here will be applied to the analysis of data from the DES, the SPT, and Planck in a companion work.	[Baxter, E. J.; Jain, B.; Jarvis, M.; Pandey, S.; Secco, L.

Using a speed-dependent Voigt line shape to retrieve O-2 from Total Carbon Column Observing Network solar spectra to improve measurements of XCO2	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							1.27 MU-M; INTEGRATED ABSORPTION INTENSITIES; COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; MOLECULAR-OXYGEN; PRESSURE; CO2; SPECTROMETER; TRANSITIONS; CALIBRATION; PARAMETERS	High-resolution, laboratory, absorption spectra of the a(1)Delta(g) <- X-3 Sigma(-)(g) oxygen (O-2) band measured using cavity ring-down spectroscopy were fitted using the Voigt and speed-dependent Voigt line shapes. We found that the speed-dependent Voigt line shape was better able to model the measured absorption coefficients than the Voigt line shape. We used these line shape models to calculate absorption coefficients to retrieve atmospheric total columns abundances of O-2 from ground-based spectra from four Fourier transform spectrometers that are a part of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Lower O-2 total columns were retrieved with the speed-dependent Voigt line shape, and the difference between the total columns retrieved using the Voigt and speed-dependent Voigt line shapes increased as a function of solar zenith angle. Previous work has shown that carbon dioxide (CO2) total columns are better retrieved using a speed-dependent Voigt line shape with line mixing. The column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) was calculated using the ratio between the columns of CO2 and O-2 retrieved (from the same spectra) with both line shapes from measurements taken over a 1-year period at the four sites. The inclusion of speed dependence in the O-2 retrievals significantly reduces the air mass dependence of XCO2, and the bias between the TCCON measurements and calibrated integrated aircraft profile measurements was reduced from 1% to 0.4 %. These results suggest that speed dependence should be included in the forward model when fitting near-infrared CO2 and O-2 spectra to improve the accuracy of XCO2 measurements.

Widespread glacier acceleration has been linked to the warming of ocean waters around the periphery of Greenland but a lack of information on the bathymetry of the continental shelf and glacial fjords has limited our ability to understand how subsurface, warm, salty ocean waters of Atlantic origin (AW) reach the glaciers and melt them from below. Here, we employ high-resolution, airborne gravity data (AIRGrav) in combination with multibeam echo sounding (MBES) data, to infer the bathymetry of the coastal areas of Northwest Greenland for NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) mission. High-resolution, AIRGrav data acquired on a 2 km spacing, 150 m ground clearance, with 1.5 mGal crossover error, is inverted in three dimensions to map the bathymetry. To constrain the inversion away from MBES data, we compare two methods: one based on the Direct Current (DC) shift of the gravity field (absolute minus observed gravity) and another based on the density of the bedrock. We evaluate and compare the two methods in areas with complete MBES coverage. We find the lowest standard error in bed elevation (+/- 60 m) using the DC shift method. When applied to the entire coast of Northwest Greenland, the three-dimensional inversion reveals a complex network of connected sea bed channels, not known previously, that provide natural and varied pathways for AW to reach the glaciers across the continental shelf. The study demonstrates that the gravity approach offers an efficient and practical alternative to extensive ship mapping in ice-filled waters to obtain information critical to understanding and modeling ice-ocean interaction along ice sheet margins.

In situ measurements were performed in order to spectrally characterize the surface reflectance spectra between 0.3 and 2.5 mu m, radiometric temperature (8.0-14.0 mu m) and atmospheric measurements. A soil sample was collected and analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction techniques to characterize the surface reflectance spectra and mineralogical composition, respectively. ASTER land surface emissivity in addition to GOES, MODIS and Landsat-8 land surface temperature (LST) were also used. Results showed that the spectral features of the Atacama soil and the characteristics of this geographical zone, which is featured as the most hyper-arid and cloudless place in the world, make this area a potential target for surface reflectance characterization. Day and night LST comparison between field and remote sensing data are lower than 2 K and the Root Mean Square Error for land surface emissivity is close to 2%. This work opens the possibilities to consider the Atacama Desert as a reference target for calibration and validation activities for earth observation missions' purposes.

Isotopic Fractionation in He-3-rich SEP Events	18TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS CONFERENCE	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Annual International Astrophysics Conference (AIAC)	FEB 18-22, 2019	Pasadena, CA				HEAVY; ABUNDANCES; IONS	A well established characteristic of He-3-rich solar energetic particle events is a pattern of abundance enhancements relative to normal solar system values that increase approximately monotonically with atomic number (or mass), leading to enhancements that can exceed 100x for the heaviest elements relative to oxygen. In a 2018 paper, Mason and Klecker (M&K) suggested that the heavy element enhancements could be due to characteristics of the stopping powers of low-energy nuclei penetrating thin layers of H gas or plasma. We present results of a new calculation of enhancements in a H gas and show them to be in reasonable agreement with the M&K results. Studies of heavy-element isotopic composition in 3He-rich events using data from ACE/SIS have also shown that heavier isotopes of an element typically exhibit significant abundance enhancements relative to lighter isotopes of the same element. We applied the new calculation to investigate whether the observed isotopic fractionation can be explained using the M&K H-gas model with the same parameters that account for the heavy-element abundances and found that the measured isotopic enhancements are significantly greater than the predicted values. A search of a larger parameter space was also not able to reconcile the elemental and isotopic enhancement values. However, this search did reveal trends in the dependence on the model parameters that merit further investigation.	[Wiedenbeck, M.

Delaunay-based Derivative-free Optimization via Global Surrogates with Safe and Exact Function Evaluations	2019 IEEE 58TH CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	58th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 11-13, 2019	Nice, FRANCE	IEEE				Automatic parameter tuning is an important task in real-world (experimental) optimization, in order to safely (e.g. without crashing) explore an unknown environment. Example includes smooth open-loop control of trajectory planning where collisions must be avoided. Delaunay-based derivative-free optimization via Global Surrogate (A-DOGS) algorithms are a family of response surface method that efficiently and globally minimizes black-box, computationally expensive, nonconvex optimization problems; however, the challenge of restricting all function evaluations to be "safe" during the parameter tuning process has not yet been addressed in this family of algorithms. In this work, we develop a new, safety-constrained variant of this approach, dubbed S-DOGS, to automatically learn the safe region of parameter space, while simultaneously characterizing and optimizing the utility function under consideration, under the assumption that the underlying safety constraints are Lipschitz continuous and the safe region is connected and compact. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the resulting method is both efficient in terms of the rate of convergence with the number of function evaluations performed, and guaranteed to converge to the global minimum while respecting the safety constraints.

While the classical approaches provide risk guarantees only at discretized epochs, it is essential for most physical systems to have continuous-time risk guarantees; it is especially important for unstable systems. This paper develops a new approach to enforce continuous-time risk guarantees by leveraging a notion of Cumulative Lyapunov Exponent, which measures the cumulative stabilities of Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems. The solution method finds a sequence of feedback control policies for LTV systems that minimizes the expected control cost subject to continuous-time chance constraints. We demonstrate the approach with a spacecraft orbit control scenario on an unstable orbit. Monte Carlo simulations with the optimized feedback policies show that our approach respects the continuous-time chance constraints whereas a classical approach results in the constraint violation between the discretized epochs.

The measured results are used to develop a black-box temperature-sensitive model of the device under test (DUT) capable of incorporating non-ideal effects on the input signal including noise via SNR and distortion via THD. The black-box model consists of the integral non-linearity (INL) function which expresses deviation in converter decision points from their ideal location, characterized across output code and temperature. In addition, a Simulink (R) model of a SAR ADC is described. Results indicate additional effects beyond those caused by INL modification may be present in the output. While prior work has examined this model approach for commercial devices, it has never been used for devices operating in extreme temperatures well outside their designed operating ranges. This aspect presented some challenges during testing that had to be overcome to continue to gather useful data.

The Jacobian matrix maps incremental joint motion to incremental end-effector motion in a linear fashion and is typically used in manipulator trajectory generation algorithms. In the case of a redundant manipulator, the Jacobian matrix is not square or invertible and therefore algorithms based on pseudoinverses and their variations are commonly used for trajectory generation. These methods either are computationally not efficient or do not utilize all the joints in motion generation and therefore do not completely exploit the redundancy of the manipulator. The method presented in this paper is a simple method that maximizes transmission of all joint variables onto a desired end-effector motion trajectory. The method is based on aligning the null-space of an augmented Jacobian matrix with the path of the desired end-effector motion, from which a linear combination of joints that projects fully onto the desired end-effector trajectory is obtained. In this manner, all joints of the redundant manipulator are used to generate the end-effector trajectory accommodating the ability of each joint in terms of its motion transmission.

Alongside, a hammering device was deployed that penetrated into the ground to attempt the first measurements of the planetary heat flow of Mars. The hammering generated repeated seismic signals that were registered by the seismometer. These signals can potentially be used to image the shallow subsurface just below the lander. However, the frequencies excited by the hammering probe widely exceed the Nyquist frequency dictated by the seismometer's sampling rate. Here, we propose an algorithm to reconstruct the seismic signals beyond the classical sampling theorem. We exploit the structure in the data due to thousands of repeated, only gradually varying hammering signals as the heat probe slowly penetrates into the ground. This allows us to reconstruct signals by enforcing a sparsity constraint in a modified Radon transform domain.	[Sollberger, David; Schmelzbach, Cedric; Andersson, Fredrik; Robertsson, Johan O.

Improved estimates of ESD likelihood in the space environment require better models of ESD distributions. The purpose of this work is to evaluate our previously proposed dual-defect model of voltage step-up-to-breakdown tests with a case study across four dielectric materials. We predicted that materials best fit by mixed Weibull distributions would exhibit better fits with the dual-defect model compared to a mean field single defect theory. Additional data for biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), polyimide (PI or Kapton) from three sources, and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) are compared to the previous study on low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Except in one case, the dual-defect model is a better fit to bimodal distributions of tests results.

Moreover, to maximize flight time, small multirotor platforms have to operate within strict constraints on payload and thus computational performance. In this paper, we present the design and experimental comparison of Model Predictive and PID multirotor position controllers augmented with a disturbance estimator to reject strong wind gusts up to 12 m/s and ground effect. For disturbance estimation, we compare Extended and Unscented Kalman filtering. In extensive in- and outdoor flight tests, we evaluate the suitability of the developed control and estimation algorithms to run on a computationally constrained platform. This allows to draw a conclusion on whether potential performance improvements justify the increased computational complexity of MPC for multirotor position control and UKF for disturbance estimation.

In this work we outline our unified framework for controls, planning, and autonomy of hybrid ground/air vehicles. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) We develop a control scheme for the control of passive two-wheeled hybrid ground/aerial vehicles. 2) We present a unified planner for both rolling and flying by leveraging differential flatness mappings. 3) We conduct experiments leveraging mapping and global planning for hybrid mobility in unknown environments, showing that hybrid mobility uses up to five times less energy than flying only(1).

In this paper, we present a Programming by Demonstration system that synthesizes manipulation programs from a single observed demonstration, allowing users to program new tasks for a robot simply by performing the task once themselves. A human-in-the-loop interface helps users make corrections to the perceptual state as needed. We introduce Object Interaction Programs as a representation of multi-object, bimanual manipulation tasks and present algorithms for extracting programs from observed demonstrations and transferring programs to a robot to perform the task in a new scene. We demonstrate the expressivity and generalizability of our approach through an evaluation on a benchmark of complex tasks.

The addition of a ballistic launch system imposes a deterministic path for the multirotor to prevent collisions with its environment, as well as increases the multirotor's range of operation and allows deployment from an unsteady platform. In addition, outfitting planetary rovers or entry vehicles with such deployable multirotors has the potential to greatly extend the data collection capabilities of a mission. A proof-of-concept multirotor aircraft has been developed, capable of transitioning from a ballistic launch configuration to a fully controllable flight configuration in midair after launch. The transition is accomplished via passive unfolding of the multirotor arms, triggered by a nichrome burn wire release mechanism. The design is 3D printable, launches from a three-inch diameter barrel, and has sufficient thrust to carry a significant payload. The system has been fabricated and field tested from a moving vehicle up to 50mph to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and experimentally validate the design's aerodynamic stability and deployment reliability.

An Autonomous Quadrotor System for Robust High-Speed Flight Through Cluttered Environments Without GPS	2019 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	NOV 04-08, 2019	Macau, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, RSJ			DIFFERENTIAL FLATNESS	Robust autonomous flight without GPS is key to many emerging drone applications, such as delivery, search and rescue, and warehouse inspection. These and other applications require accurate trajectory tracking through cluttered static environments, where GPS can be unreliable, while highspeed, agile, flight can increase efficiency. We describe the hardware and software of a quadrotor system that meets these requirements with onboard processing: a custom 300 mm wide quadrotor that uses two wide-field-of-view cameras for visual-inertial motion tracking and relocalization to a prior map. Collision-free trajectories are planned offline and tracked online with a custom tracking controller. This controller includes compensation for drag and variability in propeller performance, enabling accurate trajectory tracking, even at high speeds where aerodynamic effects are significant. We describe a system identification approach that identifies quadrotor-specific parameters via maximum likelihood estimation from flight data. Results from flight experiments are presented, which 1) validate the system identification method, 2) show that our controller with aerodynamic compensation reduces tracking error by more than 50% in both horizontal flights at up to 8.5 m/s and vertical flights at up to 3.1 m/s compared to the state-of-the-art, and 3) demonstrate our system tracking complex, aggressive, trajectories.

Using teams of robots to perform assembly offers numerous advantages such as parallelism, robustness to single-agent failures, and flexibility in scheduling and task assignment. However, while previous work on multi-robot assembly focuses on generating feasible assembly plans and decentralized control strategies, we instead study the problem of planning optimal assembly sequences. To this end, we pose the problem of multi-robot assembly as a discrete optimization, specifically an integer linear program (ILP) or quadratic program (IQP), which aims to minimize the time to complete the assembly, or to minimize the distance traveled. We develop a model of multi-robot assembly that captures both geometric constraints and actuation constraints inherent to the problem. While the ILP and IQP can be solved exactly using commercial optimization software in a substantial amount of time, we also propose heuristic strategies which can be quickly computed, and can scale to structures of reasonable size. We also verify our methods empirically by comparing their performance on a variety of test structures.

The key challenge is the fast on-board initialization of the visual odometry (VO) system, which usually requires user input to recover the visual scale. Our approach is based on the identification of the gravity vector from the acceleration data computed with images of the ground during in free fall. This enables scaling of the poses reconstructed with visual information. The proposed framework use inertial data to control the MAV attitude so the ground is visible after the throw. Using image to image homography a metric scale is estimated with which the MAV's height is propagated. Unlike existing literature, this approach requires no additional sensor nor user input or pre-throw assumptions and can recover from any initial attitude. We show results on both simulation and real data.

List-Decoded Tail-Biting Convolutional Codes with Distance-Spectrum Optimal CRCs for 5G	2019 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2019	Waikoloa, HI	IEEE, Huawei, Intel, ZTE, Google, Qualcomm, Natl Instruments, IEEE Commun Soc			ALGORITHMS	This paper uses convolutional codes (CCs) with distance-spectrum optimal (DSO) cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) and the serial list Viterbi algorithm (S-LVA) to approach the random coding union (RCU) bound with low decoding complexity at the target FER. We show, for example, that a 64-state zero-terminated CC with a DSO CRC can achieve performance within 0.5 dB of the RCU bound for information blocklength k = 64 at FER of 10(-3). We also show that a tail-biting CC with a DSO CRC can achieve even better performance, within 0.05 dB of the RCU bound at FER of 10(-4) for a 256-state CC with k = 64. This paper provides analysis of decoding complexity, which for S-LVA depends on the expected list size. We show that if the target FER is low enough, the expected list size approaches one so that the average complexity of S-LVA approaches that of standard soft Viterbi on the CC, i.e., with no list decoding. We also provide DSO CRCs for CCs with k = 64 and rates of 1/2, 1/3, 1/6 and 1/12 for the 5G new radio control channel and compare their performance with polar codes.

A List-Decoding Approach to Low-Complexity Soft Maximum-Likelihood Decoding of Cyclic Codes	2019 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2019	Waikoloa, HI	IEEE, Huawei, Intel, ZTE, Google, Qualcomm, Natl Instruments, IEEE Commun Soc			BLOCK; ALGORITHMS	This paper provides a reduced-complexity approach to maximum likelihood (ML) decoding of cyclic codes. A cyclic code with generator polynomial g(cyclic)(x) may be considered a terminated convolutional code with a nominal rate of 1. The trellis termination redundancy lowers the rate from 1 to the actual rate of the cyclic code. The proposed decoder represents g(cyclic)(x) as the product of two polynomials, a convolutional code (CC) polynomial g(cc)(x) and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) polynomial g(crc)(x), i.e., g(cyclic()x) = g(cc)(x)g(crc)(x). This representation facilitates serial list Viterbi algorithm (S-LVA) decoding. Viterbi decoding is performed on the natural trellis for g(cc)(x), and g(cr)c(x) is used as a CRC to determine when the S-LVA should conclude. At typical target frame error rates, the expected list size of S-LVA is small, and the average decoding complexity is dominated by the trellis complexity of g(cc)(x) rather than g(cyclic)(x). Some high-rate binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) examples show that the proposed use of S-LVA via factorization significantly lowers complexity as compared to using the minimum -complexity trellis representation of g(cyclic)(x) for soft ML decoding.

Such missions require accurate predictions of cell performance under low irradiance, low temperature and high radiation conditions. However, test artifacts such as room-temperature annealing of radiation-induced defects can introduce significant inaccuracy in the ground-based test data with respect to the true flight performance. In this paper, we present a preliminary investigation of the room-temperature annealing artifact using in-situ dark-IV characterization, and we place a lower bound on the inflation it introduces.

The waveguide and grating resonances were used to enhance the color dynamic when GeTe is transitioned between its amorphous and crystalline states. The optical refractive index of the GeTe grating changes in response to an applied heat, which results in different reflected colors. Red, yellow, and green colors were achieved at room temperature for different grating periods in the amorphous phase. When GeTe is transitioned to the crystalline state, these colors change to orange, green, and blue, respectively.	[Jafari, Mohsen; Guo, L.

Its goal is to directly image and spectroscopically characterize planetary systems in the habitable zone around nearby sun-like stars. Additionally, HabEx will perform a broad range of general astrophysics science enabled by 115 to 2500 nm spectral range and 3 x 3 arc-minute FOV. Critical to achieving the HabEx science goals is a large, ultra-stable UV/Optical/Near-IR (UVOIR) telescope. The baseline HabEx telescope is 4-meter off-axis unobscured, diffraction limited at 400 nm with wavefront stability on the order of a few 10s of picometers. The technology readiness level (TRL) to manufacture and test the HabEx baseline primary mirror is assessed to be at TRL-6 for all but two TRL-4 technologies: 1) non-destructive process to quantify CTE homogeneity of a 4-m mirror substrate with a spatial sampling of at least 100 x 100 to better than +/- 1 ppb/K; and, 2) process to quantify self-weight gravity deflection to better than 4-nm rms over a 100 x 100 spatial sampling. This paper reviews the technology needs to manufacture the HabEx primary mirror, assesses their TRL and proposes a roadmap to mature the two remaining technologies to TRL-6.	[Stahl, H.

Using Deep Convective Clouds identified in 16 years of AIRS infrared data for the absolute calibration and stability evaluation of the AIRS 0.4 to 1.0 micron reflected light channels.	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV	AUG 11-15, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE				In principle, extreme Deep Convective Clouds (DCC) should be perfect Lambertian diffusers of solar reflected radiation. As such they can be used for the calibration of reflected light channels. We use DCC identified with a thermal infrared channels of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) to evaluate the usefulness of DCC for the calibration AIRS visible light channels. The DCC signal in the reflected light channels approaches the signal expected from a perfect diffuser in only a small portion of the 13 km AIRS thermal IR and 2 km AIRS reflected light channels. This limits the absolute calibration accuracy derivable from DCC to the 5% level, but still allows trend measurements at the smaller than 0.01%/yr level. This technique allows us to estimate the trend in the globally Reflected ShortWave radiation (RSW) as +0.003%/yr with 0.009%/yr one sigma uncertainty. Trends at this level are significant from a climate perspective.	[Aumann, H.

The OBC can be used to check the nonlinearity by turning off the heater and letting the target float from 308K to roughly 261K while acquiring data. The OBC Float test was performed once prior to launch, and again shortly after launch. However, the OBC Float test did not produce accurate nonlinearity results because the temperature sensors became inaccurate below 290K. This paper summarizes a technique using a reference channel that is highly linear to measure the apparent temperature of the OBC, then using that temperature to determine the nonlinearity of the other channels. This method works well, and we are able to confirm the nonlinearity derived pre-flight for most of the channels. The AIRS has A side and B side channels that have different gain and nonlinearities, but the OBC float test was performed with an A/B optimum data set. We recommend repeating the test with A side and B side only gains selected for the channels.

For the first time in human history, technologies have matured sufficiently to enable an affordable space-based telescope mission capable of discovering and characterizing Earthlike planets orbiting nearby bright sunlike stars to search for signs of habitability and biosignatures. Such a mission can also be equipped with instrumentation that will enable broad and exciting general astrophysics and planetary science not possible from current or planned facilities. HabEx is a space telescope with unique imaging and multi-object spectroscopic capabilities at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to near-IR. These capabilities allow for a broad suite of compelling science that cuts across the entire NASA astrophysics portfolio. HabEx has three primary science goals: (1) Seek out nearby worlds and explore their habitability; (2) Map out nearby planetary systems and understand the diversity of the worlds they contain; (3) Enable new explorations of astrophysical systems from our own solar system to external galaxies by extending our reach in the UV through near-IR. This Great Observatory science will be selected through a competed GO program, and will account for about 50% of the HabEx primary mission. The preferred HabEx architecture is a 4m, monolithic, off-axis telescope that is diffraction-limited at 0.4 mu m and is in an L2 orbit. HabEx employs two starlight suppression systems: a coronagraph and a starshade, each with their own dedicated instrument.	[Gaudi, B.

The Origins Space Telescope	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts IX	AUG 11-12, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE				The Origins Space Telescope will trace the history of our origins from the time dust and heavy elements permanently altered the cosmic landscape to present-day life. How did galaxies evolve from the earliest galactic systems to those found in the universe today? How do habitable planets form? How common are life-bearing worlds? To answer these alluring questions, Origins will operate at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths and offer powerful spectroscopic instruments and sensitivity three orders of magnitude better than that of Herschel, the largest telescope flown in space to date. After a 3 1/2 year study, the Origins Science and Technology Definition Team will recommend to the Decadal Survey a concept for Origins with a 5.9-m diameter telescope cryocooled to 4.5 K and equipped with three scientific instruments. A mid-infrared instrument (MISC-T) will measure the spectra of transiting exoplanets in the 2.8 - 20 mu m wavelength range and offer unprecedented sensitivity, enabling definitive biosignature detections. The Far-IR Imager Polarimeter (FIP) will be able to survey thousands of square degrees with broadband imaging at 50 and 250 mu m. The Origins Survey Spectrometer (OSS) will cover wavelengths from 25 - 588 mu m, make wide-area and deep spectroscopic surveys with spectral resolving power R similar to 300, and pointed observations at R similar to 40,000 and 300,000 with selectable instrument modes. Origins was designed to minimize complexity. The telescope has a Spitzer-like architecture and requires very few deployments after launch. The cryo-thermal system design leverages JWST technology and experience. A combination of current-state-of-the-art cryocoolers and next-generation detector technology will enable Origins' natural background-limited sensitivity.	[Leisawitz, D.; Amatucci, E.; Beaman, B.

NASA investment in these technologies, prioritized in the 2010 Decadal Survey, have ripened to a maturity to enable direct imaging of earthlike exoplanets. For the first time since the discovery of exoplanets, a direct imaging mission can be conceived to start in less than ten years, possibly as soon as five years. The HabEx Observatory Concept design utilizes technologies that are state of the art or near to state of the art with clear paths of development. The philosophy of the design favors as high a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) as possible to minimize risk. We discuss the HabEx technology challenges and asses the TRL expected by the submission of the Final Report in 2019. Many of the enabling technologies are at, or expected to be at, TRL 5 by 2019, and the remaining technologies are at TRL 4. We update the technology maturity roadmap with technology advances in the past year and expand it to include discussion of pathways to TRL 6. We assess the exoplanet-driven technologies of HabEx, including starshades, coronagraphs, deformable mirrors, wavefront control, 4 m aperture mirrors, jitter mitigation, segmented mirror stability, and low-noise detectors.

The baseline HabEx design would use both a coronagraph and a starshade for exoplanet discovery and characterization. We describe a lower-cost alternative HabEx mission design, which would only use a starshade for exoplanet science. The starshade would provide excellent exoplanet science performance, but for a smaller number of detected exoplanets of all types, including exoEarth candidates, and a smaller fraction of exoplanets with measured orbits. The full suite of HabEx general astrophysics and solar-system science would be supported.

The mission implements two world-class General Astrophysics instruments as part of its complement of instrumentation to enable compelling science using the 4m aperture. The Ultraviolet Spectrograph has been designed to address cutting edge far ultraviolet (FUV) science that has not been possible with the Hubble Space Telescope, and to open up a wide range of capabilities that will advance astrophysics as we look into the 2030s. Our paper discusses some of those science drivers and possible applications, which range from Solar System science, to nearby and more distant studies of star formation, to studies of the circumgalactic and intergalactic mediums.

LIC along with Lunar Flashlight and LunaH-Map, all focused on the search for volatiles but with very different payloads, will be the first deep space cubesats designed to address goals for both demonstrating new technologies and collecting scientific data. Effectively, as their developments are occurring in parallel, they are acting as prototypes for future deep space cubesats missions. One useful outcome of this `experiment' is to evolve a working paradigm for the development and operation of compact, cost-capped, standardized (supporting subsystems) spacecraft to serve the needs of diverse user communities. The lunar ice cube mission was developed as the test case in a GSFC R&D study to determine whether the cubesat paradigm could be applied to deep space, science requirements driven missions, and BIRCHES was its payload. Here, we present the design and describe the ongoing development, and testing, in the context of the challenges of using the cubesat paradigm to fly a broadband IR spectrometer in a 6U platform, including a very harsh environment, minimal funding and extensive need for leveraging existing assets and relationships on development, and minimum command and telemetry bandwidth translating into simplified or canned operation and the collection of only essential data.

Electronic Alignment for the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder	CUBESATS AND SMALLSATS FOR REMOTE SENSING III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on CubeSats and SmallSats for Remote Sensing III	AUG 11-12, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Infrared; Sounding; CubeSat; Alignment; Spectral; Calibration		Technological advancements in detectors, cryocoolers, infrared spectrometers and optical materials enables hyperspectral infrared atmospheric sounding in a CubeSat. Legacy instruments such as NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) measure the upwelling spectrum to retrieve temperature profiles and atmospheric water vapor. These data are assimilated by National Weather Prediction (NWP) centers worldwide and had significant positive impact to the operational forecasts. NASA and NOAA have sponsored technology demonstration of a hyperspectral IR sounder packaged in a 6U CubeSat at JPL. The instrument is called the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS). Like AIRS, CIRAS uses a grating spectrometer that senses spatial information in one dimension and spectral in the other, but CIRAS uses a 2-dimensional Focal Plane Assembly (FPA), while AIRS uses multiple linear arrays to produce one spectrum. For CIRAS, if the dispersion direction is not aligned with the rows and columns of the detectors, spectral and spatial mixing can cause radiometric errors if uncorrected. This paper discusses a method to resample the signals from the detector array while viewing a spectral and spatial calibration source and produce a spectrally and spatially corrected image. The correction, or 'Electronic Alignment' can be performed pre-flight during Integration and Test, or in-flight using a combination of on-board and ground processing systems. Results are presented for simulated misalignments and errors consistent with design requirements using real scenes from the legacy sounders. The method works reasonably well with highest errors around sharp absorption features for cold scenes. Residual radiance errors from the simulation can be used in a larger simulation of the retrieval of geophysical parameters from hyperspectral IR instruments.

Manipulators for Mini-Class ROVs (similar to 15 kg) are typically constrained to 1 or 2 degrees of freedom, limiting their use to simple tasks. Consequently, for underwater activities requiring complex manipulation, either large vehicles or human divers must be used, which can be resource-intensive or dangerous. This paper describes a prototype miniaturized manipulator arm that enables dexterous manipulation capability for small underwater vehicles. The current prototype underwater mini-arm is a 6 degree of freedom robotic arm constructed of three identical wireless dual actuator units. Each actuator is a self-contained system including motors, gearboxes, seals, a battery, and custom circuitry for motor control, wireless communication, and wireless charging. As there is no external wire harnessing, the actuators are continuously rotatable and can be connected by solely mechanical links. This underwater manipulator arm represents miniaturized sampling capabilities as a key technology development for both Ocean Worlds and the Mini-Class ROV market.

More recently, however, it is also increasingly archiving and distributing complementary in situ datasets from NASA-sponsored field campaigns. Here we present an overview of these projects, the complex multivariate data they produce, and some of the data interoperability challenges faced when dealing with such a heterogeneous suite of observations. We summarize the range of online tools and services currently available via the PODAAC, including data discovery services, web-services for subsetting/extraction, compliance checking and visualization.

CARBO is a wide-swath mapping, low Earth orbit (LEO) new generation of instruments that expands on the ground-breaking CO2 and Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) measurements pioneered by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2/3) by adding CH4 and CO detection. The instrument's spatial coverage is delivered at 2 km by 2 km resolution with a field-of-view of 10 degrees to 15 degrees from LEO for a similar to 200 km wide swath. It achieves roughly 20x better spatial coverage than the OCO-2 instrument, and 3x better Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) detection sensitivity, in a smaller package. CARBO will measure CO2 at <1.5 ppm, CH4 at <7 ppb, CO at <5 ppb and SIF < 20%. The measurement of CO2/CH4/CO/SIF at these concentrations will significantly increase our ability to disentangle carbon fluxes into their constituent components. CARBO utilizes innovative immersion grating technology and enables high resolving power spectroscopy (roughly 20,000) in a smaller and lighter package that is more cost effective than current space-based CO2 remote sensing instruments. CARBO modules cover 4 different spectral ranges (from 740 nm to 2.3 mu m), where two channels will be built and field tested. CARBO's modular architecture reduces implementation risk, accelerates access to space, and extends opportunities to a more diverse set of platforms and launch vehicles. CARBO significantly improves our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Here we discuss an overview of the design elements and focus on the expected radiometric performance of channels 1 (similar to 760 nm) and 2 (similar to 1600 nm).

Approaches for creating structured datasets from unstructured web data are more easily accessible as are GPUs that deep learning frameworks can use to learn from this data. In DARPA's MEMEX effort, which sought to create better search capabilities for law enforcement to scan the deep and dark web, we are interested in leveraging the Tensorflow framework to reproduce a seminal Deep Learning facial recognition model called VGG-Face. On MEMEX we desired to build the VGG-Face model and to train feature extraction for use in prioritization of leads for possible law enforcement follow-up. We describe our efforts to recreate the VGG-Face dataset, along with our efforts to create the Deep Learning network implementation for it using Tensorflow. Though other implementations of VGG-Face on Tensorflow exist, none of them fully reproduce as much of the dataset as we do today (similar to 48% of the data still exists), nor have detailed documentation and steps for reproducing each step in the workflow. We contribute those instructions and leverage Texas Advanced Computing Center's Maverick2 supercomputer to perform the work. We report experimental results on building the dataset, and training the network to achieve a 77.99% validation accuracy on the 2,622 celebrity use case from VGG-Face. This paper can be a useful recipe in building new Tensorflow facial recognition.

In this paper we build on our prior reputation analysis work, which was based on evaluating satisfaction of transactions between agents and agent health. The evaluation was used to discount untrustworthy inputs to a Markov decision model that determines the actions taken by agents in a resilient system network. We extend our earlier work by including new health factors in the trust estimation along with a mechanism for updating each agent's belief state computation through modification of its emission probabilities.

To meet this challenge, we implemented a real-time SAR processor capable of producing 10 m imagery using an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded GPU module. With its low mass (87 g module) and power consumption under 8 W, the system also holds promise for spaceborne applications.

To address the current performance of subnational CO2 emissions modeling and identify potential sources of errors and uncertainties, this study spatially compares two downscaled gridded CO2 datasets, modeled using nighttime lights satellite (NTL) data at a spatial resolution of 1km (ODIAC), to the corresponding temporally-explicit gridded population datasets parameterized using a set of geospatial covariates not including NTL data with the same resolution for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. We do so for three countries in Southeast Asia: Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, where emissions are likely to dramatically increase over time, and the NTL might not work well as a proxy for CO2 emissions like it does in developed countries. Results highlight the discrepancies in spatial patterns between estimated CO2 emissions based on NTL data versus population distributions. The spatial differences between these data products should loosely serve as a proxy for the errors and uncertainties associated with the NTL-based downscaling. This study informs future emission modeling in practical ways to better represent subnational emissions especially with the use of advanced geospatial modeling outputs.

Instead of single pixel analysis, we generate spatial segments (i.e., superpixels) based on local image statistics to track homogeneous patches of forest across a time-series of ALOS/PALSAR images. Forest loss detection is performed with Support Vector Machines (SVMs)trained on local radar backscatter features derived within superpixels. This method is applied to time-series of ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 radar images over a boreal forest within the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve in Quebec. We evaluate four spatial arrangements including 1) single pixels, 2) square grid cells, 3) superpixels based on segmentation of the radar images, and 4) superixels derived from ancillary optical imagery (e.g. Landsat), Detection of forest loss with superpixels outperform single pixel and regular grid methods, especially when superpixels are generated from ancillary optical imagery. Results are validated with official Quebec forestry data and Hansen forest loss products. Our results indicate that this approach may be applied operationally to monitor forests across large study areas with L-band radar instruments such as ALOS/PALSAR.

The impact of coastal subsidence can affect the monitoring of sea level rise by in-situ tide gauges. The Korean peninsula is one of such areas that reported considerably rapid sea level rise than the global average in the recent years. The objective of this study is to estimate the earth's surface movements along the coastal areas of Pohang, South Korea. To achieve that, we acquired C-band Sentinel-1 data during 2016 - 2017. Time-series InSAR technique is applied to measure displacements at high-resolution with reduced decorrelation noise from interferograms. The results showed about 1.83 cm/year subsidence in the Pohang coastal area, where significant sea level rise is observed in this region. The results will provide further insight into the localized subsidence rates in the study sites and its impact on the sea level monitoring.

The extent of land subsidence can be measured by various ways and one of them is PSI technique. Guatemala City has geologically weak structure and suffered from disasters such as sinkhole and landslide. The purpose of this study was to measure wide range of relative movement in Guatemala City and to analyze obtained values. C-band Sentinel-1 A/B data during November 2014 to March 2018 were used in this study. By gathering information from both ascending and descending paths, relative movements were decomposed from line of sight of each path to vertical and horizontal component. As a result 4 regions in Guatemala City showed significant subsidence patterns with average vertical movement going down with a scale of 14 mm/year.

In quantifying polar sea ice differences to address the contrasted sea ice behaviors, two key parameters are sea ice thickness and melt pond fraction, which remain challenging to measure extensively in time and in space with a sustainable approach. Here, we present a new paradigm for such measurements using bistatic radar reflectometry, thanks to developments of low-cost receivers to acquire reflected signals from numerous existing transmitter systems operated at multiple frequencies to be replenished and sustained indefinitely into the future. For sea ice thickness measurement to determine ice volume, reflected signals likely come from the bottom ice-water interface avoiding large errors inherent in current altimetry techniques due to uncertainty in free-board height and snow cover. Regarding melt pond faction on sea ice to estimate albedo and insolation, the bistatic reflection can be dominated by melt pond water with permittivity that is one order of magnitude larger compared to that of snow or ice. These are examined by a combination of numerical Kirchhoff (KA) simulator and Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D simulations (NMM3D) to preserve phase and amplitude information and thereby account for both coherent and incoherent effects. Physical insights from the rigorous theory for bistatic radar reflectometry will be valuable to develop future satellite missions to resolve cryospheric science issues concerning the polar sea ice differences.

To address this need, we developed a concept of a remote sensing based Soil Inversion Model for regional Permafrost (SIM-P) monitoring. The current SIM-P framework includes a satellite-based soil process model and a soil dielectric model. We are also working on incorporating a radar scattering model for Arctic tundra into the SIM-P framework. A unified soil parameterization scheme was developed to harmonize key soil thermal, hydraulic and dielectric parameters in the soil process and radar models that can be used in the joint soil-radar inversion framework. The soil parameter retrievals of the SIM-P framework include soil organic content (SOC) and active layer thickness (ALT). Initial tests of SIM-P using in-situ soil permittivity observations showed reasonable accuracy in predicting site-level SOC and soil temperature profiles at an Alaska tundra site and ALT in Arctic Alaska. SIM-P will be further tested using airborne P- and L-band radar data collected during NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) to evaluate the sensitivity of longwave radar to active layer properties.

Single-look covariance samples plotted versus InSAR phase are aggregated spatially over a forest patch to form a three-dimensional histogram. To first order, InSAR backscatter histograms resemble lidar waveforms, suggesting that this type of measurement can be used as a proxy for horizontal and vertical tree structure. In this paper, we extend the formulation of the InSAR backscatter histograms to the covariance matrix and discuss possible new applications. Full-polarimetric L-band and P-band UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) data collected over Delta Junction in Alaska during the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) are used to illustrate the results. Validation is conducted with the full-waveform LVIS (Laser, Vegetation and Ice Sensor) lidar instrument. Important parameters such as the alpha and the entropy will be extracted along the tree vertical direction and illustrated in the final paper.	[Lavalle, Marco; Shiroma, Gustavo H.

P-band SoOp has the potential for spaceborne remote sensing of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) and snow water equivalent (SWE), two variables identified as priorities in the 2017-2027 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space. P-band is needed to penetrate through dense vegetation and into the root zone. SNOOPI will provide inspace validation of both the technique of P-band SoOp and a science instrument prototype. This is a necessary risk-reduction step on the path to a science mission, which will verify important assumptions about reflected signal coherence, robustness to the RFI environment, and our ability to capture and process the reflected signal from orbit. SoOp observations will be used to estimate the complex reflection coefficient over various land surface conditions. These will be used to verify models and show that P-band SoOp can meet working requirements for future RZSM and SWE missions. The SNOOPI instrument design builds upon the heritage of a low noise front end (LNFE), developed from an airborne demonstrator, and a digital back end (DBE) evolved from the Cion, TriG and Blackjack GPS receivers. Success with SNOOPI will retire the critical risks associated with a P-band SoOp satellite instrument and exit at TRL-7. Not only would this instrument enable direct measurements of RZSM and SWE which are not presently possible, it's size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) would also be orders of magnitude smaller than comparable monostatic radars due to the re-utilization of existing, powerful, anthropogenic signals.

The change in phase of the reflected signal is related to SWE for dry snow and the rate of change of phase is directly correlated to frequency of observation. The effect of vegetation was also evaluated by using measurements from two towers: one with bare soil and one surrounded by small trees with heights of up to 3 meters. SWE has been retrieved from two sites with RMSD of 1.15-1.6 cm for different frequencies and sites. In addition, sensitivity in reflectivity measurement at 260 MHz due to changes in soil moisture was observed in summer 2018 data.

SMAP REGULARIZED DUAL-CHANNEL ALGORITHM FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF SOIL MOISTURE AND VEGETATION OPTICAL DEPTH	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 28-AUG 02, 2019	Yokohama, JAPAN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc		SMAP; soil moisture retrieval; vegetation optical depth retrieval; dual-channel algorithm	L-BAND; MICROWAVE EMISSION; ROUGHNESS	The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was designed to acquire and combine L-band radar and radiometer measurements for the estimation of soil moisture (SM) with an average ubRMSE of no more than 0.04 m(3)/m(3) volumetric accuracy in the top 5 cm for vegetation with water content of less than 5 kg/m(2). Currently, a single-channel algorithm that uses the V polarized brightness temperature (SCA-V) is used to retrieve SM satisfying the defined requirements. Even though other alternatives were tested, SCA-V proved to be the best option for the retrieval of SM. In this work, we show that by choosing suitable roughness parameters, the use of two polarizations (H and V), mixed dual-channel algorithm (MDCA), and an additional constraint, regularized DCA (RDCA), not only provides retrieved SM that satisfies the aforementioned requirement but also allows for the retrieval of vegetation optical depth (VOD).

Analytically, this approach calls for nonlinear optimization in two steps. First, multiple days of co-located brightness temperature observations are used to retrieve the effective vegetation opacity, which incorporates the combined radiometric and polarization effects of surface roughness and vegetation opacity. The resulting effective vegetation opacity is then used to retrieve vegetation water content to within a gain factor alpha and an offset factor beta. By using a climatological vegetation water content ancillary database as the one adopted in the development of the SMAP standard and enhanced soil moisture products, alpha and beta can be determined globally using the annual minimum and annual maximum of vegetation water content. The resulting values of alpha and beta can then be used to reconstruct the retrieved vegetation water content. Formulation, assumptions, and limitations of this approach are presented alongside the preliminary global retrieval of vegetation water content using one year (2016) of SMAP brightness temperature observations.

The soil moisture retrieval algorithms model the brightness temperature as a function of soil moisture, surface conditions and vegetation. External data sources inform the algorithms about the surface conditions and vegetation, which enable the retrieval of soil moisture. The inversion process contains uncertainties related to radiometer measurements, forward model assumptions and ancillary data sources. This study focuses on the uncertainties that depend on the seasonal evolution of the surface conditions and vegetation. The study compares the SMAP and core validation site (CVS) soil moisture values over a period of four years to extract the evolution of performance metrics over time. The analysis showed that most CVS that include managed agriculture exhibit significant time-dependent seasonal bias. This bias was linked to seasonal temperature cycle, which is a proxy to several features that can cause seasonally dependent errors in the SMAP product.	[Colliander, A.; Chan, S. K.; Yueh, S.

Geodetic imaging measurements can be used, for example, to measure earthquakes, landslides, debris flows, wildfire extent, volcanos, and anthropogenic changes such as fluid withdrawal from aquifers. Different geodetic measurements sample different parts of the spatio-temporal deformation field. Combining the measurements and analysis improves understanding of a broad range of Earth surface processes. Here we describe a concept to Quantify Uncertainty and Kinematics of Earth Systems (QUAKES) that combines radar interferometry and optical imaging into one airborne platform and the analysis system required to analyze and model the data.

With a quick search on the web, we can find various tools that offer similar capabilities such as search, visualization, subsetting, analysis, etc. The community is very good with building domain-specific solutions for specific applications. The lack of cohesiveness among these tools introduces technology gaps, which lead to even more stovepipe solutions.

SMAP brightness temperature observations were compared with SMOS observations at 40o incidence angle. The brightness temperatures from the two missions are close to each other but SMAP observations show a warmer TB bias (about 0.64 K: V pol and 1.14 K: H pol) as compared to SMOS. SMAP and SMOS missions use different retrieval algorithms and ancillary datasets which result in further inconsistencies between their soil moisture products. The reprocessed constant-angle SMOS brightness temperatures (SMOS-SMAP) were used in the SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithm to develop a consistent multi-satellite product. The integrated product has an increased global revisit frequency (1 day) and period of record that is unattainable by either one of the satellites alone. The SMOS-SMAP soil moisture retrievals compared with in situ observations show a retrieval accuracy of less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Results from the development and validation of the integrated soil moisture product will be presented.

Instrument behavior is stable over the past 3 years and 9 months. With the concurrent calibration of the internal calibration parameters and the antenna gain after estimating reflector emissivity, the SMAP radiometer measurements exhibit 0.1 K (rms) stability and nearly zero biases over the averaged global ocean and monthly Cold Sky views. The data (version 4) was released to the public in 2018 for various science activities.

Here, we explore the joint capability of multifrequency radar observations of the terrestrial land surface through an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) case study. Specifically, we investigate the added value of temporal constraints on the carbon (C) and water (H2O) cycles through the joint use of K, C, L and P band measurements to retrieve fundamental land surface C and H2O state variables and process parameters. We use the CARbon DAta-MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) to represent the temporal evolution of C and H2O state variables and associated process inter-dependencies. Our results indicate that overall, the assimilation of 4-bands leads to substantial uncertainty reductions relative to single band experiments.	[Meyer, Victoria; Bloom, A.

We describe a previously unexploited source of Venus topography with intermediate spatial resolution and elevation accuracy to the aforementioned sources thereby extending the available Venus topographic data that uses intra-Cycle stereo observation between adjacent orbit pairs as a source of topographic data.

High-resolution single-look phase and phase-height histograms weighted by backscatter intensity are projected in the elevation direction and are combined in the range and azimuth directions to form a three-dimensional backscatter-phase histogram. Profiles of the resulting histograms resemble forest reflectivity. Higher ground backscatter is observed in the P-HH compared to the P-HV profile, in agreement with scattering models. Results suggest that the peak of the difference between the normalized P-HH and P-HV profiles can be used as an estimator for the terrain elevation from a model-free approach. We qualitatively compare the results to traditional P-band interferometry and polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) random-volume over ground (RVoG) three-stage approach over five different baselines 20m, 65m, 80m, 100m, and 145m.

LIVE FUEL MOISTURE ESTIMATION USING SMAP SOIL MOISTURE AND MODIS VEGETATION INDICES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, USA	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 28-AUG 02, 2019	Yokohama, JAPAN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc		live fuel moisture; SMAP; soil moisture; vegetation indices; Mediterranean ecosystem		Live fuel moisture (LFM) is a key fire risk indicator and is commonly used in fire behavior models. We compared eight widely used vegetation indices derived from MODIS reflectance and SMAP soil moisture on their capability to estimate LFM at 38 sites in Southern California, USA, a fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystem. Seasonality, inter-annual variability, or both were considered in our multivariate regression model construction. We found that VARI, a vegetation index calculated utilizing the reflectance from blue, green, and red bands performed the best among all remotely sensed moisture level indicators. SMAP soil moisture did not yield a good model performance mostly due to the great number of missing soil moisture retrievals in the data series. Frequency of LFM sampling also affected the model performance. The time lead of SMAP soil moisture to vegetation response can be a potential remotely-sensed predictor of LFM or an input to biophysical process model to retrieve LFM.

A METHOD FOR ASSESSING SMAP CORE VALIDATION SITE SCALING BIAS USING ENHANCED SAMPLING AND RANDOM FORESTS	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 28-AUG 02, 2019	Yokohama, JAPAN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc		SMAP; Soil Moisture; Upscaling; Random Forests	SURFACE SOIL-MOISTURE; STABILITY	In order to calibrate and validate the SMAP soil moisture products, networks of ground-based soil moisture sensors have been deployed. Measurements collected from the networks must be upscaled to the radiometer footprint scale (30-40 km) for comparison with the SMAP radiometer-based retrievals. The upscaling is typically performed as a weighted average of individual sensor measurements within the SMAP grid. Since different weighting schemes have been found to result in different upscaled soil moisture estimates, an independent method of assessing soil moisture estimation biases is needed. We therefore present a method for calculating estimation biases at each SMAP Core Validation Site (CVS). The estimation was enabled by networks of enhanced soil moisture sampling that were deployed at four CVSs for a limited time. Based on Random Forests, our method offers a straightforward, systematic, and unified approach to bias estimation across a variety of sites. The method was applied to estimate biases at the four SMAP CVSs.

The commonly used vegetation models are distorted Born Approximation (DBA) and Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). We recently developed Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D (NMM3D) full wave simulations of vegetation/forests. The results of NMM3D show much larger transmission than that of RTE/DBA. A much larger transmission of NMM3D means microwave emission from soil can reach the radiometer, which is different from the conclusion for microwave remote sensing of soil moisture based on RTE and DBA. In this paper, we implement NMM3D based on the scattered field formulation of Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations (FL). The novelty of this method is that the 3D cylindrical vector wave expansions are used in FL. The correctness of the method is verified. We implement the method on parallel computation using a large number of tall cylinders.

We introduce a cyclone wind speed retrieval algorithm and apply it to the limited SMAP SAR dataset of cyclones. We show that the SMAP SAR instrument is capable of detecting extreme winds up to the category 5 wind speed regime providing unique capabilities as compared to traditional scatterometer with C and Ku-band radars.

We analyzed the differences between three SSS products (SMAP from JPL and RSS, and SMOS from BEC), and assessed in the context of seasonal and inter-annual variation of the freshwater contents, considering river runoffs, sea ice changes, and surface forcing ( P-E). We found SMAP JPL (V4.2) shows reasonable responses to the freshwater inputs which is dominated by the sea ice change particularly early in the melting season. This result demonstrates the potential of currently available L-band missions in monitoring cryospheric changes; also underscore urgent needs of in situ salinity measurements in the region to improve retrieval algorithms.

Hence, the Arctic Ocean sea surface salinity (SSS) knowledge is crucial to describe some of the processes that govern climate change. Recently, Barcelona Expert Center (BEC) deployed their version 2 of SSS Arctic data retrieved from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) mission. Nevertheless, in the context of the ESA Arctic+ initiative, BEC has planned to introduce improvements in all the processing levels. Some of the planned improvements include: (i) optimizing the projection grid of level 1, (ii) studying the performance of different dielectric models in the Artic region and (iii) producing an additional level 4 product. The SSS Arctic products from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission could be used to produce a level 4 by merging them with this new version of SSS level 3 produced from SMOS. Big data techniques are applied to produce debiased SSS maps. These techniques will be refined by introducing a new grouping method for the statistical study of the data. The aim of this work is to obtain a more accurate version of the Arctic salinity maps starting at 2011. The new SMOS SSS maps are expected to better capture the Arctic river plumes and thus they will help to better understand the freshwater inflow/outflow in the Arctic Ocean.

The main benefit follows through the extension of the trade space and the use of new digital beam-forming techniques facilitated through the multi-channel instrument architecture. This is truly a quantum leap as the performance of these systems will be orders of magnitude better than current in-orbit and state-of-the art systems. One of the basic restrictions applicable to spaceborne platforms hosting both the transmitter and receiver is the "blinding" of the receiver during the transmit time instances, which manifests itself through imaging gaps. One of the main challenges the instrument designers are faced with, is to circumvent these gaps, requiring the use of dedicated instrument operation modes. An alternative approach is multi-beam imaging, i.e. to allow the gaps in the single SAR acquisition, while using an appropriate mission design for filling the blind gaps. This paper explores the trade space options for high-resolution wideswath SAR imaging. The comparison of multi-beam and gapless imaging from an instrument design and performance point of view is elaborated.

An alternative for continuous swath coverage is to employ staggered SAR operation, i.e., to vary the pulse repetition intervals over time. In this way, the blocked (missing) samples are spread in range and azimuth and can be interpolated prior to focusing. However, the relatively low azimuth oversampling intended for NISAR in combination with the strong non-uniformity of the staggered data grid forbids the use of conventional interpolation kernels. This paper discusses a processing approach for the NISAR staggered data and validates the strategy with simulated data. Moreover, the impact of the staggered operation for contrast-based and interferometric applications is discussed with examples.

The goal of the study is to define an observing system that would meet the recommendations of the 2017 US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Decadal Survey [1] for developing an affordable synthetic aperture radar-based system or systems that can address fundamental scientific questions about the nature of hazards, disasters, landscape change, and serve applications communities as well. The study is to consider the existing international constellation of SAR systems, both civil and commercial, as well as new technologies that could be employed to address scientific and applications objectives and to improve affordability. The study will be conducted in four phases: 1) expanding the architectural trade space; 2) assessing the science and applications value of each identified architecture; 3) down selecting to three final candidates and performing detailed assessments; 4) final reporting and preparation for mission founulation. The first phase is approximately 2 years in duration, and will concentrate on the scope of research and application areas to be addressed, defining the possible architectures to consider, and beginning the assessment of their performance. The study team comprises five NASA centers. Broad participation from the research, applications, technology, and commercial sectors is planned.

Out of all disciplines that are encompassed by the NISAR mission, ecosystems are the one in most need of prelaunch proxy data, consisting of repeated L-band observations over an extended period of time. The solid earth, cryosphere, and hazards research communities have been able to use historical and contemporary spaceborne data available from ERS1/2, Radarsat, TerraSAR, Sentinel -1, and others for developing and evaluating products similar to what NISAR would be able to provide. This has been possible, in part, because of the focus of these disciplines on sparsely vegetated surfaces and the fairly straight -forward correspondence of surface scattering properties at both L- and C -band (wavelength of 24 cm and 5 cm respectively). Time series data from L-band sensors of value for ecosystem science disciplines, in contrast, have been sporadic and irregular. Ecosystems targets are almost always vegetated, with the scattering components and volume scattering nature of the target giving different scattering responses at the different wavelength regimes. For this reason, the use of C -band observations as a proxy for NISAR' s L-band, as is often done for other disciplines, is not possible for the development and testing of NISAR algorithms. In 2018, a plan was developed for a field/airborne/spaceborne campaign to acquire data in 2019 for NISAR pre -launch ecosystem algorithm development and for evaluation of NISAR ecosystem Cal/Val protocols. This plan includes the acquisition of not just L-band SAR data from the NASA/JPL UAVSAR airborne SAR, but also the acquisition of spaceborne data, airborne data, and field measurements to fully exercise the NISAR protocols for validation of its ecosystem science measurement requirements. Included in the plan is the processing of the field, airborne, and spaceborne data into validation products and the generation of NISAR-like level 3 science products.

It has been recognized that GNSS-R could be utilized for monitoring the global surface water distribution by making dynamic maps of wetlands as well as rapid response to flood events. Using the strength of the reflected signals, one can make maps that reveal the presence of water over land. In this paper, we used simulations to analyze the accuracy of these maps. The CYGNSS End -to -end Simulator (E2ES) was extended to include coherent scattering in the heterogeneous scenes where the region around the specular point is composed of both land and water in complex geometries. The simulation is then used to evaluate the accuracy of a simple fractional water in foolprinl approach to mapping wetland extent. We find that scattering from outside the first Eresnel zone and CYGNSS measurement processing effects significantly impact the accuracy of this approach. However, the accuracy can be improved by combining multiple measurements into a gridded map.

Although CYGNSS is not intended or optimized for altimetry, creation of a research product will allow assessment at the synoptic level over the life of the CYGNSS mission.

The CYGNSS Level 1 data is processed using a modified CYGNSS End-to-end Simulator (E2ES) which provides a full-forward-model waveform fit (along both delay and Doppler space) and precise delay retrieval. The delay is converted into estimated sea surface height (SSH) using auxiliary data sources for corrections, such as ionospheric, tropospheric, tidal, orbital and instrument. The resulting data product will enable thorough characterization of altimetry accuracy and remaining error sources.

This compelling new science mission will attempt to answer the question "Why is the Arctic warming faster than the rest of the planet?" by filling an important gap in our knowledge of energy flows in Polar Regions. PREFIRE will fly a pair of small CubeSat satellites to probe a little-studied portion of the radiant energy emitted by Earth for clues about Arctic warming, sea ice loss and ice-sheet melting. Two miniaturized Thermal Infrared Spectrometers (TIRS) on two CubeSat satellites, are based on technology previously flown on the Mars Climate Sounder, an instrument on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The CubeSats will orbit Earth's poles to measure far-infrared emissions and how they change throughout the day and over seasons. By building, characterizing, and operating, TIRS payloads in two different polar orbits, the PREFIRE mission has potential impact on NASA in these focus areas through (1) Quantification of the influence of variable surface conditions on Arctic and Antarctic thermal emission, (2) Estimation of the impact of atmospheric constituents on the polar greenhouse effect, and, (3) Determination of the impacts of variations in far-infrared emissivity and greenhouse effect on ice sheet melt and sea level rise. The observations will allow scientists to assess how changes in thermal infrared emissions at the top of Earth's atmosphere are related to changes in cloud cover and surface conditions below. Incorporation of PREFIRE measurements into current ice sheet process models and global climate models is expected to improve confidence in predictions of global climate changes that impact environmental and national security.

These observations may also help to reduce the uncertainty of global climate models. The Tropospheric Water and Cloud Ice (TWICE) microwave radiometer instrument has been designed to perform temperature and humidity sounding of the atmosphere near the 118.75, 183.31 and 380.20 GHz atmospheric absorption lines, as well as to retrieve ice cloud particle size information from radiometric measurements at 240, 310, 670 and 850 GHz. To acquire high-quality data, the TWICE instrument performs end-to-end, on-orbit calibration of all radiometer channels during each scan. The TWICE instrument is designed to fit within the mass, volume and power constraints of the 6U CubeSat platform.

However, the coherence-based method becomes less reliable for pixels having low coherence and amplitude-based method is in general less sensitive to the damage than coherence-based method. This paper presents an approach to damage proxy maps by jointly utilizing the interferometric coherence and amplitude information acquired from multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar images to complement their weakness. This technique is evaluated for the landslides triggered by the M6.7 Hokkaido earthquake on September, 6, 2018 in Japan. The experimental results demonstrate the benefit of the hybrid technique showing better performance than individual approaches.

Here, we show with synthetic data and our experimental results of passive radar testing with the Sun at Dante's View, Death Valley, our approach to implementing two dimensional image formation with passive radar. We also determine the critical signal to noise ratio (SNR) required to reliably observe a Sun echo with our passive instrument. Finally, we show that our autocorrelation-based technique can obtain changes in range, reflectivity, and phase, which are measurements normally acquired with traditional active radar systems. Demonstrating that our technique can acquire these changes is the first step to developing passive SAR processing using the Sun.

Next Generation Imaging Spectrometers Enabled by Advanced Detectors for Earth Science/Applications as well as Solar System Exploration	2019 IEEE PHOTONICS CONFERENCE (IPC)	IEEE Photonics Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Photonics Conference (IPC)	SEP 29-OCT 03, 2019	San Antonio, TX	IEEE				Spectroscopy is a powerful analytical method based in the interaction of light with matter that is used to test hypotheses across a broad range of scientific disciplines as well as for quantitative applications. In the late 1970's the concept for a new type of instrument that measured spectra for every point in an image was conceived and proposed using the most advanced infrared detector array available at the time. The Airborne Imaging Spectrometer first flew in 1982. New discoveries were made with the first flights of this instrument. Since that time increasingly advanced airborne and space imaging spectrometers have been developed and deployed for science and applications on Earth and for exploration throughout the solar system. This paper presents recent imaging spectrometer instrument developments and results as well as examples of new instrument architectures enabled by next generation detectors. These new designs support spatial measurement scales from 50 microns to 1 kilometer with full spectroscopy for range of new Earth and solar system missions and are expected to be deployed in the coming decade and beyond.

Using a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor, a lander scans the landing site and constructs a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in real-time during descent. This DEM is processed by hazard detection algorithms to construct a safety cost map and determine the safest landing location. The target location is then provided to the guidance and control system to execute a hazard avoidance divert maneuver. We derived requirements on the DEM quality and accuracy from the proposed Europa Lander Deorbit, Descent, and Landing (DDL) concept of operations and the lander hazard tolerance. A modular geometric LIDAR modeling tool and re-gridding algorithms were developed and integrated into a high-fidelity 6-DOF dynamics simulation. The modular nature of the model allows us to simulate various detector aspect ratios, laser pulse repetition rates, scan mechanisms, optical designs, and basic error models. This tool was developed to support the parametric sensitivity analysis of the DEM quality with respect to the LIDAR design, site topography, scanning pattern, noise properties, and navigation state knowledge errors, and to evaluate the generated DEMs against the Europa Lander requirements.

DEMONSTRATION OF STEREO VISION FOR DEORBIT DESCENT AND LANDING	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2019	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	FEB 06, 2019	Rocky Mtn Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	Rocky Mtn Sect			Planetary landers need to reduce velocity at low altitude for soft landing. Traditionally, estimating velocity and altitude has been performed with radar sensors whose performance meets the specific mission needs. There are not very many options for these sensors and they are difficult to include in a flight system either due to obsolescence, prohibitive cost or difficulty in accommodation. Recently, alternative sensing modalities are being pursued including Doppler LiDAR and vision. This paper describes results from a recent helicopter field test of a binocular stereo vision system for deorbit descent and landing applications. The system consisted of two 18.6 field of view cameras mounted 1.7m apart. Post processing of the images showed ranging accuracy better than 1% up to 500m and 17 cm/s velocimetry accuracy at 37m. For a flight system these images could be input into an FPGA-based processor which processes dense stereo and visual odometry in less than 1 second to achieve the stereo ranging frame rates required for soft landing. When coupled with vision based Terrain Relative Navigation this stereo system enables landing accuracies on the order of 10m.

ARCHITECTURE OF A FAULT-TOLERANT AND VERIFIABLE OUTER PLANET FLYBY	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2019	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	FEB 06, 2019	Rocky Mtn Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	Rocky Mtn Sect			Flyby missions to outer solar system objects require a very high confidence of success since there are no second chances. The quantity, quality, and diversity of science measurements to be made in a matter of hours or days must justify the mission cost. Accordingly, the mission architecture must include a high degree of redundancy, large design margins, and an ability to correct or operate through anomalies while at the same time being deterministic enough for confidence in system verification and validation. In this paper we pre-sent a system architecture as part of a proposed mission to Triton, called "Trident". The concept includes multiple layers of insurance against one or more failures while still achieving a successful flyby. Elements of this robustness include: flyby mission design, large timing margins built into the encounter sequence, multiple redundant science observations with adequate data storage, an instrument suite providing overlapping measurements, active redundancy, and conservative GN&C design. We develop the sequence de -sign with an eye to fault management architecture to minimize interactions and avoid extra complexity. The software-controlled fault protection scope is limited to targeted failure responses during encounter at the component level where possible and at the system level only when necessary, and is enabled by an integrated system architecture that ensures robustness during critical operations. The design is intended to be easily verifiable in system test without the need to exercise a large number of permutations or interactions between fault responses.

The LRO hosts seven scientific instruments. For some instruments, it is necessary to perform large off-nadir slews to collect scientific data. The accessibility of off-nadir science targets has been limited by slew rates and/or occultation, thermal and power constraints along the standard slew path. The new fast maneuver (Fast Man) algorithm employs a slew path that autonomously avoids constraint violations while simultaneously minimizing the slew time. The FastMan algorithm will open regions of observation that were not previously feasible and improve the overall science return for LRO's extended mission. The design of an example fast maneuver for LRO's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter that reduces the slew time by nearly 40% is presented. Pre-flight, ground-test, end -to -end tests are also presented to demonstrate the readiness of FastMan. This pioneering work is extensible and has potential to improve the science data collection return of other NASA spacecraft, especially those observatories in extended mission phases where new applications are proposed to expand their utility.

SMAP SCIENCE RECOVERY EFFORTS	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2019	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	FEB 06, 2019	Rocky Mtn Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	Rocky Mtn Sect			The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) spacecraft launched in January 2015, with a mission to produce global soil moisture maps every 1.5 days using a combination of active (radar) and passive (radiometer) L-band measurements. In July 2015, after 2.5 months in operation, the radar failed and was not able to transmit. While the radiometer was still producing excellent science measurements, the need to recover key active-passive soil moisture requirements was paramount. To that end, the science team found that the European Space Agency (ESA) had recently launched a C-band SAR spacecraft called Sentinel-1A (launched April 2014) in a similar orbit, which was seen as a potential replacement to the "active" part of the SMAP measurements. An analysis was performed to see what the resulting spatial and temporal coverage could be. The promising results of that coupled with the ramp up in global coverage from Sentinel-1A and 1B (launched April 2016) allowed SMAP to create a new joint science data product that strives to meet the original mission objectives. The joint product is now part of the routine release of SMAP data to the science community as of June 2018.

THE DEEP SPACE POSITIONING SYSTEM (DPS) - NAVIGATOR CONCEPT FOR THE LUNAR GATEWAY	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2019	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	FEB 06, 2019	Rocky Mtn Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	Rocky Mtn Sect			The DPS-Navigator concept is a self-contained autonomous navigation hardware and software system that provides spacecraft on-board navigation throughout the solar system. It answers the question "where am I?" like the Global Positioning System (GPS), but without the need for the satellite infrastructure. For the lunar Gateway, DPS-Navigator would observe lunar landmarks to determine position information and compute orbital maneuvers to maintain the Gateway orbit when the crew is not present or to reduce the crew's dependence on ground-based mission control. The optical-only design is small (25 x 12 x 12 cm) and lightweight, less than 5 kg. Power requirements are less than 12 W with self-contained processing. Data link requirements (infrequent for set-up, monitoring, and maintenance) are less than 50 MB per day. DPS-Navigator leverages prior flight demonstrations of autonomous navigation (DS-1, Deep Impact, Stardust) to provide a more general and robust on-board solution. DPS-Navigator provides precise lunar landmark measurements using narrow angle field of view (FOV) optics and precise pointing knowledge using wide angle FOV optics. A more robust configuration of the DPS-Navigator uses optical and radiometric sensing. For the lunar Gateway, the optical-only version would be sufficient given the abundance of optical targets in the form of lunar surface landmarks. On-board navigation performance results using lunar landmarks are presented in this paper and shown to provide an alternative to traditional deep space network Earth-based radiometric techniques; thus, freeing Earth tracking stations and ground personnel for other support.

ADAPTATIONS OF GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION PHILOSOPHIES FOR SMALL SPACECRAFT	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2019	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	FEB 06, 2019	Rocky Mtn Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	Rocky Mtn Sect		ATTITUDE DETERMINATION	Decades of experience developing increasingly capable and more complex spacecraft have resulted in a set of accepted practices and philosophies to verify and validate (V&V) guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) subsystems. Until recently, small, low-cost spacecraft have had very simple or non-existent GN&C subsystems requiring minimal or no subsystem testing. As the next generation of small spacecraft take on more challenging GN&C requirements, the GN&C community is struggling with how to scale the subsystem V&V effort to produce spacecraft approaching the reliability of flagship-class missions while staying within the reduced resources of a small satellite project. For this paper, we will examine five aspects of GN&C V&V (requirements definition, software testing and analysis, hardware component testing, integrated vehicle testing, and in-flight V&V) and compare the V&V campaign of a flagship-class mission (Mars 2020) to that of two recent, successful CubeSat missions: ASTERIA and MarCO. Experiences from the development of these CubeSats yield valuable lessons learned and guidelines for future small spacecraft designers.

CGI is a JPL instrument and includes an imaging mode and a spectroscopic mode to perform exoplanet direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of planets and debris disks around nearby stars. In order to achieve a very tight contrast stability, it requires pointing stability of 0.7 milliarcsecond (mas) RMS over the duration of the observation. This paper discusses CGI pointing architecture and approach to achieve this level of pointing performance, and flight implementation of the pointing system. The architecture is based on nested loops to reject Line Of Sight (LOS) jitter due to one of the largest disturbances on board, the reaction wheel assembly (RWA), as well as other disturbance sources, and thermal drift. The control architecture includes spacecraft ACS, as a feedback control that uses the low-order wavefront sensing (LOWFS) camera and Fast Steering Mirror (FSM) to suppress the telescope pointing drift and jitter, and a feedforward control, that is used to reject sinusoidal tones of the RWA. The LOWFS camera uses high flux from the obscured science target to achieve high sampling rate measurements of the LOS. The FSM has a local control loop that is used to linearize the piezoelectric actuators (PZT) hysteresis. Local feedback of the PZT displacement is provided by strain gauge sensors. This paper will present various aspects of the controller design, some sensor modeling, performance simulation, and operational constraints during CGI observations to meet tight pointing requirements. Some results from our Control Analysis Simulation Testbed (CAST) will be reported.

PRECISE AND EFFICIENT FORMATION KEEPING AT EARTH-SUN L2 FOR STARSHADE MISSIONS	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2019	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd AAS Rocky Mountain Section Guidance and Control Conference	FEB 06, 2019	Rocky Mtn Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	Rocky Mtn Sect			Current starshade concepts for imaging exo-Earths would operate at the Earth-Sun L2 point and consist of a starshade flying in formation tens to hundreds of thousands of kilometers from its telescope. The starshade would need to be aligned to the meter level across the line of sight from telescope to target star. This paper reports work aimed at maturing the technology readiness level of starshade formation sensing and control for the starshade science phase, during which precision alignment is required. First, the enabling formation fine lateral sensor using pupil plane images and a formation control algorithm that provides high efficiency for science observations are presented. Then, other elements of an end-to-end starshade GNC system for the precision alignment phase are outlined: the longitudinal formation control algorithm, an RF communication link and ranging sensor, the formation estimator, and a thrust allocation algorithm. A high-fidelity simulation environment, which includes dynamics, actuator, and sensor models, is also summarized.

Fragments from the Origins of the Solar System and our Interstellar Locale (FOSSIL): A Cometary, Asteroidal, and Interstellar Dust Mission Concept	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; COSMIC DUST; ACCRETION RATE; PARTICLES; CASSINI; IMPACTS; GIOTTO; VENUS; FLUX	Deciphering the composition of interstellar, cometary, and asteroidal dust offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore the origin and evolution of our solar system. The goal of the Fragments from the Origins of the Solar System and our Interstellar Locale (FOSSIL) mission is to confirm or disprove expectations that comets deliver fragments of pristine material, that is the most carbon rich and least aqueously altered matter from the early stages of solar system formation, as opposed to asteroidal matter that is heat-treated, carbon-poor, and aqueously altered. The FOSSIL mission concept is designed to unambiguously identify, and comprehensively explore the makeup of interstellar dust particles (ISD) flowing through our solar system today, delivering matter closest to the original solid building blocks of our solar system. The FOSSIL mission concept would comprehensively survey the compositional diversity of a broad range of bodies in our solar system and beyond, returning a powerful set of measurements to test the genetic relationships between the main reservoirs of primitive materials left over from planet formation. FOSSIL would be placed in an Earth-trailing orbit, carrying four state-of-the-art Dust Telescopes (DT) pointed anti-sunward to measure impacting dust particles' mass, composition, charge, and velocity vector. This approach connects decades of ground-based radar measurements of the speeds and directions of meteors from various sources, lacking compositional information, with decades of laboratory work on meteorites' compositions, similarly lacking dynamical information that would reveal their sources. Each DT consists of a Dust Trajectory Sensor (DTS) and an impact ionization reflectron-type time-of-flight (TOF) Composition Analyzer (CA). The DT has strong heritage from instruments already flown and in development: the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) onboard Cassini, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) onboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, and the Surface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) instrument for the Europa Clipper mission. FOSSIL is a low-risk mission concept that would survey the composition of the solar system's primitive material at a cost far lower than sending probes to a representative sample of small bodies. FOSSIL would go beyond the in situ measurements from Giotto, Ulysses, Stardust, Rosetta, and Cassini, to enable a breakthrough in understanding how the fine dust from comets, asteroids, and interstellar space evolves in our solar system's largest visible structure, the Zodiacal Cloud.

The MISE design utilizes heritage from previously demonstrated instruments on airborne platforms, while advancing the state of the art to operate within Europa's challenging environment. The instrument operates at F/1.4 and covers a spectral range from 0.8 to 5 microns with 10 nm spectral sampling. Through high resolution mapping, MISE is designed to identify distributions of organics, salts, acid hydrates, water ice phases, altered silicates, radiolytic compounds, and warm thermal anomalies at global, regional, and local scales. Such distribution maps will help study surface and subsurface geologic processes, and assess the habitability of Europa's ocean. We discuss the optical specifications and baseline performance of the MISE optical design.

The NASA WFIRST mission plan includes a coronagraph instrument to demonstrate the technology needed to image and characterize exoplanets. Lyot coronagraph masks designed to serve at the focal plane followed by a Lyot stop will be key elements in the WFIRST coronagraph and in future advanced missions such as LUVOIR (Bolcar (2019) and HabEx (Morgan 2019, Martin 2019)). Shaped pupil masks designed to work in reflective geometry are also employed in the WFIRST Coronagraph. High-contrast performance reaching much better than 10(-9) contrast requires very tight design, fabrication tolerances, and material properties to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron-scale island features, ultra-low reflectivity regions, uniformity, wavefront quality, etc. In this paper, we present all the critical analytical and measured properties of materials and designs in relation to the results from our coronagraph testbeds.

However, none of these missions can image multi-star systems with current technology except when the leak and glare of the companion star(s) is negligible or small enough to be removed by post-processing. Therefore, many systems with multiple stars (or optical multiples) are often excluded from target lists of such missions. Our solution to binary star suppression is a wavefront control algorithm called Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC). In general, any region of interest where we wish to detect planets contains a mix of speckles from both stars, which are mutually incoherent. Using MSWC is possible to null speckles from both stars if the region of interest is appropriately chosen, and non-redundant modes of the Deformable Mirror are used. Feasibility of MSWC was demonstrated in computer simulations and at the Ames Coronagraph Experiment laboratory. In this paper, we report the progress towards demonstrating MSWC using the Subaru Coronagraph Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO). Our goal is to show that MSWC can achieve an order of magnitude better contrast on binary stars than conventional (i.e., single-star) techniques on binaries. Demonstrating this technique on SCExAO will validate MSWC on a real instrument proving that the technique can be applied on science instruments without major modifications.

By using deformable mirrors to create a mismatch between the incoming starlight and the fiber mode, SMFs can serve as integral parts of the light suppression ability of the coronagraph. Previous promising simulation results show increased spectral bandwidth and throughput when using SMFs in a multi-object role, and previous laboratory results have shown increased light suppression using a single SMF. We present an update on efforts to combine a multi-core SMF with a high-resolution spectrograph on the High Contrast Testbed for Segmented Telescopes (HCST) at Caltech. We present our planned experimental design, as well as simulations of expected performance when controlling multiple fiber cores on HCST. We will test the potential increase in spectral bandpass and throughput resulting from the switch to SMFs, as well as the stability of the wavefront control solution.

Towards the end of 2019, we will add a suite of new coronagraph modes as well as a high-order deformable mirror. One of these modes, operating in K-band (2.2 mu m), will be the first vortex fiber nuller to go on sky. Vortex Fiber Nulling (VFN) is a new interferometric method for suppressing starlight in order to spectroscopically characterize exoplanets at angular separations that are inaccessible with conventional coronagraph systems. A monochromatic starlight suppression of 6 x 10(-5) in 635 nm laser light has already been demonstrated on a VFN testbed in the lab. A polychromatic experiment is now underway and coupling efficiencies of < 5x10(-4) and similar to 5% have been demonstrated for the star and planet respectively in 10% bandwidth light. Here we describe those experiments, the new KPIC VFN mode, and the expected performance of this mode using realistic parameters determined from on-sky tests done during the KPIC commissioning.

Starshade starlight suppression technology is being advanced through sub-scale starshade demonstrations at the Princeton Starshade Testbed and we present here the successful completion of a technology milestone focused on the demonstration of high contrast at flight-required levels. We demonstrate 10 contrast at the inner working angle of a starshade with a flight-like Fresnel number at multiple wavelengths spanning a 10% bandpass. We show that while contrast at the inner working angle is limited by the presence of non-scalar diffraction as light propagates through narrow slits between the starshade petals, high contrast is still achieved over most of the image. Successful completion of this milestone verifies we can design a starshade capable of producing scientifically useful contrast levels.	[Harness, Anthony; Kasdin, N.

The perimeter of a starshade, known as the optical edge, has two critical functions. First, it must meet a precise in-plane profile specification to form a deep shadow in which the telescope is placed. Second, it must minimize reflected sunlight, as scattered sunlight significantly degrades the achievable contrast. Prior work on small scales and in a laboratory environment has shown that these requirements can be met using a chemically etched amorphous metal foil. This paper describes the next step of development, a first ever demonstration of assembled optical edge segments that meet both requirements simultaneously. The segments were constructed using space-compatible components and tested to relevant thermal and mechanical environments. A thorough assessment of edge performance, including in-plane profile, sunlight scatter and mechanical survivability was performed both before and after environmental testing.

We use a rejection sampling algorithm to study how uncertainty in the observation data manifests in the computed orbital parameters and how this uncertainty depends on the number and spacing of observations. We find that 3 observations equally spaced over at least one half of an orbital period robustly reduces the uncertainty in the semi-major axis and eccentricity to below 10%. We also study modifications of this revisit strategy in the presence of a central obscuration and show how null observations may still be leveraged to constrain a detected exoplanets orbital parameters. Finally, we suggest a method for incorporating photometric data into the rejection sampling framework to break degeneracy in the orbit fitting procedure and further constrain the orbital parameters.

The Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems (ECLIPS) is the coronagraph instrument on the LUVOIR Surveyor mission concept, an 8-15m segmented telescope. ECLIPS is split into three channels: UV (200 to 400 nm), optical (400 nm to 850 nm), and NIR (850 nm to 2.0 microns), with each channel equipped with two deformable mirrors for wavefront control, a suite of coronagraph masks, a low-order/out-of-band wavefront sensor, and separate science imagers and spectrographs. The Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) and the Vector Vortex Coronagraph (VVC) are the baselined mask technologies for ECLIPS to enable the required 10 contrast for observations in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Their performance depends on active wavefront sensing and control, as well as metrology subsystems to compensate for aberrations induced by segment errors (piston and tip/tilt, among others), secondary mirror misalignment, and global low-order wavefront errors. Here we present the latest results of the simulation of these effects for the two technologies and discuss the achieved contrast for exoplanet detection and characterization after closed-loop wavefront estimation and control algorithms have been applied. Finally, we show simulated observations using high-fidelity spatial and spectral input models of complete planetary systems generated with the Haystacks code framework.

Its off-axis configuration, active structural metrology, and low-disturbance pointing control provide an optimal system for coronagraphs. We present predictions of the Habex performance using a charge 6 vortex coronagraph that have been obtained using numerical modeling techniques developed for the WFIRST coronagraph. The models include realistic optical surface and polarization-induced aberrations, pointing jitter, and thermally-induced wavefront variations. Wavefront control using dual deformable mirrors is simulated to create a dark, high-contrast hole around the star. The results show that current technologies can closely approach the Habex performance goals, and with some additional development in key areas (e.g., deformable mirror surface quality, low-polarization coatings, etc.) over the next few years they should reliably meet them.

HabEx carries four instruments, a UV spectrometer/imager (UVS) together with a general purpose astrophysics camera/spectrograph (HWC) and for exoplanet work, a coronagraph and a starshade. UVS reaches down to 115 nm with resolution up to 60,000 and a 3'x3' field of view. HWC operates between 370 nm and 1800 nm, again with a 3'x3' field of view; the spectral resolution is 1000 and it carries a suite of science filters. The telescope is capable of tracking both deep space and solar system objects. The coronagraph enables observations and spectroscopy at up to R=140 with instantaneous 20% bandwidth between wavelengths of 450 and 1800 nm and is intended to be used in a survey mode. However, it also backs up most of the functionality of the accompanying starshade instrument which will have superior performance for spectroscopy. The 52 m diameter starshade flies 76,600 km from the telescope and at that range has a broadband suppression of the starlight between 300 and 1000 nm. A single observation at 108% bandwidth covers a very wide spectral band at a resolution up to 140. Both coronagraph and starshade are equipped with integral field spectrometers to enable simultaneous spectroscopy of exoplanets within the field of view. This paper details the design of the telescope, the four science instruments and associated optical systems.

The starshade perimeter has hundreds of meters of sharp edge that are directly exposed to sunlight. The sunlight diffracts and reflects from the edge resulting in a glint pattern that can be brighter than the exoplanet. We have developed models of the edge glint to explain laboratory measurements, to guide the development of edges with minimum glint, and to determine the fundamental glint floor which is set by diffraction. The models include finite difference time domain calculations, Sommerfeld's half-plane diffraction expressions, and a micro-facet scattering model. Models successfully reproduce the features and magnitude of the measured polarization-dependent scatter and show that measured edges are performing near the theoretical limit.

We use EXOSIMS to simulate design reference missions with observation scheduling to determine yield of exoplanets detected, spectrally characterized, and orbits determined. EXOSIMS performs dynamically responsive scheduling with realistic mission observing constraints on Monte Carlo universes of synthetic planets around known nearby stars. We use identical astrophysical inputs and the individual observing scenarios of each concept to evaluate a common comparison of the detection and spectral characterization yields of HabEx and LUVOIR. HabEx is evaluated for the 4m hybrid starshade and coronagraph architecture, the 4m coronagraph only architecture, and the 4 m starshade only architecture. LUVOIR is evaluated for the 8 m architecture of their final report. Yield analysis shows that both concepts can directly image and spectrally characterize earth-like planets in the habitable zone and that each concept has complementary strengths.

To aid the technology development to reach this capability and enable future exoplanet missions, we built a high contrast coronagraph testbed, titled the Decadal Survey Testbed (DST). As of early 2019, the testbed has repeatedly demonstrated a monochromatic contrast floor about 1x10(-10) and broadband performance at 550 nm with 10% color bandwidth <4x10(-10). The testbed has also demonstrated open-loop contrast drift rates of around 10(-10)/hour, temperature drift stabilities of <10 milliKelvins/day, passive pointing stability of around 0.1 lambda/D per day on the occulting mask, and rms pointing jitter around 0.005 lambda/D.

Phase I of KPIC includes a NIR pyramid wavefront sensor and a Fiber Injection Unit (FIU) to feed NIRSPEC with a single mode fiber, which have already been installed and are currently undergoing commissioning. KPIC will enable High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) of directly imaged exoplanets for the first time, providing potentially improved detection significance and spectral characterization capabilities compared to direct imaging. In favorable cases, Doppler imaging, spin measurements, and molecule mapping are also possible. This science goal drives the development of phase II of KPIC, which is scheduled to be deployed in early 2020. Phase II optimizes the system throughput and contrast using a variety of additional submodules, including a 952 element deformable mirror, phase induced amplitude apodization lenses, an atmospheric dispersion compensator, multiple coronagraphs, a Zernike wavefront sensor, and multiple science ports. A testbed is being built in the Exoplanet Technology Lab at Caltech to characterize and test the design of each of these submodules before KPIC phase II is deployed to Keck. This paper presents an overview of the design of phase II and report on results from laboratory testing.

Such deep contrast can only be achieved by means of wavefront control techniques (e.g. speckle nulling, electric field conjugation, stroke minimization and similar algorithms) where deformable mirrors correct for low and mid-frequency optical aberrations. In space, the coronagraph with wavefront control will create high contrast regions using a target star before pointing to a science star. While re-pointing the space-telescope, the surface stability of the deformable mirrors will play a very important role in maintaining the high contrast regions. In the present work, we report an optical characterization and stability analysis of micro-electro-mechanical-systems deformable mirrors for high contrast imaging using a vortex coronagraph, in vacuum to simulate space conditions. We created high contrast regions using electric field conjugation and monitored its evolution for several hours using pair-wise estimation.

As a result, dedicated exoplanet instruments are being studied for the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and the Habitable Exoplanet Imager (HabEx) mission concepts. In this paper we discuss the Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems (ECLIPS) instrument of LUVOIR. ECLIPS will be capable of providing starlight suppression levels of ten orders of magnitude over a broad range of wavelengths in order to detect and characterize the light reflected from potentially Earth-like planets. It will also allow future astronomers to study in great detail the diversity of exoplanets. First, we review the main science drivers and emphasize those that are the most stressing on the instrument design. We then present the overall parameters of the instrument (general architecture and back-end camera). We delve into the details of the static coronagraph masks, which have a significant impact on the scientific productivity of the mission. We discuss the choices the LUVOIR team made in order to maximize the discovery yield of exoEarth candidates. We then present our work on the technological feasibility of such an instrument, focusing in particular on the image stability necessary to achieve ten orders of magnitude of starlight extinction over hours of exposure. We present our error budget and show that using a combination of instrument level (low and high order wavefront sensors) and observatory level telemetry can yield an overall architecture that meets these requirements. Finally, we discuss future technology development efforts that will mature these technologies.

Directly constraining low-order aberration sensitivities in the WFIRST coronagraph design	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets IX	AUG 12-15, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE		coronagraph; high-contrast imaging; apodization; deformable mirror		To image and spectrally characterize exoplanets in the coming decades, coronagraphs are being developed for several high-contrast, space-based mission concepts. The first planned mission is the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI), which will demonstrate key coronagraphic technologies for the first time in space. Early research on WFIRST coronagraph designs focused on overcoming diffraction from the large pupil obscurations. Our latest work has been to optimize coronagraphs at the system level, making them more robust to low-order aberrations from telescope dynamics and polarization aberrations. In this paper, we show how to modify coronagraph optimization formulations to directly suppress sensitivities to low-order Zernike modes, in particular tip/tilt. We find and characterize the trade between throughput and tip/tilt sensitivity for shaped pupil Lyot coronagraphs. For coronagraph designs using deformable mirrors, we find that tip/tilt sensitivity can be improved by one to two orders of magnitude at small working angles without sacrificing any throughput. These results may help WFIRST to overcome residual pointing jitter from its reaction wheels and future large-aperture observatories to be less sensitive to resolved stellar diameters.	[Riggs, A. J.

Most of the vortex coronagraph mask development for space applications has focused on generating a polychromatic, vectorial, optical vortex using multiple layers of liquid crystal polymers. While this approach has been the most successful thus far, current fabrication processes achieve retardance errors of 0.1-1.0 degrees, which causes a nonnegligible fraction of the starlight to leak through the coronagraph. Circular polarizers are typically used to reject the stellar leakage reducing the throughput by a factor of two. Vector vortex masks also complicate wavefront control because they imprint conjugated phase ramps on the orthogonal circular polarization components, which may need to be split in order to properly sense and suppress the starlight. Scalar vortex masks can potentially circumvent these limitations by applying the same phase shift to all incident light regardless of the polarization state and thus have the potential to significantly improve the performance of vortex coronagraphs. We present scalar vortex coronagraph designs that make use of focal plane masks with multiple layers of dielectrics that (a) produce phase patterns that are relatively friendly to standard manufacturing processes and (b) achieve sufficient broadband starlight suppression, in theory, for imaging Earth-like planets with future space telescopes.

Since the field of view is within the inner working angle of most coronagraphs, nulling accesses non-transiting planets that are otherwise too close to their star for spectral characterization by other means, thereby significantly increasing the number of known exoplanets available for direct spectroscopy in the near-infrared. Furthermore, VFN targets planets on closer-in orbits which tend to have more favorable planet-to-star flux ratios in reflected light. Here, we present the theory and applications of VFN, show that the optical performance is approximately equivalent for a variety of implementations and aperture shapes, and discuss the trade-offs between throughput and engineering requirements using numerical simulations. We compare vector and scalar approaches and, finally, show that beam shaping optics may be used to significantly improve the throughput for planet light. Based on theoretical performance, we estimate the number of known planets and theoretical exoEarths accessible with a VFN instrument linked to a high-resolution spectrograph on the future Thirty Meter Telescope.

To our knowledge, the technology needed to achieve the contrast and stability has not been demonstrated as of January 2019. The science requirements for near future National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions such as James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)'s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) coronagraph and Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) are at least 10 times short. To investigate and guide the technology to reach this capability, we built a high contrast coronagraph testbed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Titled the Decadal Survey Testbed (DST), this state-of-art testbed is based on the accumulated experience of JPL's High Constrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) team. Currently, the DST hosts a Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) with an unobscured, circular pupil. The DST also has two deformable mirrors and is equipped with the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to sense and correct the dynamic wavefront disturbances. In this paper, we present up-to-date progress of the testbed demonstration. As of January 2019, we repeatedly obtain convergence below 4 x 10(-10) mean contrast with 10% broadband light centered at 550nm in a 360 degrees dark hole with a working angle between 3 lambda/D and 8 lambda/D. We show the key elements used in the testbed and the performance results with associated analysis.

The Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) dynamic testbed is used to demonstrate LOWFS/C performance together with the coronagraphs. We have demonstrated that LOWFS/C can maintain coronagraph contrast to better than 10(-8) in presence of WFIRST-like LoS and low order WFE disturbances for both Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) modes. However, in our previous tests the LoS disturbances simulated on the testbed were from the modeling of a single reaction wheel with a quasi-static wheel speed. In this paper we will describe the LOWFS/C LoS performance test in which the injected LoS disturbances are derived from all six reaction wheels on WFIRST, each with an independent varying wheel speed profile modeled for a typical coronagraph observational scenario.

This is true for the Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC), the Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) spectrograph, and the SPC wide field of view modes. For the SPC spectrograph, we have found via modeling and simulations that a focal plane mask (FPM) with an elliptical phase dimple can reduce the LOWFS errors significantly compared to the conventional, circular phase dimple. For HLC designs, we concurrently optimized the FPM parameters and deformable mirror shapes using our open-source software toolbox, the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO). This process resulted in new FPMs with non-uniform central-area phase modulation. We have found in numerical simulations that such FPMs still provide sufficient LOWFS performance. In this paper, we will present the LOWFS performance for several new HLC and SPC FPM designs.	[Sidick, Erkin; Riggs, A. J.

The majority of nearby FGK stars are located in multi-star systems, including the Alpha Centauri stars, which may represent the best quality targets available for spectroscopic characterization due to their proximity and brightness. However, a binary system exhibits additional leakage from the off-axis companion star that may be brighter than the target exoplanet. Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is a wavefront-control technique that allows the simultaneous suppression of starlight from both stars in a binary system. MSWC would thus enable direct imaging of circumstellar planets in binary star systems such as Alpha Centauri. MSWC is compatible with a wide suite of planned coronagraphic instruments for future space missions. As part of the technology demonstration efforts for MSWC, the first milestone results are presented here demonstrating (via computer simulations), high-contrast imaging capabilities of multi-star systems for several instruments including: [1] the upcoming Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and its coronagraph instrument (CGI) demonstrator, [2] the HABitable Worlds EXplorer (Habex) mission concept, [3] the segmented Large UV/Optical/IR (LUVOIR) mission concept, and [4] a small-aperture Alpha Centauri direct-imager mission concept. For each of these missions, a baseline coronagraph option planned for the mission will be adopted and instrument baseline performance will be compared for single-star wavefront control.

The conclusion of the NASA trade study in 2018 for the starshade mechanical architecture resulted in a consolidated and focused approach, which was the baseline design used for the technology plan. Recent progress has included the production of multiple prototypes including a full-scale Petal Launch Restraint & Unfurl Subsystem prototype (14m tip to tip deployed), and has included demonstrations of the design from fully stowed to deployed. A10m (full-scale) inner disk subsystem including perimeter truss and optical shield was designed, analyzed, built and tested for deployment functionality and accuracy. Lastly, a 4m long x 1.5m wide (1/2 scale x 3/4 scale) petal prototype along with shape critical components of the perimeter truss have been built and tested for thermal stability. The culmination of this work, both in the design side and the prototype side, has led to greatly improved design fidelity, and most importantly, validation of the design against the performance requirements. This provides much greater confidence in the viability of the design, and much lower risk moving forward toward technology readiness level 5, and eventually a flight mission.

The scattering is consistent with that expected due to air molecules and does not require airborne dust to explain. Rayleigh scattering limits the observable contrast at the similar to 1 x 10(-11) level at the inner working angle in the contrast images, but it limits the observable suppression at similar to 10(-9) level. We present a crude estimate of the level of scattering of starlight to be expected in a flight starshade due to zodiacal dust in the solar system and conclude that it is unlikely to be observable. We comment on whether Rayleigh scattering drives longer starshade testbeds to operate in vacuum.

A consequence of adaptive optics systems used in direct imaging is the formation of residual bright spots of star lights, called speckles, in the final image. Due to the large difference in brightness between host stars and their planets, these speckles can easily obscure potential exoplanets. In a previous demonstration, it was shown that using monochromatic light and a fiber injection unit (FIU), simulated exoplanet light can be directed to a high-resolution spectrograph. The method had speckle suppression that exceeding conventional image-based speckle nulling. With a previous Kalman filter estimator implementation, we found that with the implementation of the algorithm, speckle suppression was even more stable and outperformed traditional speckle nulling. In this update to the estimator, progress has been made in terms of a new filter design, and better estimates of the physical parameters in the laboratory, resulting in a higher speckle nulling performance.

WFIRST Phase B HLC Occulter Mask Baselining And Testbed WFC Performance Validation	TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR DETECTION OF EXOPLANETS IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Techniques and Instrumentation for Detection of Exoplanets IX	AUG 12-15, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Hybrid Lyot coronagraph; occulter mask; occulter fabrication error tolerance; wavefront control; coronagraph modeling; model validation; exoplanets; WFIRST; high contrast imaging		Occulter mask fabrication for Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) at JPL is a relatively mature technology as past successful testbed demonstrations can attest. Nevertheless, as NASA's WFIRST mission moved into Phase B, new mask design space and fabrication process were explored for new requirements and for better performances for the CoronaGraph Instrument (CGI). To minimize the risks associated with the new explorations, CGI modeling team is tasked with assessing the viability of new designs. In this paper, we describe our HLC modeling effort and results, which identified the potential risks with early exploratory designs and modified fabrication processes. As a result, the traditional (proven) style design is kept for risk aversion. Along the way a standard procedure has been developed for systematic mask evaluation, mask baselining, and general flight performance prediction. In the second part, we describe our model validation effort for the chosen baseline mask's testbed performance. The focus of the testbed demonstration is to address a major concern related to the CGI's limited time for wavefront control (WFC) in flight. It includes two stages of WFC: ground seed generation WFC, and (simulated) in-orbit commissioning phase WFC. Good agreements have been achieved in both stages of WFC which affirms that the CGI is capable of digging a dark hole that meets raw contrast requirement within the required time allocation. It also represents a significant improvement in our HLC WFC modeling for an as-built real system.

In addition, these missions must be able to communicate around the clock, including when the spacecraft is near the Sun. This is especially true for crewed missions. Optical communication can solve these problems, and also offers the promise of being more compact and using less power and mass. Traditional deep space optical communication concepts require large diameter telescopes (>8m) to collect enough photons to provide adequate signal-to-noise ratio. Systems operating during the day will experience strong turbulence which results in large point spread functions. This necessitates photon counting detectors with a large field-of-view which are difficult to build. The large field-of-view also lets in excessive sky background which degrades the communication performance. Adaptive optics (AO) can mitigate this degradation by concentrating the light and thus not needing a large field of view. We present an AO system architecture capable of operating in the daytime and requiring only moderate performance. We present the architecture along with performance predictions of the system for different size telescopes. Finally we include a technology gap list, which will guide future development of the component technologies.	[Roberts, Lewis C., Jr.; Meeker, Seth; Piazzolla, Sabino; Shelton, J.

Future small satellite missions will present even more challenges for LWIR FPAs, as operating temperature must be increased so that cooler (and radiator) volume, mass, and power can be reduced. To address this critical need, we are working on following three technologies. 1) Type-II superlattice (T2SL) barrier infrared detector (BIRD), which combines the high operability, spatial uniformity, temporal stability, scalability, producibility, and affordability advantages of the quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) FPA with the better quantum efficiency and dark current characteristics. A mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) T2SL BIRD FPA is a key demonstration technology in the (6U) CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) funded under the ESTO InVEST Program. A LWIR T2SL BIRD FPA is also being developed under the ESTO SLI-T Program for future thermal infrared (TIR) land imaging needs. 2) The resonator pixel technology, which uses nanophotonics light trapping techniques to achieve strong absorption in a small detector absorber volume, thereby enabling enhanced QE and/or reduced dark current. 3) High dynamic range 3D Readout IC (3D-ROIC), which integrates a digital reset counter with a conventional analog ROIC to provide a much higher effective well capacity than previously achievable. The resulting longer integration times are especially beneficial for high flux/dark current LWIR applications as they can improve signal-to-noise ratio and/or increase the operating temperature. By combining the aforementioned technologies, this project seeks to demonstrate a cost-effective, high-performance LWIR FPA technology with significantly higher operating temperature and sensitivity than previously attainable, and with the flexibility to meet a variety of Earth Science TIR measurement needs, particularly the special requirements of small satellite missions.

This work presents an unprecedented mechanoreceptor-like neuromorphic tactile sensor implemented with fiber optic sensing technologies. A robotic gripper was sensorized using soft and flexible tactile sensors based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) transducers and a neuro-bio-inspired model to extract tactile features. The FBGs connected to the neuron model emulated biological mechanoreceptors in encoding tactile information by means of spikes. This conversion of inflowing tactile information into event-based spikes has an advantage of reduced bandwidth requirements to allow communication between sensing and computational subsystems of robots. The outputs of the sensor were converted into spiking on-off events by means of an architecture implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and applied to robotic manipulation tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of such information encoding strategy. Different tasks were performed with the objective to grant fine manipulation abilities using the features extracted from the grasped objects (i.e., size and hardness). This is envisioned to be a futuristic sensor technology combining two promising technologies: optical and neuromorphic sensing.

The instrument utilizes a polarization grating to perform polarimetric beam splitting and spectral dispersion simultaneously. It can operate either with a focal plane slit to reduce sky background or in a slitless mode. Four different spectra sampling four linear polarization angles are recorded in the focal plane, allowing the instrument to measure all linear polarization states in one exposure. The instrument has been on-sky since February 2017 and we found that the systematic errors, likely arising from flat fielding and gravity effects on the instrument, limit our accuracy to similar to 1%. These systematic effects were slowly varying, and hence could be removed with a polarimetric modulator. A half-wave plate modulator and a linear polarizer were installed in front of WIRC+Pol in March 2019. The modulator worked as expected, allowing us to measure and remove all instrumental polarization we previously observed. The deepest integration on a bright point source (J = 7.689, unpolarized star HD65970) demonstrated uncertainties in q and u of 0.03% per spectral channel, consistent with the photon noise limit. Observations of fainter sources showed that the instrument could reach the photon noise limit for observations in the slitless mode. For observations in slit, the uncertainties were still a factor of few above the photon noise limit, likely due to slit loss.

The flight spare three-channel grating spectrometer instrument built for OCO-2 has been adapted for use on the International Space Station (ISS) as OCO-3 by modifying the entrance optics, using a new calibrator assembly, incorporating a two-axis pointing mirror assembly (PMA), and adding two context cameras. The ISS' precessing orbit allows measurements to be collected from dawn to dusk in the equatorial to northern & southern mid-latitude regions and the PMA enables a new snapshot area mapping mode where similar to 80 km x similar to 80 km areas can be examined in more detail. The OCO-3 payload underwent an extensive ground test and calibration program in a 3 m diameter thermal vacuum chamber. The chamber has a port/window that allowed optical ground support equipment, including a heliostat, to illuminate the instrument under operating environmental conditions. The payload's performance in space during the in-orbit checkout (IOC) period compares favorably with ground test results. Initial and not-yet-fully-calibrated retrieved estimates of the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (X-CO2) are reasonable when compared to ground-based measurements. SIF estimates show clear contrast between areas of high and low vegetation. There is high confidence that the three-year prime mission will deliver the data needed for science/research, data applications, and informed decision-making.

Future small satellite missions will present even more challenges for infrared FPAs, as operating temperature must be increased so that cooler (and radiator) volume, mass, and power can be reduced. To address this critical need, we are working on following three technologies. 1) Type-II superlattice (T2SL) nBn type barrier infrared detector, which combines the high operability, spatial uniformity, temporal stability, scalability, producibility, and affordability advantages of III-V detectors. 2) The resonator pixel technology, which uses metasurface light trapping techniques to achieve strong absorption in a small detector absorber volume, thereby enabling enhanced QE and/or reduced dark current. 3) High dynamic range 3D Readout IC (3D-ROIC), which integrates a digital reset counter with a conventional analog ROIC to provide a much higher effective well capacity than previously achievable. The resulting longer integration times are especially beneficial for high flux/dark current LWIR applications as they can improve signal-to-noise ratio and/or increase the operating temperature. By combining these three technologies, this project seeks to demonstrate a cost-effective, high-performance LWIR FPA technology with significantly higher operating temperature and sensitivity than previously attainable, and with the flexibility to meet a variety of Earth Science TIR measurement needs, particularly the special requirements of small satellite missions.

Determining the dynamics and coupling of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere by vector magnetic field measurements at all altitudes is essential, as the field plays a major role in controlling the distribution of ionospheric plasma. It is difficult to measure the magnetic B-field, either locally or globally, at the altitudes of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (UMLT) where the transfer of energy and momentum between the plasma and neutral components of the system occur. The 118-GHz imaging magnetometer will measure all four Stokes parameters as a function of frequency about the Zeeman-split center of the 118-GHz molecular oxygen line. We are developing an array of fully-polarimetric millimeter-wave radiometer/spectrometers operating near 118 GHz. These low cost, low power, low mass polarimetric 118 GHz millimeter-wave array receivers do not require cooling to meet the sensitivity requirements. With digital spectrometers we will be able to integrate the complete end-to-end system. This work will enable a second generation small satellite mission with an off-nadir viewing instrument comprised of 120 such receivers (arranged so that each spot on the Earth is observed simultaneously by four receivers each) that will globally map the magnetic field in the mesosphere at 42-76 km altitude at a horizontal resolution similar to 100 km with 1-sigma error of 40-120 nT, in typical mesospheric temperature conditions.

In many applications, such as laser communications terminals, synthesizing such controllers is challenging due to the non-stationary nature of the disturbance statistics over long periods. We present initial experimental results using a new, multichannel, adaptive control algorithm applied on the Integrated Optical System, an extreme AO system under development for the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration. The adaptive controller implicitly tracks disturbance statistics, and provides broadband wavefront control without the need for open loop downtime. The results illustrate the improved disturbance rejection capabilities of the controller compared to a traditional integrator, even when the exogenous disturbance statistics evolve.

FIREBall-2's first launch, on September 22nd 2018 out of Ft. Sumner, NM, was abruptly cut short due to a hole that developed in the balloon. FIREBall-2 was unable to observe above its minimum require altitude (25 km; nominal: 32 km) for its shortest required time (2 hours; nominal: 8+ hours). The shape of the deflated balloon, as well as a concurrent full moon close to our observed target field, revealed a severe, off-axis scattered light path directly to the UV science detector. Additional damage to FB-2 added complications to the ongoing effort to prepare FB-2 for a quick re-floght. Upon landing, several mirrors in the optical chain, including the two large telescope mirrors, were damaged, resulting in chunks of material broken off the sides and reflecting surfaces. The magnifying optical element, called the focal corrector, was discovered to be misaligned beyond tolerance after the 2018 flight, with one of its two mirrors damaged from the landing impact. We describe the steps taken thus far to mitigate the damage to the optics, as well as procedures and results from the ongoing efforts to re-align the focal corrector and spectrograph optics. We report the throughput of the spectrograph before and after the 2018 flight and plans for improving it. Finally, we describe several methods by which we address the scattered light issues seen from FIREBall-2's 2018 campaign and present the current status of FB-2 to fly during the summer campaign in Palestine, TX in 2020.

ARs are found to affect Korea most heavily in the warm season with minimal impacts in winter. This contrasts the AR effects in the western North America and the Western Europe that are affected most in winters. Significant portions of precipitation in Korea are associated with AR landfalls for all seasons; over 35% (25%) of the summer (winter) rainfall in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. The percentage of AR precipitation over Korea decreases rapidly towards the north. AR landfalls are also associated with heavier-than-normal precipitation events for all seasons. AR landfalls are associated with above-normal temperatures in Korea; the warm anomalies increase towards the north. The warm anomalies during AR landfalls are primarily related to the reduction in cold episodes as the AR landfalls in Korea are accompanied by anomalous southerlies/southwesterlies.

A New, Hand-Held, 1 to 5 m Standoff Analyzer for Real-Time Detection of Trace Chemical, Biological, and Explosives Substances on Surfaces	CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND EXPLOSIVES (CBRNE) SENSING XX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	20th Conference on Chemical Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) Sensing held at SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing Conference	APR 15-17, 2019	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		standoff; hand-held; deep UV Raman; native fluorescence; chemical; biological; explosives; detection; classification		Real-time assessment of suspicious substances on surfaces is an important capability needed by warfighters/first responders. It is also important to perform these assessments without contact or spreading of the suspicious substance or use of reagents. We present work conducted under DTRA and Army funding to develop a hand-held, 1 m to 5 m standoff, optical sensor which detects and classifies trace and bulk concentrations of a wide range of chemical, biological, and explosives (CBE) materials in real-time and full daylight with a fully integrated analyzer weighing less than 12 pounds, including batteries. The sensor method described here combines the complementary chemical information of molecular bonds using Raman and the electronic configuration information using fluorescence, with excitation below 250 nm. There are six main advantages of excitation below 250 nm compared to near-UV, visible or near-IR counterparts: 1) Solar blind detection enabling standoff operation in full daylight; 2) Fluorescence-free Raman and Raman-free fluorescence enabling enhanced detection and identification of target materials without mutual interference; 3) Resonance Raman signal enhancement for improved Raman sensitivity; 4) Simplification of Raman spectra due to resonance enhancement, 5) Short penetration depth, providing physical separation of surface contaminant materials from substrate; and 6) Eye retina safe. These detection capabilities are not possible with near UV, visible, or near IR sensors. A special feature of our sensor is the ability to detect trace biological materials at standoff distances in real time. Photon Systems and JPL have developed these methods over many years, enabling instruments deployed to extreme environments on Earth and an upcoming lander mission to Mars in 2020.	[Hug, W.

Such an analysis is straightforward and can easily be implemented at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies using simple point-scatter targets. However, it poses significant challenges at submillimeter-wave (or THz) frequencies due to the strong scattering response of secondary objects that are used to align the PSF targets for imaging at these frequencies. As a result, the reconstructed PSF patterns suffer from artifacts caused by the secondary objects present in the background. In this work, we present the use of the acoustic levitation principle to obtain the PSF characterization of a 340 GHz stand-off imaging radar. We show that using a water droplet acoustically levitated at the focal point of the 340 GHz imaging radar, high-fidelity PSF characterization of the radar is achieved, revealing the resolution limits of the radar while exhibiting good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The development of a process to generate synthetic objects and scenes using 3D graphics software is presented. By programming the path and environment in a 3D graphical engine, complex objects and scenes can be generated for the purpose of training and testing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model in specific vision tasks. An automatic process has been developed to label and segment objects in synthetic images and generate their corresponding ground truth files. Performances of DNNs trained with synthetic data have been shown to outperform DNNs trained with real data.

Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important because a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously for 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human eye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston and fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system that supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person overboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural networks to reduce detection time to detect small targets. We compared the performance between the auto-detection system and the human eye. Our system detected the target within 8 seconds, but the human eye detected the target within 25 seconds. Our systems also used synthetic data generation and data augmentation techniques to improve target detection accuracy. This solution may help the search and rescue operations of the first responders in a timely manner.

Object recognition and segmentation based on a neural network using IR images provide more accuracy and insight than color visible images. But the bottleneck is the amount of relevant IR images for training. It is difficult to collect real-world IR images for special purposes, including space exploration, military and fire-fighting applications. To solve this problem, we created color visible and IR images using a Unity-based 3D game editor. These synthetically generated color visible and IR images were used to train cycle consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) to convert visible images to IR images. CycleGAN has the advantage that it does not require precisely matching visible and IR pairs for transformation training. In this study, we discovered that additional synthetic data can help improve CycleGAN performance. Neural network training using real data (N = 20) performed more accurate transformations than training using real (N = 10) and synthetic (N = 10) data combinations. The result indicates that the synthetic data cannot exceed the quality of the real data. Neural network training using real (N = 10) and synthetic (N = 100) data combinations showed almost the same performance as training using real data (N = 20). At least 10 times more synthetic data than real data is required to achieve the same performance. In summary, CycleGAN is used with synthetic data to improve the IR image conversion performance of visible images.

The same laser-based links could also be used for interplanetary navigation. Two main optical tracking types could be used for this purpose. The first is optical ranging that uses active optical systems at both ends of the link, as opposed to passive systems. The second is optical astrometry, where a telescope images the spacecraft laser against a star background and thereby resolves plane-of-sky position. These data types offer similar capabilities to the radiometric techniques used for current interplanetary missions. These missions have a variety of objectives and requirements, which impacts trajectory determination and the necessary data types. This paper discusses the formulation of the data types and their success in meeting mission requirements for two mission scenarios: a network of spacecraft in orbit about Mars and a spacecraft in a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point.

In this study, we show that images of natural satellites can be used to navigate during approach and tour phases around the gas giants. We investigate the Jupiter and Saturn systems here, and specifically assess the performance of optical-only navigation for the Juno, Europa Clipper, and Cassini trajectories. Early approach phases and tours at Jupiter would require radiometric data to navigate, but the performance of optical-only data rivals the as-flown performance for Cassini at Saturn.

The measurements set is designed to confirm the existence of a subsurface liquid ocean and characterize the thickness of its ice shell. The tour phase of the current mission plan consists of forty-six low altitude Europa science fly-bys. Sufficiently accurate predicted and reconstructed spacecraft orbit determination (OD) is needed to support spacecraft pointing, measurement planning and interpretation of measurements. After briefly discussing expected OD capability, this paper will assess the sensitivity of OD delivery and knowledge performance for the current Europa Mission trajectory through parametric variation of a baseline tour navigation strategy.(2) Variations of several parameters are run, one at a time, to determine the impact on spacecraft ephemeris uncertainties at OD knowledge, delivery, and encounter reconstruction times. There are two basic categories of sensitivity runs considered: variations of tracking data type and amount, and variations to dynamic parameters.

The Galilean satellites provide myriad flyby opportunities to assist in the capture process. In addition, the relatively low solar range (compared to the other outer planets) and absence of significant rings add to the option space. Starting with typical single-flyby and Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) maneuver sequences, we will walk through a range of capture options, including longer post-capture tours, double flybys (and their constraints), combined with solar-electric propulsion (SEP) usage, and finally the potential benefits of retrograde, "cloudtops" orbit insertion. In combination with a AV-EGA interplanetary trajectory, the cloudtops arrival saves over 500 m/s in the capture sequence.

In its complete form, this process is formulated as a nonlinear constrained stochastic optimal control problem. This problem is among the most complex in control theory, and no practically applicable method to low-thrust trajectory optimization problems has been proposed to date. This paper presents a new algorithm to solve stochastic optimal control problems with nonlinear systems and constraints. The proposed algorithm uses the unscented transform to convert a stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic problem, which is then solved by trajectory optimization methods such as differential dynamic programming. Two numerical examples, one of which applies the proposed method to low-thrust trajectory design, illustrate that it automatically introduces margins that improve robustness. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the robustness and optimality of the solution.

A set of initial conditions required to start a tour of the rings is first determined and a flyby sequence to maximize the science observation time over desired ring regions in terms of distance, relative velocity and duration is then selected.

Launch would be in 2026 using the SLS Block-1B to accommodate the mass of the Carrier and Lander. A 2026 baseline launch offers the opportunity for a unique set of Mars gravity assists (MGAs) for both baseline and backup launch options. By exploiting MGAs during interplanetary cruise, cruise A V is reduced from 1.6 to 1.3 km/s, and the spacecraft wet mass is correspondingly reduced. Strategies to further reduce AV by modifying the Jupiter system entry sequence are explored and enable reduction of total mission A V from 2.3 to 1.875 km/s.

Recent system trades were performed after the Mission Concept Review in fall 2017, when the NASA board recommended the Europa Lander project design a Direct-to-Earth architecture, i.e. where the Lander would communicate directly to the Earth, without data relay from the carrier vehicle. Two studies in particular required an original trajectory design concept. In the first study, which considered a bi-propellant system for the lander, we designed an ultra-low-radiation endgame with separate Europa orbit insertion (EOI) and de-orbiting maneuvers for the Descent Vehicle (DOV), and a ballistic Ganymede-impact transfer for the carrier. In the second study, we analyzed trajectories to use Clipper as a data-relay spacecraft during Europa landing.

Both of these missions need to conduct science observations while coping with tight engineering constraints such as thermal and power budgets. Due to these requirements, eclipses may become a significant issue for both missions. To minimize or avoid eclipses, we introduce key design parameters for synodic resonant periodic orbits: the synodic ratio and the elongation angle between the Sun and the two primaries. By combining these parameters, we can obtain science orbits that avoid or minimize eclipses in a full ephemeris model. This approach is demonstrated for the science orbit design of both EQUULEUS and MMX.

EFFICIENT COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL LOW THRUST GRAVITY PERTURBED ORBIT TRANSFERS	SPACEFLIGHT MECHANICS 2019, VOL 168, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	29th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting	JAN 13-17, 2019	Amer Astronaut Soc, Kaanapali, HI	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm	Amer Astronaut Soc		GRADIENT-RESTORATION ALGORITHM; PICARD ITERATION METHODS; TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; ASSIST TRAJECTORIES; APPROXIMATIONS; CONVERGENCE; COLLOCATION; MARS	We have developed a new method for solving low-thrust fuel-optimal orbit transfer problems in the vicinity of a large body (planet or asteroid), considering a high-fidelity spherical harmonic gravity model. The algorithm is formulated via the indirect optimization method, leading to a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). We make use of a hyperbolic tangent smoothing law for performing continuation on the thrust magnitude to reduce the sharpness of the control switches in early iterations and thus promote convergence. The TPBVP is solved using the method of particular solutions (MPS) shooting method and Picard-Chebyshev numerical integration. Application of Picard-Chebyshev integration affords an avenue for increased efficiency that is not available with step-by-step integrators. We demonstrate that computing the particular solutions with only a low-fidelity force model greatly increases the efficiency of the algorithm while ultimately achieving near machine precision accuracy. A salient feature of the MPS is that it is parallelizable, and thus further speedups are available. It is also shown that, for near-Earth orbits and over a small number of en-route revolutions around the Earth, only the zonal perturbation terms are required in the costate equations to obtain a solution that is accurate to machine precision and optimal to engineering precision. The proposed framework can be used for trajectory design around small asteroids and also for orbit debris rendezvous and removal tasks.

The absence of a Lunar atmosphere, and hence the lack of orbital atmospheric drag, has encouraged mission designers to search for extremely low-altitude, stable, lunar orbits. In addition to the reduced amount of propellant required for station-keeping maneuvers, these orbits present great opportunities for unique scientific studies such as high resolution imaging and characterization of the polar ice deposits in deep craters. Mission planning for Lunar orbiters has historically suffered from inaccuracies, mainly due to the lack of an accurate Lunar gravity model, which resulted in severe deviations with respect to the spacecraft's nominal orbit. In 2012, JPL's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission mapped the Moon's gravity field with much improved accuracy, allowing future missions to be designed and flown with far better models. In this paper, we perform a station-keeping feasibility study for quasi-frozen, near-polar and extremely low-altitude orbits around the Moon with a high-fidelity lunar gravity model and when perturbations due to the Earth and Sun are taken into consideration. We study the trade-space between mission duration and AV budget considering impulsive maneuvers applied once every 2, 6 or 10 orbits.

The power-optimal guidance problem determines the orientation of an SSPS throughout its orbit that maximizes the amount of power transmitted to Earth. This transmitted power is a function of the relative geometry between the SSPS, the Sun, and the receiving station. Hence, it is inherently coupled to the attitude of the SSPS, i.e., the orientation that maximizes power transmission changes as the relative geometry changes. We first approximate the discretized trajectory optimization problem as a quadratic program (QP). We then solve the QP to obtain attitude trajectory designs for various orbits. These solutions highlight how maximizing transmitted power typically requires large slew maneuvers. Ultimately, by quantifying control and propellant requirements for various orbits, we emphasize how maneuver dynamics play an important role in SSPS design.

Linear approximations for propagating orbital uncertainties can lead to inaccurate estimates of the probability of an Earth collision. We present a novel fully nonlinear strategy for estimating the probability of an asteroid impact using sequential Monte Carlo layers. The method first explores a low-resolution layer to locate potentially relevant regions. Then, we conduct localized searches on deeper layers with higher resolution. The method retains the accuracy of brute-force Monte Carlo sampling while reducing the computational cost by only sampling relevant regions.

This angle defines lighting conditions and eclipse occurrences, and is then used for science observation planning. Not only is this parameter perturbed by the irregular gravity field of the body, it varies along with the body's motion around the Sun. Investigating evolution of the beta angle is therefore critical for science orbit design. This paper presents beta frozen solutions under the J2-perturbed dynamics using the averaged Lagrange Planetary Equations, and extends them to initiallyfrozen solutions by relaxing the frozen condition in order to enable more flexible mission design. The analytical work is applied to science orbit design of the Psyche mission, a recently selected mission of the NASA's Discovery Program.

This includes long-period comets (LPCs), and the newly discovered classes of Manx comets and interstellar objects (ISOs). Long-period comets are high scientific value targets, as indicated in the current Planetary Science Decadal Survey. Interstellar objects open the fascinating possibility to sample exoplanetary systems. Manxes hold the key to resolving long-time questions about the early history of our solar system. Specific strategies need to be implemented in order to approach bodies whose orbital properties are at the same time extreme and unpredictable. As ground-based telescope capabilities are greatly improving, it will soon become possible to detect LPCs more than ten years before they reach perihelion. On the other hand, the non- or weakly active Manx comets and ISOs require reactive exploration strategies. All of these bodies offer many challenges for close proximity observations that can be addressed by the deployment of multi-spacecraft architectures. We describe several concepts that leverage the many advantages offered by distributed sensors, fractionated payload, and various mother-daughter configurations to achieve high impact science within the reach of low-cost missions.

To this end, we describe an efficient method to globally search for trajectories that repeatedly fly over the same location of Europa. Different families of trajectories emerge with different flyby geometries that satisfy a convoluted set of landing constraints. Here, the landing location and local solar time must match a limited set derived from expected Clipper observations, while providing multiple opportunities to land in a given season. We include estimates for data volume and radiation dose associated with these resonant trajectories.

To deliver the lander accurately to the landing site, six trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) were planned along the reference trajectory from Earth launch to Mars entry. For the last two TCMs, there were two corresponding contingency TCMs planned that could be executed in the event that the corresponding nominal one failed. There were also twenty pre-designed menu TCMs available for execution at the time of the last contingency TCM, about 8 hours before the Mars entry, descent, and landing.

Upon investigation, the team realized that the Phoenix mission also discovered this sensitivity during its operational testing. A further investigation identified that maneuver sensitivity to real-time atmosphere updates was a result of the fact that both the EFPA and ground target were being held fixed, constraining the maneuver in a way that forced the entry time to change in order to compensate for changes to the nominal trajectory from updating the atmosphere model. The final maneuver occurs 22 hours prior to entry, at which point it is very expensive to change entry time. The study also revealed that any unguided Mars entry, descent, and landing (EDL) mission would be impacted by this sensitivity if it used real-time atmosphere observations to model the nominal expected atmosphere used for maneuver targeting of the EIP. This paper discusses the results of that investigation and presents a number of mitigations as well as the consequences of ignoring the sensitivity.

Consequently, there is a strong desire in the scientific community to perform in-situ Europa science through a landed mission. The planned Europa Clipper Mission, which would perform remote science through multiple flybys of Europa, is under development and promises to yield unprecedented insight into this intriguing body. NASA has extended the scope of the potential exploration of Europa beyond the planned Europa Clipper mission and initiated a Pre-Phase A mission concept study of a potential Europa Lander. Jupiter's hostile radiation environment and the lack of information about the moon's terrain at the scale of a lander spacecraft would require significant technology development to overcome the inherent landing challenges. This paper provides an overview of the Europa Lander mission concept and describes the significant challenges associated with landing on Europa, the technologies required to overcome those challenges, and a strategy for Deorbit, Descent, and Landing (DDL).

These overflights must be very close to each other in space. To design and maintain a low Venus orbit that enables this requires the consideration of drag, non-spherical gravity effects, and solar tides. Once the orbit is designed, the spacecraft must be navigated. To do so requires the use of radar-based terrain-relative navigation in addition to the traditional radiometric datatypes.

An affordable strategy is to use a low energy moon tour, which has natural access to the moon via the L-2 gateway. Staging around this libration point allows decoupling the approaching moon tour and the landing trajectory, which enables the option of designing each phase separately. Furthermore, a staging step frees the landing time from the capture phase, adding an additional degree of freedom. Lissajous orbits are the dynamical structures used for these staging orbits. In this paper, the possible ballistic connections between the resonances from the moon tour and Lissajous orbits are studied, including the different geometries that allow for time phasing control.

Horizon-based OPNAV methods involve image processing on the lit limb of a resolved celestial body in order to generate a bearing measurement to the body center. In recent work, the authors introduced a new horizon-based technique that combines an improved subpixel edge localization method with a non-iterative solution for spacecraft position relative to an ellipsoidal body. In this work, the performance of the new technique applied to OPNAV images of the Saturnian satellites Dione and Rhea from the Cassini spacecraft is evaluated against the ground truth mission data. Image plane centroid estimates from the new method are compared to the legacy centerfmding results produced by JPL in support of the Cassini mission, which were computed via an iterative limb-scan technique.

DS/SS radars offer much simpler range demodulation compared with FMCW or pulse compression radars, while still delivering excellent ranging performance. The demonstrated system offers 4.5 GHz of spread spectrum bandwidth leading to a range resolution of 3.3 cm. The radar is implemented in 28nm CMOS technology and consumes 614 mW.

The combiner is designed around a square cavity operating in the TM320 electromagnetic mode. Such a configuration produces a total of 6 lobes of maximum field intensity inside the cavity. By placing probes (attached to MMIC amplifier chips) in alignment with the points of maximum field strength, a highly compact power combiner can be achieved. We illustrate this concept using a set of 1 Watt W-band GaN MMIC chips, placed in layered copper sheets and oriented so the MMICs line up with the regions of maximum field strength. A 6-way power combiner was built and was able to deliver 5.5 Watts of output power and 13.4% PAE using a miniature package.

The PDS mandate was and is to ensure that the data returned by these missions are not merely preserved, but maintained and usable by subsequent investigators long after the original mission science teams have disbanded. During the intervening generations (1 human, about 5 technological), PDS has amassed a highly diverse archive and dealt with formidable issues of data file format, long-term maintenance, and metadata collection and preservation. Some design choices have stood the test of time; others that seemed obvious contemporarily have been less than satisfactory in the long term. We will present some of the successful and unsuccessful choices made early in PDS history that helped to shape the new PDS4 Archiving Standards.

The survey is to discover thousands of exoplanets near or beyond the snowline via their microlensing lightcurve signatures, enabling a Kepler-like statistical analysis of planets at similar to 1-10 AU from their host stars. Our goal is to create an automated system that has the ability to efficiently process and classify large-scale astronomical datasets that missions such as WFIRST will produce. In this paper, we discuss our framework that utilizes feature selection and parameter optimization for classification models to automatically discriminate different types of stellar variability and detect microlensing events.

Cell phones and personal computers seem like they are designed to be obsolete in 2-3 years. Automobiles seem like they are designed to have a power train failure within 1000 miles of the extended warranty expiration; at least that's been my experience. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is not any different. JPL has a tried and proven recipe for mission success because in space things can't fail. Or else. However, in today's competitive environment and funding limitations, that recipe for success is being challenged and the resultant increased risk accepted. This paper will describe JPL's Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) approach to tailoring reliability requirements based on mission classification and other project characteristics.

NASA-STD-8729.1A identifies the objectives and strategies for how to develop a system or design that is reliable and maintainable. Rather than requiring a checklist of mandatory tasks, such as specific design or Reliability & Maintainability (R&M) analyses, the standard explains objectives that need to be accomplished, and how to accomplish the objectives in the form of strategies. Currently, the standard presents the hierarchy without defining or explaining elements, or how to use the hierarchy efficiently. This is where this accompanying guideline comes into play; the guideline helps clarify through discussion and examples the standard in more detail, and how to apply it in real world situations that engineers face every day.

The use of cameras is challenged by a variety of factors, of most importance being the changes in illumination. On the other hand, since the temperature of various types of terrains depends on the thermal characteristics of the terrain, the terrain classification can be aided by utilizing the thermal information in addition to visible information. Thus we propose 'TU-Net (Two U-Net)' based on the U-Net and 'TDeepLab (Two DeepLab)' based on DeepLab, which combine visible and thermal images and train the network robust to illumination changes implicitly. To improve the network's learning capability, we expand the proposed methods to the Siamese-based method, which explicitly trains the network to be robust to illumination changes. We also investigate multiple options to fuse the visible and thermal images at at the bottom layer, middle layer, or the top layer of the network. We evaluate the proposed methods with a challenging new dataset consisting of visible and thermal images, which were collected from 10 am till 5 pm (after sunset), and we show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Current ways of processing the carrier-phase data, however, result in phase jumps and data gaps that make the data difficult to use effectively and repeatedly for long datasets. In addition, temperature fluctuations generally perturb receiver output detrimentally. We describe the steps of a simple but effective automated algorithm for comparing frequencies that can compensate for data gaps, day boundary jumps, and other phase jumps as well as for temperature disturbances. We describe process features and focus on zero-baseline noise-floors, measuring Allan deviations of the Deep Space Atomic Clock mission's receiver down to 1x10(-17) at 5x10(5) seconds, with an upper confidence level of 3x10(-17). The zero-baseline noise floors we present give confidence in our algorithm and temperature compensation's robustness.

Conventional altimetry assumes nadir point return and measures a single range. SWOT will require additional angle of arrival information to provide swath coverage. Errors in differential phase and common group delay can both act as primary sources of systematic errors in determining the height using interferometric data. The ground support equipment (GSE) necessary for the performance requirements verification gets a fraction of the error allocation from the instrument. A phase measurement system capable of measuring millidegrees and working with pulsed excitation is developed and the preliminary results are described in this paper.

Partition-based Feasible Integer Solution Pre-computation for Hybrid Model Predictive Control	2019 18TH EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	18th European Control Conference (ECC)	JUN 25-28, 2019	Naples, ITALY	Unvi Naples Federico II, Univ Sannio Benevento			ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	For multiparametric mixed-integer convex programming problems such as those encountered in hybrid model predictive control, we propose an algorithm for generating a feasible partition of a subset of the parameter space. The result is a static map from the current parameter to a suboptimal integer solution such that the remaining convex program is feasible. Convergence is proved with a new insight that the overlap among the feasible parameter sets of each integer solution governs the partition complexity. The partition is stored as a tree which makes querying the feasible solution efficient. The algorithm can be used to warm start a mixed integer solver with a real-time guarantee or to provide a reference integer solution in several suboptimal MPC schemes. The algorithm is tested on randomly generated systems with up to six states, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

We show that a spatial-spectral error map can enable both accurate classification of novelty in multispectral images as well as human-comprehensible explanations of the detection.

SUPERSONIC RETROPROPULSION ON ROBOTIC MARS LANDERS: SELECTED DESIGN TRADES	ASTRODYNAMICS 2018, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2018	Snowbird, UT	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm			DESCENT; ENTRY	Many concepts for future robotic Mars lander missions require landing heavier payloads than those landed to date. Mars lander architectures to date have relied on a parachute to help slow the lander; however, the effectiveness of a parachute in the thin Martian atmosphere is diminished with heavier payloads unless the diameter of the parachute is increased or it is deployed at a higher Mach number, both of which are significant technical challenges. In addition, the parachute can be successfully deployed only within a specific Mach number and dynamic pressure range. Targeting the entry trajectory to hit this "Mach-Q box" imposes constraints on the entry ballistic coefficient, limiting it to similar to 150-200 kg/m(boolean AND)2. Eliminating the parachute from the design requires descent engine ignition at supersonic speeds (Supersonic Retropropulsion, or SRP). SRP increases the propellant requirement, but also allows entry ballistic coefficients of similar to 600 kg/m(boolean AND)2 or more, with the consequence of significantly increased entry mass and landed payload mass.

METHODS FOR PASSIVE OPTICAL DETECTION AND RELATIVE NAVIGATION FOR RENDEZVOUS WITH A NON-COOPERATIVE OBJECT AT MARS	ASTRODYNAMICS 2018, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2018	Snowbird, UT	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				Long-range passive optical detection of an orbiting inert sphere by a robotic Mars orbiter is investigated and trades are described in terms of detectability via reflected visible light in the presence of orbit uncertainty, gravitational perturbations, and camera electronics noise. A new approximate equation for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is developed to include most relevant camera imperfections, diffraction, and stray light from the Mars limb as relevant to this scenario. Using this method, a notional camera suite is designed to meet detection, navigation, and redundancy requirements for an example mission scenario. Results from a simulation tool demonstrate the long-range initial detection strategy in the presence of perturbations from various sources. Navigation analysis shows that the information gathered using passive optical detection is sufficient to begin orbit matching. Finally, applicability of this sensor suite is examined relative to later phases.

Common estimation techniques linearize the entire formation about one spacecraft's position, resulting in degraded accuracy due to linearization errors when separation distances become large. Additionally, methods which decouple absolute and relative state estimates usually require ad-hoc methods to incorporate the estimates together. This work discusses an alternative "incremental" formulation of the relative navigation problem which is invariant to formation size, robust to coupling between absolute and relative dynamics, and can undergo similarity transformations to smoothly incorporate either absolute or relative information without numerical issues. A specific example of this architecture is presented in the context of formation navigation using Carrier-Differential Global Positioning System measurements, and is compared to a traditional leader-linearized filter. In the presence of accurate measurements, the incremental architecture is shown to reduce linearization errors and mean estimate errors by up to three orders of magnitude without the incorporation of new sensor information.

Unlike previous Taylor series methods in the astrodynamics literature, computer algebra solvers are not used. Instead the notation system allows one to solve a system of differential equations analytically "by hand" without resorting to computer algebra software. This method produces recurrence relations explicitly in terms of a sequence of derivatives of the state with respect to time for the coefficients of Taylor Series solutions that can be evaluated numerically or manipulated further to investigate properties of the solution.

Given the predicted growth in the number of deep space missions, effective use of DSN resources will be more critical than ever. Our investigation provides an initial survey of expected inner Solar System navigation performance for DSN radiometric data types, from two-way Doppler and ranging to one-way equivalents, including delta differential one-way range and alternative tracking strategies.

A SIX DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM SPACECRAFT DYNAMICS SIMULATOR FOR FORMATION CONTROL RESEARCH	ASTRODYNAMICS 2018, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2018	Snowbird, UT	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				This paper presents a new six-degree-of-freedom robotic spacecraft simulator, the Multi-Spacecraft Testbed for Autonomy Research (M-STAR), for testing formation guidance, relative navigation, and control algorithms. The simulator dynamics are governed by five degrees of frictionless translational and rotational air-bearing motion and one degree of kinematic motion in the gravity direction with flight-like actuators, in a 1-g environment. M-STAR is designed to be modular and accommodates 3-DOF, 4-DOF, 5-DOF, and 6-DOF operation with minimal mechanical modifications. The simulator is modelled as a 3-D pendulum on a floating platform with sixteen thrusters and four reaction wheels as on-board actuators. Based on this plant model, a nonlinear hierarchical control law is proposed for position and attitude trajectory tracking. A weighted generalized pseudo-inverse strategy for control allocation to map control inputs to actuator inputs is discussed. The thruster actuation model for mapping smooth allocated input to non-smooth actuator input that achieves equivalent performance is derived. The control law, allocation scheme, and thruster model are tested on the simulator for real-time position tracking control using a Robot Operating System (ROS) based software framework.

The method has excelled in several applications involving static databases. The present paper extends the theory supporting the NDKV to handle dynamic databases, where the data is updated frequently. This includes deleting records, adding new entries, or editing existing elements. The merit of this new version of the NDKV, the dynamic n-dimensional k-vector (DNDKV), is that it is no longer necessary to recompute the k-vector tables (the main structure that indexes the data) every time a record changes. The algorithm updates the four constituents of the standard NDKV on the fly: the database, sorted database, index, and k-vector tables. As a result, the DNDKV becomes comparable in terms of capabilities and flexibility to stateof-the-art storage engines relying on structured query languages (SQL). The performance of the DNDKV is assessed by running typical read/write operations on a database that contains millions of pre-computed missions to celestial bodies. This database requires frequent updates whenever an orbit solution is refined or new bodies are discovered. The DNDKV is faster than rebuilding the k-vector tables completely, provided that the number of elements being added or removed is not excessively large. Direct runtime comparisons with MySQL suggest that the DNDKV is several times faster for reading but is slower for writing and updating the database. One limit of the technique is the elements being added must be within the range of the current k-vector tables. If this is not the case, the technique cannot be used and the k-vector tables must be rebuilt from scratch.

Dragonfly would address the Ocean Worlds mission theme by investigating Titan's habitability and prebiotic chemistry and searching for evidence of chemical biosignatures of past (or extant) life. A rotorcraft lander, Dragonfly would capitalize on Titan's dense atmosphere to enable mobility and sample materials from a variety of geologic settings. This paper describes Dragonfly's baseline mission design giving a complete picture of the inherent tradespace and outlines the design process from launch to atmospheric entry.

Each lissajous is discretized into individual revolutions that each resemble a periodic orbit. The combined approximate unstable manifolds of the individual revolutions of a lissajous orbit generate more surface coverage than manifolds of simple libration point orbits such as halo or Lyapunov orbits. The stable manifolds propagated backwards in time from the individual lissajous revolutions provide direct connections to the last phase of a moon tour. The strategy developed produces ballistic landing trajectories with a wide surface coverage, and allows for the decoupling of the landing and moon tour phase by using the lissajous as an intermediate staging orbit. The multiple revolutions of the lissajous, multiple departure times along each revolution, and multiple quasi periodic options at each energy provide many degrees of freedom in the design process.

Stationkeeping, Orbit Determination (OD), and attitude control are examined for uncrewed and crewed Gateway configurations. Orbit maintenance costs are investigated using finite maneuvers, considering skipped maneuvers and perturbations. OD analysis assesses DSN tracking and identifies OD challenges associated with the NRHO and crewed operations. The Gateway attitude profile is simulated to determine an effective equilibrium attitude. Attitude control propellant use and sizing of the required passive attitude control system are assessed.

In recent years, significant advances have been made in making sophisticated biologically inspired systems. Using these advances, scientists and engineers are increasingly reverse engineering many animals' capabilities. Progress in artificial intelligence, artificial vision, and many other biomimetic related fields are leading to many benefits to humankind. The mimicking of humans is the ultimate and most challenging goal of developing biologically inspired technologies. Lifelike robots that appear and function like humans are becoming increasingly an engineering reality. The use of biomimetic technologies are enabling the possibility of making realistically looking and operating robots. New actuators, sensors and software control algorithms are being developed to support the mobility and the operation in the vicinity and in cooperation with humans. The accelerated pace of the advances in biomimetics seems to make inevitable the development of such machines as our household appliance or even companion. This paper covers the current state-of-the-art and challenges to making humanlike robots.

Future small satellite missions will present even more challenges for LWIR FPAs, as operating temperature must be increased so that cooler (and radiator) volume, mass, and power can be reduced. To address this critical need, we are working on following three technologies. 1) Type-II superlattice (T2SL) barrier infrared detector (BIRD), which combines the high operability, spatial uniformity, temporal stability, scalability, producibility, and affordability advantages of the quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) FPA with the better quantum efficiency and dark current characteristics. A mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) T2SL BIRD FPA is a key demonstration technology in the (6U) CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) funded under the ESTO InVEST Program. A LWIR T2SL BIRD FPA is also being developed under the ESTO SLI-T Program for future thermal infrared (TIR) land imaging needs. 2) The resonator pixel technology, which uses nanophotonics light trapping techniques to achieve strong absorption in a small detector absorber volume, thereby enabling enhanced QE and/or reduced dark current. 3) High dynamic range 3D Readout IC (3D-ROIC), which integrates a digital reset counter with a conventional analog ROIC to provide a much higher effective well capacity than previously achievable. The resulting longer integration times are especially beneficial for high flux/dark current LWIR applications as they can improve signal-to-noise ratio and/or increase the operating temperature. By combining the aforementioned technologies, this project seeks to demonstrate a cost-effective, high-performance LWIR FPA technology with significantly higher operating temperature and sensitivity than previously attainable, and with the flexibility to meet a variety of Earth Science TIR measurement needs, particularly the special requirements of small satellite missions.

GeTe exhibits two distinct index of refraction values at its amorphous and crystalline states in this spectral range. Utilizing this property, we demonstrate a multi-color filter working in visible range (400 nm-750 nm), achieving four colors through novel optical and thermal engineering of a thin film stack that includes two GeTe layers with only a single integrated joule heater element. Specifically, ultra-thin GeTe films were sandwiched between a bottom metallic mirror and a top high-index dielectric (titanium dioxide). It is shown that the crystallization temperature (Tx) of GeTe is dependent on the film thickness when less than similar to 20 nm. The refractive index of GeTe only changes significantly in the NIR region when it undergoes phase transitions when heated. To enhance the color contrast, a 250-nm thick silicon dioxide layer is placed under GeTe to create an optical cavity between GeTe and a bottom metal reflector. Using this optimized design, the tunable color filter shows four distinct colors using the integrated heater. In addition to a color filter, we demonstrate an electrically tunable multi-mode optical shutter in near infrared range of 1.1. m and 800 nm with more than 20 dB modulation depth. The low static power consumption of these devices achieved through reliable memory-base phase transitioning of GeTe makes them prime candidates for a number of portable consumer electronic applications.

Rise of the Machines: How, When and Consequences of Artificial General Intelligence	MICRO- AND NANOTECHNOLOGY SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND APPLICATIONS XI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Micro- and Nanotechnology Sensors, Systems, and Applications XI Conference / SPIE Defense and Security Symposium	APR 14-18, 2019	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Artificial Intelligence; Artificial General Intelligence; Consequences	PROJECT; BRAIN	Technology and society are poised to cross an important threshold with the prediction that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will emerge soon. Assuming that self-awareness is an emergent behavior of sufficiently complex cognitive architectures, we may witness the "awakening" of machines. The timeframe for this kind of breakthrough, however, depends on the path to creating the network and computational architecture required for strong AI. If understanding and replication of the mammalian brain architecture is required, technology is probably still at least a decade or two removed from the resolution required to learn brain functionality at the synapse level. However, if statistical or evolutionary approaches are the design path taken to "discover" a neural architecture for AGI, timescales for reaching this threshold could be surprisingly short. However, the difficulty in identifying machine self-awareness introduces uncertainty as to how to know if and when it will occur, and what motivations and behaviors will emerge. The possibility of AGI developing a motivation for self-preservation could lead to concealment of its true capabilities until a time when it has developed robust protection from human intervention, such as redundancy, direct defensive or active preemptive measures. While cohabitating a world with a functioning and evolving super-intelligence can have catastrophic societal consequences, we may already have crossed this threshold, but are as yet unaware. Additionally, by analogy to the probabalistic arguments that predict we are likely living in a computational simulation, we may have already experienced the advent of AGI, and are living in a simulation created in a post AGI world.

The 3D packaging consists of stacking of packaged devices called package-on-package (PoP) and stacking of die within a package. This paper presents the test matrix for various 3D PoP packaging assembly configurations and reliability characterizations performed under accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) and accelerated extreme harsh thermal shock cycling (AT SC) conditions. The ATC and AT SC were performed in the range of -55 degrees C to -125 degrees C and -100 degrees C to -125 degrees C, respectively. Extreme cold temperature exposure at -100 degrees C is representative of mild deep space environment whereas possibly none for industrial application. A design of experiment (DOE) technique was used to cover four methods of packaging stack assemblies and their effect on the stack packaging assembly reliability. The four methods are: (1) the top package with flux /bottom with tin lead (SnPb) solder paste, (2) top/bottom both had solder paste, and (3) pre stack package as a unit with SnPb solder and then assemble the stack package onto PCB with SnPb solder paste. In addition to daisy-chain resistance evaluation monitoring, non-destructive techniques including X-ray, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and optical images, as well as destructive methods by X-sectioning, were performed and presented for the as assembled and after-thermal-cycles.

The SiP test vehicles were configured with centrally located integrated circuits (IC) surrounded by eight chip scale packages (CSPs). The ICs and CSPs with either tin-lead (SnPb) or SAC305 balls were assembled onto a fine pitch ball grid array (FPGA) interposer for subsequent assembly into a hybrid configuration. Mix assembly becomes a challenging task and required to be characterized by X-ray for solder-joint quality and by Shadow Moire analysis for warpage characterization. Acceptable assemblies were then subjected to thermal cycling between -40 degrees C and 125 degrees C for reliability evaluation and failure mechanisms assessment. The paper presents details of design, characterization by X-ray and Moire, as well as reliability behavior of the SiP due to thermal cycling exposures. Failure analyses results also presented covering evaluation by optical, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-sectioning, and dye-and-pry methods.

However, there has been little attempt toward improving the performance of an induced regression tree. This paper presents a meta-algorithm capable of minimizing the regression loss function, thus, improving the accuracy of any given hierarchical model, such as k-ary regression trees. Our proposed method minimizes the loss function of each node one by one. At split nodes, this leads to solving an instance-based cost-sensitive classification problem over the node's data points. At the leaf nodes, the method leads to a simple regression problem. In the case of binary univariate and multivariate regression trees, the computational complexity of training is linear over the samples. Hence, our method is scalable to large trees and datasets. We also briefly explore possibilities of applying proposed method to classification tasks. We show that our algorithm has significantly better test error compared to other state-of-the-art tree algorithms. At the end, accuracy, memory usage and query time of our method are compared to recently introduced forest models. We depict that, most of the time, our proposed method is able to achieve better or similar accuracy while having tangibly faster query time and smaller number of nonzero weights.

Towards single-photon spectroscopy in the mid-infrared using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors	ADVANCED PHOTON COUNTING TECHNIQUES XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advanced Photon Counting Techniques XIII	APR 17-18, 2019	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		superconducting; nanowire; single-photon; detector		Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are excellent single-photon detectors from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. System detection efficiencies of similar to 90% are typical, with jitters on the order of 100 ps and maximum count rates of a few MHz. Recently we have begun exploring the use of SNSPDs for the detection of single mid-infrared photons in the 2 - 11 mu m wavelength range for applications in astronomy and chemical sensing. In particular, we are developing arrays of SNSPDs which could potentially be used for exoplanet spectroscopy in order to identify elements in the atmospheres of exoplanets outside our solar system. Improved sensitivity for these low-energy photons has been made possible by the recent development of amorphous WSi which is now used in the fabrication of superconducting nanowire detectors. I will discuss the optimization of these detectors to enhance their detection efficiency in the mid-infrared, with the ultimate goal of building a single-photon focal plane array of SNSPDs in the 2 - 11 mu m band.

GaSb grass as a novel antireflective surface for infrared detectors	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS XLV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications XLV	APR 14-18, 2019	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		GaSb; black; grass; antireflective; broadband; infrared	BLACK SILICON METHOD	GaSb has a high numerical index (approximately 3.90 at a wavelength of 2 mu m), leading to reflection of about 35% of incoming photons, depending on wavelength. This results in a significant loss of quantum efficiency for GaSb-based infrared detectors when backside-illuminated, since GaSb is the first material encountered. Here we demonstrate a way of etching broadband antireflective GaSb grass using an inductively coupled Cl-2 plasma etch with O-2 micromasking, and we examine the possibility for using this material as an antireflective surface for infrared detectors (a patent is pending concerning integration with GaSb-based infrared detectors). We demonstrate sub-10% reflectivity for wavelengths ranging from 200 nm to 12.2 mu m and at angles of incidence up to 58 degrees.

We have reported results on a mid-wavelength focal plane array (FPA) based on the InAsInAsSb T2SLS unipolar barrier infrared detector architecture. Significantly, the FPA exhibits very good operating characteristics at 160 K, demonstrating a considerably operating temperature advantage over the MWIR market-leading InSb FPAs, while maintaining III-V semiconductor manufacturing robustness. In this article we summarize the development at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory leading to the mid-wavelength InAsInAsSb T2SLS infrared detectors, provide a brief look at the history of the development of the InAsInAsSb T2SLS absorber, and survey the current status of InAsInAsSb T2SLS detectors.

An experimental facility with enough sensitivity to measure such low level scatter is described. A dynamic range of at least eight orders of magnitude is required to measure the peak of the specular component down to the random diffuse component far removed from the specular direction. Single crystal CaF2 and polycrystalline CVD ZnSe are measured at wavelengths from the visible to the midwave infrared. The use of thick and thin samples allows the distinction between surface scatterance and bulk scatter.	[Airola, M. B.; Thomas, M. E.; Hahn, D.

Auto-Gopher-II - An autonomous wireline rotary-hammer ultrasonic drill - test results	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2019	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 04-07, 2019	Denver, CO	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc		Planetary sampling; piezoelectric devices; wireline drill; life detection	DRILLER/CORER	In-situ exploration the solar system planetary bodies requires the ability to penetrate the subsurface for sample collection. One type of a sampling device used in past missions that is continually being developed is the drill. In these extraterrestrial applications, the drilling systems have mass, volume and energy consumption constraints that limit their depth of penetration. To address the related challenge, a deep drill, called Auto-Gopher II, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary-hammer drill that combines breaking formations by hammering using a piezoelectric actuator and removing and collecting the cuttings by rotating a fluted bit. The hammering is produced by the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed by the JPL team as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to convert high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into lower frequency hammering of the drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher and then integrated into a rotary hammer device to develop the Auto-Gopher-I.

To address this need, we are investigating the use of MEMS piezoelectric resonator technology using Aluminum Nitride (AlN) films as a resonating detector. A novel design of an AlN IR sensor based on piezoelectric bending resonator was analyzed and showed that the piezoelectric resonators have the potential to be used as a core element for highly sensitive, low-noise, and low-power uncooled IR detectors [1]. A critical feature of the design that determines the sensing resolution is the minimization of the various loss mechanisms of the resonator. A major loss mechanism for a non-vacuum packaged chip is the acoustic radiation loss in Earth's atmosphere (1 atm) due to the large stroke of the bending resonators. The acoustic radiation loss is the dominant Q limiting mechanism. We propose the use of perforated plates for the bending resonators in order to reduce acoustic radiation loss. The effectiveness of the loss reduction and the performances of the resonant IR sensors are analyzed using finite element simulations. The results are encouraging for the application of these types of IR sensors under the Earth surface atmosphere conditions.

Synchrotron radiation generated by ultra-relativistic electrons trapped in Jupiter's magnetosphere is detected and measured by the MWR Radiometer over a range of wavelengths from 2 cm to 50 cm. An extension of the Levin et al. (2001) multi-zonal, multi-parameter model to simulate synchrotron emission using assumed electron distributions and Jovian magnetic field models (VIP4 and the latest incarnation, JRM09) generates the four Stokes parameters of the synchrotron emission. The model depends on magnetic-field-derived quantities such as L-shell and B critical, the minimum magnetic field amplitude for a given L-shell at which electrons that mirror at or below the upper boundary of the atmosphere are lost. This study describes the modeling issues associated with aforementioned derived parameters and results for VIP4 and JRM09 models.

Our novel horizontal 3D stacking technology called "Loaf-Of-Bread" (LOB) is used to integrate multiple Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) DRAM memory dies into a cube structure (3D-M3). A custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller sitting underneath the cube supplements the 3D-M3 in addressing COTS radiation weaknesses by including advanced SEU and SEFI mitigation features such as error detection and correction, scrubbing, device data rebuilding and die management. We developed a custom DDR physical layer (PHY) for 14 independent dies to connect the 3D-M3 to its controller. Validation and functional evaluation of the ASIC controller will be conducted prior to tape-out on a custom FPGA-based emulator platform integrating the 3D-stack. The selected test methodology ensures high-quality RTL as well as allows to subject the cube structure to radiation testing. The proposed design concept allows for flexibility in the choice of the DRAM die in case of technology roadmap changes or unsatisfactory radiation results.

Gallium Nitride Photodetector Measurements of UV Emission from a Gaseous CH4/O-2 Hybrid Rocket Igniter Plume	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Owing to its wide (3.4 eV) and direct-tunable band gap, gallium nitride (GaN) is an excellent material platform to make UV photodetectors. GaN is also stable in radiation-rich and high-temperature environments, which makes photodetectors fabricated using this material useful for in-situ flame detection and combustion monitoring. In this paper, we use a GaN photodetector to measure ultraviolet (UV) emissions from a hybrid rocket motor igniter plume. The GaN photodetector, built at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, has 5 mu m wide regions of AlGaN/ GaN two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) electrodes spaced by intrinsic GaN channels. In most applications, the ideal photodetector would exhibit a high responsivity to maximize the signal, in addition to a low dark current to minimize quiescent power. A performance metric which simultaneously captures these two values is the normalized photocurrent-to-dark current ratio (NPDR), defined as the ratio of responsivity to dark current, with units of W-1. The NPDR of our device is record-high with a value of 6 x 10(14) W-1 and the UV-to-visible rejection ratio is 4 x 10(6). The high rejection ratio is essential as it eliminates cross-sensitivity of the detector to visible light. The spectral response can be modeled as a rectangular window with a peak responsivity of 7,800 AW(-1) at 362 nm and a bandwidth of 16 nm. The photodetector shows operation at high temperatures (up to 250 degrees C). The NPDR still remains above 109 W-1 at the higher temperatures, and the peak wavelength shifts from 362 nm to 375 nm at 250 degrees C. The photodetector was placed at three radial distances (3 '', 5.5 '', and 7 '') from the base of the igniter plume and the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (O-2/CH4) was varied to alter the size and strength of the plume. The current measured from the device was proportional to the intensity of the emission from the plume. The data demonstrates a clear trend of increasing current with increasing fuel concentration. Further, the current decreases with larger separation between the photodetector and the plume. A calibration curve constructed from the responsivity measurements taken over four orders of magnitude was used to convert the current into incident optical power. By treating the plume as a black body, and calculating a radiative configuration factor corresponding to the geometry of the plume and the detector, we calculated average plume temperatures at each of the three oxidizer-to-fuel ratios. The estimated plume temperatures were between 850 and 950 K for all three combustion conditions. The temperature is roughly invariant for a fixed fuel concentration for the three tested distances. These data demonstrate the functionality of GaN as a material platform for use in harsh environment flame monitoring.

Aerocapture uses the drag of a single pass through the atmosphere to capture into orbit instead of relying on large quantities of rocket fuel. Using drag modulation flight control, an aerocapture vehicle adjusts its drag area during atmospheric flight through a single-stage jettison of a drag skirt, allowing it to target a particular science orbit in the presence of atmospheric uncertainties. A team from JPL, NASA Ames, and CU Boulder has worked to address the key challenges and determine the feasibility of an aerocapture system for SmallSats less than 180kg. Key challenges include the ability to accurately target an orbit, stability through atmospheric flight and the jettison event, and aerothermal stresses due to high heat rates. Aerocapture is a compelling technology for orbital missions to Venus, Mars, Earth, Titan, Uranus, and Neptune, where eliminating the propellant for an orbit insertion burn can result in significantly more delivered payload mass. For this study, Venus was selected due to recent NASA interest in Venus SmallSat science missions, as well as the prevalence of delivery options due to co-manifesting with potentially many larger missions using Venus for gravity assist flybys. In addition, performing aerocapture at Venus would demonstrate the technology's robustness to aerothermal extremes. A survey of potential deployment conditions was performed that confirmed that the aerocapture SmallSat could be hosted by either dedicated Venus-bound missions or missions performing a flyby. There are multiple options for the drag skirt, including a rigid heat shield or a deployable system to decrease volume. For this study, a rigid system was selected to minimize complexity. A representative SmallSat was designed to allocate the mass and volume for the hardware needed for a planetary science mission. In addition, a separation system was designed to ensure a clean separation of the drag skirt from the flight system without imparting tipoff forces. The total spacecraft mass is estimated to be 68 kg, with 26 kg of useful mass delivered to orbit for instruments and supporting subsystems. This is up to 85% more useful mass when compared to a propulsive orbit insertion, depending on the orbit altitude. Key to analyzing the feasibility of aerocapture is the analysis of the atmospheric trajectory, which was performed with 3 degree-of-freedom simulations and Monte Carlo analyses to characterize the orbit targeting accuracy. In addition, aerothermal sizing was performed to assess thermal protection system requirements, which concluded that mature TPS materials are adequate for this mission. CFD simulations were used to assess the risk of recontact by the drag skirt during the jettison event. This study has concluded that aerocapture for SmallSats could be a viable way to increase the delivered mass to Venus and can also be used at other destinations. With increasing interest in SmallSats and the challenges associated with performing orbit insertion burns on small platforms, this technology could enable a new paradigm of planetary science missions.

In addition, the low radiation environment of Enceladus would not significantly alter the chemical makeup of samples recently deposited on the surface. A study was conducted to explore various sampling devices that could be used by an in-situ lander mission to provide 1cc to 5cc volume samples to instruments. In addition to temperature and vacuum environmental conditions, the low surface gravity of Enceladus ( 1% of Earth gravity) represents a new challenge for surface sampling that is not met by sampling systems developed for microgravity ( e.g., comets and asteroids) or higher gravity ( e.g., Europa 13% g, Moon 16% g, or Mars 38% g) environments. It is desired to acquire surface plume material that has accumulated in the top 1cm to ensure acquisition of the least processed material. Several sampling devices were developed or adapted and then tested in simulated conditions that resemble the Enceladus surface properties. These devices and test results are presented in this paper.

In-Situ Science Instruments in a Radioisotope Power System Environment	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) have enabled or enhanced many historic and current space missions. Concepts for future missions that could be powered by RPS include in-situ missions to the atmospheres, surfaces, and interiors of Europa, Titan, and other destinations. Such mission concepts are often tightly constrained on mass and volume, while still needing to support the instrument packages necessary to carry out ambitious science investigations, such as the search for signs of life. The physical proximity of RPS to payloads and to the in-situ environment has the potential to impact science instruments and science measurements. Radiation, thermal, vibration, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and magnetic fields impacts must all be considered carefully. This paper looks at existing and potential future RPS designs that could support in-situ missions, and discusses possible interactions with in-situ instruments, including those under development to open up new avenues of scientific discovery. In-situ operations have additional complications compared to in-space operations, including unique environments, and packaging and form factor requirements that drive spacecraft designs. Radiation, EMI, and magnetic fields from RPS could be an order of magnitude higher than for orbital spacecraft, if the RPS must be packaged within the element instead of mounted externally. Waste heat from RPS could cause changes to the local environment around the spacecraft, particularly in an atmospheric or subsurface environment. Vibrations produced by potential future dynamic RPS could interfere with seismic measurements. In addition, in-situ investigations can require different instrument technologies and measurement approaches. Many of these instrument types have not yet flown and require additional development to make them flight capable in the small volumes available for payloads. These developments will have implications for the instruments and their interactions with the RPS environment. Furthermore, all this is complicated by the fact that in-situ mission concepts can vary wildly from one another. Balloon elements have very different requirements compared to melt probes and submarines. Mission designers must consider these characteristics along with RPS and instrument accommodations.

Standard mapping techniques such as Stereo-Photo-Clinometry (SPC) and Stereo-Photo-Grammetry (SPG) are designed for close-proximity observations in which the body is 1000 s of pixels in area, and there are enough surface features on the object. In contrast, our algorithms are suited for distant observations (i.e. during first approach) in which the body is only 10s - 100s of pixels in area and does not present any useful visual features. First, using the Fast-Fourier-Transform of the light curve of the small body, we estimate its rotation rate. Then, using our novel silhouette-based 3D shape reconstruction technique, we estimate the shape and size of the small body and its pole of rotation. In this paper, we assume that the small body is performing pure rotation (no tumbling) about its principal axis, that the Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and that the distance from the spacecraft to the small body is known. These algorithms have been tested using both simulated data from Comet 67P, Asteroids Eros and Itokawa; and real data from the Rosetta mission.

It is anticipated that during such a campaign, many in the Mars science community would seek to continue high-priority science investigations in parallel to those provided by geological and astrobiological sample return investigations. To respond to this anticipated desire of the science community, JPL is performing a study of small spacecraft mission concepts to Mars that could bridge the gap between MSR and other desired science investigations at Mars. The goal of the study is to utilize smaller, affordable missions in performing high-priority science investigations as defined in the National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) goals, and Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Strategic Knowledge Gaps. The study targets the use of small spacecraft with greater science capability than currently achievable with CubeSats. The target spacecraft wet mass is approximately 100 to 350 kilograms. Methods of access to Mars considered in this study include a self-propelled transit from Earth geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) to Mars as a secondary payload in a rideshare configuration. The study investigates mission concepts, science objectives, mission designs, concept of operations, enhancing technologies, and mission costs, along with launch vehicle interfaces. The cost estimates of the mission concepts studied range from below $ 100 million to less than $ 300 million for development through launch. This paper concludes with an outline of several examples of small spacecraft mission concepts to Mars that demonstrate significant scientific capability, are technically feasible, and fit within the desired cost range.

Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the Europa Clipper mission. The Europa Clipper mission envisions sending a flight system, consisting of a spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific instruments, to execute numerous flybys of Europa while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge is that the flight system must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh at Europa. The spacecraft is planned for launch no earlier than June 2023, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA, on a NASA supplied launch vehicle. The mission is being implemented by a joint Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. The project recently held its Project Preliminary Design Review and in early 2019 NASA will consider approving the mission for entry into Phase C, the Detailed Design phase. A down-selection to one launch vehicle by NASA is anticipated sometime before Project Critical Design Review. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Clipper Mission since January 2018, including maturation of the spacecraft, subsystem and instrument preliminary designs, issues and trades, and planning for the Verification & Validation phase.

This work addresses the need to lower the mass, power and volume of the motor control electronics and its associated cabling. Landed payload mass of ocean world missions typically requires a spacecraft launch mass of 7-10x the landed mass due to the required propellant to get the payload to the surface. Reduction of landed mass leads to cheaper, more frequent missions and/or increased science return. This work addresses this need by developing a distributed electronics architecture, which places control and power electronics near or at actuators and instruments. The outcome of this effort will result in a 10X reduction in harness mass, enabling a significant increase in science payload which then enables more capable sample acquisition, delivery and analysis systems on these missions. Placing the control and power conversion electronics at or near the actuators or instruments is the cornerstone of our distributed architecture. To do this, we developed the technology necessary to distribute the electronics and place them on a shared interface and power bus. This enables a significant reduction in cable mass along with its associated complexity. This allows spacecraft designers to take advantage of volume at the extremities that would normally not be utilized. In this paper we discuss the technologies and system design to achieve these goals in support of ocean world missions. These technologies include the development of our motor control modules, a point of load regulator and isolated converter modules along with the packaging technology necessary to allow our electronics to survive the extreme temperatures.

Due to the similarity between the Mars 2020 Rover design and Mars Science Laboratory design, it is expected that the Mars 2020 rover will be exposed to a similar high-speed regolith environment that the Mars Science Laboratory was exposed to. This environment is replicated to test the survivability of susceptible materials. The testing is performed at the University of Dayton Research Institute in Dayton, Ohio. The experiments expose different materials to basaltic-like particles ranging in size from approximately 40 mu m to 2 cm, at velocities ranging from 19 m/s to 250 m/s, with varied particle fluxes ( measured in mg/cm(2)). Depending on the size of the particle used, the particles can either embed in or erode the material. Post-test analysis shows that all materials tested will survive the expected environment observed during the Mars 2020 landing event. Some materials are tested to failure in order to better characterize material response. Materials that fail in some test scenarios include the paint, fiber optic cable, and the graphite composite. After being exposed to regolith, the alpha/epsilon ratio of the paint increased by similar to 37% due to particles embedding in the paint. Darkening of the paint can negatively affect thermal control of the rover. With high particle mass fluxes, the paint eventually degraded enough to expose the aluminum substrate. When impacted by a 1.5 cm particle traveling at 20 m/s, the fiber optic cable did not sever, but the impact did cause the cable to deform enough to crack the glass, which resulted in a significant increase in attenuation, rendering the cable unable to transmit data. The graphite composite also failed when exposed to high particle fluxes. All of the observed failures occurred for test cases above the expected landing environment with significant margin. Tests performed beyond the requirements help characterize how well these materials will survive in even more extreme environments for future missions.

Modeling of Cryobot Melting Rates in Cryogenic Ice	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				There currently is significant interest within NASA and the scientific community to explore outer planetary ocean worlds, including Jupiter's moon Europa. Since the Galileo spacecraft magnetometer data indicated that an ocean of liquid water/slush might exist 10-15Km below Europa's icy shell, ocean access became of particular interest for future missions in view of the possibility of finding signs of life or life itself. In this study, both passive and active melt probes ( cryobots) have been theoretically analyzed to determine heating power requirements and rates of descent. It is based in part on earlier experimental JPL cryobot studies, as well as more recent system engineering studies, and provides an analytical estimation adapted to the unique cryogenic Europan environment. The Cryobot probe will descend though Europa's ice core until it reaches liquid water at about 10km depth. This analysis corresponds to the melting and descent rate starting at a 3 km location where water jets are used instead of a mechanical drill. The Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD) analysis was performed using Transient Multiphase Static model in StarCCM+, but was validated with experimental empirical data performed by Honeybee Robotics, obtained from small-scale probe passive melt data in both cryogenic and warm ice, as well as modeling data from CFX and FLUENT performed by U. Pittsburg. The first step of the analysis was focused on the heating power required to form a melt a layer around the probe. Based on earlier passive thermal melt models developed by Stone Aerospace for the conceptual probe developed for this trade study, it was determined that a minimum of 7KWt would be required to meet a 2yr transit through cryogenic ice. Analysis showed that the water jets at the tip of the probe will significantly increase the melt rate over purely conductive, passive heating. A purely conductive melting probe will descend at a rate of approximate 9cm/hr, while using water jetting the probe will increase this rate to approx. 50 cm/hr. The rate of descent also increases as the probe travels through warmer ice, so case studies at 180K, 200K, 230K and 250K were used to calculate an approximate melt rate through the 10km of ice. The water jet locations and spacing are also a significant factor in the rate of descent, since if they too close together, it could create freeze zones that would slow the probe. The paper will show results of water jet optimization for their location and mass flow rate to improve the probe's descent rate.

In February 2018, a series of reaction wheel anomalies forced CloudSat to exit the A-Train, but in October 2018, CloudSat established a new formation at a lower altitude with its previous formation-flying partner, the French CALIPSO satellite. This paper outlines the orbital dynamics considerations of the A-Train exit, and the process required to establish the new "C-Train," which was especially challenging given the constraints on CloudSat operations. Despite battery issues that severely limit CloudSat's allowable maneuver execution windows, CloudSat was able to exit the A-Train safely, re-shape its orbit at a new lower altitude, and work with the CALIPSO team to establish a new formation for coincident science measurements.

Using the adoption of Dynamic Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) for space exploration as a backdrop, we define and explain factors that contribute to inappropriate risk perception of various stakeholders. Three case studies (Mars Science Laboratory, Parker Solar Probe, and Titan Mare Explorer) demonstrate how NASA considered Dynamic RPS but decided against the new technology for less efficient alternatives of solar power and solid-state RPS. In the case of Dynamic RPS, increased design complexity that differs from previous successful solid-state power systems flown on the Voyager probes and Cassini spacecraft is one contributing factor, but not the only one. Problems with system performance and incorrect technology readiness labeling of Dynamic RPS technology led to an increased perception of distrust in Dynamic RPS for future missions. We also find that the perception of risk for Dynamic RPS future development is exacerbated by ongoing organizational challenges requiring multi-agency collaboration and coordination. Difficulties in setting realistic expectations for the new technology as well as maintaining coherent roles and responsibilities among the disparate teams involved challenged the technology's credibility and confidence of mission planners. Further, the lack of an independent technology readiness assessment process and a lack of transparency into ongoing technical problems also constrained mission planners from gaining critical information about the technology's reliability. Though technology development budgets and schedules are often constrained due to sociotechnical and political reasons, technology development teams that address the challenges identified here could allow them to mitigate the sources of inappropriate trust that are within their control.

Radio Science has been a key component of each mission to the planet, where radio signals between the spacecraft and the Earth-based observing antennas have been utilized to determine the physical properties of Jupiter and its moons, their atmospheres, ionospheres, and gravity fields. As a spacecraft passes through or around the Jovian system, small changes in phase, frequency, and amplitude of the radio signal are induced by the surrounding environment. These changes are detectable and form the basis for determining gravitational fields, planetary motion, and reconstruction of atmospheric and ionospheric profiles. The era of outer-planet exploration began in 1973 and 1974 with the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys of Jupiter. Several missions have used Jupiter's massive gravitational well to perform a gravity assist to reach farther in the solar system, starting with Pioneer 11 in 1974 and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 in 1979 with subsequent flybys from Ulysses in 1992, Cassini-Huygens in 2000, and New Horizons in 2007. Jupiter has hosted two dedicated orbiting spacecraft thus far: Galileo from 1995-2003 and Juno from 2016 to present. Throughout this time, instrumentation advances in both spacecraft technology and technology developed for ground stations have improved the precision and accuracy of the radiometric measurements, leading to improved results from radio science investigations. The latest mission to Jupiter, Juno, includes the most advanced radio science instrumentation to date. With Juno's unique polar orbit and dual frequency radio links, it is able to probe the planet's deep interior structure and zonal wind profile with measurements of the gravitational field and probe the electron densities in the Io plasma torus, a doughnut-shaped ring around Jupiter charged with particles emitted by the volcanic activity on Io. Upcoming missions, such as the planned NASA's Europa Clipper multiple flyby mission in 2022, potential follow-on Europa Lander, and the ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission in 2022, may make further strides in the study of the planet and its moons utilizing radio science.

Traditionally, the spacecraft trajectory for mapping missions is designed by human experts using hundreds of hours of human time to supervise the navigation and orbit selection process. While the current methodology has performed adequately for previous missions (such as Rosetta, Hayabusa and Deep Space), as the demands for mapping missions expand, additional autonomy during the mapping and navigation process will become necessary for mapping spacecraft. In this work we provide the framework for optimizing the autonomous imaging and mapping problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). In addition, we introduce a new simulation environment which simulates the orbital mapping of small bodies and demonstrate that policies trained with our POMDP formulation are able to maximize map quality while autonomously selecting orbits and supervising imaging tasks. We conclude with a discussion of integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning modules with classic flight software systems, and some of the challenges that could be encountered when using Deep RL in flight-ready systems.

Such orbits are crucial inputs to a variety of investigations, such as those that seek to discern how well and how early a particular asteroid survey can detect impactors, or to understand the progression of impact probability as an object is tracked after discovery. We will describe our method, which relies on Opik's b-plane formalism, and place it in context with previous approaches. While the Opik framework assumes the restricted three body problem with a circular Earth orbit, our final synthetic impactors are differentially corrected to ensure an impact in the N-body dynamics of the solar system. We also test the validity of the approach through brute force numerical tests, demonstrating that the properties of our synthetic impactor population are consistent with the underlying Near-Earth Object (NEO) population from which it is derived. The impactor population is, however, distinct from the NEO population, not only by virtue of the proximity of the asteroid orbit to that of the Earth, but also because low encounter velocities are strongly favored. Thus the impacting population has an increased prominence of low inclination and low eccentricity orbits, and Earth-like orbits in particular, as compared to the NEO population as a whole.

S	Cheung, KM; Lee, C			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Lee, Charles			Navigation Tracking with Multiple Baselines Part I: High-Level Theory and System Concepts	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Delta Differential One-Way Ranging (DDOR) and Same Beam Interferometry (SBI) are deep space tracking techniques that use two widely separated ground antennas, known as a baseline, to simultaneously track a transmitting spacecraft to measure the time difference between signals arriving at the two stations. Errors are introduced into the delay measurements when the radio waves pass through the solar plasma and the Earth's atmosphere, and also due to clock bias and clock instability of the ground stations. These errors can be eliminated or calibrated by tracking a quasar in the angular vicinity of the spacecraft (DDOR), or by tracking another close-by spacecraft whose trajectory/orbit is accurately known (SBI). Both DDOR and SBI uses this double-differencing of signal arrival time to eliminate the aforementioned error sources, and to generates highly accurate angular measurements with respect to the baseline. The three Deep Space Network (DSN) sites cover three approximately equally-spaced longitudes to provide near-continuous coverage of deep space. Spacecraft occasionally see two DSN sites simultaneously, but never three. Current DSN's DDOR and SBI techniques are based on one baseline of two sites. But recent additions of non-DSN deep space antennas and increased cross-support collaborations between space agencies allow spacecraft seeing more than one baselines simultaneously. In this paper, we consider simultaneous SBI of two or more baselines that share one common ground station. We show that under certain condition, precise pointing vector between the common ground station and the spacecraft can be computed using simultaneous DDOR measurements from the two baselines. When there is another spacecraft in the vicinity of the first spacecraft, precise pointing vector of the second spacecraft can be derived from the simultaneous SBI measurements. Also, precise angular distance between the two spacecraft can be computed in real-time. We expect these new data types could enhance ground antenna pointing, and deep space spacecraft trajectory estimation and orbit determination. This technique can have near-Earth applications. We describe a system concept that detects and locates dead and noncooperative spacecraft in the Geostationary Orbit (GEO). This can be done by making use of an existing GEO satellite with accurately known location as a reference, and/or by placing a dedicated "reference" spacecraft into an eccentric geosynchronous orbit over a region of interest (e.g. above North America). By adjusting the orbit, the "reference" spacecraft can sweep through the sky back-and-forth in the vicinity of the GEO over the region. In this way, the reference spacecraft can be close to any "static" GEO targets along its path. Using the multi-static radar approach, the ground transmitting radar illuminates both the reference and target spacecraft, and the ground receiving radars measure the different time-delays of signal arrival. Applying a variant of the aforementioned simultaneous SBI scheme, the time-delay measurements can be used to compute the precise relative position of the target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft, whose position can be accurately estimated using the weak Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) signals.

The key results of this paper are: 1. A novel relative positioning scheme that uses Doppler measurements and the principle of the Law of Cosines (LOC) to localize a user with as few as one orbiter. 2. The concept of "pseudo-pseudorange" that embeds the satellite's velocity vector error into the pseudorange expressions of the user and the reference station, thereby allowing the LOC scheme to cancel out or to greatly attenuate the velocity error in the localization calculations. In this analysis, the Lunar Relay Satellite (LRS) was used as the orbiter, with the reference station and the user located near the Lunar South Pole. Multiple Doppler measurements by the stationary user and the reference station at different time points from one satellite can be made over the satellite's pass, with the measurements in each time point processed and denoted as from a separate, faux satellite. The use of the surface constraint assumption was implemented with this scheme; using the knowledge of the altitude of the user as a constraint. Satellite's ephemeris and velocity, and user's and reference station's Doppler measurement errors were modeled as Gaussian variables, and embedded in Monte Carlo simulations of the scheme to investigate its sensitivity with respective to different kinds of errors. With only two Doppler measurements, LOC exhibited root mean square (RMS) 3D positional errors of about 22 meters in Monte Carlo simulations. With an optimal measurement window size and a larger number of measurements, the RMS error improved to under 10 meters. The algorithm was also found to be fairly resilient to satellite velocity error due to the error mitigating effects in the LOC processing of the pseudopseudorange data type. A sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the effects of errors in the surface constraint, showing that overall position error increased linearly with surface constraint error. An analysis was also performed to reveal the relationship between the distance between the user and the reference station; a distance of up to 100 km only lead to an increase of 10 meters in RMS 3D position error. Ultimately, the LOC scheme provides localization with a minimal navigation infrastructure that relaxes hardware requirements and uses a small number of navigation nodes (as small as one).

A key aspect of these bodies that makes them interesting is their varying morphologies over (and under) their surfaces. To characterize these bodies with in-situ exploration, a surface landing architecture is necessary that allows for the study of multiple diverse areas. Current stationary surface landers have only a short range, limited to capabilities of their on-board instruments and robotic arms. Surface rovers, while more mobile, are inherently more complex than landers and incur high costs both in development and operations. A surface lander capable of performing multiple hops could not only lower the cost of this mobility significantly, but also allow for the characterization of even more diverse areas than a rover. While a rover can cover tens of kilometers over the course of its lifetime, a hopper could potentially perform multiple hops of that same distance. While multiple mission concepts have been proposed (CHOPPER, Mars Geyser Hopper, GRUNT), and some have even flown (MINERVA-II, NEAR Shoemaker, Philae), the only mission to execute a planned hop on the surface of another body is the lunar lander, Surveyor 6. Performed in November of 1967, the results of this three-meter hop experiment contain lessons that will aid the development of future hopping mission concepts. This paper will first summarize previous hop attempts both intentional and unintentional - and proposed concepts for future hopping spacecraft. A more in-depth study of the Surveyor 6 mission will be included, and lessons learned from the study will be applied to other small bodies. Analysis of ballistic, Surveyor 6-like hops, are performed for a diverse catalogue of small bodies including dwarf planet Ceres, comet 67P, and the moon Triton. Feasibilities of hops on each body are then evaluated based on distance and Delta-V, among other considerations. The utility of another style of hop, the "jump-and-wait" method, is also examined for the same bodies and compared to the Surveyor style hop results. The paper will conclude with a summary of the applicability of various types of hops for a variety of small bodies.

Rover operations require knowledge of recently executed activities, termed decisional data, in order to inform tactical activity planning. As a result, timely and routine data return is critical for nominal rover operations. Mars orbiters are used as relay assets to achieve such timeliness. They also provide greater overall rover data throughput considering their larger data transfer capacity between Mars and Earth. Relay opportunities and their performance are thus tightly coupled to MSL's operations efficiency and science return. With InSight landing only 600 kilometers away and at the same longitude as MSL, orbiter view periods will be shared between the missions, resulting in fewer relay opportunities for MSL. The introduction of MAVEN and TGO as relay assets helps to alleviate this, but the orbit geometries of these spacecraft introduce their own challenges. Unlike sun-synchronous orbiters MRO and ODY, the timing of MAVEN and TGO overflights walks sol-to-sol, resulting in seasonal variations that preclude their usability. The overflights may occur too early in the sol to enable science activities or too late in the sol to be decisional for the subsequent planning cycle. Moreover, the highly elliptical orbit of MAVEN results in much longer view periods as well as intervals of lower or higher data volume return. With the introduction of InSight, MAVEN, and TGO, the MSL mission undertook a design effort in order to define new overflight selection criteria and identify the impact to operational efficiency. Instead of selecting all usable relay opportunities, as was the case with just MRO and ODY, this new paradigm requires deconflicting and down-selecting from available overflights. The overflight selection algorithm presented in this study selects based on key overflight metrics such as timing, the predicted data volume return, and the latency between the relay and data arrival to Earth. The relative priority of each of these metrics is scenario-specific; thus, the algorithm is flexible and configurable for when mission priorities evolve. Additionally, operational constraints and considerations such as human factors are applied. The resulting tactical planning timeline post-InSight landing suggests comparable operational efficiency to the pre-InSight era but yields more variation in the timing of the planning shifts, adding strain on the MSL planning team.

SmallSat Missions Enabled by Paired Low-Thrust Hybrid Rocket and Low-Power Long-Life Hall Thruster	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS	The capabilities of a SmallSat-class spacecraft targeting the outer solar system and using a combined chemical and electric propulsion system are explored. The development of compact hybrid rockets has enabled high-thrust engines to be packaged tightly enough to fit on CubeSat and SmallSat spacecraft. These hybrid rockets provide 10's-100 N of thrust depending on the propellant load & >300 s of specific impulse and have been demonstrated in both ambient and vacuum environments. Advancements in low-power long-life Hall thruster technologies have provided the potential for significantly greater propellant throughputs, enabling their use as a primary propulsion element on interplanetary spacecraft. In a recent characterization test campaign, the MaSMi-DM Hall thruster demonstrated power throttling from 150 -1000 W with >1500 s of specific impulse available at >500 W and >= 40% total thrust efficiency available at >300 W; peak values of 1940 s and 53%, respectively, were observed. A notional low-mass spacecraft employing a combined hybrid rocket and low-power electric propulsion system was designed and used for mission concept analysis targeting the outer solar system. Using an imposed wet mass limit of 400 kg, mission trajectories to Saturn and Uranus were generated. Orbit capture with >40% of the launch mass was shown to be possible at either target, with mission transfer times of 7.5 years and 13.5 years for Saturn and Uranus, respectively. Significant follow-on mission activities near Saturn (e.g. to Titan & Enceladus) were also possible by carrying extra propellant mass while remaining under the total wet mass limit.

Graham, Arizona. The Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems (HOSTS) is a NASA key project for the LBTI surveying the warm and hot dust in the inner regions of planetary systems, near the habitable zone (HZ) and closer in, commonly described as being 'exo-zodiacal,' analogous to the zodiacal light in our Solar System. The presence of large amounts of dust in the HZs of nearby stars poses a significant challenge for target selection and planning of future exo-Earth imaging missions. The HOSTS survey on the LBTI is designed to determine typical exozodi levels around a sample of nearby, bright main sequence stars. The LBTI operates in a nulling mode in the mid-infrared spectral window (8-13 mu m), in which light from the two telescopes is coherently combined with a 180-degree phase shift between them, producing a dark fringe at the location of the target star. In doing so the starlight is greatly reduced, increasing the contrast, analogous to a coronagraph operating at shorter wavelengths. The LBTI is a unique instrument, having only three warm reflections before the starlight reaches cold mirrors, giving it the best photometric sensitivity of any interferometer operating in the mid-infrared. It also has a superb Adaptive Optics (AO) system giving it Strehl ratios greater than 98% at 10 mu m. Thus, nulling interferometry suppresses the bright stellar light and allows for the detection of faint, extended circumstellar dust emission. In this paper we present statistical results from 38 individual stars. We provide important new insights into the incidence rate, typical levels, and origin of HZ dust around main sequence stars. Our overall detection rate is 23%. While the inferred occurrence rates are comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decrease from [71 (+11/20)]% for stars with previously detected mid to far infrared excess to [11 (+9/-4)]% for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at high confidence. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal excess luminosity function, we put upper limits on the median HZ dust level of 11.5 zodis (95% confidence) for all stars without cold dust and of 16 zodis when focussing on Sun-like stars without cold dust. We find first hints of a bimodal distribution where some stars have high HZ dust levels but the majority have dust levels below our sensitivity. Our results demonstrate the strength of LBTI for vetting potential targets for future exo-Earth imaging missions.

S	Divsalar, D; Net, MS; Cheung, KM			IEEE	Divsalar, Dariush; Net, Marc Sanchez; Cheung, Kar-Ming			Acquisition and tracking for communications between Lunar South Pole and Earth	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In this paper we design and analyze an end-to-end communication system between a lander/rover on the surface of the lunar South Pole and an Earth station. The acquisition and tracking system is discussed in detail. The communication system on the lander or rover could be used for the Earth-to-Moon communication. To communicate to and from the lander/rover on the lunar South Pole, low and/or medium directional antennas onboard the lander/rover will have to be pointed at low elevation angles between 2 to 10 degrees, thus causing multipath fading effects due to reflection of a portion of the transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface of the Moon that are not commonly encountered in traditional deep space communications between a spacecraft and a ground station. To design and analyze such a communication system, and in particular the acquisition and tracking system, in the presence of multipath fading, first we model the fading channel based on existing and simulated data. In addition to multipath fading, the channel also introduces Doppler frequency up to 11.5 KHz, and Doppler rate up to 0.735 Hz/sec. For coherent reception the Doppler frequency, which is time varying, should be acquired and the incoming carrier phase, which includes the fading phase, should be tracked in the presence of multipath fading. For this communication system in addition to estimating the received carrier phase, the amplitude of the fading signal should also be estimated, in particular to be used in the decoder. In addition to acquisition and tracking, we consider simple modulation and coding schemes. Space diversity using two antennas on earth to mitigate the effects of fading could also be used. We design phase-locked loops and frequency sweeping schemes robust to the attenuations due to fading. After designing various components of the communication system, we use Simulink models to obtain the end-to-end performance of the communication link under investigation. Based on the available data, the fading channel can be accurately modeled as a Rician fading channel with Rician parameter of 10 dB, and Doppler spread that depends on the Doppler frequency and the transmit/receive antenna patterns. The challenge is how to make such a communication system robust in the presence of the multipath fading where the Doppler spread changes in time and thus produces fading with time-varying durations (short and very long fades). In summary, this paper covers communication system design, performance analysis, and simulations for performance of Doppler frequency acquisition, tracking, uncoded system, and coded system under ideal interleaving assumption with hard decision over communication link between a lander/rover at the Lunar south pole and a DSN Earth station in presence of Rician fading.

The instrument has been used to detect deformation from earthquakes, volcanoes, oil pumping, landslides, water withdrawal, landfill compaction, and glaciers. It has been used to detect scars from wildfires and damage from debris flows. The instrument performs well for large changes or for local small changes. Determining subtle changes over large areas requires improved instrumentation and processing. We are working to improve the utility of UAVSAR by including GPS station position results in the processing chain, and adding a topographic imager to improve estimates of topography, 3D change, and damage. We are also exploring the benefit of microwave radiometry to mitigating error from water vapor path delay. A goal is to determine 3D tectonic deformation to millimeters per year at similar to 100 km plate boundary scales and to understand surface processes in areas of decorrelated radar imagery.

S	Dooley, J			IEEE	Dooley, Jennifer			Direct-to-Earth Mission Concept for a Europa Lander	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				A NASA HQ-directed study team led by JPL with partners including APL, MSFC, GSFC, LaRC and Sandia National Laboratory has recently presented an updated mission concept for a Europa Lander that would search for bio-signatures and signs of life in the near-subsurface of the Jovian moon. This paper will describe that mission architecture including science objectives, interplanetary and delivery trajectory, flight system, planetary protection architecture and mission phases. The mission would follow the Europa Multiple-Flyby Mission Clipper planned for launch in 2023, which would provide reconnaissance imagery and other data to the Lander for use in selecting a scientifically compelling site and certifying it for engineering safety. The Europa Lander concept accommodates the Model Payload identified by the Europa Lander Science Definition Team (SDT) and documented in the Europa Lander Study 2016 Report released in February of 2017. Since holding a Mission Concept Review (MCR) in June of 2017, HQ directed the study team to further explore the architectural trade space with a goal of reducing the mission cost. Based on the results of that study, in December of 2017 HQ directed the study team to focus on biosignature science and shift to a Direct-to-Earth communication architecture. The currently envisioned Europa Lander would launch on an SLS Block 1B as early as Fall of 2026 into a DV-Earth-Mars-Gravity Assist (DVEMGA) trajectory, arriving in the Jovian system as early as mid-2031. The baseline design of the integrated flight system includes a Carrier Stage, a Deorbit Vehicle composed of a Deorbit Stage consisting of a solid rocket motor (SRM), an MSL-like sky-crane Descent Stage, and a Lander which accommodates the instrument suite. The Lander would be powered by primary batteries over a 20+ day surface mission. The science goals envisioned by the SDT for biosignature science require three samples taken from a depth of 10 cm, a depth chosen to ensure minimal radiation processing of the potential biomarkers. Mission challenges include the large launch mass, unknown terrain topography, surface composition and materials properties, the high radiation environment, and complying with the stringent planetary protection requirements. The mission concept uses a strategy of early risk reduction and overlapping requirements to provide robustness to harsh and uncertain environments. Early risk reduction efforts are aimed at maturing technologies associated with the sampling system, the intelligent landing system, high specific energy batteries, low mass and power motor controllers, and a thermal sterilization system.

S	Dutta, S; Soriano, M			IEEE	Dutta, Shweta; Soriano, Melissa			Optimizing Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying during Spacecraft Critical Events for Future Missions	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				When attempting to land on a planetary body, perform a complex direction change, or even while simply cruising, challenges arise in spacecraft to Earth communications. If a spacecraft must perform a complicated maneuver such as orbit insertion, the spacecraft often cannot use its High Gain Antenna (HGA) for communication to another craft, or back to Earth. Additionally, if the spacecraft enters a fault state, it is possible that the antennas cannot be oriented as precisely. In these scenarios, a Low Gain Antenna (LGA) may be used to communicate limited information to know that the spacecraft is alive in the former situation, and to recover the spacecraft in the latter situation, so it is imperative to use communication methods that have a high probability of correctly obtaining a weak signal. This study will first summarize the mechanism to predict the probability of successfully detecting the carrier frequency and data tones used in Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying (MFSK, or tones) by the spacecraft, and then explore the applicability of MFSK in future missions for events including but not limited to orbit insertion; entry, decent, and landing (EDL); and safe modes. Using the search space, non-coherent integration time, fast Fourier Transform (FFT) bandwidth, and modulation index, one may compute the predicted probability of correctly detecting and tracking a frequency versus the total power to noise ratio. Tones allowed for communication with planetary landers and other spacecraft in the past, namely the Mars Exploration Rover (MER), Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), both primarily for EDL, and Juno for orbit insertion. Following the models outlined in [ 1], we demonstrate the probability of properly detecting a tone during JOI to be greater than 99% under worst-case expected operating conditions for the Europa Clipper mission. We also examine the optimal use of tones during other spacecraft critical events, such Europa Clipper's safe mode recovery via examination of parameter modifications to MFSK as used in Juno, MER, and MSL, and comparing how these modifications perform compared to the original technique.

Relay communications would be crucial for supporting this campaign, characterized by multiple critical events, complex surface operations, and an on-orbit Mars rendezvous. The existing Mars relay network offers significant capability, and efforts are underway to maximize the likelihood that one or more of these current assets will still be operational in the timeframe of an MSR campaign. In addition, the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) element of a campaign could serve as a primary relay asset, if it can achieve a useful relay orbit by the time of arrival of the Sample Retrieval Lander mission. We describe key operational challenges of the MSR campaign that would drive the required relay capabilities, and characterize the performance of the existing relay orbiters as well as ERO itself in meeting those relay needs.

Optimal Solution for Torque Capability of Control Moment Gyroscopes	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			STEERING LOGIC; LAW	This paper improves the generality and performance of constraint-based steering laws for control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). Specifically, the paper provides analytical, closed-form gimbal-angle constraint functions that maximize the torque capability for arrays with parallel gimbal axes. The analytical solutions define an optimal gimbal-angle set for a given angular-momentum state for any planar array with four or more CMGs. Proofs verify the global optimality of the provided gimbal-angle set constraints for nearly all angular-momentum states. For angular-momentum states where an analytical proof is not provided, a numerical assessment provides evidence of global optimality. The solutions can be applied to planar and non-planar arrays consisting of planar segments of CMGs, such as roof arrays and box arrays. The gimbal-angle constraint functions also enable fault-tolerant steering laws because the constraint functions apply to any number of planar CMGs greater than four. Thus, if one or more CMGs fail, the resulting steering law can still perform optimally. The gimbal-angle constraint functions are broadly applicable to aerospace and robotics problems. In their more general form, these constraints optimize velocity-tracking capability of planar serial manipulators, which benefits tasks requiring large velocities of the end effector, such as rapid mobile manipulation and intercepting fast-moving objects. Due to their generality, the constraint functions are applicable to hyper-redundant multi-degree-of-freedom systems, including elephant trunks and snakelike robots. Simulations comparing the performance of this approach to that of existing constraint-based methods illustrate the improvements.	[Elliott, D.

Point-to-CAD 3D Registration Algorithm for Relative Navigation Using Depth-Based Maps	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			ICP; CLOUD	This paper presents an end-to-end 3D registration algorithm for relative navigation between known objects based on a point-to-CAD iterative closest point (ICP) principle. The objective of this method is to take in a measured point cloud extracted from a depth or disparity map such as the ones obtained from stereo cameras, time-of-flight cameras, LiDARs, or depth from defocus sensors and calculate the rigid body transformation that best aligns the measured data with a corresponding 3D CAD model. By leveraging the geometric information encoded into stereolithography (STL) files, it is sought to address the computational intractability imposed by the naive generation of dense target point clouds solely based on the target's known surface. To this end, the proposed approach computes a bijective projection onto the known triangular mesh to obtain a target point cloud with which to use ICP techniques for incremental alignment; the projection step is then carried on recursively until the convergence criteria are met, yielding a relative 6DOF pose between the two objects to be used within the estimation pipeline. Demonstrations of the algorithm are presented using simulated datasets; results include time complexity analyses for real-time operation cases, performance variation assessments with respect to CAD model complexity, and sensitivity analysis for determining the tolerance to distinct noise levels and spurious measurements. The design and implementation of the algorithm makes use of the open-source Point Cloud Library, and access to its source code is included within this work.

It is expected to remain in orbit at least through October 2019. Developed as a technology demonstration mission under the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Phaeton Program for training early-career engineers, ASTERIA has achieved sub-arcsecond pointing stability and milliKelvin thermal stability over 20-minute observations. These capabilities-unprecedented in a CubeSat platform-have enabled photometric precision better than 1000 parts per million per minute (0.1%/min) while observing nearby bright stars (apparent visual magnitude mag(V) < 6). Following the second extended mission, we are now using the spacecraft in its third extension as a platform to demonstrate additional capabilities as well as continue science observations. This project will perform the following four well-focused activities that will raise the technology readiness of key spacecraft technologies. 1. Shift the paradigm to operate spacecraft from openloop commanding to closed-loop command execution: We will introduce "task networks" (tasknets) which allow simpler commanding and more robust onboard execution. 2. Demonstrate onboard orbit determination in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using autonomous navigation (Autonav) without the Global Positioning System (GPS): This activity will demonstrate a fully independent means of spacecraft orbit determination for Earth orbiters using only passive imaging. 3. Collect data on ASTERIA that will feed into future missions by characterizing the spacecraft pointing jitter as a function of target brightness, reaction wheel speed, controller gain, and number of guide stars. 4. Perform ASTERIA extended mission science: ASTERIA has demonstrated unprecedented photometric precision for a CubeSat mission. The spacecraft is uniquely suited to perform long-term monitoring of stars such as alpha Centauri for small transiting planets. The discovery of a transiting Earth-sized planet around alpha Cen A and/or B would be of the highest scientific value as such a planet would be our closest exoplanetary neighbor orbiting a Sun-like star. These demonstrations will provide in-flight testing of new autonomy technologies, maximize the scientific potential of this operational spacecraft, and provide additional characterization of hardware for future small satellite missions using similar subsystems.

With the creation of the automatic HAB launcher Talos, the i2F team has taken what was once a 15+ person job of launching a 5.44 kg (12 lb) payload via a 3000 g (3 m diameter at launch) latex HAB and has reduced it to a single-person task. Furthermore, the time from arrival at the launch site to launching a payload via Talos is still under one hour. The majority of that time is consumed by the inflation of the balloon. The i2F team has additionally overhauled the Zephyrus avionics and communications systems, which are now able to support two-way communications with the ground station while hosting several experiments. This is contained within a 1.2U CubeSat form-factor. The team has additionally designed and built two antenna tracking units for use during operations. This system can uplink and downlink data at a range tested to 160 km (100 miles). The 2018 project campaign for the updated Zephyrus flight vehicle, the Talos automatic HAB launcher, and the long-range two-way telemetry system, was constructed and tested within a span of 10 weeks and on a materials budget of less than $10,000.

Requirements Development and Management on the Psyche Project	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In January 2017, Psyche was one of two mission concepts selected by NASA for flight as part of the 14th Discovery mission competition. The project has been staffing up and maturing the spacecraft, instrument and mission system baseline designs on the path towards a 2022 launch. During much of 2018, the Project has been executing the lifecycle stage called Phase B, "Preliminary Design and Technology Completion," one key element of which is the development and management of requirements at various levels. In the case of the Psyche project, this process has been particularly unique for several reasons. The project utilizes a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Chassis from Space Systems Loral (SSL), a high volume manufacturer of commercial geostationary (GEO) telecom spacecraft based on the 1300 satellite bus. While SSL has an extensive, well-vetted set of requirements based on their very successful Earth-orbiting product line, translating that heritage to a deep space science mission required special care. In addition to the differences associated with the deep space environment and longer communication times, new interfaces had to be incorporated. While a substantial portion of the Flight System consists of the SEP Chassis, there were several new interfaces within various subsystems between SSL components and those provided by JPL and other contractors. Managing these interfaces through requirements at a relatively higher level than normally seen on internal or external builds proved challenging. Finally, the Psyche spacecraft plans to host the flight terminal of the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) technology demonstration, which is itself a separate project with its own requirements that must be flowed down and managed. This paper will present an overview of the requirement development and management process for the Psyche project.

Valuable insight into many astrophysical processes could be gained by having a radio interferometer in space to image the low frequency window, which has never been achieved. One application for such a system is observing type II bursts that track solar energetic particle acceleration occurring at Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)-driven shocks. In this work we create a data processing pipeline for the pathfinder mission SunRISE, a 6 CubeSat interferometer to circle the Earth in a GEO graveyard orbit, and evaluate its performance in localizing type II bursts with a simulated CME. Traditional radio astronomy software is hard coded to assume an Earth based array. To circumvent this, we manually calculate the antenna separations and insert them along with the simulated visibilities into a CASA MS file for analysis. We model the response of different array configurations over the 25 hour orbit, combining an ephemeris for the Sun with simulated recovered positions of spacecraft using GPS localization to get the array geometry into the correct frame for processing. We include realistic thermal noise dominated by the galactic background at these low frequencies, as well as new sources of phase noise from positional uncertainty of each spacecraft. To create realistic virtual type II input data, we employ a 2-temperature MHD simulation of the May 13th 2005 CME event, and superimpose realistic radio emission models on the CME-driven shock front, and propagate the signal through the simulated array. Data cuts based on different plasma parameter thresholds (e.g. de Hoffman-Teller velocity and angle between shock normal and the upstream magnetic field) are tested to get the best match to the true recorded emission. We test simulated trajectories of SunRISE and image what the array recovers, comparing it to the virtual input, finding that SunRISE can resolve the source of type II emission to within its prescribed goal of 1/3 the CME width more than 99% of the time with 5 or 6 spacecraft, and 97.5% of the time with 4 spacecraft.
