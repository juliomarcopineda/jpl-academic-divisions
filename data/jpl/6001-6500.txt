REMOTE SENSING OF THE CRYOSPHERE IN HIGH MOUNTAIN ASIA	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		High Mountain Asia; Glaciers; Cryosphere; Remote Sensing	SEA-LEVEL RISE; GLACIER INVENTORY; SATELLITE IMAGERY; ICE LOSS; ANTARCTICA; PIPELINE; MODELS; ALASKA	High Mountain Asia (HMA), often referred to as the "third pole" of the world because its high elevation glaciers, contains the largest amount of fresh water outside the polar ice sheets. The region's hydrology is strongly controlled by variations in the timing and distribution of runoff from snow and glacier melt. Recent improvements in remote sensing technologies and atmospheric / land surface models provides new approaches for assessing the HMA cryosphere. A recently-funded NASA program aims to apply these tools to advance understanding of HMA cryospheric processes. Here we present an overview of planned team activities during the three-year project.

In previous work, repeat-pass SAR interferometry from spaceborne sensors is utilized to create large-scale forest height maps based on a newly developed approach. This paper thus serves as a summary paper and also sheds light on the future directions with improved results. In particular, it will be shown that repeat-pass SAR interferometry is able to create a large-scale (11.6 million hectares) forest height mosaic product with RMSE <= 4 m for forest stands on the order of 6 hectares over both the flat and mountainous areas in New England, US through using the past and current spaceborne repeat-pass InSAR observations (i.e. JAXA's ALOS-1 and ALOS-2) combined with sparse airborne lidar training samples (44,000 hectares). Moreover, the results and performance of this approach can be remarkably improved with several enhancement techniques that can be easily satisfied with the use of future spaceborne repeat-pass InSAR and lidar missions (e.g. NASA-ISRO's NISAR and NASA's GEDI). The methodology described in this paper can be considered as a complimentary tool to the existing PolInSAR technique when single-pass full/dual-pol data are not available and/or the underlying topography is complicated.

The full wave approach for solving Maxwell equations is based on the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations (FL) combined with the Method of Moments for bodies of revolution (BOR). The accuracy of the method FL-BOR is first validated by comparing with the results from the commercial software HFSS for the two and five cylinders' cases. Next, the transmission through a vegetation canopy of cylindrical scatterers is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation where the cylinders, as many as 500, are generated in each realization and the scattering is solved by FL-BOR with exact solutions of the matrix equation. The results of transmission at C-band are compared with those from the distorted Born approximation (DBA) where the attenuation rate < K-e > is computed using Foldy's approximation. In NMM3D simulations, the transmission is calculated without the need of defining or calculating the attenuation rate. Two cases are studied: (a) short cylinders where the cylinder lengths are much smaller than the layer thickness and are randomly distributed in 3D in the vegetation layer, and (b) long cylinders where the cylinder lengths are the same as the thickness of the vegetation layer. Case (b) represents several vegetation types and also part of other vegetation types. The results of case (b) show there are significant differences of transmission, as much as 6 dB, from that of DBA.

Of particular interest is in the cold & fresh water where large SSS retrieval errors exist in comparison with Argo data. We found systematic SST dependence in Aquarius radar backscatter sigma(o) and radiometer excess emissivity Delta e, with the emissivity of specular surface estimated using collocated HYCOM SSS and NCEP or SSMI/S wind. In the cold water under medium to high wind, so and Delta e show opposite trend on SST: sigma(o) reduces while Delta e enhances by more than 10% relative to their corresponding values at the reference SST (15 degrees C). The geographical distribution of matchups with SST<5 degrees C & wind speed between 5-20 m s(-1) show that data collected under these conditions are coincident with the area where dSSS (= SSS-S-Argo) is largely positive. This is consistent with the SST trend observed in sigma(o), which would result in overestimation in roughness if the SST effect not considered. However, the enhanced Delta e in cold water is puzzling because it would cause even higher value for SSS retrieval if modeled as roughness. SSS retrieved with SST correction reduces bias but results on error improvement is mixed. We hypothesis there is an unknown defect in the dielectric constant model for cold water and propose an empirical correction for the Aquarius SSS retrieval.

Applying this methodology it is possible to retrieve SSS values in marginal seas or cold waters where the operational retrieval does not. Another important improvement is the possibility of defining a SMOS-based climatology to characterize spatial biases. Recently, using data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, JPL has started to produce a new 9-km resolution T-B product. The existence of such product offers the possibility of increasing the spatial resolution and quality of the mentioned SMOS SSS product using fusion techniques. The aim of this work is to produce high resolution SSS maps in marginal seas derived from the fusion of SMAP 9-km T-B and SMOS non-Bayesian debiased SSS products.

Each observatory carries a 4-channel bistatic wind scatterometer receiver. Measurements of the ocean surface scattering cross section are converted to 10 meter-referenced wind speed. The mission improves the temporal sampling of winds in tropical cyclones (TCs) with a revisit time of 2.8 hours (median) and 7.2 hours (mean) at all locations between 38 deg North and 38 deg South latitude. Operation at the 1575 MHz GPS L1 frequency permits wind measurements in the TC inner core that are often obscured from other spaceborne remote sensing instruments by intense precipitation in the eye wall and inner rain bands. The potential for improved storm surge forecast skill is examined using simulated CYGNSS science data products for Hurricane Irene. We present and compare ADCIRC 2DDI storm surge hindcasting results of Hurricane Irene using four meteorological forcing scenarios: 1) "True" meteorological data obtained from HWRF reanalysis runs; 2) "Worst-case forecast" using low-resolution NOGAPS forecast wind and pressures; 3) "Best-case forecast" using high-resolution HWRF forecast winds and pressures; and 4) a simulated "CYGNSS forecast" with wind field given by a parameterized model trained using CYGNSS-derived values for the maximum wind speed and radius of maximum winds. The results suggest that the improved temporal resolution of the CYGNSS-derived winds has a positive impact on storm surge modeling predictions.

Both instruments have served as prototypes for new orbital sensors. Hyperion has provided the only available global sample of the Earth's surface with: (i) passive optical mid-morning observations at moderate spatial resolution (30 m) to match the Landsat series; and (ii) spectral coverage over almost the full optical spectrum in 10 nm contiguous bands, in visible through shortwave infrared (VSWIR, 0.4-2.5 mu m) wavelengths. Consequently, Hyperion is a heritage platform for future full-spectrum VSWIR orbital spectrometers, including the German mission, EnMAP (2019), and the NASA pre-Phase A (yet unscheduled) mission, the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI), defined by the 2007 Decadal Survey conducted by the US National Research Council. We provide an overview of the mission's lifetime and Hyperion's scientific and application accomplishments, including calibration & validation activities, data quality evaluations during end of mission precession changes to the orbit and overpass time, and the development of a user-friendly science quality archive.

Basic information about sessile communities (wetlands, coral reefs, and sea grasses) includes mapping their extent and distribution, which can be gleaned from spectral surface reflectance imagery at high spatial resolution, but moderate temporal resolution. Moderate to high temporal resolution is also required for detailed observations of sessile community change (e.g., phenology, disturbance) and high temporal resolution is required for environmental changes in the surrounding water, phytoplankton concentration and composition, and concentrations of sediment or chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Current and upcoming satellite missions and technology could meet spatial and spectral challenges. Multiple orbiting and airborne platforms, along with a network of in situ measurements, could provide a more complete picture of how these vital resources are changing.

We hypothesize that a pure spectroscopic approach can improve atmospheric inversion accuracy to minimize regional biases in global-scale investigations. Such techniques are pervasive in atmospheric remote sounding disciplines, where Optimal Estimation (OE) retrieval theory (Rodgers et al., 2000) inverts a radiance spectrum to recover a consistent physical model incorporating, for example, aerosol and H2O, the interactions between scattering, absorption, and the coupling between surface reflectance and atmosphere. This enables a statistically rigorous treatment of uncertainty with the potential to recover information on spectrally-broad signals. Here we demonstrate a proof of concept that overcomes the primary computational roadblock of these methods: fast execution of line-by-line Radiative Transfer (RT) models. Neural Network (NN) emulation can replicate the results of the MODTRAN 6.0 line-by-line A-band model to high accuracy and a five order of magnitude improvement in execution time. This demonstrates potential for OE to provide significant advances in the accuracy and modeling power of VSWIR atmospheric correction.

IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROLS ON CRYOSPHERIC MELTING IN A CHANGING WORLD	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		Snowmelt; glacier melt; imaging spectroscopy; energy balance; global		The global retreat of Earth's cryosphere is the iconic symbol of climate change. Decades of satellite, airborne, and ground observations show clear evidence of increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, declines in sea ice, and decreasing spring snow cover. This increased melting of cryosphere cover makes Earth more absorptive of sunlight and moves enormous volumes of stored water from frozen state to liquid, raising sea level and changing water availability to large populations. However, the distribution of forcings controlling this accelerated melting is poorly known. Atmospheric warming from greenhouse gases is contributing to this acceleration but its magnitude is uncertain due to our uncertainties in the controls on the dominant contributor to annual melt, absorbed sunlight, itself controlled by albedo. Despite this crucial role of albedo and solar radiation in snow and ice melt, sparse measurements have kept us from understanding the global distribution of controls on albedo, grain size and impurities, and from accurately modeling melt processes worldwide. Such an understanding is crucial to determining cryosphere melt and projecting its future behavior. Global spectroscopic measurements are required to improve our understanding of controls on cryosphere melt rates, enabling better predictions of future changes that will affect humankind.

This debris field was the result of an explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during its launch preparations on September 1. The data collected by UAVSAR allowed us to investigate methods for the detection of small ground targets in a complex wetland environment using multi-aspect, fully polarimetric, and high resolution SAR data. We developed a new time domain processor to focus the SAR data directly to a predefined map grid instead of traditional radar coordinates. This approach allowed us to form co-registered SAR images acquired from 8 flight headings to a common map grid without additional resampling. We computed various polarimetric observables for each observed aspect angle, then calculated statistical deviations to identify candidate locations of debris.

Repeat pass radar interferometry often uses data with less than ideal correlation levels resulting from either long spatial or temporal baselines or changes between observation leading to high levels of temporal correlation. To maximize the utility of such pairs filtering the interferogram to get maximal noise reduction if often needed. One technique that has proved quite useful in the geophysical community is power spectral or Goldstein-Werner filtering of the interferogram whereby a power weighted version of the Fourier transform is used to enhance fringe visibility [1]. Although this paper briefly touched upon the spatial resolution and noise reduction induced by the filter it did not provide a useful formula for predicting the expected amount of noise reduction. The purpose of this paper is to present a formula for the amount of noise reduction obtained from power spectral filtering albeit under the restriction of several simplifying assumptions to make the problem analytically tractable.

THE NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) MISSION DUAL-BAND RADAR INSTRUMENT PRELIMINARY DESIGN	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS		NISAR; Spaceborne SAR; L-band SAR; S-Band SAR; digital beamforming; InSAR; polarimetry		The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) are developing a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission to map Earth's surface every 12 days, known as the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Mission. NISAR has completed its preliminary design and successfully passed its Preliminary Design Review in June 2016. This paper describes the radar instrument design, engineering model hardware development status, test results, and the plans for future maturation toward the Critical Design Review in late 2018. NISAR has two radars sharing a mechanical structure and reflector, one operating at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and the other at S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve wide-swath observations at both wavelengths, NISAR is designed as a reflector-feed system where the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive capability. In the partnership, NASA provides the instrument structure for both L-and S-band electronics, the L-band electronics, the reflector and associated boom, and an avionics payload to interface with the radar including a solid-state data recorder, high-rate Ka-band telecommunication link, and a GPS receiver. In addition to providing the spacecraft and launch vehicle for the mission partnership, ISRO is also providing S-band radar electronics, and an additional high-rate Ka-band telecom package. This paper will describe aspects of this technically and logistically complex international instrument and mission development, one that requires careful definition of interfaces, tracking of resources, joint analysis of designed capabilities, and detailed integration and test plans.

Over the past three decades, passive microwave remote sensing has been demonstrated as a promising tool for global soil moisture estimation and several missions have been launched over the past years. This study focuses on the parametrization of the tau-omega model at L-, C- and X-band for the Yanco site in New South Wales, Australia, and compares the resulting forward-simulated brightness temperatures with two missions: NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and JAXA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W mission. Preliminary comparison of SMAP and AMSR2 brightness temperatures and forward-simulated brightness temperatures at the Yanco site showed a generally good agreement and higher correlation for the vertical polarization. This is consistent with other studies analyzing the SMAP soil moisture products. Simultaneous calibration of the vegetation parameter b and roughness parameter h was also performed for the L-, C- and X-band data sets, respectively, at both horizontal and vertical polarizations.

The goal of the PALS measurements are to investigate the soil moisture retrieval algorithm formulation and parameterization under the varying (spatially and temporally) conditions of the agricultural domains and to obtain high resolution soil moisture maps within the SMAP pixels.

In order to account for the different frequencies and acquisition geometries of the two sensor types, the microwave covariation, being the fundamental building block of the moisture retrieval algorithm, is modeled using a fully physics-based approach. Moreover, a data-driven, single pass retrieval methodology for dual-frequency microwave covariation is proposed and tested on SMAP and Sentinel-1 data. The retrieval is also physics-based, incidence angle independent and therefore globally applicable without any empirical or statistical calibration.

In this work, we utilize an existing empirical approach as an alternative; it describes radar backscatter of a vegetated scene as a linear function of soil moisture, hence reducing dependence on ancillary data. We use 2.5 years of L-band Aquarius radar and radiometer derived soil moisture data to calculate two coefficients of a linear model function on a global scale; the coefficients are derived on a per pixel and on an IGBP land cover classification basis. These coefficients are used to estimate soil moisture from 2.5 months of L-band SMAP radar data and are evaluated with the SMAP Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product.

The images considered are the radar dataset collected by the Uninhabited Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) and the Lidar vertical full waveforms acquired by LVIS over boreal forests in the Canadian province of Quebec. We propose dataset descriptors and fusion methods in order to predict lidar from radar. The first challenge is to find features that go beyond the difference of geometrical configurations between the two types of information, and also that compensate the effect of the incidence angle on radar observables. This has been studied in previous work [1] and will be used here in order to focus on the fusion methods. In this paper, we aim to predict the vertical structure of a forest canopy from PolInSAR images. We assume the Lidar waveforms are a good descriptor of structure and use 3 decomposition methods to qualitatively characterizes these waveforms: 1-Relative Height (RH) metrics, 2-Legendre decomposition and 3-spectral clustering. The prediction will be obtained by a neuronal network which requires an input vector representing the PolinSAR data. We extracted 7 parameters from the PolinSAR images: [theta(mean).h(a), theta(0).h(a), gamma(mean), lambda(max), lambda(min), R-p, R-a]. Prediction of the RH produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.6 m for the top height (I.e. RH100). On the other hand, the Legendre coefficients were predicted with an accuracy of 15%, and the spectral clustering classes were obtained with accuracies better than 80% with 2 classes, but rapidly decreasing as the number of classes (waveform shapes) is increased.

This is significant to characterize the land-use change and its impact on climate change. In this paper, both single-pass and repeat-pass SAR interferometry from spaceborne sensors are combined in order to detect and quantify (with Normalized RMSE <= 30%) forest disturbance at a large scale (dozens of kilometers) however with a fine spatial resolution (< 1 hectare) based on two newly developed approaches. The single-pass InSAR approach is not only able to detect forest disturbance but also capable of characterizing meter (or even sub-meter) level change of forest phase-center (mean) height due to forest growth and/or degradation. These methods are extensively validated with the past and current spaceborne single-pass and repeat-pass InSAR missions (i.e. JAXA's ALOS-1, ALOS-2 and DLR's TanDEM-X) over subtropical forests in Australia as well as tropical forests in Brazil. Such techniques also serve as observing prototypes for the fusion of the future spaceborne InSAR missions (such as NASA-ISRO's NISAR and DLR's TanDEM-L).

The InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) [1], a powerful, modular, and extensible framework, is expected to be used as the processing engine for generating tens of terabytes of SAR data products from the NISAR mission on a daily basis. Until recently, the ISCE framework was designed to exploit traditional CPU-based computational architectures. Simulations with SAR data from ESA's Sentinel 1 constellation have shown that these traditional implementations maybe insufficient to handle the daily influx of data from the NISAR mission. This paper describes the initial efforts by the NISAR project team to explore the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate SAR data processing. Preliminary results from "GPU-izing" interferogram generation workflows indicate that processing times can be reduced by an order of magnitude without loss in precision, potentially setting a new standard for radar processing in the world of "Big SAR Data".

The current retrieval algorithms use roughness models and parameterization developed at field scale to estimate soil moisture at satellite footprint. These models ignored large scale roughness features due to differences in elevation, concavity etc., observed within the satellite footprint. In this study, it is hypothesized that the satellite observed surface roughness is contributed by micro roughness (small-scale roughness) and macro roughness (large-scale roughness), incorporating the scattering features observed at field and satellite scale. The traditional algorithm is used to retrieve soil moisture for SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment, 2012), and SMAPVEX15 the field experiments.

S	Lavalle, M			IEEE	Lavalle, Marco			A NEW AUTOMATED ALGORITHM FOR DETECTING FOREST DISTURBANCES WITH THE DUAL-POLARIMETRIC SAR ALPHA ANGLE	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience & Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 23-28, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	Institute of Elect & Electron Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, IEEE, IEEE GRSS				we present a new algorithm for detecting forest disturbances from a pair of dual-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The algorithm uses the mean dual-polarimetric alpha angle in conjunction with its probability distribution to isolate forest structural changes from statistical noise fluctuations. In contrast to radar backscatter, the dual-polarimetric alpha angle is estimated from the complex 2-by-2 covariance matrix and it is less sensitive to variations in soil moisture and terrain slope. Here we derive the statistical properties of the alpha angle for distribute targets, and show how these properties can be applied to detect the burned area of the 2009 Station Fire (CA) from L-band ALOS-1 data. The proposed algorithm can be applicable to future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) time-series to achieve automated global mapping of forest disturbances.

ECOSTRESS will answer science questions related to water use and availability in several key biomes of the terrestrial biosphere using surface temperature information measured from the thermal infrared (TIR) measurement. The instrument includes a TIR multispectral scanner with five spectral bands in the TIR between 8 and 12.5 pm and a spatial resolution of 60m. Model-derived evapotranspiration information derived from ECOSTRESS will help reveal how ecosystems change with climate and provide a critical link between the water cycle and plant health, both natural and agricultural. The inclined, precessing ISS orbit will also enable ECOSTRESS to sample the diurnal cycle in critical regions across the globe at spatiotemporal scales unexploited by current instruments in Sun-synchronous polar and high-altitude geostationary orbits. In this paper we will discuss the primary science objectives of ECOSTRESS, details of the Level 2, 3, and 4 science products and their derivation, validation strategies, and community outreach efforts.

It is expected that the next DS, currently under way, will put additional emphasis on the still pressing need for wind measurements from space. The first DS also called for a geostationary microwave sounder (GMS) on a Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission. Such a sounder, the Geostationary Synthetic Thinned Aperture Radiometer (GeoSTAR), has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The PATH mission has not yet been funded by NASA, but a low-cost subset of PATH, GeoStorm was proposed as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite. Both PATH and GeoStorm will obtain frequent (every 15 minutes of better) measurements of tropospheric water vapor profiles, and they can be used to derive atmospheric motion vector (AMV) wind profiles even in the presence of clouds. We report on simulation studies of such wind vectors derived from a GMS or possibly from a cluster of low-earth-orbiting (LEO) small satellites (e.g., CubeSats).

The TEMPEST concept is designed to improve the understanding of cloud processes, by providing critical information on the time evolution of cloud and precipitation microphysics and by improving our understanding of the largest sources of uncertainty in cloud models. TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers are able to perform observations inside the cloud to observe changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. The TEMPEST Technology Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) mission will be deployed to demonstrate measurement capabilities required for a constellation of 6U-Class nanosatellites to directly observe the temporal development of clouds to understand the conditions that control their transition from non-precipitating to precipitating clouds. TEMPEST-D will provide observations at five millimeter-wave frequencies from 89 to 183 GHz using a single compact instrument that is well suited for the 6U-Class architecture.

The dam is located on the Tigris river and is the biggest hydraulic structure in Iraq. From a geological point of view the dam foundation is unstable due to the underlying geology that is formed by alternate and variable strata of highly soluble materials such as gypsum, anhydrite, marl and limestone. Here we present the first comprehensive multi-sensor cumulative deformation map for the dam generated from space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from the Italian constellation COSMOSkyMed and the European Sentinel-1a satellite. We compared 2014-2016 data to an historic dataset spanning 2004-2010 acquired with the Envisat ASAR sensor. We found that deformation was rapid during 2004-2010, slowed down in 2012-2014, and restarted in August 2014 when grouting operations stopped due to the temporary capture of the dam by the self proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). We took advantage of the availability of data from multiple SAR satellites to infer the deformation at the dam in great spatial and temporal detail and shed new light on the processes of the ongoing destabilization.

In SEQUAL the assessment of the state of 'well-being' - from behaviors and biological signals - is holistic, meaning that the estimation of individual's health, emotional condition, activity and wishes, are from the beginning determined in relation to each other and in (individual's own) context, with superior results compared to when estimated independent from each other, as in common practice. Similarly, the prediction of a person's future condition, intentions, future needs, and actions/treatment/interventions are determined holistically. SEQUAL includes robots, mobility systems and assistive devices for physical intervention, as well as remote professional caregivers, family and friends, to provide intelligent assistance and support network, aiming for higher quality of life for both patient and caregiver.

A Fast Motion Planning Representation for Configuration Flat Robots with Applications to Micro Air Vehicles	2017 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference (ACC)	MAY 24-26, 2017	Seattle, WA	GE Global Res, Mitsubishi Elect Res Labs, Eaton, United Technologies Res Ctr, MathWorks, Amer Automat Control Council				Navigation of micro air vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environments is a complex sensing and trajectory generation task, particularly at high velocities. In this work, we introduce an efficient sense-and-avoid pipeline that compactly represents range measurements from multiple sensors, trajectory generation, and motion planning in a 2.5-dimensional projective data structure called an egospace representation. Egospace coordinates generalize depth image obstacle representations and are a particularly convenient choice for configuration flat mobile robots, which are differentially flat in their configuration variables and include a number of commonly used MAV plant models. After characterizing egospace obstacle avoidance for robots with trivial dynamics and establishing limits on applicability and performance, we generalize to motion planning over full configuration flat dynamics using motion primitives expressed directly in egospace coordinates. In comparison to approaches based on world coordinates, egospace uses the natural sensor geometry to combine the benefits of a multi-resolution and multi-sensor representation architecture into a single simple and efficient layer.

The 8-fingered gripper has 50 cm(2) of active electrodes operating at 3 kV. It generates electrostatic adhesion forces up to 3.5 N (0.70 kPa) on Ge-coated polyimide film and 1.2 N on MLI blanket, a film composite used for satellite thermal insulation. Extremely low-force gripper engagement (0.08 N) and release (0.04 N) of films is ideal for micro-gravity. Individual fingers generate shear adhesion forces up to 4.76 N (5.04 kPa) using electrostatic adhesive and 45.0 N (47.6 kPa) with a hybrid electrostatic / gecko adhesive.

Current state-of-theart planning approaches use sampling-based methods or trajectory optimization to obtain fast trajectories, whose safety is evaluated by taking into account the current state estimate of the environment. In unknown environments, however, this leads to numerous stops caused by the need for re-planning the trajectory due to unexpected obstacles. In this paper, we propose to use an active perception paradigm for planning. We predict the future uncertainty of the map and optimize trajectories to minimize re-planning risk. This leads to faster and safer trajectories. We evaluate the proposed planning approach in a series of simulation experiments, which show that we are able to achieve safer trajectories with a smaller number of re-planning stops and faster speeds.

For instance, if the task is to pour liquid from a container, the model encodes grasps that leave the opening of the container unobstructed. The model consists of two independent agents: First, a geometric grasp model that computes, from a depth image, a distribution of 6D grasp poses for which the shape of the gripper matches the shape of the underlying surface. The model relies on a dictionary of geometric object parts annotated with workable gripper poses and preshape parameters. It is learned from experience via kinesthetic teaching. The second agent is a CNN-based semantic model that identifies graspsuitable regions in a depth image: regions where a grasp will not impede the execution of the task. The semantic model allows us to encode relationships such as "grasp from the handle." A key element of this work is to use a deep network to integrate contextual task cues, and defer the structured-output problem of gripper pose computation to an explicit (learned) geometric model. Jointly, these two models generate grasps that are mechanically fit, and that grip on the object in a way that enables the intended task.

In this paper, we learn a manipulation model to execute tasks with multiple stages and variable structure, which typically are not suitable for most robot manipulation approaches. The model is learned from human demonstration using a tactile glove that measures both hand pose and contact forces. The tactile glove enables observation of visually latent changes in the scene, specifically the forces imposed to unlock the child-safety mechanisms of medicine bottles. From these observations, we learn an action planner through both a top-down stochastic grammar model (And-Or graph) to represent the compositional nature of the task sequence and a bottom-up discriminative model from the observed poses and forces. These two terms are combined during planning to select the next optimal action. We present a method for transferring this human-specific knowledge onto a robot platform and demonstrate that the robot can perform successful manipulations of unseen objects with similar task structure.

It is limited by communication constraints and to overcome this limitation, this paper formulates the process as a collaboration in which the human scientist and the robot work together to fill in gaps in knowledge to make discoveries. It introduces the science hypothesis map as the probabilistic structure in which scientists initially describe their abstract beliefs and hypotheses, and in which the state of this belief evolves as the robot makes raw measurements. It discusses how to incorporate path planning for maximizing scientific information gain, which is efficiently computed. As proof of concept, this paper describes a geologic exploration problem where a robot uses a spectrometer to infer the geologic composition of different regions in a mining district at Cuprite, Nevada. It shows that the science hypothesis map can infer geologic units with high accuracy, and that exploration using information gain-based path planning has better performance than exploration with conventional science-blind algorithms.

The design consists of a sensory glove that is capable of jointly collecting data of finger poses, hand poses, as well as forces on palm and each phalanx. Specifically, the sensory glove employs a network of 15 IMUs to measure the rotations between individual phalanxes. Hand pose is then reconstructed using forward kinematics. Contact forces on the palm and each phalanx are measured by 6 customized force sensors made from Velostat, a piezoresistive material whose force-voltage relation is investigated. We further develop an open-source software pipeline consisting of drivers and processing code and a system for visualizing hand actions that is compatible with the popular Raspberry Pi architecture. In our experiment, we conduct a series of evaluations that quantitatively characterize both individual sensors and the overall system, proving the effectiveness of the proposed design.

Workflow provenance is core to understand how services and workflows behaved in the past, which knowledge can be used to provide a better recommendation. Existing workflow provenance management systems handle various types of provenance separately. A typical data science exploration scenario, however, calls for an integrated view of provenance and seamless transition among different types of provenance. In this paper, a graph-based, uniform provenance model is proposed to link together design-time and run-time provenance, by combining retrospective provenance, prospective provenance, and evolution provenance. Such a unified provenance model will not only facilitate workflow mining and exploration, but also facilitate workflow interoperability. The model is formalized into colored Petri nets for verification and monitoring management. A SQL-like query language is developed, which supports basic queries, recursive queries, and cross-provenance queries. To verify the effectiveness of our model, A web-based, collaborative workflow prototyping system is developed as a proof-of-concept. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SQL-like graph query against SQL query.

Service recommendation typically relies on service linkage prediction calculated by the semantic distances (or similarities) among services based on their collection of inherent attributes. Given a specific context (mashup goal), however, different attributes may contribute differently to a service linkage. In this paper, instead of training a model for all attributes as a whole, a novel approach is presented to simultaneously train separate models for individual attributes. Meanwhile, a latent attribute modeling method is developed to reveal context-aware attribute distribution. Experiments over real-world datasets have demonstrated that this fine-grained method yields higher link prediction accuracy.

Now that the core protocols are complete, engineers are beginning to incorporate DTN into mission system designs. When we look across the NASA mission needs over the next decade, there are multiple ways DTN can work in concert with end-to-end mission system software to enhance mission capabilities or even enable new types of missions. DTN-enabled space systems can mitigate data loss when radio links are interrupted, improve the efficiency of operations by simplifying downlink planning, automate relay operations and enable coordinated operations among multiple spacecraft. This paper describes key elements of the protocol suite and software applications along with the mission capabilities they can enable.	[Wyatt, E.

Having a standard format for describing the telemetry and command formats allows for the development or adoption of compatible tools and significantly reduces the amount of custom software development often needed to ensure all system components have access to consistent format definitions. The main objective of this paper is to show how powerful XTCE is in terms of interoperability across organizations. This paper summarizes work which entailed converting the mission telemetry database for a current NASA mission, in XTCE format, into several target mission operation databases associated with different telemetry and command toolchains, and then, comparing the results of the telemetry processing and display. The target toolchains selected were Ball Aerospace/COSMOS, NASA-GSFC/ITOS (Goddard Space Flight Center/Integrated Test and Operations System), and NASA-AMMOS/AMPCS (Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System/Mission Data Processing and Control System) - all real-time telemetry and command processing systems.

The work of spacecraft navigation involves rigorous requirements for accuracy and completeness, often carried out under uncompromising critical time pressures. Robust and fault tolerant design for the ground data system is crucial for the numerous space missions we support, from the Mars rover Curiosity to Cassini in orbit around Saturn. We begin by examining the design principles learned from fault tolerant design efforts to protect against random failure, and consider computer security engineering as a derivative effort to protect against intelligent actors promoting malicious failure. Examples for best practices of reliable system design from computer and aviation industry are considered and security fault tolerance principles are derived from this effort. Computer security design approaches are reviewed, both as abstract principles (starting from cornerstones in Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and from implementation. Strategic design principles such as defense in depth, least privilege, and vulnerability removal are used in this design. We evaluate system design from external access data flows, through internal host security mechanisms, and finally to user access controls. A complementary intersection the balance between the protection of the system and promoting its ease of use by engineers (making their experience as user friendly and efficient as possible) is evaluated. Finally, we consider future refinements to secure system architecture.

Among DTN routing algorithms there is a dichotomy between opportunistic and deterministic (scheduled) solutions. The former are numerous and apply to terrestrial environments; CGR is the most widely supported algorithm designed for scheduled connectivity, and it is usually applied to space networks. However, in an attempt to provide a unified approach, an opportunistic variant of CGR, Opportunistic CGR (OCGR) has been recently proposed by some of the authors. Performance evaluations are normally carried out for opportunistic solutions by means of simulators, such as The ONE considered in this paper. CGR by contrast is more often studied by means of small testbeds. As the simulation approach could be complementary for CGR, and essential for OCGR, the authors have recently ported both of them into The ONE, by developing and releasing as free software a specific additional package. The aim of this paper is to show the rationale of this choice and discuss the many challenges that needed to be tackled to achieve this primary goal.

The thermal performance of the microcooler was measured in vacuum for heat reject temperatures between 185 and 300 K. The cooler was driven with a Chroma 61602 AC power source for input powers ranging from 10 to 60 W and drive frequency between 115 and 140 Hz during thermal performance testing. The optimal drive frequency was dependent on both input power and heat reject temperature. In addition, the microphonics of the cooler were measured with the cooler driven by Iris Technologies LCCE-2 and HP-LCCE drive electronics for input powers ranging from 10 to 60 W and drive frequency between 135 and 145 Hz. The exported forces were strongly dependent on input power while only weakly dependent on the drive frequency. Moreover, the exported force in the compressor axis was minimized by closed loop control with the HP-LCCE. The cooler also survived a 500 krad radiation dose while being continuously operated with 30 W of input power at 220 K heat rejection temperature in vacuum. Finally, the DC and AC magnetic fields around the cooler were measured at various locations.	[McKinley, I. M.; Hummel, C. D.; Johnson, D. L.; Rodriguez, J.

The cooler system design has been incrementally documented in previous publications [1][2][3][4][5]. It has components that traverse three primary thermal regions on JWST: Region 1, approximated by 40K; Region 2, approximated by 100K; and Region 3, which is at the allowable flight temperatures for the spacecraft bus. However, there are several sub-regions that exist in the transition between primary regions and at the heat reject interfaces of the Cooler Compressor Assembly (CCA) and Cooler Control Electronics Assembly (CCEA). The design and performance of the test facility to provide a flight representative thermal environment for acceptance testing and characterization of the complete MIRI cooler subsystem are presented.

The high-density two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure is used to screen out the lateral electric field and switch off the piezoelectric transducer. By properly selecting the thickness-to -wavelength ratio, the proposed Lamb wave delay line only exhibits zero-order symmetric (S0) and anti-symmetric (A0) Lamb wave mode responses, while providing significant spurious mode reduction up to 26.5 GHz. The Lamb wave delay lines show superior performance in terms of insertion loss and out-of-band rejection over conventional surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and also achieve a good linearity.

Current methods for communication and tracking of deep space probes use ground based systems such as the Deep Space Network (DSN). However, the increased communication demand will require radically new methods to ease communication congestion. Networks of communication relay satellites located at strategic locations such as geostationary orbit and Lagrange points are potential solutions. Instead of one large communication relay satellite, we could have scores of small satellites that utilize phase arrays to effectively operate as one large satellite. Excess payload capacity on rockets can be used to warehouse more small satellites in the communication network. The advantage of this network is that even if one or a few of the satellites are damaged or destroyed, the network still operates but with degraded performance. The satellite network would operate in a distributed architecture and some satellites maybe dynamically repurposed to split and communicate with multiple targets at once. The potential for this alternate communication architecture is significant, but this requires development of satellite formation flying and networking technologies. Our research has found neural-network control approaches such as the Artificial Neural Tissue can be effectively used to control multirobot/multi-spacecraft systems and can produce human competitive controllers. We have been developing a laboratory experiment platform called Athena to develop critical spacecraft control algorithms and cognitive communication methods. We briefly report on the development of the platform and our plans to gain insight into communication phase arrays for space.

Detailed algorithms are derived and covariance of calibration residuals in both error state and target position determination accuracy are obtained. An example with system design parameters is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches. The algorithm can be used for any terrestrial or space position determination instruments employing a camera/laser triangulation system and is proposed, as one application, for the PIXL instrument of JPL's MARS 2020 Rover project.

Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigations & Analysis (AMELIA) by ExoMars 2016 Schiaparelli Entry Descent Module The ExoMars Entry, Descent and Landing Science	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON METROLOGY FOR AEROSPACE (METROAEROSPACE)	IEEE Metrology for AeroSpace		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for AeroSpace	JUN 21-23, 2017	Univ Degli Studi Padova, Padua, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Instrumentat Measurement Soc, AES Chapter IEEE Italy Sect	Univ Degli Studi Padova	Mars; Entry Descent and Landing (EDL); dynamical models; trajectory; attitude; atmospheric investigations		On the 19th October 2016, Schiaparelli, the Entry Demonstrator Module (EDM) of the ESA ExoMars Program entered into the martian atmosphere. Although it did not complete a safe landing on Mars, it transmitted data throughout its descent to the surface, until the loss of signal at 1 minute before the expected touch-down on Mars' surface. The main objective of the Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigations and Analysis (AMELIA) experiment was the assessment of the atmospheric science and landing site by exploiting the Entry Descent and Landing System (EDLS) sensors of Schiaparelli beyond their designed role of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the EDL technology demonstrator. Although more limited than expected, the flight data received from Schiaparelli are essential to investigate the anomaly that caused the crash landing and for the achievement of the AMELIA scientific objectives. We will present our methodology and results for the reconstruction of the dynamics of the vehicles during the EDL phases from the available flight data in order to assess the trajectory and attitude of the Schiaparelli EDM and to retrieve the atmospheric profiles.

An on-chip direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) digitally generates the chirping waveform which then drives a ring oscillator based K-u-Band phase-locked loop (PLL) to provide the final Ku-band FMCW signal. Employing a ring oscillator as oppose to a tuned inductor based oscillator (LC-VCO) allows the radar to achieve wider chirp bandwidth resulting in a higher axial resolution (7.5cm) which is needed to accurately quantify the snowpack profile. The demonstrated radar chip is fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process, and it consumes 250mW of power under 1.1V supply, making its payload requirements suitable for observations from a small UAV.

The amplifier chips were fabricated in Northrop Grumman Corporation's (NGC) 35-nm InP HEMT technology and packaged in WR15 waveguide housings utilizing alumina E-plane waveguide probes. The amplifier modules achieve 18 to 27 K noise temperatures from 50 to 75 GHz when cryogenically cooled to 21 K. When measured through a mylar vacuum window, a cascade of two amplifier modules achieves a receiver noise temperature of 18.5 K at 58 GHz. A second chain has a measured receiver noise temperature between 20 to 28 K for the whole V-band. To the best of authors' knowledge, these are the lowest LNA noise temperatures for V-Band reported to date.

The input feeding is based on (N) E field probes employing capacitive resonance, feeding a wave-guide with artificial dielectrics (ADs). The signal summation occurs on a single transverse plane, thus providing insertion losses which do not scale with the number of inputs. This results in a combiner more compact and without restriction in the number of inputs compared to the traditional power of two (2(N)) combiners. The power combiner operation is presented in a BiCMOS technology implementation and analyzed by means of full wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Finally, the experimental results of an integrated 4: 1 back-to-back-combiner operating in the 240-310GHz band is presented and compared with the full EM model.

The proposed digital pre-distortion technique first power combines the leakage signal with a second pre-distorting signal prior to entering the radar receiver. The Phase & amplitude of this pre-distorting signal are adjusted for partitions of the FMCW chirp to provide cancellation.

Conventional high-speed connectors in interconnect standard such as USB, HDMI, DP, and Thunderbolt are not only expensive, but also suffer poor performance in both mechanical reliability and signal integrity often becoming a bottleneck in high-performance computing systems. The proposed CWC exploits a 125GHz CMOS transmitter (TX), receiver (RX), and compact FR4 PCB antenna to realize high-speed (>10Gb/s), low-cost, and energy-efficient connector solutions. An on-off keying (OOK) modulation is utilized for a non-coherent transceiver (TRX) architecture. In addition, antennas are designed on an FR4HR substrate for a compatibility with an existing infrastructure. The CMOS TX and RX is assembled with the antenna through a flip-chip process. The demonstrated CWC draws a total of 60mW of power under 1.1V supply while transferring 14Gb/s of data rate, achieving 4.28pJ/bit energy efficiency.

Such a telescope could study the origins of stars, planets, molecular clouds, and galaxies; providing a much needed means of following-up on tantalizing results from recent successful missions such as Spitzer, Herschel, SOFIA, and, in the near future, JWST. Indeed, Herschel began its life in the US space program as the Large Deployable Reflector (LDR) - to be assembled in low Earth orbit by shuttle astronauts. Escalating costs and smaller federal budget allocations resulted in a downsizing of the mission. However, by combining break-through technologies utilizing spherical reflectors and inflatable structures, the dream of a 10+ meter class space telescope can be realized. The same telescope technology can also be used to perform sensitive, high spectral and spatial resolution limb sounding studies of the Earth's atmosphere in greenhouse gases such as CO, ClO, O3, and water, as well as serve as a high flying hub for any number of telecommunications and surveillance activities. In our paper we discuss the prospects of using inflatable, spherical reflectors to realize a similar to 25 meter TeraHertz Space telescope (TST).

Here, we describe the unique geometries and sampling strategies that GNSS-R provide, which come with both advantages and limitations visa-vis traditional remote sensing techniques for monitoring the freeze/thaw transition. We will compare observational GNSS-R data in the northern high latitudes with cotemporaneous L-band radiometer and radar data to highlight these advantages and limitations.

The TS ranges were within the IPC9701 specification: TC4; -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C and TC5, -55 degrees C to +100 degrees C. Two facilities were used for testing. The first facility simply performed TC5, TS, to determine the effect cycling alone whereas the second facility evaluated several additional parameters. The variables include 250 hours of 125 degrees C aging prior to TC4 thermal shock as well as including single-sided and double-sided assembly of the QFN devices. This allowed comparison of reliability for these conditions. Microstructural analysis, pre- and post isothermal again and thermal shock testing enabled a mechanistic analysis of the solder fatigue behavior.

An egocentric cylindrical representation is utilized to model the world using forward-looking stereo vision. This efficient representation enables a 360 degrees field of regard, as the vehicle moves around and disparity maps are fused temporally on the cylindrical map. For this purpose, we developed a new Gaussian Mixture Models-based disparity image fusion algorithm, with an extension to handle independently moving objects (IMO). The extension improves scene models in case of moving objects, where standard temporal fusion approaches cannot detect movers and introduce errors in world models due to the common static scene assumption. The on-board implementation of the vision pipeline provides disparity maps on a 360 degrees egocentric cylindrical surface at 10 Hz. The perception output is used in our system by real-time motion planning with collision avoidance on the MAV.

Several aspects of the analysis are paid particular attention. First is the modeling of a thermal blanket at a small stand-off distance from the box chassis. The properties of the blanket are such that under some assumptions, it may be treated as an effective bumper shield, and under other assumptions, it may not. The assumptions and their effects on the results of the analysis are explored. Similarly, the configuration of the electronic components inside the chassis are such that several definitions of failure criteria appear plausible. The results of each treatment are presented together and compared with the status of the actual electronics box. The failure predictions vary widely between treatments, and the more conservative assumption sets predict incredulously high probabilities of failure. This is problematic because the conservative assumptions are the ones typically used in analyses for flight projects. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Martin			Ballistic limit equations for non-aluminum projectiles impacting dual-wall spacecraft systems	14TH HYPERVELOCITY IMPACT SYMPOSIUM (HVIS 2017)	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	14th Hypervelocity Impact Symposium (HVIS)	APR 24-28, 2017	Univ Kent, Canterbury Campus, Canterbury, ENGLAND		Univ Kent, Canterbury Campus	ballistic limit equation; non-aluminum projectiles; dual-wall structure; orbital debris; risk assessment		One of the primary design considerations of earth-orbiting spacecraft is the mitigation of the damage that might occur from an on-orbit MMOD impact. Traditional damage-resistant design consists of a 'bumper' that is placed a small distance away from a spacecraft component or from the wall of the element in which it is housed. The performance of such a multi-wall structural element is typically characterized by its ballistic limit equation (BLE), which defines the threshold particle size that results in a failure of the spacecraft element. BLEs are also key components of any micro-meteoroid/orbital debris (MMOD) risk assessment calculations. However, these assessments often call for BLEs to predict impact response for projectiles made of materials not used in the development of those BLEs. The question naturally arises regarding how close are the predictions of such BLEs when used in impact scenarios involving projectiles made of materials not necessarily considered in their development. In an effort to address this issue, a study was performed with the objective of assessing the validity of the NNO BLE for non-aluminum particles. Particle materials considered included steel, copper, and A1203 (i.e. particles that are made of materials that are more dense than aluminum). Comparisons are made between actual test results involving these non-aluminum projectiles and the predictions of the NNO BLE. In nearly all cases, the NNO BLE was found not to work very well in the predicting failure / no failure response of these non-aluminum projectiles. A new NNO-type BLE is then developed that can be used to more reliably predict the response of dual-wall systems under the hypervelocity impact of such "heavier" non-aluminum projectiles.

WFIRST will settle essential questions in both exoplanet and dark energy research and will advance topics ranging from galaxy evolution to the study of objects within the galaxy. The WFIRST mission uses a repurposed 2.4-m Forward Optical Telescope assembly (FOA), which, when completed with new aft optics will be an Integrated Optical Assembly (IOA). WFIRST is equipped with a Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and a Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). An Instrument Carrier (IC) meters these payload elements together and to the spacecraft bus (S/C). A distributed ground system receives the data, uploads commands and software updates, and processes the data. After transition from the study phase, Pre-Phase-A (a.k.a., "Cycle 6") design to NASA Phase A formulation, a significant change to the IOA was initiated; including moving the tertiary mirror from the instrument package to a unified three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) placement, that provides a wide 0.28-sq degrees instrumented field of view to the Wide Field Instrument (WFI). In addition, separate relays from the primary and secondary mirror feed the Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). During commissioning the telescope is aligned using wavefront sensing with the WFI[2]. A parametric and Monte-Carlo analysis was performed, which determined that alignment compensation with the secondary mirror alone degraded performance in the other instruments. This led to the addition of a second compensator in the WFI optical train to alleviate this concern. This paper discusses the trades and analyses that were performed and resulting changes to the WFIRST telescope architecture.

It has been designed to be deployed and reconfigured easily for scientific applications. These applications include both geospace and astronomy experiments where a relatively small and sparse aperture is sufficient in size. Examples include the study of ionospheric turbulence using active and passive radar imaging, astronomical observations of galactic synchrotron emission, and localization of bright radio emissions such as those from the Sun and Jupiter. The high degree of mobility afforded by the system enables interferometric configurations that are tailored to specific experiments and can be changed in the field. RAPID can also be deployed to locations that are optimal for specific scientific objectives or that complement other existing facilities by adding baselines or serving as a separate imaging receiver array.

In this article, we focus on the localization aspect of the technology. The technique requires a minimum of two nodes, of which one is mobile and can be located in the sub-surface, whereas the second is located at a fixed location above the over-burden. To simplify the proof-of-concept, we use a fixed transmitter device located above the ground, and a mobile receiver device located within a cave system, below the over-burden. By sensing and inverting the MQS field detected at the receiver, we were able to solve for positions of the mobile receiver device.

These recent works demonstrate the ability to determine the position of a mobile device in 2D space over ranges of up to many ten's of meters and in non-line-of-sight environment, due to use of MQS fields. One additional advantage of the recent theory and technique is that the solutions for range, azimuthal-direction, and orientation of the device are decoupled and can be solved in a low-latency environment. In this article, we demonstrate a low-latency solution for MQS positioning in a large 2D space.

In this context, an appealing RRN case study is presented and evaluated through simulations based on Delay/Disruption-tolerant Network (DTN) protocols and algorithms.

Satellite observations can provide information on the atmospheric state at fine spatial and temporal resolution while providing substantial coverage across the globe. For example, this capability can greatly enhance the understanding of the space-time variation of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), since ground-based measurements are limited. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) collects tens of thousands of observations of reflected sunlight daily, and the mission's retrieval algorithm processes these indirect measurements into estimates of atmospheric CO2. The retrieval is an inverse problem and consists of a physical forward model for the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere that includes absorption and scattering by gases, aerosols, and the surface. The model and other algorithm inputs introduce key sources of uncertainty into the retrieval problem. This article develops a computationally efficient surrogate model that is embedded in a simulation experiment for studying the impact of uncertain inputs on the distribution of the retrieval error.

The high contrast is achieved by utilizing slit and surface plasmon polariton resonances in an array of gold lines filled with a phase change material (Germanium Telluride-GeTe). Stacking multiple layers of the phase change plasmonic grating enabled development of the high-index modulator in chip scale dimensions at telecommunication wavelength. Coupling the optical modes of multiple layers results in such a high contrast when GeTe goes through crystallographic phase transition. Phase transition through joule-heating is achieved by employing a matching circuit.

This starshade is flown between the telescope and the star, and suppresses stellar light sufficiently to allow the imaging of the faint reflected light of the planet. This paper presents a mechanical architecture for this occulter, which must stow in a 5 m-diameter launch fairing and then deploy to about a 80 m diameter structure. The optical performance of the starshade requires that the edge profile is accurate and stable. The stowage and deployment of the starshade to meet these requirements present unique challenges that are addressed in this proposed architecture. The mechanical architecture consists of a number of petals attached to a deployable perimeter truss, which is connected to central hub using tensioned spokes. The petals are furled around the stowed perimeter truss for launch. Herein is described a mechanical design solution that supports an 80 m-class starshade for flight as part of HabEx.

However, for a starshade to generate a sufficiently dark shadow on the telescope, the two must be coaligned to just 1 meter laterally, even at these large separations. The principal challenge to achieving this level of control is in determining the position of the starshade with respect to the space telescope. In this paper, we present numerical simulations and laboratory results demonstrating that a Zernike wavefront sensor coupled to a WFIRST-type telescope is able to deliver the stationkeeping precision required, by measuring light outside of the science wavelengths. The sensor can determine the starshade lateral position to centimeter level in seconds of open shutter time for stars brighter than eighth magnitude, with a capture range of 10 meters. We discuss the potential for fast (ms) tip/tilt pointing control at the milli-arcsecond level by illuminating the sensor with a laser mounted on the starshade. Finally, we present early laboratory results.

The SPC provides starlight suppression in a pair of wedge-shaped regions over an 18% bandpass, and is well suited for spectroscopy of known exoplanets. To demonstrate this starlight suppression in the presence of expected on orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have recently built a dynamic testbed at JPL analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture, with both Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and SPC architectures and a Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to apply, sense, and correct dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present our best up-to-date results of the SPC mode demonstration from the testbed, in both static and dynamic conditions, along with model comparisons. HLC results will be reported separately.

Key to the science of direct imaging is the spectroscopic capabilities of the instrument, our ability to fit spectra, and understanding the composition of the observed planets. Direct imaging instruments generally use an integral field spectrograph (IFS), which encodes the spectrum into a two-dimensional image on the detector. This results in more efficient detection and characterization of targets, and the spectral information is critical to achieving detection limits below the speckle floor of the imager. The most mature application of these techniques is at more modest contrast ratios on ground-based telescopes, achieving approximately 5-6 orders of magnitude suppression. In space, where we are attempting to detect Earth-analogs, the contrast requirements are more severe and the IFS must be incorporated into the wavefront control loop to reach le-10 detection limits required for Earth-like planet detection. We present the objectives and application of IFS imagery for both a speckle control loop and post-processing of images. Results, tested methodologies, and the future work using the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) and the Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies (PISCES) at the JPL High Contrast Imaging Testbed are presented.

Two key aspects to advancing starshade technology are the demonstration of starlight suppression to the level required for flight and validation of optical models at this high level of suppression. These technologies are addressed in current efforts underway at the Princeton Starshade Testbed. We report on results from modeling the performance of the Princeton Starshade Testbed to help achieve the milestone 10(-9) suppression. We use our optical model to examine the effects that errors in the occulting mask shape and external environmental factors have on the limiting suppression. We look at deviations from the ideal occulter shape such as over-etching during the lithography process, edge roughness of the mask, and random defects introduced during manufacturing. We also look at the effects of dust and wavefront errors in the open-to-atmosphere testbed. These results are used to set fabrication requirements on the starshade and constraints on the testbed environment. We use detailed measurements of the manufactured occulting mask to converge towards agreement between our modeled performance predictions and the suppression measured in the testbed, thereby building confidence in the validity of the optical models. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and practicalities of scaling to a larger testbed to further advance the optical aspect of starshade technology.

In order to achieve an optimal trade-off between planet light throughput and diffracted starlight suppression, we consider coronagraphs comprised of a stage of phase control implemented with deformable mirrors (or other optical elements), pupil plane apodization masks (gray scale or complex valued), and focal plane masks (either amplitude only or complex-valued, including phase only such as the vector vortex coronagraph). The optimization of these optical elements, with the goal of achieving 10 or more orders of magnitude in the suppression of on-axis (starlight) diffracted light, represents a challenging non-convex optimization problem with a nonlinear dependence on control degrees of freedom. We develop a new algorithmic approach to the design optimization problem, which we call the "Auxiliary Field Optimization" (AFO) algorithm. The central idea of the algorithm is to embed the original optimization problem, for either phase or amplitude (apodization) in various planes of the coronagraph, into a problem containing additional degrees of freedom, specifically fictitious "auxiliary" electric fields which serve as targets to inform the variation of our phase or amplitude parameters leading to good feasible designs. We present the algorithm, discuss details of its numerical implementation, and prove convergence to local minima of the objective function (here taken to be the intensity of the on-axis source in a "dark hole" region in the science focal plane). Finally, we present results showing application of the algorithm to both unobscured off-axis and obscured on-axis segmented telescope aperture designs. The application of the AFO algorithm to the coronagraph design problem has produced solutions which are capable of directly imaging planets in the habitable zone, provided end-to-end telescope system stability requirements can be met. Ongoing work includes advances of the AFO algorithm reported here to design in additional robustness to a resolved star, and other phase or amplitude aberrations to be encountered in a real segmented aperture space telescope.

We have demonstrated a new concept for speckle nulling by injecting directly imaged planet light into a single-mode fiber, linking a high-contrast adaptively-corrected coronagraph to a high-resolution spectrograph (diffraction-limited or not). The restrictions on the incident electric field that will couple into the single-mode fiber give the adaptive optics system additional degrees of freedom to suppress the speckle noise on top of destructive interference. We are able to achieve a starlight suppression gains that are an order of magnitude better than conventional techniques in broadband light with minimal planet throughput losses.

The payload will include a coronagraph instrument (CGI). The CGI designs under development use deformable mirrors (DM) to create a point spread function (PSF) with a dark region around the obscured star object. Electric field conjugation (EFC) is an iterative nonlinear optimization procedure that uses measurements of the electric field at the image to determine the DM displacements that modify the PSF to create the region of high contrast in the image. EFC requires a numerical model of the coronagraph to calculate the Jacobian of the system, which is used, along with regularization, to solve for the DM displacements for each iteration of the nonlinear optimization. Ideally, the coronagraph is aligned and calibrated, and the calibration data are used in the numerical model for calculating the Jacobian. However, calibration and alignment measurements always contain uncertainty resulting in calibration error. Therefore, the Jacobian calculated from the numerical model is not an exact representation of the physical coronagraph, and the resulting DM solution for an EFC iteration does not have the exact impact on the electric field of the coronagraph as predicted by the EFC. The result is slow convergence, and, as will be shown, the necessity of more restrictive regularization. Using Monte Carlo trials, we investigate the effect of calibration error on EFC convergence and regularization. Comparison to results from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph are also presented.

The high-contrast imaging system serves as a spatial filter to separate the light from the star and the planet while the high-resolution spectrograph acts as a spectral filter, which differentiates between features in the stellar and planetary spectra. The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) located downstream from the current W. M. Keck II adaptive optics (AO) system will contain a fiber injection unit (FIU) combining a high-contrast imaging system and a fiber feed to Kecks high resolution infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC. Resolved thermal emission from known young giant exoplanets will be injected into a single-mode fiber linked to NIRSPEC, thereby allowing the spectral characterization of their atmospheres. Moreover, the resolution of NIRSPEC (R = 37,500) is high enough to enable spin measurements and Doppler imaging of atmospheric weather phenomenon. The module will be integrated and tested at Caltech before being transferred to Keck in 2018.	[Mawet, D.; Delorme, J.

EXOSIMS has been adopted by the Exoplanet Exploration Programs Standards Definition and Evaluation Team (ExSDET) as a common mechanism for comparison of exoplanet mission concept studies. To ensure trustworthiness of the tool, we developed a validation test plan that leverages the Python-language unit-test framework, utilizes integration tests for selected module interactions, and performs end-to-end crossvalidation with other yield tools. This paper presents the test methods and results, with the physics-based tests such as photometry and integration time calculation treated in detail and the functional tests treated summarily. The test case utilized a 4m unobscured telescope with an idealized coronagraph and an exoplanet population from the IPAC radial velocity (RV) exoplanet catalog. The known RV planets were set at quadrature to allow deterministic validation of the calculation of physical parameters, such as working angle, photon counts and integration time. The observing keepout region was tested by generating plots and movies of the targets and the keepout zone over a year. Although the keepout integration test required the interpretation of a user, the test revealed problems in the L2 halo orbit and the parameterization of keepout applied to some solar system bodies, which the development team was able to address. The validation testing of EXOSIMS was performed iteratively with the developers of EXOSIMS and resulted in a more robust, stable, and trustworthy tool that the exoplanet community can use to simulate exoplanet direct-detection missions from probe class, to WFIRST, up to large mission concepts such as HabEx and LUVOIR.

The main technical challenge in direct detection comes from three areas: starlight suppression, low flux detection, and speckle stabilization in the dark zone where the planet or disk light is to be detected. These three aspects in turn place requirements on key instrument parameters such as system throughput, raw contrast and detector effects. The link between instrument limitations and instrument performance is captured in models, and balanced using error budgets. Instrument performance can be measured in terms of the science yield, which is itself limited by available mission time and the instrument sensitivity floor. In this paper, we present an overview of the modeling and methodology to assess the sensitivity of the coronagraph and some of the key results pertaining to the WFIRST coronagraph.

Early CGI designs focused on overcoming the diffraction of the large pupil obscurations. Now that those designs have been proven to work in the lab, the design emphasis has been on achieving higher throughput and lower sensitivities to jitter and polarization aberrations.

To achieve this goal, coronagraphic instruments have favored integral field spectrographs (IFS) as the science cameras to disperse the entire search area at once and obtain spectra at each location, since the planet position is not known a priori. These spectrographs are useful against confusion from speckles and background objects, and can also help in the speckle subtraction and wavefront control stages of the coronagraphic observation. We present a software package, the Coronagraph and Rapid Imaging Spectrograph in Python (crispy) to simulate the IFS of the WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). The software propagates input science cubes using spatially and spectrally resolved coronagraphic focal plane cubes, transforms them into IFS detector maps and ultimately reconstructs the spatio-spectral input scene as a 3D datacube. Simulated IFS cubes can be used to test data extraction techniques, refine sensitivity analyses and carry out design trade studies of the flight CGI-IFS instrument. crispy is a publicly available Python package and can be adapted to other IFS designs.

Since being selected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in December 2013, the coronagraph technology is being matured to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by 2018. To demonstrate starlight suppression in presence of expecting on-orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have built a dynamic testbed in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2016. This testbed, named as Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed, is designed analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture: It has both HLC and Shape Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) architectures, and also has the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to sense and correct the dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present upto-date progress of HLC mode demonstration in the OMC testbed. SPC results will be reported separately. We inject the flight-like Line of Sight (LoS) and Wavefront Error (WFE) perturbation to the OMC testbed and demonstrate wavefront control using two deformable mirrors while the LOWFS/C is correcting those perturbation in our vacuum testbed. As a result, we obtain repeatable convergence below 5 x 10(-9) mean contrast with 10% broadband light centered at 550 nm in the 360 degrees dark hole with working angle between 3 lambda/D and 9 lambda/D. We present the key hardware and software used in the testbed, the performance results and their comparison to model expectations.

With smaller telescopes, the targets tend to be brighter and closer to the Solar System, and their putative planetary systems span angles that require starshades with radii of 10-30 m at distances of 10s of Mm. With larger apertures, the light-collecting power enables studies of more numerous, fainter systems, requiring larger, more distant starshades with radii >50 m at distances of 100s of Mm. Characterization using infrared wavelengths requires even larger starshades. A mitigating approach is to observe planets between the petals, where one can observe regions closer to the star but with reduced throughput and increased instrument scatter. We compare the starshade shape requirements, including petal shape, petal positioning, and other key terms, for the WFIRST 26m starshade and the HABEX 72 m starshade concepts, over a range of working angles and telescope sizes. We also compare starshades having rippled and smooth edges and show that their performance is nearly identical.

The LOWFS/C uses a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) with the phase shifting disk combined with the starlight rejecting occulting mask. For wavefront error corrections, WFIRST LOWFS/C uses a fast steering mirror (FSM) for line-of-sight (LoS) correction, a focusing mirror for focus drift correction, and one of the two deformable mirrors (DM) for other low order wavefront error (WFE) correction. As a part of technology development and demonstration for WFIRST Coronagraph, a dedicated Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed has been built and commissioned. With its configuration similar to the WFIRST flight coronagraph instrument the OMC testbed consists of two coronagraph modes, Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) and Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC), a low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS), and an optical telescope assembly (OTA) simulator which can generate realistic LoS drift and jitter as well as low order wavefront error that would be induced by the WFIRST telescope's vibration and thermal changes. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of WFIRST LOWFS/C, describe the OMC testbed, and present the testbed results of LOWFS sensor performance. We will also present our recent results from the dynamic coronagraph tests in which we have demonstrated of using LOWFS/C to maintain the coronagraph contrast with the presence of WFIRST-like line-of-sight and low order wavefront disturbances.

Considered case include drifts in actuator gains or actuator response curves, paired actuators, as well as the limits imposed by a neighboring-actuator rule. Actual data about the actuator drifts and the knowledge about the paired-actuators obtained in several DM characterization experiments conducted at JPL, as well as the neighboring-actuator rule implemented on the OMC testbed were used in simulations. We obtained good agreement between the model prediction and the testbed measurement in terms of static HLC contrast floor and contrast chromaticity.

In addition to the diffracted and scattered light for the on-axis star, a multi-star system features additional starlight leakage from the off-axis star that must also be controlled. A basic option is for additional starshades to block the off axis stars. An interesting option takes the form of hybrid operation of a starshade in conjunction with an internal starlight suppression. Two hybrid scenarios are considered. One such scenario includes the coronagraph instrument blocking the on-axis star, with the starshade blocking off-axis starlight. Another scenario uses the wavefront control system in the coronagraph instrument and using a recent Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC) technique can remove the off-axis stars leakage to enable a region of high-contrast around the on-axis star blocked by the starshade. We present simulation results relevant for the WFIRST telescope.

The dust grains coalesce into structures reminiscent of early solar system formation; their composition has been predicted through simulations and some edge-on observations but better data is required to validate them. Scattered light from these dust grains presents challenges to exoplanet imaging missions: resolution of their stellar environment is hindered by exozodiacal emissions and therefore sets the size and scope of these imaging missions. Understanding the composition of this interplanetary dust in our solar system requires an imaging mission from a vantage point above the ecliptic plane. The high surface brightness of the zodiacal light requires only a small aperture with moderate sensitivity; therefore a 3cm camera is enough to meet the science goals of the mission at an orbital height of 0.1AU above the ecliptic. A 6U CubeSat is the target mass for this mission which will be a secondary payload detaching from an existing interplanetary mission. Planetary flybys are utilized to produce most of the plane change Delta v; deep space corrective maneuvers are implemented to optimize each planetary flyby. We developed an algorithm which determines the minimum Delta v required to place the CubeSat on a transfer orbit to a planet's sphere of influence and maximizes the resultant orbital height with respect to the ecliptic plane. The satellite could reach an orbital height of 0.22 AU with an Earth gravity assist in late 2024 by boarding the Europa Clipper mission.

Currently at Princeton and JPL, two control schemes are being employed: electric field conjugation (EFC) and stroke minimization. Both of them are based on a linearized state transition model and both have achieved great success over the past decade. In this paper, we develop a general framework for the control system and improve upon the robustness of wavefront controllers from the perspective of stochastic optimization. We start by analyzing the model uncertainty and reformulating the wavefront control as a stochastic optimization problem. Then, we apply this idea to a recently proposed linear constraint wavefront controller and develop a robust version. According to the numerical simulations, the robust linear controller reveals the potential for creating more uniform dark holes. In experiment, the robust linear controller achieves at least as good performance as Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and stroke minimization.	[Sun, He; Kasdin, N.

We have developed an automated data architecture to process and index all data related to the survey uniformly. An automated and flexible data processing framework, which we term the GPIES Data Cruncher, combines multiple data reduction pipelines together to intelligently process all spectroscopic, polarimetric, and calibration data taken with GPIES. With no human intervention, fully reduced and calibrated data products are available less than an hour after the data are taken to expedite follow-up on potential objects of interest. The Data Cruncher can run on a supercomputer to reprocess all GPIES data in a single day as improvements are made to our data reduction pipelines. A backend MySQL database indexes all files, which are synced to the cloud, and a front-end web server allows for easy browsing of all files associated with GPIES. To help observers, quicklook displays show reduced data as they are processed in real-time, and chatbots on Slack post observing information as well as reduced data products. Together, the GPIES automated data processing architecture reduces our workload, provides real-time data reduction, optimizes our observing strategy, and maintains a homogeneously reduced dataset to study planet occurrence and instrument performance.

Future mission concepts under study by the 2020 decadal survey, e.g., HabEx and LUVOIR, have the potential of achieving this goal. We investigate the baseline requirements for detecting four molecular species, H2O, O-2, CH4, and CO2. These molecules are highly relevant to habitability and life activity on Earth and other planets. Through numerical simulations, we find the minimum requirement for spectral resolution (R) and starlight suppression level (C) for a given exposure time. We consider scenarios in which different molecules are detected. For example, R = 6400 (400) and C = 5 x 10(-10) (2 x 10(-9)) are required for HabEx (LUVOIR) to detect O-2 and H2O for an exposure time of 400 hours for an Earth analog around a solar-type star at a distance of 5 pc. The full results are given in Table 2. The impact of exo-zodiacal contamination and thermal background is also discussed.

We present our modeling method and results of comparisons to testbed's high order wavefront correction performance for the shaped pupil coronagraph. Agreement between model prediction and testbed result at better than a factor of 2 has been consistently achieved in raw contrast (contrast floor, chromaticity, and convergence), and with that comes good agreement in contrast sensitivity to wavefront perturbations and mask lateral shear.

The equations of motion are formulated in a preconditioned form using kinematic substructuring with a heuristic application of Generalized Coordinate Partitioning (GCP). This results in an optimal split of dependent and independent variables during run time. It also allows reliable handling of end of stroke conditions and bifurcations in mechanisms, thereby facilitating dynamic simulation of paradoxical linkages such as Bricard's mechanism that has been known to cause problems with some multibody dynamic codes. The new Preconditioned Equations of Motion are then solved using a recursive formulation of the Schur Complement Method combined with Sparse Matrix Techniques. In this fashion the Preconditioned Equations of Motion are recursively uncoupled and solved one kinematic substructure at a time. The results are demonstrated using examples.

This paper seeks to investigate the suitability of several different open and closed loop control techniques for application to the problem of end effector position control with minimal vibration for a low stiffness space based manipulator. Simulations of a representative planar problem with two flexible links are used to measure performance and sensitivity to parameter variation of: model predictive control, command shaping, and command shaping with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback. An experimental testbed is then used to validate simulation results for the recommended command shaped controller.

Performing these tasks while using minimal mass/volume systems and with low energy consumption is another set of requirements imposed on such technologies. A deep drill, called Auto-Gopher II, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Corp. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary-hammer drill that combines formation breaking by hammering using an ultrasonic actuator and cuttings removal by rotating a fluted auger bit. The hammering mechanism is based on the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to transform high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher and then integrated into a rotary hammer device to develop the Auto-Gopher-I. The lessons learned from these developments are being integrated into the development of the Auto-Gopher-II, an autonomous deep wireline drill with integrated cuttings and sample management and drive electronics. Subsystems of the wireline drill are being developed in parallel at JPL and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. This paper presents the development efforts of the piezoelectric actuator, cuttings removal and retention flutes and drive electronics.

Prior approaches have mainly been either purely reactive, mapping low-level visual features directly to headings, or deliberative methods that use onboard 3-D sensors to create a 3-D, voxel-based world model, then generate 3-D trajectories and check them for potential collisions with the world model. Onboard 3-D sensor suites have had limited fields of view. We use forward-looking stereo vision and lateral structure from motion to give a very wide horizontal and vertical field of regard. We fuse depth maps from these sources in a novel robot-centered, cylindrical, inverse range map we call an egocylinder. Configuration space expansion directly on the egocylinder gives a very compact representation of visible freespace. This supports very efficient motion planning and collision-checking with better performance guarantees than standard reactive methods. We show the feasibility of this approach experimentally in a challenging outdoor environment.

By strategically exploiting turbulence-induced "gravity fluctuations," our technique enables a new experimental approach for testing surface interactions of robotic systems in micro-to milli-gravity environments. This strategy is used to evaluate the performance of internally-actuated hopping rovers designed for controlled surface mobility on small Solar System bodies. In experiments, these rovers demonstrated a range of maneuvers on various surfaces, including both rigid and granular. Results are compared with analytical predictions and numerical simulations, yielding new insights into the dynamics and control of hopping rovers.

The HydroCube satellites would operate at sun-synchronous 3-day repeat polar orbits with a spatial resolution of about 1-3 Km. The mission goals would be to improve the estimation of terrestrial water storage and weather forecasts. Root-zone soil moisture and snow water storage in land are critical parameters of the water cycle. The HydroCube Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) concept utilizes passive receivers to detect the reflection of strong existing P-band radio signals from geostationary Mobile Use Objective System (MUOS) communication satellites. The SWE remote sensing measurement principle using the P-band SoOp is based on the propagation delay (or phase change) of radio signals through the snowpack. The time delay of the reflected signal due to the snowpack with respect to snow-free conditions is directly proportional to the snowpack SWE. To address the ionospheric delay at P-band frequencies, the signals from both MUOS bands (360-380 MHz and 250-270 MHz) would be used. We have conducted an analysis to trade off the spatial resolution for a space-based sensor and measurement accuracy. Through modeling analysis, we find that the dual-band MUOS signals would allow estimation of soil moisture and surface roughness together. From the two MUOS frequencies at 260 MHz and 370 MHz, we can retrieve the soil moisture from the reflectivity ratio scaled by wavenumbers using the two P-band frequencies for MUOS. A modeling analysis using layered stratified model has been completed to determine the sensitivity requirements of HydroCube measurements. For mission concept demonstration, a field campaign has been conducted at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado since February 2016. The data acquired has provided support to the HydroCube concept.

This work defines and derives recovery of these characteristics, in a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous medium. Recovery is based on a novel tomography approach. Multi-view (multi-angular) and multi-spectral data are linked to the underlying microphysics using 3D radiative transfer, accounting for multiple-scattering. Despite the nonlinearity of the tomography model, inversion is enabled using a few approximations that we describe. As a case study, we focus on passive remote sensing of the atmosphere, where scatterer retrieval can benefit modeling and forecasting of weather, climate and pollution.

In order to form clathrate hydrates, water molecules are removed from the aqueous solution. This fact causes great impact on solutes concentration, including available nutrients in solution so habitability is directly affected. Both, thermodynamical history recorded in the experiments and visual features following of the system help to understand the truly effect of salting-out on geology and its expression on Europa's surface in application to space exploration.

It extends a subset of the Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 for robotic applications. Hierarchical abstractions fundamental to BPMN allow the mission to be naturally decomposed into interdependent parallel sequences of BPMN elements. M2PEM adapts these elements in a role based framework which uses collaborative control modalities as an atomic building block. Designed missions are able to consider situational data, external stimuli, and direct user interaction. Missions are directly executable using a resource manager and a ROS-based execution engine.

It uses a reference frame based on longitudinal spacing along the route and lateral orthogonal offsets to plan for route clearance and traversal around previously unknown obstacles. By defining desired positions in terms of offsets from the route, the spatial and temporal components can be decoupled. The spatial components are planned using a two-step planner for fast real-time planning. The spatially defined paths are passed to a speed adaptation algorithm for temporal considerations including inter-vehicle collision avoidance. The approach balances real-time obstacle avoidance, spatial structure of the formation, and inter-vehicle safety considerations.

The paper begins with in-depth discussion of the multi-sensor calibration procedure. It then follows the flow of data through the perception pipeline, detailing the process by which the sensor data is combined in the world model representation.

Additive Effects on Li parallel to CFx and Li parallel to CFx-MnO2 Primary Cells at Low Temperature	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTE; CATHODE; LI/CFX; 15-CROWN-5; SYSTEMS	The effect of additives and electrolyte composition was investigated for Li parallel to CFx and Li parallel to CFx-MnO2 cells operated at low (ca. -40 degrees C) temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel measurements indicated that the anode is far more resistive than the cathode at low temperatures. Adding a small amount of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) to a propylene carbonate (PC) + 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) + tetrahydrofuran (THF) ternary blend was found to have a beneficial effect on the anode of a cell when using 0.5 M LiClO4 as the electrolyte salt. Although the cathode impedance did increase with the addition of FEC, the overall cell impedance dropped dramatically, particularly at -40 degrees C. Capacity at low temperature was not significantly improved with FEC addition, however, indicating that static (i.e. EIS) measurements may not be the best tool to understand the cell under dynamic (discharge) conditions. 15-crown-5 (as an additive) proved to have severe negative effects on specific capacity.

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) retarder optics. The DKIST retarder baseline design used 6 crystals, single-layer anti-reflection coatings, thick cover windows and oil between all optical interfaces. This new tool estimates polarization fringes and optic Mueller matrices as functions of all optical design choices. The amplitude and period of polarized fringes under design changes, manufacturing errors, tolerances and several physical factors can now be estimated. This tool compares well with observations of fringes for data collected with the SPINOR spectropolarimeter at the Dunn Solar Telescope using bi-crystalline achromatic retarders as well as laboratory tests. With this new tool, we show impacts of design decisions on polarization fringes as impacted by anti-reflection coatings, oil refractive indices, cover window presence and part thicknesses. This tool helped DKIST decide to remove retarder cover windows and also recommends reconsideration of coating strategies for DKIST. We anticipate this tool to be essential in designing future retarders for mitigation of polarization and intensity fringe errors in other high spectral resolution astronomical systems.

The solution that we propose uses a method to construct an imaging system in space in which the nonlinear optical properties of a cloud of micron-sized particles, shaped into a specific surface by electromagnetic means, and allows one to form a very large and lightweight aperture of an optical system, hence reducing overall mass and cost. Recent work at JPL has investigated the feasibility of a granular imaging system, concluding that such a system could be built and controlled in orbit. We conducted experiments and simulation of the optical response of a granular lens. In all cases, the optical response, measured by the Modulation Transfer Function, of hexagonal reflectors was closely comparable to that of a conventional spherical mirror. We conducted some further analyses by evaluating the sensitivity to fill factor and grain shape, and found a marked sensitivity to fill factor but no sensitivity to grain shape. We have also found that at fill factors as low as 30%, the reflection from a granular lens is still excellent. Furthermore, we replaced the monolithic primary mirror in an existing integrated model of an optical system (WFIRST Coronagraph) with a granular lens, and found that the granular lens that can be useful for exoplanet detection provides excellent contrast levels. We will present our testbed and simulation results in this paper.

VEM will provide a global map of surface composition as well as redox state of the surface, providing a comprehensive picture of surface-atmosphere interaction on Venus. In addition, continuous observation of the thermal emission of the Venus will provide tight constraints on current day volcanic activity. These capabilities are complemented by measurements of atmospheric water vapor abundance as well as cloud microphysics and dynamic. Atmospheric data will allow for the accurate correction of atmospheric interference on the surface measurements and represent highly valuable science on their own. A mission combining VEM with a high-resolution radar mapper such as the NASA VOX or the ESA EnVision mission proposals in a low circular orbit will provide key insights in the divergent evolution of Venus.

Design and characterization of a low cost CubeSat multi-band optical receiver to map water ice on the lunar surface for the Lunar Flashlight mission	INFRARED REMOTE SENSING AND INSTRUMENTATION XXV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Infrared Remote Sensing and Instrumentation XXV	AUG 07-08, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		NASA Lunar Flashlight mission; NIR optical receiver; NIR multi-band reflectometer; CubeSat	ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER; TEMPERATURE-MEASUREMENTS; POLAR-REGIONS; SOUTH-POLE; MOON; ALBEDO	Lunar Flashlight is an innovative NASA CubeSat mission dedicated to mapping water ice in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon, which may act as cold traps for volatiles. To this end, a multi- band reflectometer will be sent to orbit the Moon. This instrument consists of an optical receiver aligned with four lasers, each of which emits sequentially at a different wavelength in the near- infrared between 1 mu m and 2 mu m. The receiver measures the laser light reflected from the lunar surface; continuum/absorption band ratios are then analyzed to quantify water ice in the illuminated spot. Here, we present the current state of the optical receiver design. To optimize the optical signal-to-noise ratio, we have designed the receiver so as to maximize the laser signal collected, while minimizing the stray light reaching the detector from solar-illuminated areas of the lunar surface outside the field-of-view, taking into account the complex lunar topography. Characterization plans are also discussed. This highly mass- and volume-constrained mission will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first CubeSats performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit.

Four different coating recipes are presented as candidates for future far-ultraviolet (FUV) sensitive broadband observatories. Three samples were first coated with aluminum (Al) and lithium fluoride (LiF) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) using a new high-temperature physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. Two of these samples then had an ultrathin (10-20 angstrom) protective coat of either magnesium fluoride (MgF2) or aluminum fluoride (A1F(3)) applied using atomic later deposition (ALD) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). A fourth sample was coated with Al and a similar high temperature PVD coating of ALF(3). Polarized reflectivities into the FUV for each sample were obtained through collaboration with the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We present a procedure for using these reflectivities as a baseline for calculating the optical constants of each coating recipe. Given these results, we describe plans for improving our measurement methodology and techniques to develop and characterize these coating recipes for future FUV missions.

LUVOIR is being designed to pursue an ambitious program of exoplanetary discovery and characterization, cosmic origins astrophysics, and planetary science. The LUVOIR study team is investigating two large telescope apertures (9- and 15-meter primary mirror diameters) and a host of science instruments to carry out the primary mission goals. Many of the exoplanet, cosmic origins, and planetary science goals of LUVOIR require high-throughput, imaging spectroscopy at ultraviolet (100 - 400 nm) wavelengths. The LUVOIR Ultraviolet Multi-Object Spectrograph, LUMOS, is being designed to support all of the UV science requirements of LUVOIR, from exoplanet host star characterization to tomography of circumgalactic halos to water plumes on outer solar system satellites. LUMOS offers point source and multi-object spectroscopy across the UV bandpass, with multiple resolution modes to support different science goals. The instrument will provide low (R = 8,000 - 18,000) and medium (R = 30,000 - 65,000) resolution modes across the far-ultraviolet (FUV: 100 - 200 nm) and near-ultraviolet (NUV: 200 - 400 nm) windows, and a very low resolution mode (R = 500) for spectroscopic investigations of extremely faint objects in the FUV. Imaging spectroscopy will be accomplished over a 3 x 1.6 arcminute field-of-view by employing holographically-ruled diffraction gratings to control optical aberrations, microshutter arrays (MSA) built on the heritage of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), advanced optical coatings for high-throughput in the FUV, and next generation large-format photon-counting detectors. The spectroscopic capabilities of LUMOS are augmented by an FUV imaging channel (100 - 200nm, 13 milliarcsecond angular resolution, 2 x 2 arcminute field-of-view) that will employ a complement of narrow-and medium-band filters. The instrument definition, design, and development are being carried out by an instrument study team led by the University of Colorado, Goddard Space Flight Center, and the LUVOIR Science and Technology Definition Team. LUMOS has recently completed a preliminary design in Goddard's Instrument Design Laboratory and is being incorporated into the working LUVOIR mission concept. In this proceeding, we describe the instrument requirements for LUMOS, the instrument design, and technology development recommendations to support the hardware required for LUMOS. We present an overview of LUMOS' observing modes and estimated performance curves for effective area, spectral resolution, and imaging performance. Example "LUMOS 100-hour Highlights" observing programs are presented to demonstrate the potential power of LUVOIR's ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities.

The materials that were developed in the early days of this field generated limited actuation strain and therefore received relatively little attention. However, over the last years a series of EAP materials has emerged that exhibits a significant shape change in response to electrical stimulation. Their capability allowed the production and demonstration of various exciting and novel mechanisms including robot fish, catheter steering elements, miniature grippers, loudspeakers, fishlike blimps, and dust-wipers. Novel applications such as microfluidic systems and tissue engineering have also emerged. The impressive advances in improving their actuation strain are attracting the attention of many engineers and scientists from many different disciplines. These materials are particularly attractive to biomimetic applications since they can be used to make biologically inspired intelligent robots and other mechanisms. Increasingly, EAP-actuated mechanisms are being engineered with large application potential. This chapter reviews the state of the art, challenges, and potential applications of EAP materials.

HabEx would help assess the prevalence of habitable planets in our galaxy, searching in particular for potential biosignatures in the atmospheres of planets in habitable zones. More generally, HabEx would image our neighboring solar systems and characterize the variety of planets that inhabits them. Its direct imaging capability would also enable the mission to study the structure and evolution of debris disks around nearby stars, and their dynamical interaction with planets. Additionally, it will explore a number of more general astrophysics phenomena in our solar system, galaxy, and beyond, in the UV through NIR range. The exoplanet science goals lead to a mission concept with requirements for high contrast imaging and the continuous spectral coverage. The baseline for HabEx is a 4-meter diameter off-axis telescope designed to both search for habitable planets and perform general astrophysics observations, possibly combined with a starshade. In this paper, the initial flight system design for both the telescope and the starshade are presented, focusing on the key and driving requirements and subsystems, as well as the trajectory and station keeping and formation flying technique. Furthermore, some of the initial design trades undergone are described, as well as the key challenges and enablers. Finally, some of the future design and architecture trades to be performed within the flight systems as part of the continuing effort in the HabEx study are discussed.

New and improved coatings are sought to protect aluminum from oxidizing readily in normal environment causing severe absorption and reduction of reflectance in the deep UV. Choice of materials and the process of applying coatings present challenges. Here we present the progress achieved to date with experimental investigations of coatings at JPL and at GSFC and discuss the path forward to achieve high reflectance in the spectral region from 90 to 300nm without degrading performance in the visible and NIR regions taking into account durability concerns when the mirrors are exposed to normal laboratory environment as well as high humidity conditions.

The required planet/star brightness ratio of order 10-10 at visible wavelengths can be obtained by blocking stellar photons with an occulter, either externally (a starshade) or internally (a coronagraph) to the telescope system, and managing diffracted starlight, so as to directly image the exoplanet in reflected starlight. Coronagraph instruments require advancement in telescope aperture (either monolithic or segmented), aperture obscurations (obscured by secondary mirror and its support struts), and wavefront error sensitivity (e.g. line-of-sight jitter, telescope vibration, polarization). The starshade, which has never been used in a science application, benefits a mission by being decoupled from the telescope, allowing a loosening of telescope stability requirements. In doing so, it transfers the difficult technology from the telescope system to a large deployable structure (tens of meters to greater than 100 m in diameter) that must be positioned precisely at a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers from the telescope. We describe in this paper a roadmap to achieving the technological capability to search for biosignatures on an Earth-like exoplanet from a future space telescope. Two of these studies, HabEx and LUVOIR, include the direct imaging of Earth-sized habitable exoplanets as a central science theme.

With the JWST Science and Operations Center co-located at STScI, JOST was developed to provide both a platform for staff training and to test alternate wavefront sensing and control strategies for independent validation or future improvements beyond the baseline operations. The design of JOST reproduces the physics of JWSTs three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) using three custom aspheric lenses. It provides similar quality image as JWST (80% Strehl ratio) over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module, but at 633 nm. An Iris AO segmented mirror stands for the segmented primary mirror of JWST. Actuators allow us to control (1) the 18 segments of the segmented mirror in piston, tip, tilt and (2) the second lens, which stands for the secondary mirror, in tip, tilt and x, y, z positions. We present the most recent experimental results for the segmented mirror alignment. Our implementation of the Wavefront Sensing (WFS) algorithms using phase diversity is tested on simulation and experimentally. The wavefront control (WFC) algorithms, which rely on a linear model for optical aberrations induced by misalignment of the secondary lens and the segmented mirror, are tested and validated both on simulations and experimentally. After alignment, JOST achieves 23 nm RMS WFE at 633 nm (RMS = lambda/28), which after accounting for the difference in design wavelengths, is comparable to the budgeted post-alignment WFE expected for JWST. We present the performance of the full active optic control loop in presence of perturbations on the segmented mirror, and we detail the quality of the alignment correction.

The key challenge for this type of architecture is how to achieve sufficient stability to support this level of contrast. This paper will survey a few emerging sensing and control architectures and associated technologies that can potentially achieve the required stability. It will also provide a summary of the sensing and control portion of the LUVOIR segmented telescope architecture that has emerged from a recent design study and will provide a first look at the control methods that are being employed.

The Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) mission concept being assessed by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is expected to be 9 to 15 meters in diameter, have a segmented primary mirror and be diffraction limited at a wavelength of 500 nanometers. The optical stability is expected to be in the picometer range for minutes to hours. Architecture studies to support the NASA Science and Technology Definition teams (STDTs) are underway to evaluate systems performance. JWST is the closest analog to this mission concept but requires significant performance improvements to meet the science goals. To help define the technology needs and assess performance, a first order error budget has been developed. Like the JWST error budget, the error budget includes the active, adaptive and passive elements in spatial and temporal domains JWST performance is scaled using first order approximations where appropriate and includes technical advances in telescope control.

The telescope is designed specifically to operate with both a high contrast coronagraph and a starshade, enabling the direct optical detection of exoplanets as close as 70 mas from their star. The telescope will be equipped with cameras for exoplanetary system imaging and with spectrometers capable of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. Gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane have spectral lines in the visible and near infrared part of the spectrum and may indicate biological activity. In addition to the study of exoplanets, HabEx enables general astrophysics with two dedicated instruments. One instrument is a camera enabling imaging on a 3 arc minute field of view in two bands stretching from the UV to the near infrared. The same instrument can also be operated as a multi-object spectrograph, with resolution of 2000. A second instrument will be a high resolution UV spectrograph operating from 120 nm with up to 60,0000 resolution. We discuss the preliminary designs of the telescope and the optical instruments for the observatory.

The effects of space telescope primary mirror segment errors on coronagraph instrument performance	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VIII	AUG 06-07, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Coronagraph; Exoplanet; Wavefront; Segmented; Contrast		Direct imaging of potentially habitable planets is challenging because of the relative proximity of the planet to the star and the low flux ratio (typically well under 1e-9 in the visible) of the planet relative to the star. Future exoplanet direct imaging telescopes like the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) or the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) will hence require large collecting apertures with very low wavefront errors. The feasibility of these missions is in a large part dependent on the sensitivity of the achieved contrast at small working angles to imperfections and motions of the telescope optics. In past studies, we explored the effect of applying specific modes to segmented and monolith telescopes on the contrast leakage of a coronagraph. Here we present a revised analysis which, though not substantially different from the previous results, includes a mode careful theoretical examination of the issues involved. We conclude by highlighting the importance of the temporal characteristics of the errors.	[Nemati, Bijan] Univ Alabama, 301 Sparkman Dr,OPB400, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA; [Stahl, Mark T.; Stahl, H.

Laser Metrology (MET) provides a different, complementary sensing method, one that can be used to measure changes in the alignment of the optics at high bandwidth, independent of the magnitude of the host star. Laser metrology measures changes in the separation of optical fiducial pairs, which can be separated by many meters. The principle of operations is similar to the laser metrology system used in LISA-Pathfinder to measure the in-orbit displacement between two test masses to a precision of similar to 10 picometers. In closed loop with actuators, MET actively maintains rigid body alignment of the front-end optics, thereby eliminating the dominant source of wavefront drift. In the case of a segmented, active primary mirror, MET provides six degrees of freedom sensing, replacing edge sensors. MET maintains wavefront control even during attitude maneuvers, such as slews between target stars, thereby avoiding the need to repeat time-consuming speckle suppression. These features can significantly improve the performance and observational efficiency of future large-aperture space telescopes equipped with internal coronagraphs. We evaluate MET trusses for various proposed monolithic and segmented space-based coronagraphs and present the performance requirements necessary to maintain contrast drift below 10(-11).

LUVOIR Backplane Thermal Architecture Development Through the Composite CTE Sensitivity Study	UV/OPTICAL/IR SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONCEPTS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on UV/Optical/IR Space Telescopes and Instruments - Innovative Technologies and Concepts VIII	AUG 06-07, 2017	San Diego, CA	SPIE		LUVOIR; ATLAST; Thermal Distortion; pico-meter; Composite; CTE; CTE sensitivity; ULE; HST; JWST		The Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) is one of four 2020 Decadal Survey Missions, a concept for 'flag-ship' class space-borne observatory, operating across the multi-wavelength UV/Optical/NIR spectra. An Optical Telescope concept being considered is the segmented primary mirror architecture with composite backplane structure. In order to achieve the high-contrast imaging required to satisfy the primary science goals of this mission would require, roughly, 10 pico-meter wavefront RMS stability over a wavefront control time step of approximately 10 minutes. The LUVOIR primary mirror backplance support structure (PMBSS) requires active thermal management to maintain operational temperature while on orbit. Furthermore, the active thermal control must be sufficiently stable to prevent time-varying thermally induced distortions in the PMBSS. This paper describes a systematic approach to developing a thermal architecture of a modular composite section of the mirror support structure heavily guided by the sensitivity studies of the composite Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) values. Thermal and finite-element models, sensitivity studies against the absolute values and their variations of the composite CTE, the early findings from the thermal and thermal-distortion analyses are presented.

One of the key scientific objectives of the latter two is the detection and characterization of the earth-like planets around nearby stars using the direct imaging technique (along with a broad range of investigations regarding the architecture of and atmospheric composition exoplanetary systems using this technique). As a consequence dedicated exoplanet instruments are being studied for these mission concepts. This paper discusses the design of the coronagraph instrument for the architecture "A" (15 meters aperture) of LUVOIR. The material presented in this paper is aimed at providing an overview of the LUVOIR coronagraph instrument. It is the result of four months of discussions with various community stakeholders (scientists and technologists) regarding the instrument's basic parameters followed by meticulous design work by the the GSFC Instrument Design Laboratory team. In the first section we review the main science drivers, presents the overall parameters of the instrument (general architecture and backend instrument) and delve into the details of the currently envisioned coronagraph masks along with a description of the wavefront control architecture. Throughout the manuscript we describe the trades we made during the design process. Because the vocation of this study is to provide a baseline design for the most ambitious earth-like finding instrument that could be possibly launched into the 2030's, we have designed an complex system privileged that meets the ambitious science goals out team was chartered by the LUVOIR STDT exoplanet Working Group. However in an effort to minimize technological risk we tried to maximize the number of technologies that will be matured by the WFIRST coronagraph instruments.

This indicates that an alternative to autonomous self-deployment similar to that of the James Webb Space Telescope will eventually be required. Moreover, even before this size limit is reached, there will be significant motivation to service, repair, and upgrade in-space missions of all sizes, whether to extend the life of expensive facilities or to replace outworn or obsolete onboard systems as was demonstrated so effectively by the Hubble Space Telescope program. In parallel with these challenges to future major space astronomy missions, the capabilities of in-space robotic systems and the goals for human space flight in the 2020s and 2030s offer opportunities for achieving the most exciting science goals of the early 21st Century. In this paper, we summarize the history of concepts for human operations beyond the immediate vicinity of the Earth, the importance of very large apertures for scientific discovery, and current capabilities and future developments in robot-and astronaut-enabled servicing and assembly.

The annual fluxes from its sources and sinks are investigated using a 3-D chemistry transport model, STOCHEM-CRI. In terms of the flux analysis, the oxidation of CS2 by OH is found to be the main removal process (76-88% of the total loss) and the dry deposition loss contributes 11-24% to the total loss of CS2. The global burden of CS2 was calculated, varying between 6.1 to 19.2 Tg and the lifetime of CS2 was determined to be within the range of 2.8-3.4 days. The global distribution of CS2 found the Northern Hemisphere (NH) continental landmasses to be the areas of concentration maxima with peak concentrations reaching up to 20 ppt during June-July-August (J-J-A) season and 40 ppt during December-January-February (D-J-F) season in anthropogenic source regions. Oceanic regions returned low CS2 levels of less than 2 ppt. The vertical profile of CS2 shows higher levels up to 3 ppt at 30 degrees N-45 degrees N during J-J-A and up to 4 ppt at 30 degrees N-55 degrees N during D-J-F. The oxidation of CS2 by OH can produce a substantial amount (0.58 Tg/yr) of atmospheric OCS and the annual average surface distribution of this flux shows up to 6 Gg/yr OCS formed in the regions with highest anthropogenic pollution (e.g.,South east Asia). In general, the model-measurement comparison reveals an underprediction of model CS2 compared with measured CS2 for most of the regions. It is likely that the emissions of CS2 are being underestimated and there are likely much larger emission sources of atmospheric CS2 than previously suggested.

Relationship between SST gradients and upwelling off Peru and Chile: model/satellite data analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE SST; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM; OCEAN; MODEL	The upwelling system off Peru/Chile is characterized by significant mesoscale to submesoscale surface variability that results from the instability of the coastal currents (due to the strong vertical and horizontal shears) and to the marked density cross-shore gradients (associated with the mean upwelling). Here we investigate to what extent upwelling intensity can be inferred from sea surface temperature (SST) derived from remote sensing. As a first step in validation, a comparison between SST observations is performed, which indicates that the 1 km gridded multi-scale ultra-high-resolution (MUR) SST data set is defining a zone of maximum SST gradients closer to shore than the low-resolution National Centers for Environmental Information 0.25 degrees resolution data set. Two model versions, at nominal resolutions of 2 km and 4 km, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model are analysed. A high-resolution version at 2 km is examined for the period 13 September 2011-23 January 2013, while a 4 km version is examined for 6 March 2011-22 April 2013. MUR shows maxima SST gradients in the range of 0.03 +/- 0.02 K km(-1) while the model showed higher gradients around 0.05 +/- 0.02 K km(-1). Based on coherence spectra, the relationship between upwelling rate (as inferred from the vertical velocity) and SST gradient is documented in the model from intraseasonal to annual timescales. It suggests that changes in SST gradient magnitudes are related to changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling off Peru and Chile. Such a relationship between SST gradients and vertical velocity would allow for the use of satellite-derived SSTs to monitor the intensity	[Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge; Torres, Hector S.; Menemenlis, Dimitris; Chin, Toshio; Armstrong, Edward M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA	Vazquez-Cuervo, J (corresponding author), M-S 300-323,3800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

Effect of Displacement Damage on Tantalum Oxide Resistive Memory	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article							RADIATION; MEMRISTORS; TAOX	The radiation environment of space poses a challenge for electronic systems, in particular flash memory, which contains multiple radiation-sensitive parts. Resistive memory (RRAM) devices have the potential to replace flash memory, functioning as an inherently radiation resistant memory device. Several studies indicate significant radiation resistance in RRAM devices to a broad range of radiation types and doses. In this study, we focus on the effect of displacement damage on tantalum oxide-based RRAM devices, as this form of damage is likely a worst-case scenario. An Ar+ (170 keV) ion beam was used to minimize any contribution from ionization damage, maximizing the effect of displacement damage. Fluence levels were chosen to generate enough oxygen vacancies such that devices in the high resistance state (HRS) would likely switch to the low resistance state (LRS). More than half of devices tested at the highest fluence level (1.43E13 ions/cm(2)) switched from HRS to LRS. The devices were then switched for 50 set/reset cycles, after which the radiation-induced resistance shift disappeared. These results suggest that device switching may mitigate radiation damage by accelerating oxygen vacancy-interstitial recombination.

The paper presents a demonstration of a CMOS Dicke-switched radiometer which uses correlated double sampling to eliminate gain variation, and investigates the contributions of the Delta G/G behavior to the demonstrated instrument's measured NE Delta T through experimental approaches. Finally the paper describes how the discrepancies between calculation and measurement can be attributed to limited performance of Dicke switches in silicon and how further development is needed to truly hit useful NE Delta T resolutions in the 1 degrees K range.

The electromagnetic fields are calculated by numerical solutions of 3D Maxwell equations (NMM3D) using the method of Foldy Lax multiple scattering equations combined with the method of the body of revolution (BOR). Using the calculated transmission, we derive, the "tau", the optical thickness, which describes the magnitude of the transmission. Two cases are considered: the short-cylinder case and the extended-cylinder case. The case of short cylinders is that the lengths of cylinders are much smaller than the layer thickness, while the case of extended cylinders is that the lengths of the cylinders are the same as or comparable to the layer thickness. Numerical results are illustrated for vertically polarized plane waves obliquely incident on the layer of cylinders. The NMM3D results for the extended-cylinder case show large differences of transmission from the results of the other approaches, such as the effective permittivity (EP), the distorted Born approximation (DBA), and the radiative transfer equation (RTE). For the case of short cylinders, the NMM3D results are in close agreement with those of EP, DBA, and RIB.

CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) NASA InVEST Technology Demonstration	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS XLIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications XLIII	APR 09-13, 2017	Anaheim, CA	SPIE		Infrared; Sounding; CubeSat; Grating; Spectrometer		Infrared sounders measure the upwelling radiation of the Earth in the Midwave Infrared (MWIR) and Longwave Infrared (LWIR) region of the spectrum with global daily coverage from space. The observed radiances are assimilated into weather forecast models and used to retrieve lower tropospheric temperature and water vapor for climate studies. There are several operational sounders today including the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on Aqua, the Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on Suomi NPP and JPSS, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on the MetOp spacecraft. The CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) is a NASA In-flight Validation of Earth Science Technologies (InVEST) program to demonstrate three new instrument technologies in an imaging sounder configuration. The first is a 2D array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The detectors are hybridized to a commercial ROIC and commercial camera electronics. The second technology is a MWIR Grating Spectrometer (MGS) designed to provide imaging spectroscopy for atmospheric sounding in a CubeSat volume. The MGS employs an immersion grating or grism, has no moving parts, and is based on heritage spectrometers including the OCO-2. The third technology is a Black Silicon infrared blackbody calibration target. The Black Silicon offers very low reflectance over a broad spectral range on a flat surface and is more robust than carbon nanotubes. JPL will also develop the mechanical, electronic and thermal subsystems for the CIRAS payload. The spacecraft will be a commercially available CubeSat. The integrated system will be a complete 6U CubeSat capable of measuring temperature and water vapor profiles with good lower tropospheric sensitivity. The low cost of CIRAS enables multiple units to be flown to improve temporal coverage or measure 3D Atmospheric Motion Vector (AMV) winds. CIRAS will launch in 2019 and is only a technology demonstration. However, what we learn will benefit future instruments that support operational weather forecasting and climate studies.

Here we study photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime of this InAsSb/InSb digital alloy. While increasing temperature from 15 K to 40 K we show a 14 meV blue shift of the photoluminescence peak energy and a decrease in lifetime. This deviation from the expected Varshni empirical relation indicates strong carrier localization. We contrast to photoluminescence and lifetime results in bulk InAsSb. We discuss implications of this localization for design of digital alloy InAsSb/InSb nBn detectors.

The three categories of technologies include organic multichip modules (MCMs), ceramic leadless surface mount technology (SMT) and 3D printed waveguide structures. There are many other packaging technologies that currently exist but these three were selected in part due to their heritage in various commercial, military and space applications along with each having a relatively clear path to flight. For each of these technologies, detailed examples will be included in which hardware has been fabricated and tested for use in RF electronics for spacecraft transponders. The organic MCM example will be described in most detail and it utilizes a packaging technology by the name of CoreEZ which is a trademark of i3 Electronics. This MCM has shrunk a portion of our electronics down to 1/8th of its previous area. The CoreEZ technology has been shown to be rad hard beyond a total ionizing dose (TID) of 300kRad and the MCM which was fabricated has gone through thermal cycling and shown to have no degradation in performance. The ceramic leadless package examples include packages from high reliability manufactures by the name of KCB solutions and Barry Industries. In the case of KCB solutions, we have multiple products that will be described including a hermetic ceramic carrier which houses three microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) along with small discrete components. Finally, we will discuss the results of our search for a 3D printing process that allows us to reduce the cost and volume of our waveguide filters and diplexers for low cost small satellite applications. We have fabricated a few prototypes using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and metal coated plastics. Each of these packaging technology discussions will have a brief overview of its current and future use.

Radio emission from CMEs is a direct tracer of the particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere and potential magnetic connections from the lower solar corona to the larger heliosphere. These questions are among those highlighted in the current Solar Decadal Servey, e.g., "Discover and characterize fundamental processes that occur both within the heliosphere and throughout the Universe." Furthermore, CME radio emission is quite strong, such that only a relatively small number of antennas is required, and a small mission would make a fundamental advancement in our scientific understanding. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art for tracking CME radio emission is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES) in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping. This type of heliophysics mission has been studied several times in the past, but had so far been found to be cost prohibitive, due to the inherent complexity of building multiple spacecraft and flying them in constellation. However, with the increased popularity and success of CubeSat concepts, accompanied by the miniaturization of subsystem components, a range of missions are now being enabled at lower cost than ever before. The paper presents the science requirements for a Small Explorer (SMEX)-class (typically < similar to$100M, including all lifecycle costs) mission concept, and walks through the major features of the SunRISE mission study. SunRISE is composed of six 6U (where 1U is defined as a 10 by 10 by 10cm form-factor) CubeSats placed in an orbit slightly above the Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO) to achieve the aforementioned science goals. The spacecraft fly in a passive formation, which allows them to form an interferometer while minimizing the impact on operations complexity. The paper provides an overview of the mission and spacecraft design, as well as the concept of operations for the mission. Finally, it discusses how the SunRISE mission concept could serve as a stepping stone in demonstrating space-based interferometry and enable more complex mission concepts in the future.

An areostationary Relay Satellite is expected to be used for future communication network for the exploration of Mars. An areostationary Relay Satellite at 17,000 km above Mars surface is always in the same place in the sky on Mars, receiving data from the rovers/landers and low Mars orbiters and transmitting it to an Earth station. The areostationary satellite enables almost all time communication, except for certain durations when Mars is in between the areostationary Relay Satellite and the Earth. In this paper we define a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system between various assets such as rovers/landers on Mars surface, low Mars orbiters such as MRO, CubeSats in vicinity of Mars, and an areostationary relay satellite at 17,000 km above Mars surface. We assume data rates between 50 Kbps and 1 Mbps operating at 8.40 GHz frequency. We define the transmit power, antenna size, and data rates for the assets communicating with the areostationary relay satellite. Since the areostationary relay satellite simultaneously receives data from many users we have chosen the code division multiple access (CDMA) as a multiple access scheme, which does not require time/frequency coordination among users. Furthermore we compute the link budgets for various communication links, we define the modulation format, the PN spreading and chip rates. We provide a new theoretical analysis for multiuser interference, and simulate the performance of coded CDMA communication system. For coded system we use standard CCSDS LDPC codes proposed by NASA for space applications. Using CDMA, the communication structure of all assets on Mars operates at one single RF frequency. However the initial states of spreading PN codes assigned to users are different such that if all users communicate simultaneously with the areostationary relay satellite over a given band will have low cross correlation that reduces the multiuser interference.

The goal of the LunaH-Map mission is to map the hydrogen content of the entire South Pole of the moon, including permanently shadowed regions at high resolution. The spacecraft is a 6 U CubeSat and the main instrument is a neutron spectrometer which will be used to perform the measurements required to accomplish the primary science objective. Once LunaH-Map reaches the Moon, the spacecraft will perform a 60-day science mission, consisting of 141 science orbits during which the measurements will be taken. In the design of the LunaH-Map spacecraft, one of the main challenges is the telecommunication system as the spacecraft needs the ability to relay data during the long cruise phase and during the science phase. In addition, the telecommunication system needs to support the main navigation functions required to reach the Moon and to insert in the highly elliptical orbit required for the science phase. This paper covers the main aspects of the telecommunication design for the mission including: link and coverage analysis, waveform selection and spectral constraints, hardware selection and ground station coordination.

As the goals for these spacecraft become more ambitious in space exploration, the communication systems currently implemented will need to be improved to support those missions. One of the bottlenecks is the antennas' size, due to the close relation between antenna gain and dimensions. Hence, a possible solution is to develop inflatable antennas which can be packaged efficiently, occupying a small amount of space, and they can provide, once deployed, large dish dimension and correspondent gain. A prototype of a 1 m inflatable antenna for X-Band has been developed in a joint effort between JPL and ASU. After initial photogrammetry tests and radiation tests, it was discovered that the design was not able to meet the required gain. As a result, a new design, based on a spherical inflatable membrane, is proposed. This new design will allow reaching a more stable inflatable surface, hence improving the electromagnetic performance. This paper will detail the principle challenges in developing this new antenna focusing on: design, EM analysis, fabrication and tests.

S	Bahrami, P; Nesmith, B; Carpenter, K			IEEE	Bahrami, Poyan; Nesmith, Bill; Carpenter, Kalind			Milli-watt Radioisotope Power to Enable Small, Long-Term Robotic "Probe" Space Exploration	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Milli-watt Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) based on Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs) could be an ideal power source for certain spacecraft that cannot use solar power due to large distances from the sun, or other environmental constraints, and where they enable or significantly enhance the ability of a mission to meet its scientific or operational goals. Various modular, compact RHU-based thermoelectric (TE) generator concepts developed or derived from current NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects satisfying this need have been investigated. These modular, compact and low mass power systems could support small, highly-mobile robotic exploration packages, and could be incorporated into different robotic package concepts, spacecraft or satellites. Current modular RPS design concepts with 40mW, 80mW and 120mW power levels use RHUs and Bi2Te3 TE converters. Skutterudites materials could be used in the future if new higher thermal energy output and higher temperature miniature heat sources were developed, for example, using technologies currently in the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) used in higher electric power output RTGs. Small (a.k.a., "mice-like") robotic packages could effectively utilize these RHU-driven power levels to accommodate crawling, climbing, monitoring, taking measurements, and communicating during long-term planetary missions aimed at gathering environmental and geologic data (i.e., over multiple decades). Waste heat from the cold side of the TE converter could also be directed toward the electronics and / or energy storage (e.g. batteries) to keep them within design temperature ranges. In addition to power generation and electronics / battery heating, the RHU / TE configuration could be designed to survive an external 500 degrees C bake out procedure for critical spacecraft sterilization, environmental certification and planetary protection. Analytical studies have been performed to optimize various design configurations for power, mass, volume and robotic mobility. Specific power (mW/kg) and volumetric specific power (mW/cm(3)) characteristics of various design configurations will be presented and key conceptual design tradeoffs will be discussed. Hot-and cold-side thermal interfaces required to meet power and mass goals and associated design sensitivities will also be discussed. RHU / TE systems must overcome critical design challenges to survive high-g loadings in some robotic applications and we will examine the mass impacts required to satisfy various dynamic loading environments up to 10,000 g's. Power can be generated for a minimum of 30 years or more using plutonium-238 dioxide heat sources (given that Pu-238 has an 87.7 year half-life) with some reduction in power as the heat source naturally degrades.

The outer solar system, in particular, poses a challenge for lower mission cost as the principal need for a robotic craft -a source of energy -is difficult to supply through conventional means (solar energy). Even as far from the Sun as Saturn, the solar energy density is only 1% of that at Earth. Not viewed typically as a power source for low-cost missions, radioisotope power systems (RPS) may well fill that role by providing power to small spacecraft in the outer solar system. And the outer solar system beckons with extremely compelling science. The rich dynamics of the atmospheres of the gas giants are continuously operating laboratories of extreme weather processes, examples of which in miniaturized scale may become more familiar here on Earth. Enceladus, a small moon of Saturn, has been seen by the Cassini mission to be a site of continuous high geologic activity, with plumes of water vapor and particles pumped hundreds of kilometers above the surface, indeed into Saturn orbit. The internal heating mechanisms of this activity beg for explanation, and more importantly, initial measurements by the Cassini spacecraft give tantalizing clues that the geo-thermal source of the heating is, in fact, maintaining a global sub-surface ocean, which in combination could provide a habitat for life. This paper will explore how existing and currently available RPS elements may make mission concepts to explore the intriguing science of Enceladus economically tractable, and at the same time provide a generic platform for other small but highly capable spacecraft to explore the outer solar system.

The 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey, Vision and Voyages, states: "Because of this ocean's potential suitability for life, Europa is one of the most important targets in all of planetary science." Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the planned Europa Mission. This exploration is intimately tied to understanding the three "ingredients" for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy. The Europa Mission would investigate these ingredients by comprehensively exploring Europa's ice shell and liquid ocean interface, surface geology and surface composition to glean insight into the inner workings of this fascinating moon. In addition, a lander mission is seen as a possible future step, but current data about the Jovian radiation environment and about potential landing site hazards and potential safe landing zones is insufficient. Therefore an additional goal of the mission would be to characterize the radiation environment near Europa and investigate scientifically compelling sites for hazards, to inform a potential future landed mission. The Europa Mission envisions sending a flight system, consisting of a spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific instruments, to execute numerous flybys of Europa while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge is that the flight system must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh at Europa. The innovative design of this multiple-flyby tour is an enabling feature of this mission: by minimizing the time spent in the radiation environment the spacecraft complexity and cost has been significantly reduced compared to previous mission concepts. The spacecraft would launch from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, on a NASA supplied launch vehicle, no earlier than 2022. The formulation and implementation of the proposed mission is led by a joint Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. In June 2015, NASA announced the selection of a highly capable suite of 10 scientific investigations to be flown on the Europa Mission. Since the announcement, the Europa Mission Team has updated the spacecraft design in order to fully accommodate this instrument suite - a significant challenge. After completing a successful System Requirements Review and Mission Definition Review in January of 2017, the project is currently transitioning from the concept development phase to the preliminary design phase of the mission. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Mission since 2015, including maturation of the spacecraft design, requirements, system analyses, and mission trajectories.

EDL trajectories with SRP enable landing larger masses on Mars than those possible using aerodynamic decelerators only. For manned missions to Mars, SRP will be a necessary technology, given the high ballistic coefficients that the entry vehicles require. Trajectories using SRP as the only means of terminal deceleration possess specific characteristics that require a tailored strategy and guidance algorithms, both of which are outlined in this paper.

The anchors can be antennas of a ground-based network (e.g., Deep Space Network (DSN) or Near Earth Network (NEN) stations), or satellites of a space-based network (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) or tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS)). We define raw-range as the range that includes all the systematic errors that occur during range measurements. A unique feature of this approach is that accurate relative position is derived from a "differencing function" of raw-range measurements of the reference spacecraft and target spacecraft, thereby eliminating most of the systematic errors, such as media effects, ephemeris errors, instrument delays, clock bias, etc. There can be an arbitrary number of target spacecraft, and relative positioning of target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft can be done simultaneously. In this paper, we first assume an idealized system in which clocks on the reference and target spacecraft are synchronized, with clocks of the anchors synchronized as well. 2 We develop a novel iterative algorithm that computes the relative position of the target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft. We illustrate the relative positioning method using the scenario of a network of three ground stations (i.e., the anchors) at Goldstone, California, USA, Madrid, Spain, and Marlargue, Argentina tracking two spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit distance. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges to sub-meter accuracy in estimating the relative position, in the presence of random errors and systematic errors in raw-range measurements, and in the presence of angular errors in estimating the pointing vectors between the anchors and the reference spacecraft. Next, we relax the requirement of perfect time synchronization between spacecraft, and show that by using an additional anchor, one can estimate and remove the clock biases between the reference and target spacecraft. We add a ground station at Kourou to the above example of three ground stations of Goldstone, Madrid, and Marlargue, and demonstrate that the updated algorithm also converges to meter-level accuracy (sub-meter in some cases) in the presence of clock biases in addition to the random errors, systematic errors, and angular errors as shown in the above case. We compare this scheme with a similar trilateration scheme for relative positioning scheme first proposed by Montenbruck in 2002.

S	Clark, I; Tanner, C			IEEE	Clark, Ian; Tanner, Christopher			A Historical Summary of the Design, Development, and Analysis of the Disk-Gap-Band Parachute	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute was originally developed in the late 1960's by Clint Eckstrom for high-altitude meteorological rocket applications. It was designed as a balance between drag and stability with a relatively simplistic design and low packing volume. Due to its demonstrated high-altitude performance and design features, the DGB was selected as a candidate for Viking precursor test programs such as the Planetary Entry Parachute Program (PEPP) and the Supersonic Planetary Entry Decelerator (SPED), in which the parachute was tested at high altitude supersonic conditions similar to those that would be experienced during an entry at Mars. The DGB was eventually selected for the Viking mission and qualified using a series of low-altitude drop tests and high-altitude balloon-launched decelerator tests (BLDT). Based on the success of the DGB on the Viking I and II missions, as well as the wealth of data generated during the PEPP, SPED, and BLDT test programs, the DGB parachute has been used on all subsequent U.S. missions to the surface of Mars with great success. Recently, an effort was undertaken to further improve the structural capability of the DGB parachutes used at Mars. An early activity was undertaken to better understand the breadth of designs, design modifications, and general evolution of the DGB canopy to better inform future designs. This paper collates historical DGB designs and structural performance. A key design shift includes the switch from low-tenacity Dacron skeletal components used in the Viking era to high-tenacity Kevlar skeletal components used in the Pathfinder era, which fundamentally changes the load sharing and energy absorption characteristics of the parachute. The paper also scrutinizes the analysis methods and flight limit load policies used throughout history. Of note is that the analysis methods have become "smarter,"transitioning from hand calculations to finite element analyses, but the use of more advanced methods have likely been eroding design conservatism leading to more aggressively designed parachute systems. Reflection upon previous DGB design and flight practices has shown that modern design practices may be driving large DGB designs outside the traditionally successful margin limits.

The magnetic circuit of the MaSMi-60 Hall thruster was modified to improve the magnetic field topology while increasing the strength of the field across the discharge channel gap. Direct thrust measurements were then taken to assess the changes to thruster efficiency, thrust, and specific impulse. The MaSMi-60's total efficiency increased by nearly 30% as a result of the improved magnetic field, resulting in a peak value of 32.1% (38.6% anode efficiency). Peak thrust and total specific impulse values of 35.8 mN and 1,440 s (1,550 s anode specific impulse) were observed. To demonstrate the thruster's enabling capabilities when paired with a smallsat-class spacecraft, three example mission trajectories to 118401 LINEAR, an icy asteroid-belt comet, were calculated. For each trajectory, the MaSMi-60' s experimentally demonstrated performance was used for the throttling table inputs. The trajectory solutions show a delivered mass fraction of between 35-49% for an initial spacecraft mass of up to 350 kg, a solar array power of up to 2.0 kW, and a total transfer time of similar to 6.5 years.

Geodetic and topographic imaging provide measurements of transient and long-term crustal deformation needed to monitor fault zones and understand earthquakes. Earthquake- induced strain and rupture characteristics are expressed in topographic features imprinted on the landscapes of fault zones.

During the separation event, and subsequently during Schiaparelli's Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), the NASA-provided Electra Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) payload onboard TGO was used to record signals from the Schiaparelli Lander for post-processing on the ground to recover both tracking of the lander's carrier signal and reconstruction of the lander's 8 kb/s telemetry. In addition, ESA's Mars Express orbiter recorded the Schiaparelli signal, with ground post-processing providing independent tracking of the lander carrier signal, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India was configured to provide real-time detection of the lander carrier signal. While an anomaly in the latter stages of EDL led to loss of the lander, these critical event data sets, and in particular the telemetry reconstruction enabled by the TGO Electra recording, proved essential in enabling detailed diagnosis of the anomaly. While the loss of the lander during EDL precluded the planned surface relay operations, the preparations for that activity provide important lessons learned for future Mars relay support scenarios.

We discuss the results of rapid prototyping and how those results fed into design specifications for a new platform built with Zynq System-OnChip (SoC) technologies from Xilinx. Existing TLS designs are limited to the extent that they employ analog implementations of filter, modulation/demodulation and phase sensitive detection circuitries.

Locations are identified and evaluated using a process involving two illumination simulation and analysis methods and a set-cover algorithm. Results are presented that demonstrate the trade-off between number of locations and height above surface level to achieve near-continuous access to sunlight near Shackleton Crater.

Missions involving multiple spacecraft are inherently more complex to design than traditional single spacecraft missions. This is particularly true for fractionated mission concepts, where spacecraft have diverse roles and distributed responsibilities, and fulfilling mission goals requires communication and collaboration. In practice, this complexity and the lack of computational models and tools limit design teams to consider small design spaces and force them to quickly fixate on a single mission design. However, design fixation at such early stages often leads to sub-optimal designs. Towards overcoming this limitation, we propose an automated approach to exploring and visualizing the trade space of multi-spacecraft mission architectures that aids users in decision making, and provides a basis for identifying solutions that are Pareto-optimal with respect to user-defined science requirements, technical and resource constraints, and mission objectives. Central to our approach is the automated synthesis and analysis of mission architecture alternatives from a set of user-provided functional requirements and mission goals, as well as a library of spacecraft components and analysis models. Design rules (synthesis knowledge) are provided in the form of model-transformation rules. Sequences of endogenous model transformations are applied in-place to produce sets of candidate solutions, thereby effectively searching the design space. The search process is guided by the specified objectives, and is implemented using evolutionary algorithms. We demonstrate our approach to architectural optimization using a simplified radio interferometry mission design as a case study. We conclude that using the proposed approach, the number and diversity of candidate mission architectures available for consideration can be significantly increased. Furthermore, the automated synthesis and evaluation of mission architectures can lead to emergent and non-intuitive solutions to be discovered.	[Herzig, Sebastian J.

ASCoT is a web-based tool that provides a suite of estimation tools to support early lifecycle NASA Flight Software analysis. ASCoT employs advanced statistical methods such as Cluster Analysis to provide an analogy based estimate of software delivered lines of code and development effort, a regression based Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) model that estimates cost (dollars), and a COCOMO II based estimate. The ASCoT algorithms are designed to primarily work with system level inputs such as mission type (earth orbiter vs. planetary vs. rover), the number of instruments, and total mission cost. This allows the user to supply a minimal number of mission-level parameters which are better understood early in the life-cycle, rather than a large number of complex inputs.

The planned Europa mission would be equipped with a suite of instruments to perform both remote and in-situ sensing, the scope of which ranges from gravity science to characterizing the surface composition, with one of the objectives being to confirm the existence of the subsurface ocean. As the selected instruments mature, the challenge has been to select and refine a spacecraft configuration that is flexible enough to accommodate these changes without degrading the scientific capability of the spacecraft. An increase in instrument volume and power have prompted the growth of spacecraft engineering subsystems, which include the solar arrays and the avionics module. These changes have the potential to cause obstructions to the instrument fields of view, stray light keep-out-zones, and thermal radiative fields of view. Many of these criteria are addressed by the implementation of a dedicated instrument platform. Payloads that are unique to the Europa mission require new approaches to instrument accommodation, such as coupling the ice penetrating radar's radiating elements to the solar array. This paper will discuss these accommodation strategies for the Europa spacecraft to generate a new baseline design.

The Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout mission, being developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is implementing a solar sail on a 6U CubeSat platform to address a specific set of key strategic knowledge gaps laid out by NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). NEA Scout's mission is to perform a close and slow encounter of a representative NEA as a robotic precursor for future human exploration. In addition to the resource limitations synonymous with small satellites, the NEA Scout flight system is further constrained by the implementation of the solar sail; for the CubeSat's expected 2.5-year mission, the solar sail is the flight system's primary attitude pointing constraint in order to achieve the trajectory needed to reach its target NEA. Due to the unique configuration challenges of fitting an 86 m(2) solar sail in the vehicle, NEA Scout's solar panels and medium gain antenna are fixed in a plane parallel to the sail. With the sail pointing constraint, the flight system cannot optimally orient the solar panels directly at the sun, subjecting them to a continuous cosine loss in generation. This may be the first deep space mission that has been designed to nominally not point at the sun - a challenge that traditional systems engineering and power models are not designed to handle optimally. To meet these challenges for NEA Scout and other similar mission concepts, JPL has created a novel flight system analysis model to rapidly simulate and iterate trajectories against spacecraft subsystem performance. Following mission design trajectory inputs, the model performs a Monte Carlo simulation of the flight system's performance. The outputs are distributions of the telecommunications downlink time (important for navigation and data sufficiency) and solar sail cruise angle (important for recharging the batteries before the next downlink). These distributions are processed and give key insight into the feasibility of the reference trajectory and likelihood of mission success.

These will be demonstrated on currently funded missions, such as INSPIRE, MarCO, and Lunar Flashlight, which will be among the first CubeSat missions to leave Earth's orbit and explore deep space, Mars, and the Moon, respectively. Other concepts may consider using these technologies to explore Venus, asteroids, Europa, Titan, and other areas of the solar system. These missions and concepts can be enabled by the development of miniaturized yet performant command and data handling, power, software, and communications systems specifically designed for deep space applications. JPL is pushing the state of the art in small subsystems to augment NASA's history of exploration. While the CubeSat/SmallSat component market has grown significantly to benefit LEO applications, only a few vendors are actively developing avionics and instrument interface electronics capable of meeting the stringent environmental, reliability, and performance requirements of deep space missions. These electronics and systems need to be specifically designed to handle harsh radiation and thermal environments as well as extended mission durations, where a CubeSat may begin its science observations after a multi-year cruise. Deep space missions also require additional technologies, such as radio transponders for interplanetary navigation. This paper first summarizes the systems-level developments of the enabling technologies of the JPL avionics bus, looking at maturing hardware and as well as future evolutions of technologies. Second, the paper discusses potential science instruments and applications that could be accommodated by these unique flight systems, either within a CubeSat or SmallSat form factor. Finally, the paper pairs technologies and instruments and showcases potential science missions enabled by this novel capability.

Data was collected for more than 400 different tests in order to evaluate the influence of mass flow rate, molecular weight of the working gas, back pressure of the ambient gas, height of the nozzle above the surface, and the nozzle design. The results of these tests are summarized and presented. The test program showed that the use of a cold gas system is an effective means of clearing dust from the surface of samples and determined which design parameters are key for system performance.

The Effects of Constrained Electric Propulsion on Gravity Tractors for Planetary Defense	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Electric propulsion may play a crucial role in the implementation of the gravity tractor planetary defense technique. Gravity tractors were devised to take advantage of the mutual gravitational force between a spacecraft flying in formation with the target celestial body to slowly alter the celestial body's trajectory. No physical contact is necessary, which bypasses issues associated with surface contact such as landing, anchoring, or spin compensation. The gravity tractor maneuver can take several forms, from the originally proposed constant thrust in-line hover to the offset halo orbit. Both can be enhanced with the collection of mass at the asteroid. The form of the gravity tractor ultimately impacts the required thrust magnitude to maintain the formation, as well as constraints on the vectoring of the thrust direction. Solar electric propulsion systems provide an efficient mechanism for tugging the spacecraft-asteroid system due to their high specific impulse. Electric propulsion systems can generate thrust continuously at high efficiency, which is an ideal property for gravity tractors that may require years of operation to achieve the desired deflection because of the very low coupling force provided by the gravitational attraction. The performance and feasibility of the deflection are predicated on having the propulsion capability to maintain the gravity tractor. This paper describes the impacts of constraining the solar electric propulsion thrust magnitude and thrust vectoring capability. It is shown that uncertainty in asteroid density and size, when combined with the enforcement of the electric propulsion constraints, can preclude the feasibility of certain gravity tractor configurations. Additionally, odd thruster configurations are shown to drive the gimbal performance and to have major impacts on eroding incident spacecraft surfaces due to plume interaction. Center of gravity movement further exacerbates issues with gimbaling and plume interaction. A tighter plume divergence angle is therefore always desired, but this paper shows that there is an optimal momentum balance between plume interaction and asteroid-plume avoidance. Several gravity tractor techniques are compared based on metrics of time efficacy, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit time, and mass efficiency, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit mass of fuel. Given the propulsion constraints, halo orbits can be infeasible for smaller asteroids unless the mass of the spacecraft is augmented with collected material through a technique called the Enhanced Gravity Tractor. Another proposed method is to alter the halo period by canting the thrusters. In-line hover gravity tractors can always be moved along the net thrust direction to conform to the given propulsion system at the expense of performance, except in the case of smaller asteroids with propulsion systems that are limited in lower throttle range or maximum gimbal angle. Alternative strategies, such as on-off pulsing the thrusters to lower the effective thrust are considered. An example is described for deflecting asteroid 2008 EV5 (341843), which currently serves as the reference asteroid for the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission.

S	Jones-Wilson, L; Susca, S			IEEE	Jones-Wilson, Laura; Susca, Sara			A Framework for Extending the Science Traceability Matrix: Application to the Planned Europa Mission	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				One of the most critical functions of the systems engineering requirements process for a large multi-instrument science-driven space mission is to successfully communicate customer expectations into a comprehensive and traceable science requirements flowdown. These requirements are essential to communicating the constraints on the scope of the science investigations and clarifying how multiple instruments contribute to a given science goal. They also provide insight into how the science goals of the whole mission are affected by design choices. There is little specific guidance available on best practices for developing this science-driven flowdown. A unified Science Traceability Matrix (USTM) contains a significant amount of information that can be leveraged for that purpose, but the USTM was not designed to directly produce a complete science requirements flowdown. Thus, starting with the principles codified in a USTM, the authors propose a framework that directly maps into the requirements flowdown and supports broader systems engineering processes while retaining its meaning to the science team. This Science Traceability and Alignment Framework, or STAF, defines a set of common definitions and valid relationships to structure communication across the project. In addition, STAF populates a network of information that can be useful to support complex mission analysis activities such as fault protection. This work discusses the highest-level implementation of the STAF, the project-domain or P-STAF, which describes an approach to decomposing customer requirements into science requirements. The planned Europa Mission is used as a case study for the implementation of this framework and its potential benefits to a project.

However, they also pose a set of new environmental challenges that must be addressed in order to offer a viable alternative to ground-or space-based assets. In particular, maintaining science-quality pointing stability is a critical challenge for HAB platforms. For these missions, dynamic errors must be limited to a fraction of the observation wavelength, so as the wavelength becomes smaller, it becomes more difficult to meet the needed performance. As a result, there are very few existing pointing stabilization solutions that use visible-spectrum guide stars, despite their relatively wide distribution across the sky. This paper describes the results achieved with the STABLE (Subarcsecond Telescope And BaLloon Experiment) project whose goal is to provide the fine pointing stage for a balloonborne platform observing in the visible wavelength.

However, it is at a relatively low level of maturity compared to conventional propulsion options. Technology development efforts are currently underway to bring hybrid propulsion to a technology readiness level that would enable its infusion into potential Mars Sample Return. A new propellant combination is being considered for this design that has excellent low temperature behavior. Preliminary results of two ground test campaigns are currently underway to characterize this propellant combination. Hotfire testing is being carried out in parallel at Parabilis Space Technologies and Space Propulsion Group. In addition to the new propellant combination, several other technologies are being pursued for a potential hybrid MAV: hypergolic ignition and Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control. Both of these technologies have been applied in other rocket applications, e.g. liquid propulsion commonly uses hypergolic propellants and missiles, such as the Minuteman II, have used LITVC in the past. Hypergolic ignition, when oxidizer and fuel combust upon contact, is highly desirable for multiple starts required by the MAV concept. Therefore, testing at Penn State and Purdue is being completed in this area. An updated hybrid propulsion system design for a Mars Ascent Vehicle concept based on JPL's current understanding of potential Mars Sample Return requirements will be presented, leveraging the advances in technology development as well as updated understanding of how requirements may evolve.

The GRACE-FO mission is the result of an international cooperation to develop a concept and approach that minimizes cost and risk and maximizes the probability of success through limited changes to the original GRACE system design. The result is a system architecture in which maintenance of heritage is paramount, including heritage derived through the partnership with the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Germany. As a secondary goal, GRACE-FO will carry a Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) as a technology demonstration, which will provide laser interferometry measurements of inter-satellite range, complementary to the K/Ka-Band microwave link to demonstrate laser-ranging technology in support of future GRACE- like missions. Another secondary objective is the continuation of GRACE radio occultation measurements.

Historically, international agreements provided guidelines to prevent contamination of the Moon and other celestial bodies, as well as the Earth (e.g., sample return missions). The UN Outer Space Treaty was established in 1967 and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) maintains a planetary protection policy complying with Article IX of this treaty. By avoiding forward contamination, the integrity of scientific exploration is preserved. Planetary Protection mission requirements are levied on missions to control contamination. These requirements are dependent on the science of the mission and on the celestial bodies encountered or targeted along the way. Consequently, categories are assigned to missions, and specific implementation plans are developed to meet the planetary protection requirements. NASA missions have evolved over time with increasingly more demanding scientific objectives and more complex flight systems to achieve those objectives and, thus, planetary protection methods and processes used for implementation have become much more intricate, complicated, and challenging. Here, we will portray the evolution of planetary protection implementation at JPL in several important areas throughout the course of NASA sponsored robotic Mars lander or rover missions, starting from Mars Pathfinder through the beginning of Mars 2020. Highlighted in the discussion will be process changes in planetary protection requirements development and flow down. Development and implementation of new and improved methods used in the reduction of spacecraft bioburden will be discussed as well as approaches and challenges that come along with setting up remote laboratories to perform bioassays. The consequences and forward planning of delays on missions will be highlighted as well as lessons learned on the impact of communication and training in achieving planetary protection requirements. The evolution of methods used for the detection of microbial bioburden on spacecraft hardware will be considered. These methods use standard microbiology as well as the adaptation of advances in biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Technical approaches developed for the prevention of contamination and recontamination of hardware during Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations will be discussed.

The FM system called MONSID is designed to provide off-nominal state detection and identification capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The analysis tool can be applied to MONSID models to predict MONSID's diagnostic performance for various sensor suite configurations and model topologies. The underlying algorithms of the diagnostic resolution analysis tool are discussed. The tool is applied to a MONSID model of a robot power subsystem to illustrate how MONSID's ability to distinguish among potentially faulty components is affected by the number of sensors and their placement (injection points) in the model. The tool can be utilized for FM design early in the program by supporting sensor suite selection. In the operations phase, it can be used to reduce the amount of onboard processing required by the MONSID engine in the fault identification process.

Thus, instead of arriving in mid-Mars-global-dust-storm season in 2016 as originally planned, InSight now will arrive in 2018 during the Martian season when dust storms are typically waning. However, it must be able to withstand a global dust storm near the mission's end a Mars year later, by which point dust on the solar arrays is likely to have accumulated significantly more. This paper discusses how the change in launch date has changed the energy management challenges for InSight, and how the energy management approach for surface operations has been adapted to address those challenges. It also describes how energy balance and battery life are protected over the course of the InSight landed mission, in terms of a deliberate balance between autonomous on-board fault protection and ground commanding into reduced-load configurations that still make progress versus specific, prioritized mission success criteria. It describes the project's unique statistical analysis and usage of Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) archived data on solar energy collection to develop and validate an explicit pre-launch margin policy versus energy reductions due to environment variability over multiple-sol sequences. And finally, the paper explains how this archived energy data has influenced the modification of the Phoenix-heritage autonomous fault protection, to guard against quickly-arising inclement power-generation conditions, such as rapid onset of a local dust storm or water ice cloud front.

The starshade has a particular apodizing profile that effects strong suppression of starlight within the starshade's shadow.

Instead of dedicated launches of large science instruments, small science satellites could be piggybacked as secondary payloads. After deployment, the SmallSats will rendezvous. Miniature robot arms will deploy and perform docking to a second SmallSat, similar to robotic docking on the ISS or space shuttle. This docking method accommodates uncertainty in GNC while reducing risk of spacecraft collision through increased separation distance. Docking will be repeated until the cluster is completely formed, amplifying their capabilities. These clusters would be scalable in both the number and size of the cluster elements. The formation will be maintained without expending energy or fuel. This work addresses technology development areas of creating large, scalable structures in space. This assembly method allows for very small packing volumes that reduces mass and cost. Increased separation distance between cluster elements provide larger aperture per SmallSat, reducing number of total elements. It also enables scalable large structures that can be reconfigurable. Precise relative repositioning can accommodate alignment errors or thermal drift in addition to enabling variable baseline instruments. Individual cluster elements could be grossly repositioned to provide hardware reconfiguration. Applications include large, scalable RF and optical apertures, interferometry, in-space assembly, close formation flying, scanning and fixed "stare" imagers, and mother-daughter spacecraft. Four aspects addressed in this paper include the robotic arm, end effector, SmallSat bus, and rendezvous. The robotic arm is designed to meet SmallSat size (< 0.5U), weight (< kg), actuation, and power (approximate to 15 W) (SWAP) constraints. The actuators can be driven using SmallSat processing and motor drivers. Manipulator position can be held without use of power. By maintaining these constraints, the miniature robotic arm can be used as a payload of a variety of science SmallSats. Accounting for general SmallSat bus trends, capabilities, and interfaces help to provide minimal integration efforts across different platforms. The compact end effector is designed to accommodate any positioning uncertainty and relative spacecraft motion during docking. After docking, the end effector remains engaged without the use of power. Docking can be released to allow for gross hardware reconfiguration. Modularity was another important aspect of the end effector design. While the focus of this work is on docking, modularity allows for a wide range of potential applications. A representative SmallSat bus was designed using COTS components. Finally, rendezvous and relative control of two SmallSats was investigated.

The best observations then available could not provide an acceptable upper limit of the dust environment, so a process was put into place to develop multiple contingency trajectories and attitude profiles that could be implemented within the last few weeks before closest approach. One part of that process was to quickly associate the range of potential dust environments with the probabilities that the spacecraft would survive the encounter. This paper provides an overview of the New Horizons Hazard Process and describes the details of the spacecraft hazard assessment. The New Horizons hazard assessment process began with images taken of the Pluto system using the high-resolution imager. Those images were passed to a group looking for new objects. The locations of any new moons were analyzed to develop the associated stable orbits. Using those orbits, a team of dust modelers developed a range of dust environments for the system using models of how the dust particles were generated by the moons and transported throughout the system. Other key assumptions included the optical properties that defined how the dust environments would be imaged by the spacecraft sensor. These environments were then coupled to the spacecraft trajectory and attitude profiles to predict how many hits the different spacecraft surfaces would see. The number of hits and the damage criteria for those surfaces were combined to develop the overall probability of survival of the spacecraft. There were two parts to the New Horizons hazard process that were unique and provide key features for how these types of studies could be improved in the future. The first part was the timing. All of the spacecraft operations were controlled by preloaded commanded sequences that needed to be developed, reviewed, and tested well beforehand. A set of alternate command sequences and trajectories were developed in advance of the encounter to respond to possible dust hazards in the event that significant hazards were found. The limits of the available imaging from the spacecraft meant that the process of final image acquisition, downlink, analysis, and hazard assessment had to be completed within a 3-day time period so that the appropriate trajectory and sequence could be selected in time. The unknowns associated with the dust environment led to the development of over 2000 dust model/trajectory/attitude combinations that had to be evaluated and assessed. As the number of cases to be evaluated increased, the processing time became the schedule driver. The second part was the parametric dust models used. In an encounter with an unknown dust environment, the calculation of the dust spatial distribution involves a range of parameters that need to be defined by the dust modelling experts. The relative likelihood of the different dust parameter sets used in the dust model allow the generation of confidence levels to be included with the overall spacecraft damage assessment.

An orbiter would capture the OS, manipulate to a preferential orientation, transition it through the steps required to break-the-chain with Mars, stowing it in a containment vessel or an Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV) and providing redundant containment to the OS (for example by closing and sealing the lid of the EEV). In this paper, we discuss the trade-space of concepts generated for both the individual aspects of capture and manipulation of the OS, as well as concepts for the end-to-end system. Notably, we discuss concepts for OS capture, manipulation of the OS to orient it to a preferred configuration, and steps for transitioning the OS between different stages of manipulation, ultimately securing it in a containment vessel or Earth Entry Vehicle.

The OS would be in Martian orbit where a sample capture orbiter could find it and rendezvous with it. The orbiter would capture the OS, manipulate it to a preferential orientation for the samples, transition it through steps required to break-the-chain with Mars, stowing it in a containment vessel or an Earth Entry Vehicle and providing a redundant containment to the OS (e.g., by closing and sealing the lid of the EEV). In this paper, we discuss component technologies developed for in-laboratory evaluation and maturation of concepts toward the robotic capture and manipulation of an Orbital Sample. We discuss techniques for simulating 0-g dynamics of a spherical OS, including contact, in a laboratory setting. In this, we leverage a 5dof gantry system and, alternately, a 6dof KUKA robotic arm to simulate the OS motion. Both the gantry and robotic arm are mounted with a force-torque sensor that enable detection of contact and provide measurements to simulate, in hardware, the 0-g OS dynamics. We present results that demonstrate the validity of our approach and the extent to which we are able to simulate 0-g dynamics in a laboratory setting. We also discuss techniques for detecting and tracking the OS using optical sensors and LIDAR from near-capture distances. These are discussed in the context of individual sensors as well as fusion of multiple sensor readings. Results of hardware experiments with different sensors are presented. Further, we discuss an uncertainty quantification based physics modeling capability for quantitative evaluation of different concepts for OS capture and manipulation. The computational models are based on high-fidelity multibody dynamics simulations of the OS, robotic elements and their contact mechanics. We present results that demonstrate our effective use of computational simulations in a complementary manner to hardware experiments. Finally, we present a cyber-physical approach to concurrently fusing hardware elements, computational simulation elements and autonomy software to effectively and rapidly simulate end-to-end systems concepts for end-to-end orbital sample capture and manipulation system concepts.

These include: an order-of-magnitude or more increase in the area and consequent choices for accessing samples or making observations compared to past lander-based manipulator systems, the ability to deploy samplers and instruments over the extreme topography expected on ocean worlds, and accessing crevasses and vents from a safe distance. We have developed prototypes of concepts for long reach sampling and for deploying instruments and sampling systems on ocean worlds. In the paper, we describe a self-righting system to anchor and collect samples up to 20 cm below the surface and two options for sampler or instrument deployment at distances greater than 10m from a lander.

Long range mobility at an appropriately selected site on the surface and with the requisite science instruments will address these goals. The challenges for mobility are rugged terrain, unknown and potentially soft regolith, extremely low temperature, and on Europa, possible corrosive materials and exposure to radiation. We have designed and prototyped a concept vehicle that can handle a wide range of topography and terra-mechanics conditions that we believe is needed for successful roving on ocean world bodies. The concept has been analyzed, optimized, simulated, and designed. The results from operating and testing the prototype are reported in this paper.

Development of Models for Disk-Gap-Band Parachutes Deployed Supersonically in the Wake of a Slender Body	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research and Experiments (ASPIRE) project will investigate the supersonic deployment, inflation, and aerodynamics of DiskGap- Band (DGB) parachutes in the wake of a slender body. The parachutes will be full-scale versions of the DGBs used by the Mars Science Laboratory in 2012 and planned for NASA's Mars 2020 project and will be delivered to targeted deployment conditions representative of flight at Mars by sounding rockets launched out of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. The parachutes will be tested in the wake of a slender payload whose diameter is approximately a sixth that of entry capsules used for Mars missions. Models of the deployment, inflation, and aerodynamic performance of the parachutes are necessary to design key aspects of the experiment, including: determining the expected loads and applicable margins on the parachute and payload; guiding sensor selection and placement; evaluating the vehicle trajectory for targeting, range safety, and recovery operations. In addition, knowledge of the differences in the behavior of the parachutes in the wake of slender and blunt bodies is required in order to interpret the results of the sounding rocket experiment and determine how they relate to expected performance behind blunt bodies at Mars. However, modeling the performance of a supersonic DGB in the wake of a slender body is challenging due to the scarcity of historical test data and modeling precedents. This paper describes the models of the aerodynamic performance of DGBs in supersonic slender-body wakes being developed for the ASPIRE sounding rocket test campaign. Development of these models is based on the four available flight tests of DGBs deployed in supersonic slender-body wakes as well as on data from past flight and wind-tunnel experiments of DGBs deployed in the wake of blunt bodies, on the reconstructed at-Mars DGB performance during past missions, and on computational fluid dynamics simulations. Simulations of the wakes of blunt and slender bodies in supersonic flow have been conducted in order to investigate the differences in the flowfields encountered by parachutes deployed in both wake types. The simulations have allowed the project to investigate the fundamental differences between the sounding rocket tests and the flight of a DGB during a Mars mission and to assess the limitations of the sounding rocket test architecture for evaluating flight performance at Mars.

On-orbit Measurement of ISS Vibrations during OPALS Extended Mission Operations	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Detailed understanding of the International Space Station vibration environment, particularly for the unpressurized portions of the platform, is and has been of high interest to payload developers seeking precision pointing performance due to its potential impact on on-orbit operations. The availability of such information, however, especially measured data, has been scarce, usually forcing investigators to utilize conservative bounding assumptions. During extended mission operations aboard the ISS at ELC 1, FRAM 8, the OPALS payload conducted a series of experiments aimed at improving the understanding of this key environmental parameter. The payload was repurposed for performing open-loop tracking of a ground-based laser beacon in a step-and-stare fashion so as to minimize the effects of its own gimbal on the measurement. Following significant processing of data acquired at 100Hz, the root-mean-square jitter at the OPALS mounting location is estimated to be in the 20-30 microradians range, and may even be in the low teens under certain conditions, an order of magnitude lower than previously assumed value.

The ability to rove on the surface of a comet could create a similar revolutionary improvement in the quality and quantity of in situ science that could be performed in comparison to touch-and-go systems or static landers. However, due to the microgravity environment, traditional wheeled rovers are infeasible as they lack the ground pressure on their wheels necessary for traction. Recent breakthroughs in limbed robots both at JPL and broadly across the world provide hope that a reliable and robust climbing rover could be a priority mission in the next decade. Similar rapid development has been occurring in anchoring end effectors that would serve as the rovers feet, preventing the rover from escaping the microscopic gravity field. When sampling the subsurface (1-3 meter depth), these same anchoring feet would also react the forces and torques that are put into the surface. A mission concept is presented that would analyze unaltered primitive materials, catalog complex organic molecules, and document any organic synthesis still occurring. In addition, the mission would quantify the heterogeneity of the comet's chemical and physical properties. A potential instrument suite is proposed that would fulfill these objectives. The science campaign of this mission was developed in partnership with JPL's Innovation Foundry.

The mission plans to extract a boulder from the asteroid's surface and use the combined mass of the spacecraft and boulder to slowly change the parent asteroid's orbit using a gravity tractor technique. ARM would then return this boulder to the Earth-Moon system for future human exploration. ARM would also mature several critical technologies needed for human missions to Mars including high power solar electric propulsion, dexterous robotics and autonomy, and support technologies for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. ARM has baselined two Microspine Tools for grasping, anchoring to, and helping extract the boulder from the asteroid. These tools must operate in the microgravity environment of the asteroid with the ability to grip and drill in microgravity. Another challenging constraint is the large uncertainty in the physical properties of the boulder. This paper describes the Microspine Tool's architecture, detailed design, and the fabrication and testing of a development unit.

A critical component of such a campaign would be an Orbiting Sample container (OS), which would contain the Mars samples to be returned to Earth. This paper discusses the most recent efforts by the JPL's Mars Formulation Office to mature an OS design planned for use on a potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. Similar to the "Decadal Study Architecture" [1], the current MSR architecture envisions as a three-mission campaign with each mission serving a critical role towards returning Martian rock and atmospheric samples back to Earth. An OS would be a central piece of hardware in the proposed MSR architecture due to its interfaces to all the three missions of the potential campaign. Additionally, numerous stakeholders and subsystems such as science and planetary protection impose challenging requirements on the OS's functions and capabilities. As a result, designing an OS that meets all the requirements is challenging and quite complex. The story of the OS's evolution from black box concept thru to the current-and-still-maturing baseline design is the focus of this paper. From the OS's launch off Earth aboard a Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) through to return to Earth, the design and functional requirements generated by and for each stage of the OS's mission are discussed. Then, with an understanding of what the OS would be required to do, a mapping of the main requirements to the design features of the current OS concept is explained. Many tests and analyses have been conducted to support and validate the current OS design. Results from test and analysis in the areas of aerothermal, impact dynamics, optical tracking, and radio electromagnetics are presented.

In particular, this paper is focused on aerostatic-based mechanisms, utilizing buoyancy principles to maintain flight. Three primary aerostat types were investigated; CharliSre (light-gas), Montgolfier (heated gas), and Vacuum aerostats. Supplemental systems to the aerostats were also investigated to assist with mobility control within the Jupiter atmosphere. The systems include the Balloon Guidance System (BGS) previously investigated for planetary balloons, and buoyancy controlled gliders. A CharliSre would provide the most reliable lift, however one needs to ensure 13 kg of H-2 for every 1 kg of payload. A Montgolfier would not require supplemental hydrogen; further analysis is needed to evaluate flight equilibrium dynamics. A BGS would provide the increased mobility otherwise unachievable with a conventional aerostat, offering steering ability (given wind gradients) between Jupiter belts and zones. Buoyancy controlled gliding is a potential solution which if executed correctly may bridge the functionality gap between traditional aerostats (with the benefits of reliable lift), and gliders (with maneuverability and navigational abilities).

This paper details the UST software defined radio design and describes how the combination of a modular hardware architecture and in-flight reprogrammability enables a new level of flexibility and expandability for a space transponder. The UST uses common power and digital processing assemblies that can be integrated with a variety of RF modules and is capable of simultaneous, multiband operations with data rates up to 37.5 Mbps RX and 300 Mbps TX. This allows a single radio to support all the direct-to-Earth and relay communication requirements for even complex mission scenarios, reducing the total cost, mass, and power. The discussion includes a description of the current UST engineering models that have been built and tested, as well as details about the next generation capabilities supported by UST, including advanced link coding and modulation, radiometric techniques, and in-radio protocol handling. Details are also presented on RF modules and digital processing in development for radio science and astronomy purposes, including a bistatic radar receiver and broadband planetary emissions receiver. These will demonstrate the ability to integrate low-cost science instruments into the UST architecture, further expanding the versatility of the UST.

Charged dust is ever present, in the form of dusty plasma, even at high altitudes, following the solar illumination. If a body with high surface resistivity is exposed to the solar wind and solar radiation, sunexposed areas and shadowed areas become differentially charged. The E-Glider (Electrostatic Glider) is an enabling capability for operation at airless bodies, a solution applicable to many types of in-situ missions, which leverages the natural environment. This platform directly addresses the "All Access Mobility" Challenge, one of the NASA's Space Technology Grand Challenges. Exploration of comets, asteroids, moons and planetary bodies is limited by mobility on those bodies. The lack of an atmosphere, the low gravity levels, and the unknown surface soil properties pose a very difficult challenge for all forms of know locomotion at airless bodies. This EGlider levitates by extending thin, charged, appendages, which are also articulated to direct the levitation force in the most convenient direction for propulsion and maneuvering. The charging is maintained through continuous charge emission. It lands, wherever it is most convenient, by retracting the appendages or by firing a cold-gas thruster, or by deploying an anchor. Preliminary calculations indicate that a 1 kg mass can be electrostatically levitated in a microgravity field with a 2 m diameter electrostatically inflated ribbon structure at 19kV, hence the need for a "balloon-like" system. The wings could be made of very thin Au-coated Mylar film, which are electrostatically inflated, and would provide the lift due to electrostatic repulsion with the naturally charged asteroid surface. Since the E-glider would follow the Sun's illumination, the solar panels on the vehicle would constantly charge a battery. Further articulation at the root of the lateral strands or inflated membrane wings, would generate a component of lift depending on the articulation angle, hence a selective maneuvering capability which, to all effects, would lead to electrostatic (rather than aerodynamic) flight.

Additionally, dynamic systems offer the potential of producing generators with significantly reduced power degradation over the course of deep space missions so that more power would be available at the end of the mission, when it is needed most for both powering science instruments and transmitting the resulting data. The development of dynamic generators involves addressing technical issues not typically associated with traditional thermoelectric generators. Developing long-life, robust, and reliable dynamic conversion technology is challenging yet essential to building a suitable flight-ready generator. Considerations include working within existing hardware-handling infrastructure, where possible, so that development costs can be kept low, and integrating dynamic generators into spacecraft, which may be more complex than integration of static thermoelectric systems. Methods of interfacing to and controlling a dynamic generator must also be considered, and new potential failure modes must be taken into account. This paper will address some of the key issues of dynamic RPS design, development, and adaption.	[Qualls, A.

The WindBot would explore this region, which extends from 15km above to 125km below the reference surface at 1 bar. Proposed WindBot mission scenarios include a glider which would use updrafts to gain altitude before gliding to find another updraft, mimicking the action of soaring birds such as frigate birds. In another mission scenario, a balloon-like WindBot would use buoyancy to maintain altitude within its operational region. An important requirement of a WindBot is survival with energy obtained in-situ to provide power for the 30-50W avionic payload envisioned for the mission. The solar intensity below Jupiter's clouds is small and a solar solution as well as a nuclear solution have been ruled out from this study. This paper analyzes methods of energy generation and harvesting in Jupiters atmosphere and offers a comparison of the relative power densities. Wind, thermal, and magnetic energy, as well as other modalities, are sources of energy for a WindBot to transform into mechanical or electrical energy. Mechanisms evaluated include vibration harvesting and turbine technologies to utilize small-scale wind velocity gradients. Natural atmospheric thermal and pressure gradients may be tapped to provide power to a WindBot. The possibility of inductive generation using Jupiters strong magnetic field is also considered. Finally, these methods are evaluated on their power density and applicability to proposedWindBot designs.

An analysis of the optimum placement of two vertically collinear reflectors suggests that placement atop a 300m deployable support structure would be sufficient to provide year round illumination to points of interest in the crater below. In order to provide the 300W/m(2) of sunlight necessary for the robots to operate, each solar reflector must unfold to over 1000m(2) of reflective surface area, have over 95% long term directional reflectivity in the visible regime, and be flat within lmm/m of deviation. Each reflector must also stow to less than 1m(3) in volume, have less than 100kg of mass, and be less than 1mm thick. Two classes of origami crease patterns have been developed that will allow a 25 mu m thick aluminized biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate solar reflector with 95% visible reflectivity, to be stowed within a cylinder lm tall, lm in diameter, with a mass of 35kg, and with up to 0.71m(3) volume to spare in the center for other components. Each class of origami crease pattern can be deployed from their perimeter by an attached inflatable thermoplastic torus that heats up during deployment to maintain flexibility and cools to maintain rigidity afterward. The remainder of the 1m(3) volume will be allocated to the inflatable deployment mechanism, electronics, and the deployable support structure. In order to maintain flatness, carbon fiber fabric tapes would run along the load bearing paths opposite of the reflective surface. Simulations of an elliptic solar reflector under lunar gravity show that a single carbon fiber fabric tape 40cm wide that spans the length of the reflector is sufficient to maintain the required flatness. Future work includes simulating the deployment of the solar reflectors with their support structure, building and testing larger scale prototypes, and performing field tests in relevant environments.

By utilizing high temperature alloys, the rover would survive on the surface of Venus for weeks if not months. The rover concept harvests wind energy using a turbine and stores it in a constant force spring. The mobility system would be guided by a mechanical computer and logic system, programed to carry out the mission. It would collect basic science data such as wind speed, temperature, and seismic events. Communicating the data back to Earth is the most challenging aspect of the system design with multiple options being explored in a trade: a simple electronic high temperature transponder, a retroreflector target or inscribing phonograph style records to be launched via a balloon to a high altitude drone capable of transmitting the data back to Earth. AREE is not only a new exciting in-situ rover concept, but also a paradigm shift to conducting in-situ science in extreme environments. Traditional extreme environment vehicles collect as many diverse data points as possible in the short period of time before system failure. AREE breaks that trend by exploring what can be done with only a few basic scientific measurements, but recorded over long periods of time.

SpaceCubeX: A Framework for Evaluating Hybrid Multi-Core CPU/FPGA/DSP Architectures	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The SpaceCubeX project is motivated by the need for high performance, modular, and scalable on-board processing to help scientists answer critical 21st century questions about global climate change, air quality, ocean health, and ecosystem dynamics, while adding new capabilities such as low-latency data products for extreme event warnings. These goals translate into on-board processing throughput requirements that are on the order of 100-1,000x more than those of previous Earth Science missions for standard processing, compression, storage, and downlink operations. To study possible future architectures to achieve these performance requirements, the SpaceCubeX project provides an evolvable testbed and framework that enables a focused design space exploration of candidate hybrid CPU/FPGA/DSP processing architectures. The framework includes ArchGen, an architecture generator tool populated with candidate architecture components, performance models, and IP cores, that allows an end user to specify the type, number, and connectivity of a hybrid architecture. The framework requires minimal extensions to integrate new processors, such as the anticipated High Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC), reducing time to initiate benchmarking by months. To evaluate the framework, we leverage a wide suite of high performance embedded computing benchmarks and Earth science scenarios to ensure robust architecture characterization. We report on our projects Year 1 efforts and demonstrate the capabilities across four simulation testbed models, a baseline SpaceCube 2.0 system, a dual ARM A9 processor system, a hybrid quad ARM A53 and FPGA system, and a hybrid quad ARM A53 and DSP system.

The chronicle of designing and updating the Titan flyby altitudes have twists and turns enough to satisfy a full-length novel or feature film, including: critical design decision-making before arrival with multiple atmospheric models, high uncertainties, and limited data; early flybys that seemed to show trends that weren't there; use and misuse of statistical analysis; unexpected surprises with limited reaction time; navigation of a scientific, engineering, and management community with a wide array of inherent biases; and consideration of a variety of project risk postures in a high-scrutiny, high-impact, high-reward environment.

One of these technical teams is the Mission Operations Planning team, charged with increasing interactions and efficiency for planning of mission activities. That team is chaired by the author with representatives from eight other centers across the Agency. As the strategic architects for the vision of agency-wide ops planning, the team has identified a number of new initiatives and techniques to improve planning, including: breaking down walls within centers which obstruct multi-mission planning; breaking down walls agency-wide which obstruct the sharing of ops planning lessons and capabilities; strengthening the community of practice of ops planning capability developers; establishing best practices for a variety of types of ops planning; defining standards for activity plans and timelines, and plan inputs; and recommending the presence of "multi-mission operations champions" within each center to implement these recommendations into the next decade.

Two Antenna Arrays for Remote Sensing Applications	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE			MICROSTRIP ANTENNA	This paper presents two array designs as feeds for parabolic reflector antennas for satellite remote sensing applications. The designs are 4x4 in dimensions and fit within the surface area of one side of a CubeSat. Both arrays are dual-frequency and dual-polarization and are designed on different substrates. The frequencies of interest are 14 GHz and 35 GHz, and the polarizations are vertical and horizontal (or 0 degrees and 90 degrees). One array is designed solely on a Roger RO4003C material, while the other is designed on the RO4003C for the antennas layer and on an RT/Duroid 6010 for the feeding network. The designs are multi-layer and different challenges are being met. For integration purpose, the feed layers must be placed on the same substrates, which in turn require the elimination of any overlapping as well as increased spacing between adjacent lines. Symmetry for the feeds is ensured by using corporate feed networks as the array size (4x4) results in acceptable losses. Parametrization of the feed provided the flexibility to adjust element spacing and achieve a fully nested design where the 35 GHz array lies inside the empty space of a 2x2, 14 GHz sub-array. Also, adequate space for the integration of surface mounted amplifiers directly on the feed network layer is provided. The proposed array occupies only 8.7 cm x 7.2 cm and has similar radiation patterns at both frequencies and polarizations with an excellent front-to-back ratio.

Modeling Risk Perception for Mars Rover Supervisory Control: Before and After Wheel Damage	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The perception of risk can dramatically influence the human selection of semi-autonomous system control strategies, particularly in safety-critical systems like unmanned vehicle operation. Thus, the ability to understand the components of risk perception can be extremely valuable in developing either operational strategies or decision support technologies. To this end, this paper analyzes the differences in human supervisory control of Mars Science Laboratory rover operation before and after the discovery of wheel damage. This paper identifies four operational factors sensitive to risk perception changes including rover distance traveled, utilization frequency of the autonomous driving capability (AutoNav), terrain risk weighting, and changes in high-level mission planning. A resulting Rover Risk Perception Model illustrates how these operational factors relate to increased perception of risk. Based on these results, we propose aiding risk perception mitigation strategies such that risk can be appropriately anchored. Such strategies can include a change in system design including adding technology and decision support tools, or changing the training of operators who use the system.

The high-power, light-weight solar arrays and high-power, magnetically-shielded hall thrusters being developed for ARRM will dramatically increase NASA's in-space transportation capability. These two technologies could propel affordable human missions to asteroids, Martian moons, and asteroids. In addition, these technologies could be used to enhance human access to cis-lunar space and the Lunar surface.

These five orbits were designed to be as deep in the atmosphere as Cassini could safely fly; however, recent occultation data of Saturn's atmosphere suggest that it is contracting. Given this contraction, the primary concern during these orbits has shifted from spacecraft health and safety to loss of science value. This paper explores a scenario for modifying the Cassini spacecraft's trajectory, during these final orbits, such that it dips deeper into Saturn's atmosphere. This scenario describes the method for in-situ detection of Saturn's atmospheric state, the locations and sizes of maneuvers that would reduce the final periapsis altitudes, the effects of such maneuvers on the remaining trajectory, and the risks involved. The result is that a periapsis-lowering, "pop-down" maneuver is feasible during Cassini's final orbits. Risk to the spacecraft is minimized by using the attitude control thrusters as density detectors during the first three atmospheric transits of the final five orbits. Should these transits reveal sufficiently low density and should sufficient propellant remain, then the Cassini project will consider performing the maneuver.

The FPA was characterized in a laboratory thermal-vacuum chamber that allowed the read noise, dark current, well capacity, linearity, and crosstalk to be measured. Results are presented across a range of operating temperatures and pixel clock rates. Additionally, the outcomes of radiation testing to 100 krad TID are discussed.

The inversely twisted liquid crystal polymer (LCP) layer method was introduced to achieve broadband operation in patterned waveplate applications. The selection of the twist angle and half wave retardation wavelength, and the precise control in fabrication to achieve these values are critical for high efficiency in these type of devices. We numerically simulated the conversion efficiency of inversely twisted LCP to determine the twist angle and half wave retardation wavelength for the designated wavelength range, and experimentally fine-tuned these parameters. The resulted VVW exhibit very high conversion efficiency in the designated wavelength range. Polarimetry measurement revealed that the retardation of the VVW is very close to half wave retardation in a broad wavelength range.

The F-ring orbits, and proximal time outside of POST, were handled similar to Cassini's Solstice Mission using the Pre-Integrated Event (PIE) process. The new and unique properties of the spacecraft's trajectory required much forethought to be flown safely while still planning for the most and best science return possible. Some ring-plane crossings (RPX) will be protected against dust impacts by turning the high gain antenna (HGA) to the dust RAM direction (HGA2RAM). If on the first proximal RPX higher than expected dust readings are seen then the Project Office may choose to require more (all) subsequent RPX to be HGA2RAM, implemented via a real-time command overlay for uplinked sequences. The pointing uncertainties will be larger than usual after the final targeted flyby; some of the process changes to address this include adding extra orbit trim maneuvers (OTMs) (fuel permitting) to resync to the reference trajectory and reduce pointing uncertainties; and movable blocks of commands to be used for some periapses where atmospheric drag may cause large timing shifts Changes made for FRPO to address perceptions that these sequences will be hard to implement include requiring early pointing designs (during integration) for certain types of observations, requiring teams to check early on that they can turn to and from their observation attitude, and that their attitude is safe, and adjusting the Implementation process to give more time for science observation designers. This paper will discuss these process changes and lessons learned so far.

At JPL, we are designing a single receiver package designed to operate across the 8 to 48 GHz frequency range, in contrast to the current JVLA, which covers this frequency range with five receiver packages. Reducing the number of receiving systems required to cover the full frequency range would reduce operating costs. We are developing a prototype integrated feed-receiver package with a system noise temperature that meets the requirements of the ngVLA/NAA primary science programs, with a design that meets the requirement of low long-term operational costs. The receiver package being developed at JPL consists of a feed horn, low-noise amplifier (LNA), and down-converters to analog intermediate frequencies. We report on the status of this receiver package development.

S	Wilcox, B			IEEE	Wilcox, Brian			An Architecture for Sustainable Human Exploration of Mars Enabled by Water from the Lunar Poles	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				This paper describes an architecture for human exploration of Mars that would be enabled by 10 metric tons (t) per day of ISRU water extracted at the lunar poles. The architecture involves a concept for a standardized "self-propelled tank" having an 85% propellant mass fraction that could hold up to 51 t of LH2/LO2 propellant. A variant of this tank would be equipped with landing legs so that, when fully-loaded, it could lift another full tank into Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), release it, and have enough propellant remaining to mate with an empty tank and to land safely back at the ISRU plant in a lunar polar crater. Two such pairs would be launched each lunar sidereal month such that the two payload tanks could mate together in LLO and depart to a carefully-selected High Earth Orbit (HEO). This orbit is such that exactly one tank would be consumed propelling one full tank to HEO and returning one empty tank from HEO to LLO, with both tanks arriving empty. Also, a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is selected where two full tanks in HEO could mate together such that one full tank arrives in LEO while the other tank has just enough propellant left to return to HEO, arriving empty. This combination of capabilities allows payloads to be launched from Earth into LEO, where they could be ferried to HEO using lunar propellant. Such payloads could be assembled together as stacks in HEO, where an array of full tanks accumulated over time from lunar ISRU could propel them on Hohmann transfers to Mars on every opportunity (every 26 months). The notional payload we envision launching to Mars every 26 months includes two 31 t Deep Space Habitats (DSHs, one for the outbound journey and one for the return journey) plus a 48 t Mars Surface Habitat with Ascent Vehicle (MSHAV). The stack departs HEO with a small burn from the array of 24 standardized propellant tanks - just enough to put it on an Oberth Maneuver trajectory, swinging by the top of the Earth's atmosphere where the main Trans-Mars Injection (TMI) burn occurs, consuming 7.8 of the 24 tanks. No tanks are jettisoned, so as to make this architecture sustainable and affordable. Upon arrival at Mars similar to 7-9 months later, another 9.2 tanks are burned to inject the stack into Low Mars Orbit (LMO). Exactly one tank is burned to de-orbit the MSHAV, reducing its velocity to zero at some point deep in the Mars atmosphere. The one tank that de-orbits the Mars entry stack is lost. After similar to 500 days on the Mars surface, the MAV launches and mates with the main stack in LMO. The returning DSH and the 23 tanks depart LMO with a burn of 4.3 tanks for Trans-Earth Injection. Upon arrival at Earth, 1.7 tanks are burned to inject into HEO, where the tanks could be shuttled back to the lunar surface for re-fueling. The DSH is mated with a single full tank at HEO that brings it to LEO to rendezvous with a crew capsule for re-entry.

A Deep Subsurface Ice Probe for Europa	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				This paper describes work on a concept for a probe that would be capable of km-scale deep subsurface ice penetration on Europa or other Ocean World. Penetrating deep into or through the ice cap over the liquid ocean is the best way to establish if life has evolved there. A central thesis of this work is that we must start by addressing the Planetary Protection constraints, and not to try to add them on at the end. Specifically, all hardware in the probe would be designed to survive heat sterilization at 500C for extended periods, as required to meet the COSPAR 1-in-10,000 probability per mission of biological contamination of the ocean. The baseline concept features a heat source containing plutonium-238 encased within a stainless Dewar so that the heat is not lost by conduction into the ice. A circular saw blade sticks out through a slot in a hemispherical turret dome at the bottom of the Dewar such that the blade cuts the ice as it spins. The turret also rotates slowly to cause the saw blade to make a hemispherical cut in the ice. The ice chips would be thrown up through the slit into the turret and would be melted by the heat source. The meltwater drains into sumps on either side of the sawblade, from which the meltwater would be pumped out to the rear of the probe. The main body of the probe contains a spool of aluminum tubing that would be dispensed from within the probe all the way back to the lander. This tubing is nominally 1-3 mm in outside dimension with integral insulated electrical wires around the center hole. This tube would pneumatically transport small (mm-scale) single-use canisters containing meltwater samples from the probe to the surface for analysis. Surface analysis allows use of instruments that can be neither miniaturized nor sterilized sufficiently to go down-hole. Dry inert gas would be used to push the canister down from the lander and back up. The dry gas would be re-compressed and re-used. During a portion of the cruise to the outer solar system, the heat source would heat the entire probe, including the coiled tubing inside as well as all the canisters and inert gas, to 500C to destroy any lingering organisms and to decompose any complex organic molecules. The paper describes analysis, design, and preliminary testing, as well as plans for building a prototype and testing it in an "ice treadmill" where a plug of ice is created inside a vertical LN2 cold jacket, pushed up by water pumped below so that the ice plug rises at the same rate that the probe penetrates the ice.

S	Xie, H; Divsalar, D; Farr, WH; Dolinar, S; Cheung, KM			IEEE	Xie, Hua; Divsalar, Dariush; Farr, William H.; Dolinar, Sam; Cheung, Kar-Ming			Very Low Rate Coded Laser Communications for Noise-Limited Space Optical Channels	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE			MODULATION	For an optical communications signal, when the noise power dominates, the capacity scales as the square of signal power over noise power. In this regime, data rate scales inversely as the 4th power of range, and the high data rate advantage of optical communications that results from a narrower transmit beam cannot be achieved. Before a received signal can be decoded, it first must be acquired from the background noise. In noise-limited optical communications, a background power dependent signal power threshold exists below which acquisition cannot occur, and data cannot be recovered. Decreasing the pulse width, corresponding to increasing the modulation bandwidth B, both increases capacity and aids acquisition. Higher modulation bandwidths than about 10 GHz require higher power in the control electronics due to the energy required to charge and discharge circuit capacitances. Higher complexity and higher power are negative attributes for space optical communications. One solution is to use a mode-locked laser, which enables very high effective peak power pulses with minimum complexity. A mode-locked laser utilizes a non-linear inter-cavity element to generate a fixed-rate train of narrow pulses. Communications requires data encoding on the fixed pulse train carrier. One method is to use a mode-locked laser with right or left circularly polarized output. Initial acquisition is aided by the narrow temporal spectrum and high peak power. Once acquired, all of the background noise outside the single data slot of the symbol can be rejected. In the noise-limited regime, capacity now is proportional to signal power over bandwidth-noise power product. The use of the mode-locked laser, versus a conventional pulse-carved continuous wave laser, allows optical communications links to be established in background noise regimes where the signal could not be acquired using conventional modulation schemes. This laser source and modulation scheme has benefits to CubeSat optical communications, and lander/rover Direct-toEarth communications. In this paper we investigate the design and performance evaluation of a coded mode-locked laser with right and left circular polarization switching. At the optical receiver a polarizing beam splitter and two photo-detectors are used to detect the data. One method for data detection is to compare the number of received photons from two photo-detectors. This comparison produces 0, or 1, or an erasure output. The erasure symbol is produced when the numbers of photons from the two detectors are equal. This method of detection produces an equivalent binary-input ternary-output discrete memoryless channel. Transition probabilities of this channel are computed based on received signal and background noise fluxes. We evaluate the performance of a very low-rate turbo code (rate 1/31) to be used over this channel. We compare this code's performance with the capacity of the underlying optical channel, and with uncoded system performance. We demonstrate that at least 10 dB coding gain can be achieved with respect to the uncoded case. Moreover, we show that the performance of this well designed code is within 1 dB of channel capacity for an information block size of 16384 bits.

Its rotary drill successfully penetrated the surface and pneumatically transferred material to the science instrument within the insulated interior of the spacecraft. Follow-on missions in the Venera and Vega program repeated that feat. These missions demonstrated that it is possible for an electric motor to function at Venus conditions and that it is possible to drill Venus surface material and pneumatically transfer captured sample under Venus conditions. Unfortunately, design details for the sampling system do not exist or cannot be located. Hence for any future Venus surface missions, the sampling technology has to be designed without any prior knowledge of materials or methods. To help advance Venus sampling technology, Honeybee Robotics in partnership with NASA JPL has been developing critical components that would make Venus sampling possible. To date, three types of motors (Switched Reluctance, Brushless DC, and Stepper), a Pulsed Injection Position Sensor (PIPS) for commutation and position control, and planetary gearboxes have been fabricated and tested at Venus Temperature and/or Venus Temperature and Pressure. This paper summarizes past work and presents the current state-of-art technology related to Venus sampling drill for the New Frontiers Venus lander proposal called In-situ Surface and Atmospheric Geochemical Explorer (VISAGE).

It is important to make sure such a mission concept would not bring any living microbes, which may possibly exist on Mars, back to Earth's environment. In order to ensure the isolation of Mars microbes from Earth's Atmosphere, a brazing sealing and sterilizing technique was proposed to break the Mars-to-Earth contamination path. Effectively, heating the brazing zone in high vacuum space and controlling the sample temperature for integrity are key challenges to the implementation of this technique. The break-the-chain procedures for container configurations, which are being considered, were simulated by multi-physics finite element models. Different heating methods including induction and resistive/radiation were evaluated. The temperature profiles of Martian samples in a proposed container structure were predicted. The results show that the sealing and sterilizing process can be controlled such that the samples temperature is maintained below the level that may cause damage, and that the brazing technique is a feasible approach to breaking the contamination path.

In order to ensure this does not happen, it would be necessary to "break the chain of contact (BTC)", where any material reaching Earth would have to be inside a container that is sealed with extremely high confidence. Therefore, it would be necessary to contain the acquired samples and destroy any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of their container while protecting the sample itself for further analysis. A novel synchronous separation, seaming, sealing and sterilization (S4) process for sample containerization and planetary protection has been conceived and demonstrated. A prototype double wall container with inner and outer shells and Earth clean interstitial space was used for this demonstration. In a potential future mission, the double wall container would be split into two halves and prepared on Earth, while the potential on-orbit execution would consist of inserting the sample into one of the halves and then mating to the other half and brazing. The use of brazing material that melts at temperatures higher than 500 degrees C would assure sterilization of the exposed areas since all carbon bonds are broken at this temperature. The process would be executed in two-steps, Step-1: the double wall container halves would be fabricated and brazed on Earth; and Step-2: the containerization and sterilization process would be executed on-orbit. To prevent potential jamming during the process of mating the two halves of the double wall container and the extraction of the brazed inner container, a cone-within-cone approach has been conceived and demonstrated.

Compact piezoelectric resonance mass balance for sample verification and mass quantification and mixing	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 26-29, 2017	Portland, OR	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc, Fiberguide Ind, Frontiers Media		Piezoelectric; mass balance; resonance; flextensional; cantilever; ultrasonic mixing; portioning	RETURN MISSION; MODE	There is a need for sample verification and mass quantification of rock, soil and/or ice obtained by sample acquisition mechanisms on extraterrestrial bodies. For many scientific instruments information about the mass of the sample would aid in the interpretation of the data and help prevent the portioning system from overloading instrument ports. Additionally, on a potential sample return mission it is likely that a sample confirmation or mass determination requirement would be implemented before the spacecraft would be commanded to return to Earth or Lunar orbit. In an effort to meet these potential requirements, a piezoelectric resonance balance is being developed to measure a frequency change proportional to the sample mass change. In previous work(1) we developed a resonance balance which produced large non-linear frequency changes due to the addition of a large mass. In this study we have looked at a variety of resonator geometries in an effort to linearize the frequency shift with mass. In addition, we have investigated the use of oscillator/counter circuitry to track the frequency shift of the piezoelectric mass balance. In this new design the frequency shifts automatically when a mass is placed on the balance and the counter circuit calculates the frequency shift. This frequency is then converted to a mass using calibration tables determined previously. An additional feature we have implemented is the use of a high frequency thickness mode piezoelectric resonator to mix the sample and a reactant or solvent. This allows for measuring both sample and reagent prior to ingestion by the instrument. This paper will focus on the design requirements and how they are affected by the local gravity and acoustic properties of the sample. Designs which allow for easy loading and unloading of the balance will also be discussed.

Modeling of a space-based 2 mu m, high pulse energy, triple-pulse, direct detection integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar was conducted to demonstrate CO2 measurement capability and to evaluate random and systematic errors. Parameters based on recent technology developments in the 2 mu m laser and state-of-the-art HgCdTe (MCT) electron-initiated avalanche photodiode (e-APD) detection system were incorporated in this model. Strong absorption features of CO2 in the 2 mu m region, which allows optimum lower tropospheric and near surface measurements, were used to project simultaneous measurements using two independent altitude-dependent weighting functions with the triple-pulse IPDA. Analysis of measurements over a variety of atmospheric and aerosol models using a variety of Earth's surface target and aerosol loading conditions were conducted. Water vapor (H2O) influences on CO2 measurements were assessed, including molecular interference, dry-air estimate, and line broadening. Projected performance shows a < 0.35 ppm precision and a < 0.3 ppm bias in low-tropospheric weighted measurements related to column CO2 optical depth for the space-based IPDA using 10 s signal averaging over the Railroad Valley (RRV) reference surface under clear and thin cloud conditions.

However, there are two expected populations of high energy neutrinos: the astrophysical flux observed by IceCube (similar to 1 PeV) and the cosmogenic flux (similar to 10(17) eV or 100 PeV). Typical radio arrays employ a noise-riding trigger, which limits their minimum energy threshold based on the background noise temperature of the ice. Phased radio arrays could lower the energy threshold by combining the signals from several channels before triggering, thereby improving the signal-to-noise at the trigger level. Reducing the energy threshold would allow radio experiments to more e ffi ciently overlap with optical Cherenkov neutrino telescopes as well as for more e ffi cient searches for cosmogenic neutrinos. We discuss the proposed technique and prototypical phased arrays deployed in an anechoic chamber and at Greenland's Summit Station.

A comprehensive methodology for discovering semantic relationships among geospatial vocabularies using oceanographic data discovery as an example	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Query augmentation; semantic search; web mining; search history; click behavior; big data	BIG DATA; SIMILARITY; SEARCH	It is challenging to find relevant data for research and development purposes in the geospatial big data era. One long-standing problem in data discovery is locating, assimilating and utilizing the semantic context for a given query. Most research in the geospatial domain has approached this problem in one of two ways: building a domain-specific ontology manually or discovering automatically, semantic relationships using metadata and machine learning techniques. The former relies on rich expert knowledge but is static, costly and labor intensive, whereas the second is automatic and prone to noise. An emerging trend in information science takes advantage of large-scale user search histories, which are dynamic but subject to user-and crawler-generated noise. Leveraging the benefits of these three approaches and avoiding their weaknesses, a novel methodology is proposed to (1) discover vocabulary-based semantic relationships from user search histories and clickstreams, (2) refine the similarity calculation methods from existing ontologies and (3) integrate the results of ontology, metadata, user search history and clickstream analysis to better determine their semantic relationships. An accuracy assessment by domain experts for the similarity values indicates an 83% overall accuracy for the top 10 related terms over randomly selected sample queries. This research functions as an example for building vocabulary-based semantic relationships for different geographical domains to improve various aspects of data discovery, including the accuracy of the vocabulary relationships of commonly used search terms.

In order to achieve these efficiencies, two-dimensional doping methods are used to increase the UV sensitivity of back-illuminated Si sensors. Integrated filters are then deposited by a combination of Al evaporation and atomic layer deposition of dielectric spacer layers. At far UV wavelengths these filters require the use of non-absorbing dielectrics, and we have pursued the development of new atomic layer deposition processes for metal fluorides materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. The performance of the complete multilayer filters on Si photodiodes and CCD imaging sensors, and the design and fabrication challenges associated with this development are demonstrated. This includes the continued development of deep diffused silicon avalanche photodiodes designed to detect the fast 220 nm emission component of barium fluoride scintillation crystals, while optically rejecting a slower component at 300 nm.

The mission's primary objectives will be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. This single spacecraft solution with an L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength) radar has a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed, uses a reflector-feed system whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive ("SweepSAR") capability at both L-band and S-band. This design is in contrast to recent concepts towards large constellations of smaller radar satellites, and is driven by the science requirements for complete coverage over the 12-day repeat cycle, using repeat pass interferometry and polarimetry to measure deformation and surface properties. A single spacecraft with enough aperture, power, duty cycle, and downlink capacity was determined to be a more practical and implementable solution that multiple smaller spacecraft. The use of a single large aperture reflector for both the L- and S-band radars enables both to have comparable performance, leading to overall development and operational efficiencies.

The current software architecture used to process this data is the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), a powerful and modular platform that applies a combination of novel and legacy processing modules to many sources of SAR data. Until recently, this architecture could process most images in a reasonable amount of time; however in the case of the NISAR mission (where the daily influx as well as the size of the images themselves are significantly larger) the current architecture can take hours to process even a single image. This paper explores new efforts to use a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate one of the processing modules to achieve unprecedented runtimes with no loss in precision, potentially setting a new standard in radar processing in the world of "Big Data".

Longer wavelengths (S-Band and L-Band) are preferred because they do not decorrelate as quickly as shorter wavelengths. Rapid revisit (1-3 days) is preferred because it allows the study of these phenomena at the timescales at which they commonly occur. Global access on such timescales is also required. Vector surface deformation measurements, taken from more than one direction, are a desired feature. This paper describes the conceptual architecture of a longer wavelength, Smallsat SAR constellation of up to 12 satellites for rapid revisit surface deformation studies. The key to making such a constellation affordable is to lower launch costs, spacecraft costs, and instrument (SAR) costs. The first two objectives can be achieved using an ESPA-ring class, or Smallsat, spacecraft. The third objective requires a SAR instrument sized to fit the mass and volume constraints imposed by such a spacecraft. Current state-of-the-art in miniaturization of electronics means that the radar transmit, receive and data handling functions can easily be implemented in a compact, low mass solution. The most significant challenge in designing a SAR to fit the Smallsat paradigm is in the dimensions of the antenna. The antenna sizing problem is addressed by adopting a smaller antenna than allowed by conventional SAR design rules. The baseline antenna design is simple, requiring no electronic beam-steering or beam-forming capability. Both reflectarray and microstrip patch antenna solutions are considered. The antenna structure is dual-purpose, to limit the overall system mass, with solar panels on the backplane providing power for the radar and spacecraft. The proposed solution easily accommodates radar squint angles of +/- 30 degrees for repeat-pass interferometry measurements from multiple directions.

Radar Autofocus Algorithm Incorporating Terrain Knowledge for Correction of Mars' Ionospheric Distortion in MARSIS Observations	2017 IEEE RADAR CONFERENCE (RADARCONF)	IEEE Radar Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)	MAY 08-12, 2017	Seattle, WA	IEEE, Inst Engn & Technol, Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Seattle Sect, IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, APS, Int Conf Radar Syst, IEEE Aerosp & Elect Soc, Seattle Sect, IEEE Aerosp & Elect Soc Chapter				Low-frequency subsurface radar observations of Mars' polar ice deposits by MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) are heavily impacted by the electron content of Mars' ionosphere, which has a peak plasma frequency close to MARSIS operating frequencies. The resulting ionospheric distortion can be represented as attenuation and bulk delay, in addition to higher-order frequency dispersion effects. Baseline, uncorrected images are often unusable when the solar zenith angle is less than 90 degrees (day side). In this work, a radar autofocus algorithm is developed that estimates and inverts ionospheric distortion, producing a focused radargram of the ice deposit subsurface. A maximum likelihood approach is developed that incorporates simulated surface clutter returns for the current spacecraft position, based on the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) elevation model of the Martian surface. An ancillary product is a surface-only clutter simulation for each orbit, which is necessary to identify true subsurface features.

Beyond the potential for earthquake-induced failure, performance monitoring of the levee system on the network level and the assessment of potential distress levels are needed for the maintenance and rehabilitation of this system. In this case, critical deformation needs to be assessed especially in view of the levees age, sea level rise, and ongoing subsidence due to the decomposition of the peat foundation layer. The work presented herein describes the remote sensing of a levee section deformation with time. The levee section is located on Sherman Island, CA and monitoring was conducted in situ by GPS, in addition to remote sensing by airborne synthetic aperture radar and satellite systems. Coupled deformation/seepage numerical analysis of the levee section is performed using PLAXIS. The numerical model included characterization of the unsaturated-saturated zones and the peat foundation layer. Key parameters of the peat layer were synthesized from published data to provide baseline assessment for the current condition of the levee system in view of the measured rate of deformation.

For this objective, the authors initially developed methods and obtained preliminary test results based on the use of ultrasonic pulse-echo transducers and enhanced signal-processing tool; however, the methodology needed further development in order to obtain measurements in turbulent dynamic flow conditions. To improve the reliability of measurements taken in turbulent flow conditions, an experimental system was developed using multiple transducers driven by a multiplexer, and a data acquisition module capable of operating in any flow conditions. The system consists of a simulation testbed, which allows testing the performance over a range of flow rates and water levels and to observe flow conditions and patterns, as well as measure actual water level, flow velocities, wave conditions, etc. In this paper, we present the development details that include description of the testbed for simulating the flow of condensed water, the multiple transducers arrangement, the signal processing method, and the test results of both steady state and turbulent flow.

QPI is often performed by optical interferometry, where two coherent beams of light are used to produce interference patterns at a detector plane. Many algorithms exist to calculate the phase of the incident light from these recorded interference patterns as well as enhance their quality by various de-noising methods. Many of these de-noising algorithms, however, corrupt the quantitative aspect of the measurement, resulting in phase contrast images. Among these phase calculation techniques and de-noising algorithms, none approach the optimization of phase measurements by theoretically addressing the various sources of error in its measurement, as well as how these errors propagate to the phase calculations. In this work, we investigate the various sources of error in the measurements required for QPI, as well as theoretically derive the influence of each source of error on the overall phase calculation for three common phase calculation techniques: the four bucket/step method, three bucket/step method, and the Carre method. The noise characteristics of each of these techniques are discussed and compared using error parameters of a readily available CCD sensor array. Additionally, experimental analysis is conducted on interferograms to investigate the influence of speckle noise on the phase measurements of the three algorithms discussed.

We observed WASP-103b during secondary eclipse using two visits of the Hubble Space Telescope with the G141 grism on Wide Field Camera 3 in spatial scan mode. We generated secondary eclipse light curves of the planet in both blended white-light and spectrally binned wavechannels from 1.1 to 1.7 mu m and corrected the light curves for flux contamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics and secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that the near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed near-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope toward the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of T-B = 2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is indistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically isothermal system, i. e., pseudo-isothermal. A solar-metallicity profile with a thermal inversion layer at 10(-2) bar fits the spectrum of WASP-103b with high confidence, as do an isothermal profile with solar metallicity and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O > 1. The data rule out a monotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with solar composition, and we rule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as unphysical for this system. The pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer just above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the upper atmosphere. Transmission spectra at optical wavelengths would allow us to better distinguish between potential atmospheric models.	[Cartier, Kimberly M.

The chemical compositions and temperatures of the jet and that of the fluid in the chamber are initially prescribed. The governing equations consist of the conservation equations for mass, momentum, species and energy, and are complemented by a real-gas equation of state. The fluxes of species and heat are written in the framework of fluctuation-dissipation theory and include Soret and Dufour effects. For more than two species, the full mass diffusion and thermal diffusion matrices are computed using high-pressure mixing rules which utilize as building blocks the corresponding binary diffusion coefficients. The mixture viscosity and thermal conductivity are computed using standard mixing rules and corresponding states theory. To evaluate the physical model and numerical method, LES is employed first to simulate a supercritical N-2 jet injected into N-2. Time averaged results show reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Then, DNS is conducted to study the spatial evolution of a supercritical N-2 jet injected into CO2. Time averaged results are used to compute the length of the potential core and the species diffusion characteristics. Spectral analysis is then applied on a time series data obtained at several axial locations and a dominant frequency is observed inside the potential core.

Service robots, which co-exist with humans and provide various services in daily life, must have sufficient ability to sense changes in the environment and deal with a variety of situations. However, since the daily environment is complex and unpredictable, it is almost impossible with current methods to sense all the necessary information using only a robot and the attached sensors. One promising approach for robots to co-exist with humans is to use IT technology, such as a distributed sensor network and network robotics. As an empirical example of this approach, the authors have started Robot Town Project. The aim of this research project is to develop a distributed sensor network system covering an area of a block in a town in which there are many houses, buildings, and roads, and manage robot services by monitoring events that occur in the town. This paper introduces currently available technologies including an RFID-tag-based localization system, distributed sensor systems for moving object tracking, and object management systems using RFID tags. For the construction of 3-D geometrical models of large-scale environments, a measurement and modeling system using a group of multiple robots and an on-board laser range finder is also introduced.

We compare the modeled vertical distribution of clouds against the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosols Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) using a simulator approach. Although the overall pattern of modeled zonal cloud frequency profiles is relatively good (r=0.92 for the multi-model mean), we show two main systematic biases in the cloud frequency profiles: a positive bias above 7km (up to 10%), particularly in the tropics; and a negative bias below 3km (up to -10%), which reaches a maximum over the stratocumulus cloud regions. Using radiative heating rate profiles calculated with constraints from CloudSat, CALIPSO and other satellite observations, we show that the excess of clouds in the upper troposphere (> 7km) results in excess infrared and solar heating in the vicinity of the clouds as well as more infrared heating for the entire column below the cloud. On the other hand, the lack of clouds in the lower troposphere reduces the infrared cooling near the missing cloud levels and increases the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor below. The global radiative heating rate between 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N is too warm in the models (-0.81K/day vs. -1.01K/day). The representation of clouds in GCMs remains challenging, but reducing the cloud biases would lead to an improvement of the heating rate profiles, which in turn would help in improving other aspects of models' simulations such as the dynamics, cloud feedbacks and surface-atmosphere interactions.

Cloud Effects on Atmospheric Solar Absorption in Light of Most Recent Surface and Satellite Measurements	RADIATION PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	International Radiation Symposium (IRC/IAMAS) - Radiation Processes in the Atmosphere and Ocean	APR 16-22, 2016	Univ Auckland, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	Univ Auckland, Dept Phys, Kipp & Zonen, EKO Instruments Europe B V	Univ Auckland		RADIATION	At 36 locations worldwide, we estimate the cloud radiative effect (CREatm) on atmospheric solar absorption (ASR(atm)) by combining ground-based measurements of surface solar radiation (SSR) with collocated satellite-derived surface albedo and top-of-atmosphere net irradiance under both all-sky and clear-sky conditions. To derive continuous clear-sky SSR from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in-situ measurements of global and diffuse SSR, we make use of the Long and Ackerman (2000) algorithm that identifies clear-sky measurements and empirically fits diurnal clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. The 11-year average (2000-2010) CREatm (all-sky minus clear-sky) is overall positive at around + 11 Wm(-2) using direct measurements form ground and space, and at 4 Wm(-2) in the CERES EBAF dataset. This discrepancy arises from a potential overestimation in clear-sky absorption by the satellite product or underestimation by the combined BSRN/CERES dataset. The forcing ratio R shows that clouds enhance ASRatm most distinctly at desert-like locations that overall experience little occurrence of clouds. This relationship is captured by both the combined dataset and CERES EBAF.

Assessing Contact Graph Routing Performance and Reliability in Distributed Satellite Constellations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER NETWORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TOLERANT NETWORKING; SYSTEMS; FAILURE; SPACE; DTN	Existing Internet protocols assume persistent end-to-end connectivity, which cannot be guaranteed in disruptive and high-latency space environments. To operate over these challenging networks, a store-carry-and-forward communication architecture called Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) has been proposed. This work provides the first examination of the performance and robustness of ContactGraph Routing (CGR) algorithm, the state-of-the-art routing scheme for space-basedDTNs. To this end, after a thorough description of CGR, two appealing satellite constellations are proposed and evaluated by means of simulations. Indeed, the DtnSim simulator is introduced as another relevant contribution of this work. Results enabled the authors to identify existing CGR weaknesses and enhancement opportunities.	[Fraire, J.

Most 3D sensors produce dense depth maps, which are subject to imperfections due to various environmental factors. Temporal fusion of depth maps is crucial to overcome those. Temporal fusion is traditionally done in 3D space with voxel data structures, but it can be approached by temporal fusion in image space, with potential benefits in reduced memory and computational cost for applications like reactive collision avoidance for micro air vehicles. In this paper, we present an efficient Gaussian Mixture Models based depth map fusion approach, introducing an online update scheme for dense representations. The environment is modeled from an ego-centric point of view, where each pixel is represented by a mixture of Gaussian inverse-depth models. Consecutive frames are related to each other by transformations obtained from visual odometry. This approach achieves better accuracy than alternative image space depth map fusion techniques at lower computational cost.

To overcome the hurdles associated with the use of dielectric substrates in the sub-millimeter wave range, we propose an MTS structure which consists of an array of metalized cylinders placed on a ground plane. The metal cylinders are arranged in a square lattice with sub-wavelength unit cell size. This MTS topology has been successfully used to design a spiral MTS antenna. The resulting structure has been micromachined out of a silicon wafer by means of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The performance of the antenna has been verified by full-wave simulations, and measurements will be available at the time of the conference.

Spectrum resources are in ever-greater demand as new applications emerge and existing ones continue to grow. Reconfigurable radios can mitigate the problems associated with limited spectrum availability and limited open bandwidth by tuning to the frequency and standard that is least heavily used at any given time. In this paper, reconfigurable electronic technologies based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as well as phase change materials are discussed with applications in reconfigurable radios.

This on-road FFCO2 emissions dataset for LA (from Hestia version 1.0), based on actual traffic volume, provides emissions per vehicle kilometer travelled (VKT)-an important metric for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. We further identify emissions hotpots that can help state and local policy makers plan the most effective GHG reduction strategies. On-road vehicle traffic accounts for half of the FFCO2 emissions in LA, of which 41% is from arterials (intermediate road type). Arterials also have the largest C emissions intensity-FFCO2 per VKT-possibly from high traffic congestion and fleet composition. Non-interstate emissions hotspots (> 419 tC lane-km(-1)) are equally dominated by arterials and collectors (the lowest road type) in terms of FFCO2 emissions though collectors have a higher VKT. These hotspots occur in densely populated areas and developed landuse classes, largely in LA (67%) and Orange (18%) counties, and provide specific targets for emissions reduction efforts. The estimated uncertainties for interstate, arterial and collector emissions per road length are +/- 2.1, +/- 0.5 and +/- 18.0%, respectively. Our overall estimates compare reasonably well with other products, DARTE and FIVE but with substantial differences in spatial distribution. The method for developing this dataset is easily replicable in other urban landscapes, and represents a powerful tool for carbon cycle science and regional policy makers.

Because these advanced electronic packages tend to have less solder-joint strain-relief than do leaded flat-pack electronic packages, the reliability of CCGA packages in challenging thermal environments is a very important consideration for their short-and long-term use in JPL-NASA space missions. In this study, we assembled daisy chains of polyimide printed wiring boards from CCGA-interconnect packages, inspected the boards nondestructively, and then subjected them to thermal cycling to assess their reliability in thermal environments from +125 degrees C to -40 degrees C +/- 25 degrees C. The test hardware consists of a CCGA 1752 package (CN version). The package was divided into four daisy-chained sections that were electrically monitored for their continuity during thermal cycling. The CCGA 1752 package is roughly 45 mm x 45 mm with a 42-mm x 42-mm array of 80%/20% Pb/Sn columns on a 1.00-mm pitch. The resistance of the daisy-chained CCGA interconnects was continuously monitored during thermal cycling in a gaseous nitrogen environment. Electrical continuity resistance measurements as a function of thermal cycling are reported here; tests to date have shown significant change to an open circuit in daisy-chain resistance as a function of thermal cycling. The change in interconnect resistance becomes increasingly noticeable with increasing number of thermal cycles. This paper describes the experimental thermal-cycling test results of CCGA 1752 package reliability testing under an extremely wide temperature range. The first failure was observed at 1479th thermal cycle. We report the thermalcycle reliability test data for 2500 thermal cycles.

For the first time, we design and fabricate resonators of the same lateral dimensions but with different stacking layers, namely, Si, AlN-on-Si, and Al-on-AlN-on-Si. With both optical and electrical readout techniques, we measure the fundamental radial-extensional mode and its Q values and compare the observed and simulated energy dissipation. For the same device geometry, the results show that the bare Si device has the highest Q (11,304). Adding an AlN layer leads to a reduction in Q for the AlN-on-Si device by a factor of similar to 1.46 compared to bare Si device. Top layer metallization further compromises the Q by a factor of similar to 1.85. Modeling of the dissipation processes suggests that neither the thermoelastic damping (TED) nor the anchor loss is the limiting loss factor. A piezoelectric-specific loss mechanism known as charge redistribution loss and interface loss are both possible limiting mechanisms.

A conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometer consists of a terahertz mixer that mixes a received terahertz signal with a local oscillator signal to generate an intermediate frequency signal in the radio frequency (RF) range, where it can be easily processed and detected by RF electronics. Schottky diode mixers, superconductor -insulator superconductor (SIS) mixers and hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixers are the most commonly used mixers in conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometers. While conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometers offer high spectral resolution and high detection sensitivity levels at cryogenic temperatures, their dynamic range and bandwidth are limited by the low radiation power of existing terahertz local oscillators and narrow bandwidth of existing terahertz mixers. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach for heterodyne terahertz spectrometry based on plasmonic photomixing. The presented design replaces terahertz mixer and local oscillator of conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometers with a plasmonic photomixer pumped by an optical local oscillator. The optical local oscillator consists of two wavelength-tunable continuous-wave optical sources with a terahertz frequency difference. As a result, the spectrometry bandwidth and dynamic range of the presented heterodyne spectrometer is not limited by radiation frequency and power restrictions of conventional terahertz sources. We demonstrate a proof-o-concept terahertz spectrometer with more than 90 dB dynamic range and 1 THz spectrometry bandwidth.

One approach to achieving this capability are high-heat-flux reflux boiling systems that take advantage of high heat transfer boiling and condensation mechanisms. Advanced solar systems are also intermittent by their nature and their electrical generation is often out-of phase with electric utility power demand, and their required power system cycling reduces efficiency, performance (dispatchability), lifetime, and reliability. High temperature thermal energy storage (TES) at 300-600 degrees C enables these reflux boiling systems to simultaneously store thermal energy internally to increase the energy dispatchability of the associated solar system, as this can increase the power generation profile by several hours (up to 6-10 hours) per day. Many TES phase change materials (PCM's) exist including KNO3, NaNO3, LiBr/KBr, MgCl2/NaCl/KCl, Zn/Mg, and CuCl/NaCl, which have various operating melting points and different latent heats of fusion. Common, cost effective TES PCM's are FeCl2/NaCl/KCl mixtures, whose phase change temperature can be varied and controlled by simple composition adjustments. This paper presents and discusses unique "temperature-staged" thermal energy storage configurations using these TES materials and analysis of such systems integrated into high-heat-flux reflux boiling systems. In this specific application, the TES materials are designed to operate at staged temperatures surrounding an operating design point near 350 degrees C, while providing 18 kW of source heat transfer to operate a thermoacoustic power system during off-sun conditions (e.g., temporary cloud conditions, after sun-down). This work discusses relevant configurations, and critical thermal and entropy models of the TES configurations, which show the inherent minimization of thermal exergy during critical heat transfers within the configurations and systems envisioned.

Galaxy morphologies are determined visually using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the spectral energy distribution fitting code Code Investigating GALaxy Emission, we measure star formation rates, stellar masses, and 4000 (A) over circle break strengths. The latter are used to separate quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). From z similar to 1.3 to z similar to 0.2, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of cluster SFGs and quiescent galaxies decreases by factors of three and four, respectively. Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster population declines by a factor of 11, from 0.48 +/- 0.06 Gyr(-1) to 0.043 +/- 0.009 Gyr(-1). This strong overall sSFR evolution is driven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of quiescent cluster galaxies increases from 28(-19)(+8)% to 88(-4)(+5)% over z similar to 1.3 to 0.2. The majority of the growth occurs at z greater than or similar to 0.9, where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR of the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field, a small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity, suggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of quiescent galaxies above z similar to 0.9, coupled with the field-level sSFRs of cluster SFGs, suggests that higher-redshift cluster galaxies are likely being quenched quickly. Assessing those timescales will require more accurate stellar population ages and star formation histories.

For each, an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) canopy height model (CHM) was produced by subtracting a LiDAR digital terrain model from the TanDEM-X DSM. These InSAR CHMs were compared to a LiDAR CHM at a resolution of 25 m and led to biases from 0.77 to 1.56 m, r(2) from 0.68 to 0.38, and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from 2.06 to 3.67 m. Two datasets acquired in similar conditions differed by 1.27m(RMSE). Differences in the interferometric baseline had the strongest effect on the DSMs (RMSE of 3.27 m between short and long baseline DSMs). The height of ambiguity therefore had a significant effect on the resulting canopy height. The effect of phenological changes on canopy height estimations was lower (RMSE of 2.30 m between leaf-on and leaf-off DSMs) and not highly significant. These results indicate that, despite variations in the acquisition conditions, a continuous TanDEM-X mosaic acquired with proper baselines could produce a reliable estimate of canopy surface elevations of evergreen closed-canopy boreal forests.

The laser beacon ( 1568 +/- 0.1 nm) was square wave modulated and sensed by a quadrant sensor on LLST. While link acquisition and tracking proceeded with the sensed signal, on-board processing extracted power incident on the quadrant sensor and telemetered it down over the optical downlink. Subsequently, post-processing of the codewords received at OCTL retrieved the power time series recorded at LLST. Analysis comparing measured and predicted mean irradiance delivered to LLST consistently agreed to within < 1 decibel (dB). Irradiance fluctuations detected at LLST were reconciled with an uplink wave-propagation simulation model using Kolmogorov phase screens.

This design, optimized for operation across a wide range of illumination conditions, is focused on minimizing blinding from stray light, and providing reliable, accurate attitude information to point its narrow communication beam accurately to the future location of the ground terminal. Though our transceiver will transmit in the 1550 nm waveband and receive in the 1064 nm waveband, the system design relies heavily on reflective optical elements, extending flexibility to be modified for use at different wavebands. The design makes use of common path propagation among transmit, receive and pointing verification optical channels to maintain precise alignment among its components, and to naturally correct for element misalignment resulting from launch or thermal element perturbations. This paper presents the results of trade studies showing the evolution of the design, unique operational characteristics of the design, elements that help to maintain minimal stray light contamination, and preliminary results from development and initial testing of a functional aluminum test model.

In this paper, we discuss a downlink receiver concept capable of demodulating optical pulse-position modulated (PPM) waveforms with data rates varying from approximately 50 kbps up to 265 Mbps, using a range of PPM orders, slot widths, and code rates. The receiver operates on recorded timestamps corresponding to the times-of-arrival of photons detected by a photon-counting detector array followed by a commercial time-tagger. Algorithms are presented for slot, symbol, and frame synchronization as well as parameter estimation. Estimates of link performance are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation for an optical channel that includes optical losses, detector blocking, signal clock dynamics, and pointing-induced downlink fades. Based upon these simulation results, it is expected that link closure may be achieved with at least 3 dB of margin under a variety of relevant conditions.

The proposed approach employs two probe antennas, one fixed and one scanning, enabling to retrieve both amplitude and phase of the near field. This allows us to employ conventional near-field-to-far-field transformations, without the need to resort to phase retrieval approaches. The technique is first demonstrated on a standalone 60-GHz patch, showing the good agreement between the proposed method and a conventional (one probe) near-field characterization. Then, the method is applied to the characterization of embedded antennas operating in the 60-GHz and 94-GHz bands, and it is benchmarked with simulations and conventional far-field characterization techniques.

Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, with limited success, especially through use of low sulfur loadings (1-2 mg/cm(2)). Dense electrodes with high sulfur loadings are essential for high energy cells, however, such electrodes experience more serious polysulfide effects. In this paper, we describe the benefits of blending sulfur with a transition metal sulfide (here, TiS2 and MoS2) to form dense composite cathodes with enhanced conductivity. There is an improvement in both the initial capacity from sulfur utilization (similar to 800 mAh/g based on sulfur content), the coulombic efficiency (>96%) and also in cycle life upon blending with the metal sulfide. High sulfur loadings (>12 mg/cm(2) or similar to 6 mAh/cm(2) per side) were demonstrated to display high sulfur utilization in Li-S cells containing the metal sulfide blends either with or without coatings over the sulfur cathode. XRD studies were carried out to understand the redox behavior of the metal sulfide additive during charge/discharge cycling of the sulfur cathodes. DC polarization and Potentiometric Intermittent Titration Technique (PITT) measurements were made on sulfur cathodes with and without metal sulfide blends to determine the charge transfer and diffusional kinetics.

Because BMGs properties are highly correlated with processing, it is necessary to test them in a relevant engineering application. In the current work, CuZr-based BMGs are developed with excellent wear performance when used as gears. It is shown that in order to optimize the wear performance of these gears, toughness should be maximized. This contrasts the conventional design strategy, where wear performance increases with increasing hardness. Finally, a new low-cost manufacturing method for casting net- shaped macroscale gears is developed.

Thermoelectric heat recovery from glass melt processes	ENERGY			English	Article						High temperature thermoelectrk; Glass process; Industrial heat recovery	WASTE HEAT; EFFICIENCY; STRESS	Thermoelectric energy recovery from waste heat in glass melting process is investigated without any detrimental design or process changes. Melting glass pellets require a furnace with temperature over 1500 degrees C for downstream glass shaping processes and hence a large amount of exergy is available but currently destroyed. Due to high temperature gradients, parasitic losses are investigated in conjunction with the optimum thermoelectric design for maximum power output and the lowest cost. Among variations of thermal paths, the fireports are identified as the best potential for lowest cost. By partially replacing the refractory wall in thickness with a thermoelectric generator, heat loss is kept at the current 9 kW/m(2). High temperature gradients across the thermoelectric generator requires a water cooling heat sink. The cost of the heat sink is included in the overall energy and cost analysis. Based on a typical thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT = 1), optimally designed thermoelectric integrated system generates 55.6 kW of electricity with efficiency of over 15% from a 500 ton/day (5.8 kg/s) scale glass production at an additional cost of $ 1-2/W. This technology can provide 1.37 billion kWh of primary energy savings annually, if it is implemented throughout the whole glass industry in U.S. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The spacecraft launched on 18 November 2013, entered Mars orbit on 22 September 2014, and continues to acquire measurements of Mars's upper atmosphere in an effort to understand the loss of Martian volatiles to space. The navigation team is responsible for estimating and predicting the spacecraft's position and velocity, and designing and reconstructing propulsive maneuvers. After Mars orbit insertion, the team faced additional challenges unique to the mission's orbit and tracking data schedule, including the determination of the atmospheric density at each periapsis, which is necessary to keep the spacecraft within a predefined density corridor. This paper briefly describes the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, shows how it fits into previous and ongoing Mars exploration efforts, and overviews the operations of the navigation team from launch through the nominal science phase.

J	Lobbia, MA				Lobbia, Marcus A.			Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of Waverider-Derived Crew Reentry Vehicles	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							HL-20; ENVIRONMENT	The development of a multidisciplinary design optimization framework for crew reentry vehicles is presented. A waverider design methodology is used as the basis for the parametric design technique, with required modifications (e.g., leading edge blunting and integration of a cylindrical payload volume representing the crew compartment) used to allow the generation of practical reentry configurations. In addition to the shape design code, aerodynamics analysis, mass estimating, and trajectory/aeroheating analyses are linked using a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization process to maximize vehicle downrange, additional payload mass capability, and lift-to-drag ratio. Pareto fronts were generated for three different launch vehicle capabilities ranging from 12,000 to 26,000kg to orbit, and highlight the relationships between reentry vehicle payload mass, maximum lift-to-drag ratio, and downrange, as well as the fact that a medium-class or larger launch vehicle was required to meet the baseline mission payload mass requirement. Although the modifications necessary for the crew reentry vehicle mission resulted in a substantial reduction in lift-to-drag ratio relative to the idealized waveriders used in the design process, comparisons of several designs to the NASA HL-20 concept indicated that the waverider-derived design process can produce vehicles with an almost 30% improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio and the ability to carry additional payload mass on longer downrange trajectories.

Multiinstrument observations of a geomagnetic storm and its effects on the Arctic ionosphere: A case study of the 19 February 2014 storm	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article							TOTAL ELECTRON-CONTENT; SPACE WEATHER; RING CURRENT; PHASE; IRREGULARITIES; SCINTILLATIONS; TIMED/GUVI; MORPHOLOGY; LATITUDES; IMPACT	We present a multiinstrumented approach for the analysis of the Arctic ionosphere during the 19 February 2014 highly complex, multiphase geomagnetic storm, which had the largest impact on the disturbance storm-time index that year. The geomagnetic storm was the result of two powerful Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It produced a strong long lasting negative storm phase over Greenland with a dominant energy input in the polar cap. We employed global navigation satellite system (GNSS) networks, geomagnetic observatories, and a specific ionosonde station in Greenland. We complemented the approach with spaceborne measurements in order to map the state and variability of the Arctic ionosphere. In situ observations from the Canadian CASSIOPE (CAScade, Smallsat and IOnospheric Polar Explorer) satellite's ion mass spectrometer were used to derive ion flow data from the polar cap topside ionosphere during the event. Our research specifically found that (1) thermospheric O/N-2 measurements demonstrated significantly lower values over the Greenland sector than prior to the storm time. (2) An increased ion flow in the topside ionosphere was observed during the negative storm phase. (3) Negative storm phase was a direct consequence of energy input into the polar cap. (4) Polar patch formation was significantly decreased during the negative storm phase. This paper addresses the physical processes that can be responsible for this ionospheric storm development in the northern high latitudes. We conclude that ionospheric heating due to the CME's energy input caused changes in the polar atmosphere resulting in Ne upwelling, which was the major factor in high-latitude ionosphere dynamics for this storm.

Comment on "Effects of electron temperature anisotropy on proton mirror instability evolution" by Ahmadi et al. (2016)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							EARTHS BOW SHOCK; MAGNETIC-FIELD; LION ROARS; WAVES DOWNSTREAM; SOLAR-WIND; MAGNETOSHEATH; SIMULATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; DEPLETION; PLASMA	In a recent paper, Ahmadi et al. (2016) analyze the effect of electron temperature anisotropy on proton mirror instability. They find that the electron whistler instability grows faster and consumes all the available electron free energy so that no anisotropy is left to fuel the proton mirror mode growth.

Tidally induced variations in vertical and horizontal motion on Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, inferred from remotely sensed observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						synthetic aperture radar; glacier mechanics; ice-ocean interactions; ice shelf buttressing; ice-bed mechanics; ice rheology	RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; BASAL MECHANICS; PINE ISLAND; OCEAN TIDES; INSAR DATA; VELOCITY; FLOW; MARGINS; SHELF; BED	To better understand the influence of stress changes over floating ice shelves on grounded ice streams, we develop a Bayesian method for inferring time-dependent 3-D surface velocity fields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data. Our specific goal is to observe ocean tide-induced variability in vertical ice shelf position and horizontal ice stream flow. Thus, we consider the special case where observed surface displacement at a given location can be defined by a 3-D secular velocity vector, a family of 3-D sinusoidal functions, and a correction to the digital elevation model used to process the SAR data. Using nearly 9months of SAR data collected from multiple satellite viewing geometries with the COSMO-SkyMed 4-satellite constellation, we infer the spatiotemporal response of Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to ocean tidal forcing. Consistent with expected tidal uplift, inferred vertical motion over the ice shelf is dominated by semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. Horizontal ice flow variability, on the other hand, occurs primarily at the fortnightly spring-neap tidal period (M-sf). We propose that periodic grounding of the ice shelf is the primary mechanism for translating vertical tidal motion into horizontal flow variability, causing ice flow to accelerate first and most strongly over the ice shelf. Flow variations then propagate through the grounded ice stream at a mean rate of approximate to 29km/d and decay quasi-linearly with distance over approximate to 85km upstream of the grounding zone.

Such capability exists at larger than 4-mm overall diameters. We report the development of a stereo imaging endoscope of 4-mm maximum diameter, called Multiangle, Rear-Viewing Endoscopic Tool (MARVEL) that uses a single-lens system with complementary multibandpass filter (CMBF) technology to achieve 3-D imaging. In addition, the system is endowed with the capability to pan from side-to-side over an angle of +/- 25 deg, which is another unique aspect of MARVEL for such a class of endoscopes. The design and construction of a single-lens, CMBF aperture camera with integrated illumination to generate 3-D images, and the actuation mechanism built into it is summarized.

Mineralogy and chemistry of San Carlos high-alkali basalts: Analyses of alteration with application for Mars explorations	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						VSWIR spectroscopy; Mars analogs; XRD; geochemistry; alkali basalts; San Carlos	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; GALE CRATER EVIDENCE; GUSEV CRATER; ROCKS; WATER; ROVER; SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE; DIVERSITY; HISTORY	The discovery of Fe, Mg, and Al phyllosilicates on Mars using visible and short-wave infrared (VSWIR) spectroscopy from orbit indicates aqueous alteration of basaltic rocks. Analyses at Gusev Crater by the Spirit rover and Gale Crater by the Curiosity rover have discovered alkaline basaltic rocks. In this work, multiple methods VSWIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical analyses were used to study a suite of alkaline basalts from San Carlos, Arizona, which have been altered by water in an oxidative, semi-arid environment. As an analog for the weathering of alkaline basaltic rocks on Mars, a suite of rocks visually identified to have different degrees of alteration were characterized to understand the spectral, mineralogical, and chemical trends in alteration as sensed by multiple techniques. Samples with strong 1.9.mu m H2O-related absorptions in VSWIR commonly exhibited absorption bands at 1.4, 2.2, and/or 2.31 mu m, indicating the presence of clay minerals or silica as well as features at 0.5-0.9 mu m indicative of ferric iron oxides. Primary mineralogy for all samples, as determined by point analyses with the microprobe and XRD, consisted of olivine, plagioclase, nepheline, augite, and titanomagnetite. Compositional imaging and spot analyses with the microprobe revealed distinct alteration textures and phases, suggesting weathering pathways involving the oxidation of iron in olivine and primary Fe2+ oxides to form Fe3+ oxides as well as the formation of aluminum phyllosilicates and magnesium phyllosilicates from feldspars and olivines, respectively, while pyroxene remained relatively unaltered. Bivariate plots of major oxides both from bulk-chemical analysis and microprobe measurements also revealed trends in alkali and silica depletion and calcium enrichment, but there was little chemical fractionation in most of the major oxides. The strength of the 1.9 mu m H2O absorption, loss on ignition, and depletion in silica and sodium, correlated with increasing alteration. The data sets provide an analog for understanding possible weathering pathways in martian alkaline basalts and thresholds for the detection of aqueous alteration in multiple data sets.

A new technique to facilitate the SET testing of the high frequency transceivers is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The entire radar receiver front-end, including the high frequency signal sources and modulators, were designed and fully integrated in 90 nm 300 GHz SiGe process technology (Global Foundries SiGe 9HP). Two-photon absorption (TPA) laser pulses were utilized to induce transient currents in different devices in various circuit blocks. The study shows how short transient pulses from the high frequency tuned circuits are propagated throughout the receiver and are broadened while passing through low-pass filters present at supply nodes and the low-pass filter following the down-conversion mixer, thus affecting the digital data at the output of the receiver. The proposed methodology allows the study of the effect of SETs on the recovered digital data at the output of the high frequency receivers, thus allowing bit error rate calculations. Comprehensive device and circuit level simulations were also performed, and a close agreement between the measurement results and simulation data was demonstrated. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study of SET on full receiver at millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies.

From orbital images examined early in the Curiosity mission, the Kimberley region had been identified as a high-priority science target based on its clear stratigraphic relationships in a layered sedimentary sequence that had been exposed by differential erosion. Observations of the stratigraphic sequence at the Kimberley made by Curiosity are consistent with deposition in a prograding, fluvio-deltaic system during the late Noachian to early Hesperian, prior to the existence of most of Mount Sharp. Geochemical and mineralogic analyses suggest that sediment deposition likely took place under cold conditions with relatively low water-to-rock ratios. Based on elevated K2O abundances throughout the Kimberley formation, an alkali feldspar protolith is likely one of several igneous sources from which the sediments were derived. After deposition, the rocks underwent multiple episodes of diagenetic alteration with different aqueous chemistries and redox conditions, as evidenced by the presence of Ca-sulfate veins, Mn-oxide fracture fills, and erosion-resistant nodules. More recently, the Kimberley has been subject to significant aeolian abrasion and removal of sediments to create modern topography that slopes away from Mount Sharp, a process that has continued to the present day.

The surface rupture extended about 120km in a NW-SE direction, west of the Cerro Prieto fault. Here we use geodetic measurements including near- to far-field GPS, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and subpixel offset measurements of radar and optical images to characterize the fault slip during the EMC event. We use dislocation inversion methods and determine an optimal nine-segment fault geometry, as well as a subfault slip distribution from the geodetic measurements. With systematic perturbation of the fault dip angles, randomly removing one geodetic data constraint, or different data combinations, we are able to explore the robustness of the inferred slip distribution along fault strike and depth. The model fitting residuals imply contributions of early postseismic deformation to the InSAR measurements as well as lateral heterogeneity in the crustal elastic structure between the Peninsular Ranges and the Salton Trough. We also find that with incorporation of near-field geodetic data and finer fault patch size, the shallow slip deficit is reduced in the EMC event by reductions in the level of smoothing. These results show that the outcomes of coseismic inversions can vary greatly depending on model parameterization and methodology.

Cassini UVIS observations of Titan ultraviolet airglow intensity dependence with solar zenith angle	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Titan; airglow; upper atmosphere; ultraviolet		The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) observed the airglow (dayglow and nightglow) of Titan over a range of solar zenith angles (SZA) from 14 to 150 degrees on five separate observations obtained between 2008 and 2012. The modeling of the solar cycle normalized UVIS observations indicates that a Chapman layer function provides a satisfactory fit to the intensity of the EUV and FUV airglow molecular emissions of the N-2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band system (LBH a1gX1 Sigma g+) the Carroll-Yoshino band system (c41 Sigma u+X1 Sigma g+) and of several atomic multiplets of nitrogen (NI, II) as a function of SZA. This result shows that the strongest contribution to the Titan dayglow occurs by processes (photoelectrons and photodissociation) involving the solar EUV flux rather than magnetospheric particle precipitation that dominates emission excitation in the nightglow.

Spectral analysis of Ahuna Mons from Dawn mission's visible-infrared spectrometer	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Ahuna Mons; spectroscopy; DAWN; VIR; Ceres; carbonates	ASTEROID 1 CERES; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; MINERALS; VESTA; WATER	Ahuna Mons is the highest mountain on Ceres. A unique complex in terms of size, shape, and morphology, Ahuna is bordered by flanks of the talus around its summit. Recent work by Ruesch et al. () based on Dawn's Framing Camera images shed light on the possible origin of Ahuna Mons. According to Ruesch et al. (2016), Ahuna Mons is formed by a volcanic process involving the ascent of cryomagma and extrusion onto the surface followed by dome development and subsequent spreading. Here we analyzed in detail the composition of Ahuna Mons, using data acquired by the visible and infrared spectrometer aboard Dawn. The spectral analysis reveals a relatively high abundance of carbonates and a nonhomogeneous variation in carbonate composition and abundance along Ahuna's flanks, associated with a lower amount of the Ceres's ubiquitous NH4-phyllosilicates over a large portion of the flanks. The grain size is coarser on the flanks than in the surrounding regions, suggesting the presence of fresher material, also compatible with a larger abundance of carbonates. Thermal variations are seen in Ahuna, supporting the evidence of different compactness of the surface regolith in specific locations. Results of the spectral analysis are consistent with a possible cryovolcanic origin which exposed fresher material that slid down on the flanks.	[Zambon, F.; Raponi, A.; Tosi, F.; De Sanctis, M.

Three-dimensional displacements of a large volcano flank movement during the May 2010 eruptions at Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Pacaya Volcano; three-dimensional (3-D) displacements; pixel offsets; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); volcano instability	SURFACE DEFORMATION; DIKE INTRUSION	Although massive flank failure is fairly common in the evolution of volcanoes, measurements of flank movement indicative of instability are rare. Here 3-D displacements from airborne radar amplitude images derived using an amplitude image pixel offset tracking technique show that the west and southwest flanks of Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala experienced large (similar to 4m), discrete landsliding that was ultimately aborted. Pixel offset tracking improved measurement recovery by nearly 50% over classic interferometric synthetic aperture radar techniques, providing unique measurements at the event. The 3-D displacement field shows that the flank moved coherently downslope along a complex failure surface involving both rotational and along-slope movement. Notably, the lack of continuous movement of the slide in the years leading up to the event emphasizes that active movement should not always be expected at volcanoes for which triggering factors (e.g., magmatic intrusions and eruptions) could precipitate sudden major flank instability.

Using GRACE to constrain precipitation amount over cold mountainous basins	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						precipitation; satellite; mountain; GRACE; GPCP; cold region	GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; PROJECT; PRODUCTS	Despite the importance for hydrology and climate-change studies, current quantitative knowledge on the amount and distribution of precipitation in mountainous and high-elevation regions is limited due to instrumental and retrieval shortcomings. Here by focusing on two large endorheic basins in High Mountain Asia, we show that satellite gravimetry (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) can be used to provide an independent estimate of monthly accumulated precipitation using mass balance equation. Results showed that the GRACE-based precipitation estimate has the highest agreement with most of the commonly used precipitation products in summer, but it deviates from them in cold months, when the other products are expected to have larger errors. It was found that most of the products capture about or less than 50% of the total precipitation estimated using GRACE in winter. Overall, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) showed better agreement with GRACE estimate than other products. Yet on average GRACE showed similar to 30% more annual precipitation than GPCP in the study basins. In basins of appropriate size with an absence of dense ground measurements, as is a typical case in cold mountainous regions, we find GRACE can be a viable alternative to constrain monthly and seasonal precipitation estimates from other remotely sensed precipitation products that show large bias.

The Lagrangian observations show mean divergence and vorticity values that can exceed 5 times the Coriolis frequency. Values are the largest observed in the field to date and represent an extreme departure from geostrophic dynamics. The study also quantifies errors and biases associated with Lagrangian observations of the underlying velocity strain tensor. The greatest error results from undersampling, even with a large number of drifters. A significant bias comes from inhomogeneous sampling of convergent regions that accumulate drifters within a few hours of deployment. The study demonstrates a Lagrangian sampling paradigm for targeted submesoscale structures over a broad range of scales and presents flow kinematic values associated with vertical velocities O(10)mh(-1) that can have profound implications on ocean biogeochemistry.

At and after the time of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake on 11 March 2011, and the Chile earthquake on 16 September 2015, the spacecraft was performing scans over the Pacific Ocean. Significant (similar to 10% relative to the ambient emission profiles) and coherent nighttime airglow perturbations were observed in the mesosphere following Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broad-band Emission Radiometry limb scans intercepting tsunami-induced atmospheric gravity waves. Simulations of emission variations are consistent with the physical characteristics of the disturbances at the locations of the corresponding SABER scans. Airglow observations and model simulations suggest that atmospheric neutral density and temperature perturbations can lead to the observed amplitude variations and multipeak structures in the emission profiles. This is the first time that airglow emission rate perturbations associated with tsunamis have been detected with space-based measurements.

D.; Pavone, Marco			Design, Control, and Experimentation of Internally-Actuated Rovers for the Exploration of Low-gravity Planetary Bodies	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article								This paper discusses the design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity (micro-g to milli-g) planetary bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or small moons. The rover is actuated by spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged in one sealed enclosure and enables the platform to be minimalistic, thereby reducing its cost. By controlling the spin rate of the flywheels, the rover can achieve large surface coverage by attitude-controlled hops, fine mobility by tumbling, and coarse instrument pointing by changing the orientation relative to the ground. We first discuss the dynamics of such rovers, their control, and key design features (e.g., flywheel shape and orientation, geometry of external spikes, and system engineering aspects). We then discuss the design and control of a first-of-a-kind test bed that enables the accurate emulation of a microgravity environment for mobility experiments, which consists of a three-degree-of-freedom gimbal attached to an actively controlled gantry crane. Finally, we present experimental results on the test bed that provide key insights for rover control and validate our theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the black hole mass of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0323+342	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						quasars: emission lines; quasars: individual: 1H 0323+342; galaxies: Seyfert-infrared: galaxies; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; RADIUS-LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIP; X-RAY; EMISSION-LINE; HOST-GALAXY; REGION; VARIABILITY; TELESCOPE; SPECTRUM; SAMPLE	Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies have been identified by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope as a rare class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei. The lowest redshift candidate among them is the source 1H 0323+342. Here we present quasi-simultaneous Gemini near-infrared and Keck optical spectroscopy for it, from which we derive a black hole mass based on both the broad Balmer and Paschen emission lines. We supplement these observations with a Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array X-ray spectrum taken about two years earlier, from which we constrain the black hole mass based on the short time-scale spectral variability. Our multiwavelength observations suggest a black hole mass of similar to 2 x 10(7) M-circle dot, which agrees well with previous estimates. We build the spectral energy distribution and show that it is dominated by the thermal and reprocessed emission from the accretion disc rather than the non-thermal jet component. A detailed spectral fitting with the energy-conserving accretion disc model of Done et al. constrains the Eddington ratio to L/L-Edd similar to 0.5 for a (non-rotating) Schwarzschild black hole and to L/L-Edd similar to 1 for a Kerr black hole with dimensionless spin of a* = 0.8. Higher spin values and so higher Eddington ratios are excluded, since they would strongly overpredict the observed soft X-ray flux.	[Landt, H.; Ward, M.

The Phoenix galaxy as seen by NuSTAR	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; X-RAY-EMISSION; SEYFERT 2 GALAXIES; XMM-NEWTON; AGN; REFLECTION; VARIABILITY; ABSORPTION; MRK-1210; MISSION	Aims. We study the long-term variability of the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1210 (also known as UGC4203, or the Phoenix galaxy). Methods. The source was observed by many X-ray facilities in the last 20 yr. Here we present a NuSTAR observation and put the results in the context of previously published observations. Results. NuSTAR observed Mrk 1210 in 2012 for 15.4 ks. The source showed Compton-thin obscuration similar to that observed by Chandra, Suzaku, BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton over the past two decades, but different from the first observation by ASCA in 1995, in which the active nucleus was caught in a low flux state or was obscured by Compton-thick matter with a reflection-dominated spectrum. Thanks to the high-quality hard X-ray spectrum obtained with NuSTAR and exploiting the long-term spectral coverage spanning 16.9 yr, we can precisely disentangle the transmission and reflection components and put constraints on both the intrinsic long-term variability and hidden nucleus scenarios. In the former case, the distance between the reflector and the source must be at least similar to 2 pc, while in the latter the eclipsing cloud may be identified with a water maser-emitting clump.

Discovery of a low-mass companion inside the debris ring surrounding the F5V star HD 206893	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						brown dwarfs; circumstellar matter; planet-disk interactions; planetary systems	GEMINI PLANET IMAGER; BROWN DWARFS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; BETA-PICTORIS; GIANT PLANETS; DISK; EXOPLANETS; CORONAGRAPH; PHOTOMETRY; REDUCTION	Aims. Uncovering the ingredients and the architecture of planetary systems is a very active field of research that has fuelled many new theories on giant planet formation, migration, composition, and interaction with the circumstellar environment. We aim at discovering and studying new such systems, to further expand our knowledge of how low-mass companions form and evolve. Methods. We obtained high-contrast H-band images of the circumstellar environment of the F5V star HD 206893, known to host a debris disc never detected in scattered light. These observations are part of the SPHERE High Angular Resolution Debris Disc Survey (SHARDDS) using the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) installed on VLT/SPHERE. Results. We report the detection of a source with a contrast of 3 : 6 x 10(-5) in the H-band, orbiting at a projected separation of 270 milliarcsec or 10 au, corresponding to a mass in the range 24 to 73 M-Jup for an age of the system in the range 0.2 to 2 Gyr. The detection was confirmed ten months later with VLT /NaCo, ruling out a background object with no proper motion. A faint extended emission compatible with the disc scattered light signal is also observed. Conclusions. The detection of a low-mass companion inside a massive debris disc makes this system an analog of other young planetary systems such as beta Pictoris, HR 8799 or HD 95086 and requires now further characterisation of both components to understand their interactions.

Realistic 3-D cirri are modeled with the 3DCLOUD code, and top-of-atmosphere radiances are simulated by the 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer (RT) algorithm 3DMCPOL for two (8.65 m and 12.05 m) channels of the Imaging Infrared Radiometer on CALIPSO. At nadir, comparisons of 1-D and 3-D RT show that 3-D radiances are larger than their 1-D counterparts for direct emission but smaller for scattered radiation. For our cirrus cases, 99% of the 3-D total radiance is computed by the third scattering order, which corresponds to 90% of the total computational effort, but larger optical thicknesses need more scattering orders. To radically accelerate the 3-D RT computations (using only few percent of 3-D RT time with a Monte Carlo code), even in the presence of large optical depths, we develop a hybrid model based on exact 3-D direct emission, the first scattering order from 1-D in each homogenized column, and an empirical adjustment linearly dependent on the optical thickness to account for higher scattering orders. Good agreement is found between the hybrid model and the exact 3-D radiances for two very different cirrus models without changing the empirical parameters. We anticipate that a future deterministic implementation of the hybrid model will be fast enough to process multiangle thermal imagery in a practical tomographic reconstruction of 3-D cirrus fields.

J	Suhir, E; Ghaffarian, R; Yi, S				Suhir, E.; Ghaffarian, R.; Yi, S.			Reliability physics behind the QFN state of stress	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							PREDICTED STRESSES; THERMAL-STRESSES	A physically meaningful analytical stress model is developed for the explanation of the reliability physics underlying the relief in the thermally induced interfacial shearing stresses in a typical Quad Flat No-lead (QFN) assembly. The stress relief in a QFN design is, in effect, an implementation of the general concept developed and quantified by the first author about a decade ago of using inhomogeneous bonds for lower thermal stresses in adhesively bonded or soldered assemblies. It is shown also that the maximum stress in the QFN design can be minimized, if the lengths of the peripheral zones are established based on the requirement that the stresses at the ends of the assembly are made equal to the stresses at the ends of its mid-portion. In the carried out numerical example the gain in the relief in the maximum interfacial shearing stress owing to the application of a bond with an elevated compliance is 9.94 %. When the optimized inhomogeneous bond is applied, the gain is 16.87 %.

Impacts of increasing aridity and wildfires on aerosol loading in the intermountain Western US	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						aridity; wildfires; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; IMPROVE	UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; PROJECTIONS; DROUGHT; CARBON; FIRES; MODEL	Feedbacks between climate warming, land surface aridity, and wildfire-derived aerosols represent a large source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. Here, long-term observations of aerosol optical depth, surface level aerosol loading, fire-area burned, and hydrologic simulations are used to show that regional-scale increases in aridity and resulting wildfires have significantly increased summertime aerosol loading in remote high elevation regions of the Intermountain West of the United States. Surface summertime organic aerosol loading and total aerosol optical depth were both strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with aridity and fire area burned at high elevation sites across major western US mountain ranges. These results demonstrate that surface-level organic aerosol loading is dominated by summertime wildfires at many high elevation sites. This analysis provides new constraints for climate projections on the influence of drought and resulting wildfires on aerosol loading. These empirical observations will help better constrain projected increases in organic aerosol loading with increased fire activity under climate change.	[Hallar, A.

An observed link between AGN Eddington ratio and narrow-emission-line ratios	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; MASS-METALLICITY RELATION; BLACK-HOLE GROWTH; SHELL ABSORPTION-LINES; QUASI-STELLAR OBJECTS; ULTRA-FAST OUTFLOWS; STAR-FORMATION RATE; HOST GALAXIES; OPTICALLY DULL	We investigate the observed relationship between black hole mass (M-BH), bolometric luminosity (L-bol) and Eddington ratio (lambda(Edd)) with optical emission-line ratios ([N II] lambda 6583/H alpha, [S II] lambda lambda 6716, 6731/H alpha, [O I] lambda 6300/H alpha, [O III] lambda 5007/H beta, [Ne III] lambda 3869/H beta and He II lambda 4686/H beta) of hard X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. We show that the [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio exhibits a significant correlation with lambda(Edd) (R-Pear = -0.44, p-value = 3 x 10(-13), sigma = 0.28 dex), and the correlation is not solely driven by M-BH or L-bol. The observed correlation between [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio and M-BH is stronger than the correlation with L-bol, but both are weaker than the lambda(Edd) correlation. This implies that the large-scale narrow lines of AGN host galaxies carry information about the accretion state of the AGN central engine. We propose that [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha is a useful indicator of Eddington ratio with 0.6 dex of rms scatter, and that it can be used to measure lambda(Edd) and thus M-BH from the measured L-bol, even for high-redshift obscured AGN. We briefly discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this correlation, such as the mass-metallicity relation, X-ray heating, and radiatively driven outflows.

Rapid decadal convective precipitation increase over Eurasia during the last three decades of the 20th century	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							NORTHERN EURASIA; WATER-VAPOR; CLIMATE; FREQUENCY; TEMPERATURE; EXTREMES; INTENSITY; MODELS; IMPACT; CMIP3	Convective precipitation-localized, short-lived, intense, and sometimes violent-is at the root of challenges associated with observation, simulation, and prediction of precipitation. The understanding of long-term changes in convective precipitation characteristics and their role in precipitation extremes and intensity over extratropical regions are imperative to future water resource management; however, they have been studied very little. We show that annual convective precipitation total has been increasing astonishingly fast, at a rate of 18.4%/degrees C, of which 16% is attributable to an increase in convective precipitation occurrence, and 2.4% is attributable to increased daily intensity based on the 35 years of two (combined) historical data sets of 3-hourly synoptic observations and daily precipitation. We also reveal that annual daily precipitation extreme has been increasing at a rate of about 7.4%/degrees C in convective events only. Concurrently, the overall increase in mean daily precipitation intensity is mostly due to increased convective precipitation, possibly at the expanse of nonconvective precipitation. As a result, transitional seasons are becoming more summer-like as convective becomes the dominant precipitation type that has accompanied higher daily extremes and intensity since the late 1980s. The data also demonstrate that increasing convective precipitation and daily extremes appear to be directly linearly associated with higher atmospheric water vapor accompanying a warming climate over northern Eurasia.

Here we present the results of a 2.4 Ms NuSTAR observing campaign aimed at studying the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We perform spatially resolved spectroscopic analyses of the Ti-44 ejecta, which we use to determine the Doppler shift and thus the three-dimensional (3D) velocities of the 44Ti ejecta. We find an initial Ti-44 mass of (1.54 +/- 0.21) x 10(-4) M-circle dot, which has a present-day average momentum direction of 340 degrees +/- 15 degrees projected onto the plane of the sky (measured clockwise from celestial north) and is tilted by 58 degrees +/- 20 degrees into the plane of the sky away from the observer, roughly opposite to the inferred direction of motion of the central compact object. We find some Ti-44 ejecta that are clearly interior to the reverse shock and some that are clearly exterior to it. Where we observe Ti-44 ejecta exterior to the reverse shock we also see shock-heated iron; however, there are regions where we see iron but do not observe Ti-44. This suggests that the local conditions of the supernova shock during explosive nucleosynthesis varied enough to suppress the production of Ti-44 by at least a factor of two in some regions, even in regions that are assumed to be the result of processes like alpha-rich freezeout that should produce both iron and titanium.

OGLE Collaboration; Spitzer Microlensing Team	OGLE-2015-BLG-0196: GROUND-BASED GRAVITATIONAL MICROLENS PARALLAX CONFIRMED BY SPACE-BASED OBSERVATION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; gravitational lensing: micro	SPITZER OBSERVATIONS; GALACTIC BULGE; SATELLITE MASS; OGLE-III; LENS; PHOTOMETRY; DISTANCES; SYSTEMS; PLANET; STARS	In this paper, we present an analysis of the binary gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0196. The event lasted for almost a year, and the light curve exhibited significant deviations from the lensing model based on the rectilinear lens-source relative motion, enabling us to measure the microlens parallax. The ground-based microlens parallax is confirmed by the data obtained from space-based microlens observations using the Spitzer telescope. By additionally measuring the angular Einstein radius from the analysis of the resolved caustic crossing, the physical parameters of the lens are determined up to the twofold degeneracy, u(0) < 0 and u(0) > 0, solutions caused by the well-known "ecliptic" degeneracy. It is found that the binary lens is composed of two M dwarf stars with similar masses, M-1 = 0.38 +/- 0.04M(circle plus) (0.50 +/- 0.05M(circle plus)) and M-2 = 0.38 +/- 0.04M(circle plus) (0.55 +/- 0.06M(circle plus)), and the distance to the lens is D-L = 2.77. +/- 0.23 kpc (3.30 +/- 0.29 kpc). Here the physical parameters outside and inside the parentheses are for the u(0) < 0 and u(0) > 0 solutions, respectively.

The existence of these high-mass stars that apparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm, which requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to understand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is necessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming. With the Hubble. Space. Telescope, we observe the seven most isolated massive (> 8 M-circle dot) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large. Magellanic. Cloud. The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other MYSOs, OB associations, and even known giant molecular clouds, they are actually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals similar to 100 to several hundred pre-mainsequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously undetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in most cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions. Contrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations suggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses less than 100 M-circle dot. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for isolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with random sampling of the initial mass function. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we find evidence that isolated clusters containing O stars can exist, which in itself is rare.

SPATIALLY RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY OF EUROPA'S LARGE-SCALE COMPOSITIONAL UNITS AT 3-4 mu m WITH KECK NIRSPEC	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: composition; planets and satellites: individual (Europa); planets and satellites: surfaces	GALILEAN SATELLITES; CASSINI VIMS; SURFACE; ICE; SPECTRA; ENCELADUS; PYTHON; OCEAN	We present spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of Europa's surface at 3-4 mu m obtained with the near-infrared spectrograph and adaptive optics system on the Keck II telescope. These are the highest quality spatially resolved reflectance spectra of Europa's surface at 3-4 mu m. The observations spatially resolve Europa's large-scale compositional units at a resolution of several hundred kilometers. The spectra show distinct features and geographic variations associated with known compositional units; in particular, large-scale leading hemisphere chaos shows a characteristic longward shift in peak reflectance near 3.7 mu m compared to icy regions. These observations complement previous spectra of large-scale chaos, and can aid efforts to identify the endogenous non-ice species.	[Fischer, P. D.; Brown, M. E.; Trumbo, S.

SPITZER SECONDARY ECLIPSE DEPTHS WITH MULTIPLE INTRAPIXEL SENSITIVITY CORRECTION METHODS OBSERVATIONS OF WASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b, AND HAT-P-22b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						atmospheric effects; methods: numerical; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: detection; techniques: photometric	INFRARED ARRAY CAMERA; M PHASE CURVES; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; GIANT PLANETS; GJ 436; EMISSION; TRANSIT; IRAC	We measure the 4.5 mu m thermal emission of five transiting hot Jupiters, WASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b, and HAT-P-22b using channel 2 of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Significant intrapixel sensitivity variations in Spitzer IRAC data require careful correction in order to achieve precision on the order of several hundred parts per million (ppm) for the measurement of exoplanet secondary eclipses. We determine eclipse depths by first correcting the raw data using three independent data reduction methods. The Pixel Gain Map (PMAP), Nearest Neighbors (NNBR), and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) each correct for the intrapixel sensitivity effect in Spitzer photometric time-series observations. The results from each methodology are compared against each other to establish if they reach a statistically equivalent result in every case and to evaluate their ability to minimize uncertainty in the measurement. We find that all three methods produce reliable results. For every planet examined here NNBR and PLD produce results that are in statistical agreement. However, the PMAP method appears to produce results in slight disagreement in cases where the stellar centroid is not kept consistently on the most well characterized area of the detector. We evaluate the ability of each method to reduce the scatter in the residuals as well as in the correlated noise in the corrected data. The NNBR and PLD methods consistently minimize both white and red noise levels and should be considered reliable and consistent. The planets in this study span equilibrium temperatures from 1100 to 2000. K and have brightness temperatures that require either high albedo or efficient recirculation. However, it is possible that other processes such as clouds or disequilibrium chemistry may also be responsible for producing these brightness temperatures.

POST-OUTBURST RADIO OBSERVATIONS OF THE HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD PULSAR PSR J1119-6127	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						ISM: individual objects (G292.2-0.5); ISM: supernova remnants; pulsars: individual (PSR J1119-6127); stars: magnetars; stars: neutron	SUPERNOVA REMNANT G292.2-0.5; YOUNG PULSAR; TELESCOPE; EMISSION; GLITCH; DENSITY; CATALOG	We have carried out high-frequency radio observations of the high magnetic field pulsar PSR. J1119-6127 following its recent X-ray outburst. While initial observations showed no evidence of significant radio emission, subsequent observations detected pulsed emission across a large frequency band. In this Letter, we report on the initial disappearance of the pulsed emission and its prompt reactivation and dramatic evolution over several months of observation. The periodic pulse profile at S-band (2.3 GHz) after reactivation exhibits a multi-component emission structure, while the simultaneous X-band (8.4 GHz) profile shows a single emission peak. Single pulses were also detected at S-band near the main emission peaks. We present measurements of the spectral index across a wide frequency bandwidth, which captures the underlying changes in the radio emission profile of the neutron star. The high-frequency radio detection, unusual emission profile, and observed variability suggest similarities with magnetars, which may independently link the high-energy outbursts to magnetar-like behavior.

An analysis of high cloud variability: imprints from the El Nio-Southern Oscillation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Cloud fraction; Interannual variability; Principal component analysis	OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; DIURNAL CYCLE; CIRCULATION; FEEDBACK; CONVECTION; DATASETS; CMIP5; ISCCP	Using data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), we examine how near-global (60A degrees N-60A degrees S) high cloud fraction varies over time in the past three decades. Our focus is on identifying dominant modes of variability and associated spatial patterns, and how they are related to sea surface temperature. By performing the principal component analysis, we find that the first two principal modes of high cloud distribution show strong imprints of the two types of El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-the canonical ENSO and the ENSO Modoki. Comparisons between ISCCP data and 14 models from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (AMIP5) show that models simulate the spatial pattern and the temporal variations of high cloud fraction associated with the canonical ENSO very well but the magnitudes of the canonical ENSO vary among the models. Furthermore, the multi-model mean of the second principal mode in the AMIP5 simulations appears to capture the temporal behavior of the second mode but individual AMIP5 models show large discrepancies in capturing observed temporal variations. A new metric, defined by the relative variances of the first two principal components, suggests that most of the AMIP5 models overestimate the second principal mode of high clouds.

J	Mao, W; Thill, M; Hassibi, B				Mao, Wei; Thill, Matthew; Hassibi, Babak			On Ingleton-Violating Finite Groups	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Finite groups; entropy vectors; Ingleton inequality; network coding; group network codes	INFORMATION INEQUALITIES; ENTROPY REGION	Given n discrete random variables, its entropy vector is the 2(n) - 1-dimensional vector obtained from the joint entropies of all non-empty subsets of the random variables. It is well known that there is a close relation between such an entropy vector and a certain group-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and n of its subgroups; indeed, roughly speaking, knowing the region of all such group-characterizable vectors is equivalent to knowing the region of all entropy vectors. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space of entropic vectors and for designing network codes. If one restricts attention to abelian groups then not all entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an explanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al. that linear network codes cannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems (since linear network codes come from abelian groups). All abelian group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton inequality. General entropy vectors, however, do not necessarily have this property. It is, therefore, of interest to identify groups that violate the Ingleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian finite groups that yield characterizable vectors, which violate the Ingleton inequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group S-5 to be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study of the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to the Ingleton-violating family PGL(2, q) with a prime power q >= 5, i.e., the projective group of 2 x 2 nonsingular matrices with entries in F-q. We further interpret this family of groups, and their subgroups, using the theory of group actions and identify the subgroups as certain stabilizers. We also extend the construction to more general groups such as PGL(n, q) and GL(n, q). The families of groups identified here are therefore good candidates for constructing network codes more powerful than linear network codes, and we discuss some considerations for constructing such group network codes.

THz spectroscopy of D2H+	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						THz spectra; Tunable FIR; Molecular Ion; Interstellar molecule	ROTATIONAL SPECTRA; H2D+; EMISSION; CORE	We extended the measurements of the rotational transitions of D2H+ up to 3 THz by using the JPL frequency multiplier chains and a TuFIR system at Toyama. D2H+ was generated in an extended negative glow discharge cell cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. We observed five new THz lines. All the available rotational transition frequencies together with the combination differences derived from the three fundamental bands were subject to least square analysis to determine the molecular constants. New THz measurements are definitely useful for better characterization of spectroscopic properties. The improved molecular constants provide better predictions of other unobserved rotational transitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Yu, S.; Pearson, J.

Line parameters for CO2 broadening in the nu(2) band of (HDO)-O-16	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						HDO-CO2 widths; HDO-CO2 shifts; HDO-CO2 calculated line list; Temperature dependence of widths; Off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients; Mars atmosphere	ROBERT-BONAMY FORMALISM; INTERMOLECULAR POTENTIAL PARAMETERS; DIODE-LASER MEASUREMENTS; HALF-WIDTHS; WATER-VAPOR; COLLISIONAL PARAMETERS; SHIFT COEFFICIENTS; H2O LINES; COMBINATION RULES; H2O-CO2 MIXTURES	CO2-rich planetary atmospheres such as those of Mars and Venus require accurate knowledge of CO2 broadened HDO half-width coefficients and their temperature dependence exponents for reliable abundance determination. Although a few calculated line lists have recently been published on HDO-CO2 line shapes and their temperature dependences, laboratory measurements of those parameters are thus far non-existent. In this work, we report the first measurements of CO2-broadened half-width and pressure-shift coefficients and their temperature dependences for over 220 transitions in the nu(2) band. First measurements of self-broadened half-width and self-shift coefficients at room temperature are also obtained for majority of these transitions. In addition, the first experimental determination of collisional line mixing has been reported for 11 transition pairs for HDO-CO2 and HDO-HDO systems. These results were obtained by analyzing ten high-resolution spectra of HDO and HDO-CO2 mixtures at various sample temperatures and pressures recorded with the Bruker IFS-125HR Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Two coolable absorption cells with path lengths of 2038 cm and 20.941 m were used to record the spectra. The various line parameters were retrieved by fitting all ten spectra simultaneously using a multispectrum nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The HDO transitions in the 1100-4100 cm(-1) range were extracted from the HITRAN2012 database. For the nu(2) and 2 nu(2) -nu(2) bands there were 2245 and 435 transitions, respectively. Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy formalism (MCRB) calculations were made for the half-width coefficients, their temperature dependence and the pressure shift coefficients for the HDO-CO2 and HDO-HDO collision systems. MCRB calculations are compared with the measured values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Devi, V. Malathy; Benner, D.

Two-dimensional radiative transfer for the retrieval of limb emission measurements in the martian atmosphere	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						2D; Radiative transfer; Limb geometry; Mars; MCS	3-D TOMOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL; MIDDLE-ATMOSPHERE; SOUNDING OBSERVATIONS; IMAGER GLORIA; MARS; SPECTRA; SENSITIVITY; MODEL	The remote sounding of infrared emission from planetary atmospheres using limb-viewing geometry is a powerful technique for deriving vertical profiles of structure and composition on a global scale. Compared with nadir viewing, limb geometry provides enhanced vertical resolution and greater sensitivity to atmospheric constituents. However, standard limb profile retrieval techniques assume spherical symmetry and are vulnerable to biases produced by horizontal gradients in atmospheric parameters. We present a scheme for the correction of horizontal gradients in profile retrievals from limb observations of the martian atmosphere. It characterizes horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, and aerosol extinction along the line-of-sight of a limb view through neighboring measurements, and represents these gradients by means of two-dimensional radiative transfer in the forward model of the retrieval. The scheme is applied to limb emission measurements from the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Retrieval simulations using data from numerical models indicate that biases of up to 10 K in the winter polar region, obtained with standard retrievals using spherical symmetry, are reduced to about 2 K in most locations by the retrieval with two-dimensional radiative transfer. Retrievals from Mars atmospheric measurements suggest that the two-dimensional radiative transfer greatly reduces biases in temperature and aerosol opacity caused by observational geometry, predominantly in the polar winter regions.

The IPAC Image Subtraction and Discovery Pipeline for the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						methods: analytical; methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ASTROMETRIC CALIBRATION; VARIABLE-STARS; CLASSIFICATION; CATALOG; SEARCH; KERNEL; PHOTOMETRY; SUPERNOVAE; ALGORITHM	We describe the near real-time transient-source discovery engine for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), currently in operations at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC), Caltech. We coin this system the IPAC/iPTF Discovery Engine (or IDE). We review the algorithms used for PSF-matching, image subtraction, detection, photometry, and machine-learned (ML) vetting of extracted transient candidates. We also review the performance of our ML classifier. For a limiting signal-to-noise ratio of 4 in relatively unconfused regions, bogus candidates from processing artifacts and imperfect image subtractions outnumber real transients by; 10:1. This can be considerably higher for image data with inaccurate astrometric and/or PSF-matching solutions. Despite this occasionally high contamination rate, the ML classifier is able to identify real transients with an efficiency (or completeness) of; 97% for a maximum tolerable false-positive rate of 1% when classifying raw candidates. All subtraction-image metrics, source features, ML probability-based real-bogus scores, contextual metadata from other surveys, and possible associations with known Solar System objects are stored in a relational database for retrieval by the various science working groups. We review our efforts in mitigating false-positives and our experience in optimizing the overall system in response to the multitude of science projects underway with iPTF.

Applying terrestrial lidar for evaluation and calibration of airborne lidar-derived shrub biomass estimates in Arctic tundra	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; LEAF-AREA	Monitoring of climate-driven expansion of low-stature shrubs in Arctic tundra can be improved through application of high-resolution remote sensing. However, the destructive nature of harvest sampling that is usually performed for validation of these data is resource intensive and can limit future comparisons by destroying benchmark measurements. We compared aboveground shrub biomass estimates derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) with the goal of determining whether TLS data can be used to accurately calibrate ALS estimates of shrub biomass in Arctic tundra. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation calibration of canopy volume against harvested shrub biomass to establish predictive relationships between TLS canopy volume and harvested shrub biomass, and between ALS canopy volume and TLS-derived shrub biomass estimates. TLS produced more accurate predictions of shrub biomass (R-2 = 0.78; root mean square deviation [RMSD] = 102 g) than did ALS, but the accuracy of ALS-derived shrub biomass predictions was the same whether they were calibrated directly against harvest biomass or against TLS-derived estimates of biomass (R-2 = 0.62; RMSD = 140 g). Our results suggest that once the initial TLS-harvest relationship is known, TLS can provide valid ground reference data for calibration of ALS-derived estimates of shrub biomass without the need for additional destructive harvest.

The number of small satellite and CubeSat missions has increased significantly in recent years. Compared to traditional larger satellite missions, CubeSats are designed at lower cost and with shorter development cycles. The reliability of CubeSats and small satellites in on-orbit radiation environments needs to be ensured for mission success. In this study, single event effect analysis has been performed for a 6U-Class satellite instrument in low Earth orbit to improve its on-orbit reliability. Critical commercial off-the-shelf parts of the Command and Data Handling Subsystem of a 6U-Class satellite instrument have been tested under heavy-ion radiation at the Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute Radiation Effects Facility. SEE characteristics have been tested and analyzed for analog-to-digital data converters, voltage regulators, and current sensing and voltage monitoring devices. Device-and system-level risk analyses have been performed for the Command and Data Handling electronics based on the results of heavy-ion radiation testing. System-level mitigation techniques have been studied to minimize the effects of SEEs on electronic systems for deployment on 6U-Class satellites in low Earth orbit.

The cost and feasibility of future missions to 5-10 AU and beyond would greatly benefit from the availability of high-efficiency solar arrays optimized for low-irradiance low-temperature (LILT) environments. We have therefore set out to develop an advanced-architecture solar cell technology that will produce over 20% more power per unit area at LILT than the current state of practice. This technology will leverage recent advances in bandgap engineering originally developed for 1 AU, such as inverted or upright metamorphic multijunction device architectures. In addition, the new technology will feature a LILT-optimized, radiation-hard design. This paper reports on initial results from JPL's advanced-architecture LILT cell development project, specifically ground-based laboratory measurements of temperature-dependent illuminated current-voltage (LIV) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). Test conditions included irradiances corresponding to Sun distances from 1 AU to 9.5 AU, and junction temperatures between +28 degrees C and -165 degrees C. Through such measurements, multiple advanced architectures have been identified which demonstrate superior performance even prior to completing the design optimization for LILT, at both beginning of life (BOL, pre-radiation) and at end of life (EOL, post le15 1 MeV e(-)/cm(2)). For example, we measured 5.5 AU -140 degrees C average efficiencies of similar to 35% at BOL and similar to 31-33% at EOL for inverted metamorphic four-junction cells from SolAero and upright metamorphic triple-junction cells from Spectrolab. Further efficiency improvements are to be expected in the near future as we investigate, identify and eliminate from the device design those mechanisms that limit the cell performance at LILT.

The study covered particles from spores to fluorescent particles of different sizes as well as a variety of substrate surfaces, including aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, and nitinol. Particles were deposited using aerosol (dry) and droplet (wet) deposition. Results from the previous study show that the CO2 composite spray system is capable of cleaning to sterility for aerosol deposited spores and is capable of cleaning a minimum of a 4-log reduction for droplet deposited spores. This minimum 4-log reduction matches current Planetary Protection dry heat microbial reduction requirements. In this paper we will present new data to further correlate the cleaning efficiency with how contamination was introduced to the surface, the surface roughness, and particle size. Possible causes for such correlations will be discussed.

In the early days of the Space Program, this figure was small, and could be described in bits or maybe even megabits. But now, missions are capable of returning data volumes two or three orders of magnitude larger. For example, Voyager 1 and 2 combined produced a little over 5 Terabits of data in 39 years of operation. In contrast, the Cassini mission, launched two decades after Voyager, produced about one and a half times those data volumes in half the time. NISAR, an Earth Science Mission currently in implementation, plans to produce over 28 Petabits of raw data in just 3 years. This means that NISAR will produce about as many data in 30 days as the combined data production of nearly all planetary missions to date. These increases in capability are a result of technology enhancements in two main areas: telecommunications architecture (both space and ground segments) and data storage technology. This paper describes the progression of these two technologies over the course of more than three decades of space missions and provides additional insight into the design of the end-to-end NISAR Data System Architecture. Trends in the data are briefly explored and compared to Moore's Law which provides only a qualitative model for memory growth but not for data production. In summary, early missions are found to be driven by unrefined processes while later missions, having utilized earlier lessons learned, focus more on improvements to flight and ground capabilities. Data return seems to fall into three categories. First, deep space missions are driven by the large distances that limit data return to the Earth. Next, the orbiter infrastructure around Mars helps these missions generate more data than other deep space spacecraft. Finally, near-Earth missions have the greatest capabilities for the studied metrics due to their close proximity to Earth and the ground network availability.	[Jasper, Lee E.

During this time, regular astrometric measurements of Cassini's sky position have been made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). These are high precision differential measurements that determine the position of Cassini with respect to angularly nearby extragalactic radio sources. Differential, narrow-angle astrometry reduces many error sources, particularly those associated with signal propagation effects in the ionosphere and troposphere. The background radio sources positions are tied to the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) by other international VLBI observations. Thus, we obtain a series of ICRF positions for Cassini, which can be combined with spacecraft orbit solutions from Deep Space Network doppler tracking to get ICRF positions for the center of mass of the Saturn system. These positions have typical accuracies at the nano-radian level. For some epochs uncertainties in the background source positions are a major component of the total error, but these positions are being constantly improved as additional VLBI observations are incorporated into radio source catalogs. The planetary ephemeris group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses our position measurements to fit improved orbital solutions for Saturn. As a result the orientation of the plane of Saturn's orbit is now known to approximately 0.25 milli-arcseconds (1.25 nrad), nearly an order of magnitude improvement over its pre-VLBA uncertainty. We will continue this observing program until the end of the Cassini mission in late 2017. By that time we will have covered about 1/3 of Saturn's orbital longitude range. Future improvements to this technique will include the use of higher spacecraft downlink frequencies (Ka band instead of X band) and higher ground array sensitivity to permit the use of weaker but angularly closer reference sources. In addition, the continuing international campaigns to enhance the accuracy of radio source catalogs will be extended to weaker sources, improving their ties to the ICRF.

Each team submitted a Mission Concept Study to NASA in August 2016, and in January of 2017 NASA selected Psyche and a second mission for flight. This paper describes Psyche, a unique investigation of a metal world, which is the only one of the original five mission concepts studied in detail to propose the use of Electric Propulsion (EP) to accomplish its mission objectives. Psyche will harness commercially developed EP and space power systems with strong system-level heritage to accomplish a deep space NASA science mission at comparatively low technical-risk and cost-risk. This paper describes the Psyche mission concept and the unique Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) architecture that allows the use of SSL's commercial SPT-140 Hall thruster propulsion system at solar distances of up to 3.3 AU with only minimal modifications. Building on previous work analyzing SEP systems for Discovery-class missions, this paper describes the heritage, design, and testing which have been conducted on the power and propulsion systems to develop the Psyche mission, addresses the differences between GEO and deep-space environments, and describes actions taken to ensure that GEO heritage systems can be operated reliably in deep-space.

This method was developed for the Mars Exploration Rovers mission's surface operations to aid in determining orbiter visibility periods for downlink data, and is now being considered for all Mars surface missions and for a variety of applications. Starting with images received from Mars rovers or landers, the horizon pixel location is found by (1) obtaining the gradient images using the Sobel operator, (2) calculating the preliminary horizon locations by optimizing the maximum difference between sky and ground regions in the gradient domain, and (3) applying a multi-variable thresholding method. The results are analyzed using a variety of images from the Mars rovers, as an example one dataset's results were categorized as 94.2% Good, 4.11% Okay, and 1.65% Poor. The pixel location corresponding to the found horizon in an image is converted to azimuth and elevation values using the camera model. The elevation of the terrain surrounding the rover or lander directly affects the duration orbiters are visible for downlink data volume, and when the sun is visible for image quality or solar energy consumption. Having an automated process to detect the elevation of the terrain allows the operation team to better predict the outcome of the plan, reducing heath and safety risks and allowing new operational limits to be defined.

A three-mission campaign concept is currently being investigated. The Mars 2020 rover mission is intended to core and collect samples. These samples will be sealed in tubes and left on the surface for potential return to Earth. In the current MSR campaign concept, a Sample Retrieval and Launch (SRL) mission would collect the sample tubes left by the Mars 2020 rover and load them into a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) to be launched into orbit. The third mission concept involves a spacecraft capturing the samples in Martian orbit and returning them to Earth. This paper focuses on the SRL mission concept to collect the sample tubes, addressing the problem of autonomously detecting, localizing, and grasping sample tubes deposited on the Martian surface. We employ two approaches: The first one is context-based. It would use a high precision map computed from images captured during tube release, to locate the tubes without directly observing them. The second approach directly detects the sample tubes visually and estimates their 6-DoF pose onboard from dense stereo data.

In particular, space-based radio interferometers can detect signals in frequency ranges that are absorbed by Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere. Furthermore, such formation missions are now feasible under constrained cost caps due to the growing availability of SmallSat components with spaceflight heritage that are compatible the CubeSat form-factor. Accordingly, we analyze a mission concept operating multiple SmallSats in a passive cluster to establish a space-based interferometer. The goal of this array is to reconstruct radio emissions associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, giving us insight into the particle acceleration occurring during these events. This low-cost mission concept presents a number of unique challenges in regards to mission design and navigation, particularly the configuration of the spacecraft to optimize science return and the reconstruction of precise spacecraft-spacecraft separation values. After providing a brief overview of the mission concept, this paper presents several key features of the mission design and orbit determination strategy that enable this potential heliophysics mission.

A Framework for Writing Measurement Requirements and its Application to the Planned Europa Mission	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Science-engineering communication is critical to the success of any science-driven mission. The process of building this understanding relies on a shared language for communicating science needs and engineering results, which can be particularly difficult on large space-science missions where many different institutions contribute to the science team. The Science Traceability Matrix can be used to formalize this communication pathway, but it has limited use in the development of the science requirements flowdown, and varies in format, scope and content from mission to mission. There are many guidelines on developing well-constructed requirements in general, but very little is published on how to actually write these science-driven requirements in a systematic way. This paper discusses the measurement-domain science traceability and alignment framework, or M-STAF, which was developed to help frame the conversation between scientists and engineers in the development of measurement requirements. The M-STAF provides a common language that can be used to ensure consistency across instruments, completeness in the coverage of the requirements, and traceability of the engineering work to the science objectives of the project. This work discusses the framework in the context of other communication tools and its implementation on a flight project. The general framework is presented through the lens of its potential application on the planned Europa Mission.

During this stage of human Mars exploration, it would be necessary to provision the crews with equipment and supplies both before and during their missions. In this paper, we study the use of 150 kW reusable SEP tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and to the surface. The SEP tugs would make use of technology currently being developed for the proposed Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. The SEP tugs envisioned would be staged at a quasi-stable Lunar Near Rectilinear Orbit (NRO). The tugs would then mate with cargo vessels and xenon propellant being delivered by an SLS launch vehicle and continue on to Mars orbit where the cargo is delivered and the SEP tug returns to NRO to repeat the process. It was found that it is more efficient to deliver surface cargo via direct launch and entry versus using the tug cycler. Thousands of optimized low-thrust trajectories were simulated in order to create "Bacon plots" (like porkchop plots, but for low thrust transfers) in order to map out potential trajectories for dates from 2039 to 2052. This study maps out the buildup of a surface outpost as well as the necessary orbital and surface resupply launches in order to maintain it. In the steady state, a cadence of 9 cargo launches is required every 4 years to sustain the human outpost.

For very large distributed datasets, this slows down the analytics process, and for extremely large datasets it is often impractical to download such massive volumes due to bandwidth limitations. In such cases, data scientists need to be provided explicit access to the remote servers hosting the datasets, and possess detailed knowledge of the server infrastructure and environments, in order to send their analytics packages to the data owner. This alternative poses considerable challenges and has not been adequately addressed to date. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to addressing this challenge called Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI) which seamlessly allows users to conduct analytics-in-place by distributing analytics to the distributed repositories without moving the underlying datasets to a common location. By allowing automated analytics scripts to be sent to the data and orchestration of distributed infrastructure, VIFI allows users to conduct, execute and coordinate complex analytics activities in-place with the data on multiple data repositories. VIFI uses Docker containerization technology along with open-source workflow tool NIFI to achieve automated orchestration and distributed analytics without requiring users to posses detailed knowledge of the distributed repositories and their underlying infrastructure. We demonstrate and evaluate VIFI on a Earth Science use-case for evaluation of precipitation over the Great Plains involving analytics on massive distributed data repositories.

Energized electrons excite Langmuir waves, which convert into radio emission at the local plasma frequency, with the most intense acceleration thought to occur within 20 R-S. The capability of ground-based radio arrays to track this radio emission is limited by ionospheric absorption (nu greater than or similar to 15 MHz) to altitudes less than about 3R(S). The state of the art for tracking such emission from space is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES), in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping; there has been some success in triangulating the emission between the spacecraft, but considerable uncertainties remain. The Sun Radio Imaging Space Experiment (SunRISE) mission concept would be a constellation of small spacecraft operating as an interferometer designed to localize and track radio emissions in the inner heliosphere. Each spacecraft would carry a receiving system for observations below 25 MHz, and SunRISE would image CMEs more than a few solar radii from the Sun.	[Lazio, T.

The instrument was launched in 2011 and data acquisition ended in June 2015 when control of the spacecraft was lost. Aquarius produced global maps of salinity with accuracy of 0.2 psu and special resolution of 150 km as well as other products such as global maps of RFI and soil moisture. The mission will formally end December 2017.	[Le Vine, D. M.; Dinnat, E. P.] Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Dinnat, E.

We examine network parameters to describe spatio-temporal correlations in the TEC data for January 2016. We find that significant network structure exists distinguishing the dayside and nightside ionosphere, and specific features in the high-latitudes (cusp/ionospheric footpoints of magnetospheric boundary layers, polar cap, and auroral zone), and that these features vary with IMF clock angle. In this brief summary paper, we provide proof of concept results and identify important areas of future research, providing a basis for the discussion of network analysis and machine learning approaches for space weather applications.

Using the infrastructure being designed for EarthCube - the Virtual Observatory for the earth sciences - we discuss essential steps for better transfer of tools and techniques in the future e.g. domain adaptation. Finally we point out that it is never a one-way process and there is enough for astroinformatics to learn from geoinformatics as well.	[Mahabal, Ashish A.; Djorgovski, S.

Dealing with the size and complexity of this requires new techniques and methodologies. Quasars are an ideal work set for developing and applying these: they vary in a detectable but not easily quantifiable manner whose physical origins are poorly understood. In this paper, we will review how quasars are identified by their variability and how these techniques can be improved, what physical insights into their variability can be gained from studying extreme examples of variability, and what approaches can be taken to increase the number of quasars known. These will demonstrate how astroinformatics is essential to discovering and understanding this important population.	[Graham, Matthew J.; Djorgovski, S.

SPECTRAL CHANGES IN THE HYPERLUMINOUS PULSAR IN NGC 5907 AS A FUNCTION OF SUPER-ORBITAL PHASE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; pulsars: individual (NGC 5907 ULX1); X-rays: binaries	X-RAY SOURCE; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; BLACK-HOLES; BROAD-BAND; ULTRALUMINOUS STATE; ACCRETION DISKS; NEUTRON-STARS; GX 339-4; 1313 X-1	We present broadband, multi-epoch X-ray spectroscopy of the pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 5907. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data from 2014 are best described by a multicolor blackbody model with a temperature gradient as a function of accretion disk radius significantly flatter than expected for a standard thin accretion disk (T(r) proportional to r(-p), with p = 0.608(-0.012)(+0.014)). Additionally, we detect a hard power-law tail at energies above 10 keV, which we interpret as being due to Comptonization. We compare this observation to archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR data from 2003, 2012, and 2013, and investigate possible spectral changes as a function of phase over the 78-day. super-orbital period of this source. We find that observations taken around phases 0.3-0.4 show very similar temperature profiles, even though the observed flux varies significantly, while one observation taken around phase 0 has a significantly steeper profile. We discuss these findings in light of the recent discovery that the compact object is a neutron star and show that precession of the accretion disk or the neutron star can self-consistently explain most observed phenomena.

Here, we present a comprehensive search for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of V404 Cygni during its recent outburst, utilizing data from six instruments on board five different X-ray missions: Swift/XRT, Fermi/GBM, Chandra/ACIS, INTEGRAL's IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X, and NuSTAR. We report the detection of a QPO at 18 mHz simultaneously with both Fermi/GBM and Swift/XRT, another example of a rare but slowly growing new class of mHz-QPOs in BHXRBs linked to sources with a high orbital inclination. Additionally, we find a duo of QPOs in a Chandra/ACIS observation at 73 mHz and 1.03 Hz, as well as a QPO at 136 mHz in a single Swift/XRT observation that can be interpreted as standard Type-C QPOs. Aside from the detected QPOs, there is significant structure in the broadband power, with a strong feature observable in the Chandra observations between 0.1 and 1 Hz. We discuss our results in the context of current models for QPO formation.

Drought: Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, and Soil Moisture	ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SOIL SCIENCE, VOLS I-III, 3RD EDITION			English	Article; Book Chapter							ATMOSPHERE WATER FLUX	Drought is major hydrological disaster for human society and encompasses multiple hydrological components. There are numerous definitions of drought, many of which do not include transpiration or evaporation [evapotranspiration (ET)]. In this entry, we describe the role of ET in drought, and why ET is important to consider when assessing drought. We emphasize the dynamic roles of ET, precipitation, and soil moisture, with a focus on vegetation response during water stress. Finally, we conclude with a case study example of drought in Amazonia.

From 21 September -2 November 2015, the HTP discharged similar to 39 x 10(3) m(3) h(-1) of treated wastewater into Santa Monica Bay through their emergency 1-mile outfall pipe. Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing was employed to determine the biophysical impact of discharged wastewater in the shallow nearshore environment. Landsat 8 TIRS observed decreased sea surface temperatures (SST) associated with the surfacing wastewater plume. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Aqua MODIS satellite sensors were used to monitor the biological response to the addition of nutrient-rich wastewater. In situ chl-a and in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were measured before, during, and after the diversion event. These in situ data were paired with coincident OLI and MODIS satellite data to yield a more comprehensive view of the changing conditions in Santa Monica Bay due to the wastewater diversion. Two new local chl-a algorithms were empirically derived using in situ data for the OLI and MODIS sensors. These new local chl-a algorithms proved more accurate at measuring chl-a changes in Santa Monica Bay compared to the standard open ocean OC2 and OC3M algorithms, and the regional southern California CALFIT algorithm, as validated by in situ chl-a measurements. Additionally, the local OLI algorithm outperformed the local MODIS algorithm, especially in the nearshore region. A time series of chl-a, as detected by the local OLI chl-a algorithm, illustrated a very large increase in chl-a concentrations during the wastewater diversion, and a subsequent decrease in chl-a after the diversion. Our study demonstrates the capability of using Landsat 8 TIRS and OLI sensors for the monitoring of SST and surface chl-a concentrations at high spatial resolution in nearshore waters and highlights the value of these sensors for assessing the environmental effects of wastewater discharge in a coastal environment.

We have used the latter to make the first determination of Saturn's Love number from observations, k(2)=0.390 +/- 0.024, a value larger than the commonly used theoretical value of 0.341 (Gavrilov & Zharkov, 1977), but compatible with more recent models (Helled & Guillot, 2013) for which the static k(2) ranges from 0.355 to 0382. Depending on the assumed spin for Saturn's interior, the new constraint can lead to a significant reduction in the number of potential models, offering great opportunities to probe the planet's interior. In addition, significant tidal dissipation within Saturn is confirmed (Lainey et al., 2012) corresponding to a high present-day tidal ratio k(2)/Q=(1.59 +/- 0.74)x10(-4) and implying fast orbital expansions of the Moons. This high dissipation, with no obvious variations for tidal frequencies corresponding to those of Enceladus and Dione, may be explained by viscous friction in a solid core, implying a core viscosity typically ranging between 10(14) and 10(16) Pa.s (Remus et al., 2012). However, a dissipation increase by one order of magnitude at Rhea's frequency could suggest the existence of an additional, frequency-dependent, dissipation process, possibly from turbulent friction acting on tidal waves in the fluid envelope of Saturn (Ogilvie & Lin, 2004; Fuller et al. 2016).

Tropospheric emissions: Monitoring of pollution (TEMPO)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							ROTATIONAL RAMAN-SCATTERING; OZONE PROFILE RETRIEVALS; SURFACE UV IRRADIANCE; AIR-QUALITY; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; NO2 RETRIEVAL; GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS; CLOUD PRESSURES; NORTH-AMERICA; WATER-VAPOR	TEMPO was selected in 2012 by NASA as the first Earth Venture Instrument, for launch between 2018 and 2021. It will measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO observes from Mexico City, Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (similar to 2.1 km N/S x 4.4 km E/W at 36.5 degrees N, 100 degrees W). TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies. TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide), water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O-3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O-3 in the lowermost troposphere, substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides these near-realtime air quality products that will be made publicly available. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be the North American component of the global geostationary constellation of pollution monitoring together with the European Sentinel-4 (S4) and Korean Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments.

The main source of the IPT is the moon Io, the most volcanically active object in the Solar System. Io is the innermost of the Galilean moons of Jupiter, the main source of the magnetospheric plasma and responsible for injecting nearly 1 ton/s of ions into Jupiter's magnetosphere. In this work ground-based observations of the [SII] 6731 angstrom emission lines are observed, obtained at the MacMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The results shown here were obtained in late 1997 and occurred shortly after a period of important eruptions observed by the Galileo mission (1996-2003). Several outbursts were observed and periods of intense volcanic activity are important to correlate with periods of brightness enhancements observed at the IPT. The time of response between an eruption and enhancement at IPT is still not well understood.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of in situ datasets and their variable adherence to meta/data standards poses a significant impediment to interoperability and long-term data stewardship. Here we introduce the Oceanographic in situ data Interoperability Project, a collaboration between JPL PO.DAAC, UCAR/Unidata and the Large Pelagics Research Center (UMASS-Boston) that aims to address these challenges. It involves the enhancement and integration of available technology components for improved interoperability and support of in situ data with a focus on a representative yet complex class of oceanographic field data: data from electronic tags deployed on a variety of marine species. Beyond this technical development work itself, an innovative part of our project involves collaborating with the electronic tag manufacturer Wildlife Computers and actively engaging tagging community stakeholders to promote the adoption of appropriate data standards. The project thus adopts a model lifecycle approach complimented by broadly applicable technologies to address key data management and interoperability issues for electronic tagging data and other marine in situ datasets. In this paper, we review the motivation, approach and current status of the work, 9 months into the project.

However, the slanted direction of the measurements complicates interpretation of the signal, especially in regions that are subject to multiple deformation processes. The Simultaneous and Integrated Strain Tensor Estimation from Geodetic and Satellite Deformation Measurements (SISTEM) algorithm enables decomposition into a three-dimensional velocity field through joint inversion with GNSS measurements, but has never been applied to interseismic deformation where strain rates are low. Here, we apply SISTEM for the first time to detect tectonic deformation on the Hyblean Foreland Plateau in South-East Sicily. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the DInSAR data beforehand, we reduce atmospheric InSAR noise using a weather model and combine it with a multi-directional spatial filtering technique. The resultant three-dimensional velocity field allows identification of anthropogenic, as well as tectonic deformation, with sub-centimeter accuracies in areas of sufficient GPS coverage. Our enhanced method allows for a more detailed view of ongoing deformation processes as compared to the single use of either GNSS or DInSAR only and thus is suited to improve assessments of regional seismic hazard.

We desire a computer vision system (e.g., a robot) that can recognize human activities and assist our daily life, yet ensure that it is not recording video that may invade our privacy. This paper presents a fundamental approach to address such contradicting objectives: human activity recognition while only using extreme low-resolution (e.g., 16x12) anonymized videos. We introduce the paradigm of inverse super resolution (ISR), the concept of learning the optimal set of image transformations to generate multiple low-resolution (LR) training videos from a single video. Our ISR learns different types of sub-pixel transformations optimized for the activity classification, allowing the classifier to best take advantage of existing high-resolution videos (e.g., YouTube videos) by creating multiple LR training videos tailored for the problem. We experimentally confirm that the paradigm of inverse super resolution is able to benefit activity recognition from extreme low-resolution videos.

Interferences by HNO3, CO2 and H2O have to be accounted for. Application of this approach to observations recorded within the framework of long-term monitoring activities carried out at the northern mid-latitude, high-altitude Jungfraujoch station in Switzerland (46.5 degrees N, 8.0 degrees E, 3580 m above sea level) has provided a total column times series spanning the 1989 to mid-2015 time period. A fit to the HCFC-142b daily mean total column time series shows a statistically-significant long-term trend of (1.23 +/- 0.08 x 10(13) molec cm(-2)) per year from 2000 to 2010, at the 2-sigma confidence level. This corresponds to a significant atmospheric accumulation of (0.94 +/- 0.06) ppt (1 ppt =1/10(12)) per year for the mean tropospheric mixing ratio, at the 2-sigma confidence level. Over the subsequent time period (2010-2014), we note a significant slowing down in the HCFC-142b buildup. Our ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) results are compared with relevant data sets derived from surface in situ measurements at the Mace Head and Jungfraujoch sites of the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network and from occultation measurements by the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) instrument on-board the SCISAT satellite.

Polygonal ridge networks on Mars: Diversity of morphologies and the special case of the Eastern Medusae Fossae Formation	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Surface; Geological processes; Mars; Volcanism; Hydrology	FAN-SHAPED DEPOSIT; GALE CRATER; ORIGIN; FAULTS; HELLAS; EVOLUTION; HISTORY; EROSION; SURFACE; FLOOR	Polygonal ridge networks, also known as boxwork or reticulate ridges, are found in numerous locations and geological contexts across Mars. Distinguishing the morphologies and geological context of the ridge networks sheds light on their potential as astrobiological and mineral resource sites of interest. The most widespread type of ridge morphology is characteristic of the Nili Fossae and Nilosyrtis region and consists of thin, criss-crossing ridges with a variety of heights, widths, and intersection angles. They are found in ancient Noachian terrains at a variety of altitudes (between -2500 and 2200 m) and geographic locations and are likely to be chemically altered fracture planes or mineral veins. They occur in the same general areas as valley networks and ancient lake basins, but they are not more numerous where these water-related features are concentrated, and can appear in places where th morphologies are absent. Similarly, some of the ridge networks are located near hydrated mineral detections, but there is not a one-to-one correlation. Smaller, light-toned ridges of variable widths have been found in Gale Crater and other rover sites and are interpreted to be smaller versions of the Nili-like ridges, mostly formed by the mineralization of fractures. This type of ridge is likely to be found in many other places on Mars as more high-resolution data become available. Sinus Meridiani contains many flat-topped ridges arranged into quasi-circular patterns. The ridges are eroding from a clay-rich unit, and could be formed by a similar process as the Nili-type ridges, but at a much larger scale and controlled by fractures made through a different process. Hellas Basin is host to a fourth type of ridge morphology consisting of large, thick, light-toned ridges forming regular polygons at several superimposed scales. While still enigmatic, these are most likely to be the result of sediment-filled fractures. The Eastern Medusae Fossae Formation contains large swaths of a fifth, previously undocumented, ridge network type. The dark ridges, reaching up to 50m in height, enclose regular polygons and erode into dark boulders. These ridge networks are interpreted to form as a result of lava flow embayment of deeply fractured Medusae Fossae Formation outcrops. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cassini microwave observations provide clues to the origin of Saturn's C ring	ICARUS			English	Article						Saturn, rings; Planetary rings; Radar observations; Origin, Solar system	INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; PARTICLE COMPOSITION; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SYSTEM; ACCRETION; EVOLUTION; RADAR; WAKES; MOONS	Despite considerable study, Saturn's rings continue to challenge current theories for their provenance. Water ice comprises the bulk of Saturn's rings, yet it is the small fraction of non-icy material that is arguably more valuable in revealing clues about the system's origin and age. Herein, we present new measurements of the non-icy material fraction in Saturn's C ring, determined from microwave radiometry observations acquired by the Cassini spacecraft. Our observations show an exceptionally high brightness at near-zero azimuthal angles, suggesting a high porosity of 70-75% for the C ring particles. Furthermore, our results show that most regions in the C ring contain about 1-2% silicates. These results are consistent with an initially nearly pure-ice ring system that has been continuously contaminated by in-falling microwmeteoroids over similar to 15-90 million years, using the currently accepted value of the micrometeoroid flux at infinity of similar to 4.5 x 10(-17)g cm(-2) s(-1), and assuming that the C ring optical depth and surface density has not changed significantly during that time. This absolute time scale is inversely proportional not only to the flux at infinity, but also to the amount of gravitational focusing by Saturn the micrometeoroids experience before encountering the rings. We also find an enhanced abundance of non-icy material concentrated in the middle C ring. When assumed to be mixed volumetrically ("intramixed") with water ice, this enhanced contamination reaches a maximum concentration of 6-11% silicates by volume around a ring radius of 83,000 km, depending on the volume mixing model used. This is significantly higher than the inner and outer C ring. As opposed to an intramixing model, we also consider a silicate-core, icy mantle model to address the fact that silicates may be present in chunks instead of fine powder in the ring particles. Such a model naturally helps to account for the observed opacity distribution. We propose several models to explain the radially varied non-icy material contamination. Our preferred model is that the C ring has been continuously polluted by meteoroid bombardment since it first formed, while the middle C ring was further contaminated by an incoming Centaur, a rocky object torn apart by tides and ultimately broken into pieces that currently reside in the middle C ring. If correct, the spatial extent of the enhanced non-icy material fraction suggests that the Centaur was likely to be captured and integrated into the rings perhaps as recently as similar to 10-20 million years ago.

Bright prospects for radar detection of Europa's ocean	ICARUS			English	Article						Radar sounding; Regolith; Ocean; Volume scattering; Icy moon	ICY GALILEAN SATELLITES	The surface of Europa has been hypothesized to include an ice regolith layer from hundreds of meters to kilometers in thickness. However, contrary to previous claims, it does not present a significant obstacle to searching for Europa's ocean with radar sounding. This note corrects prior volume scattering loss analyses and expands them to includes observational and thermo-mechanical constraints on pore size and regolith depth. This provides a more physically realistic range of potential ice-regolith volume-scattering losses for radar sounding observations of Europa's ice shell in the HF and VHF frequency bands. We conclude that, for the range of physical processes and material properties observed or hypothesized for Europa, volume scattering losses are not likely to pose a major obstacle to radar penetration.

We particularly focus on how the planetary mass M-oli at the onset of oligarchic growth depends on the initial mass m(0) of a planetesimal. Oligarchic growth commences when the velocity dispersion relative to the Hill velocity of the protoplanet takes its minimum. We find that if m(0) is small enough, this normalized velocity dispersion becomes as low as unity during the intermediate stage between the runaway and oligarchic growth stages. In this case, M-oli is independent of m(0). If m(0) is large, on the other hand, oligarchic growth commences directly after runaway growth, and M-oli alpha m(0)(3/7). The planetary mass M-oli for the solid surface density of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula is close to the masses of the dwarf planets in a reasonable range of m(0). This indicates that they are likely to be the largest remnant planetesimals that failed to become planets. The power-law exponent q of the differential mass distribution of remnant planetesimals is typically -2.0 and -2.7 to -2.5 for small and large m(0). The slope, q similar or equal to -2.7, and the bump at 10(21) g (or 50 km in radius) for the mass distribution of hot Kuiper belt objects are reproduced if m(0) is the bump mass. On the other hand, small initial planetesimals with m(0) similar to 10(13) g or less are favored to explain the slope of large asteroids, q similar or equal to -2.0, while the bump at 10(21) g can be reproduced by introducing a small number of asteroid seeds each with mass of 10(19) g.

Spectral characteristics of background error covariance and multiscale data assimilation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS			English	Article						Variational data assimilation; Kalman Filter; atmospheric and oceanic models; multiscale algorithm; background error covariance; spectral power density	VARIATIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; ATMOSPHERIC DATA ASSIMILATION; PART I; ANALYSIS SYSTEM; SCHEME; FORMULATION; CLOUD; IMPLEMENTATION; PREDICTION	The spatial resolutions of numerical atmospheric and oceanic circulation models have steadily increased over the past decades. Horizontal grid spacing down to the order of 1 km is now often used to resolve cloud systems in the atmosphere and sub-mesoscale circulation systems in the ocean. These fine resolution models encompass a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, across which dynamical and statistical properties vary. In particular, dynamic flow systems at small scales can be spatially localized and temporarily intermittent. Difficulties of current data assimilation algorithms for such fine resolution models are numerically and theoretically examined. An analysis shows that the background error correlation length scale is larger than 75 km for streamfunctions and is larger than 25 km for water vapor mixing ratios, even for a 2-km resolution model. A theoretical analysis suggests that such correlation length scales prevent the currently used data assimilation schemes from constraining spatial scales smaller than 150 km for streamfunctions and 50 km for water vapor mixing ratios. These results highlight the need to fundamentally modify currently used data assimilation algorithms for assimilating high-resolution observations into the aforementioned fine resolution models. Within the framework of four-dimensional variational data assimilation, a multiscale methodology based on scale decomposition is suggested and challenges are discussed.

Extensive winter subglacial water storage beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							LAND-TERMINATING SECTOR; DRAINAGE SYSTEM; SURFACE MELTWATER; RADAR ATTENUATION; BASAL CONDITIONS; RUSSELL GLACIER; GROUNDING-ZONE; FLOW; MELT; EVOLUTION	Surface meltwater that reaches the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet exerts a fundamental impact on ice flow, but observations of catchment-wide movement and distribution of subglacial water remain limited. Using radar-sounding data from two seasons, we identify the seasonal distribution of subglacial water in western Greenland. Our analysis provides evidence of widespread subglacial water storage beneath Greenland in the wintertime. The winter storage is located primarily on bedrock ridges with higher bed elevations in excess of 200 m. During the melt season water moves to the subglacial troughs. This inverse relationship with topography indicates that the material properties of the glacier bed strongly influence subglacial drainage development. Both the spatial variations in bed properties and the initial state of the subglacial hydrology system at the start of the melt season lead to differing glacier dynamical responses to surface melting across the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (climate models) simulate a wide range of magnitudes of unforced interdecadal variability in global mean surface air temperature (UITglobal), hampering efforts to quantify the influence of UITglobal on contemporary global temperature trends. Recently, a preliminary consensus has emerged that unforced interdecadal variability in local surface temperatures (UITlocal) over the tropical Pacific Ocean is particularly influential on UITglobal. Therefore, a reasonable hypothesis might be that the large spread in the magnitude of UITglobal across climate models can be explained by the spread in the magnitude of simulated tropical Pacific UITlocal. Here we show that this hypothesis is mostly false. Instead, the spread in the magnitude of UITglobal is linked much more strongly to the spread in the magnitude of UITlocal over high-latitude regions characterized by significant variability in oceanic convection, sea ice concentration, and energy flux at both the surface and the top of the atmosphere. Thus, efforts to constrain the climate model produced range of UITglobal magnitude would be best served by focusing on the simulation of air-sea interaction at high latitudes.

Tomographic reconstruction of an aerosol plume using passive multiangle observations from the MISR satellite instrument	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ALGORITHM	We present initial results using computed tomography to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of an aerosol plume from passive observations made by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite. MISR views the Earth from nine different angles at four visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Adopting the 672 nm channel, we treat each view as an independent measure of aerosol optical thickness along the line of sight at 1.1 km resolution. A smoke plume over dark water is selected as it provides a more tractable lower boundary condition for the retrieval. A tomographic algorithm is used to reconstruct the horizontal and vertical aerosol extinction field for one along-track slice from the path of all camera rays passing through a regular grid. The results compare well with ground-based lidar observations from a nearby Micropulse Lidar Network site.

The Coriolis effect on mass wasting during the Rheasilvia impact on asteroid Vesta	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ACOUSTIC FLUIDIZATION; DAWN; GRAVITY; LANDSLIDES; MOBILITY; PHYSICS; MODELS; SHAPE; POLE	We investigate the influence of the Coriolis force on mass motion related to the Rheasilvia impact on asteroid Vesta. Observations by the NASA Dawn mission revealed a pattern of curved radial ridges, which are related to Coriolis-deflected mass-wasting during the initial modification stage of the crater. Utilizing the projected curvature of the mass-wasting trajectories, we developed a method that enabled investigation of the initial mass wasting of the Rheasilvia impact by observational means. We demonstrate that the Coriolis force can strongly affect the crater formation processes on rapidly rotating objects, and we derive the material's velocities (28.9 +/- 22.5 m/s), viscosities (1.5-9.0 x 10(6) Pa s) and coefficients of friction (0.02-0.81) during the impact modification stage. The duration of the impact modification stage could be estimated to (1.1 +/- 0.5) h. By analyzing the velocity distribution with respect to the topography, we deduce that the Rheasilvia impactor hit a heterogeneous target and that the initial crater walls were significantly steeper during the modification stage.

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	SCIENCE			English	Article							OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; WATER ICE; SURFACE; VIRTIS; ROTATION; SHAPE; DARK; H2O; CO2	Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO2 ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO2 ice-rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80-by 60-meter area is CO2 ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO2 ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO2 ice and the depth of the eroded surface layer. We interpret the presence of CO2 ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet.

Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature	SCIENCE			English	Article							EXPOSED WATER ICE; H2O ICE; NUCLEUS; SURFACE; OSIRIS; MORPHOLOGY; VIRTIS	The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.	[Fornasier, S.; Barucci, M. A.; Feller, C.; Deshapriya, J. D.

The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) is the primary activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - phase 6 (CMIP6) focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In this paper, we describe the framework for ISMIP6 and its relationship with other activities within CMIP6. The ISMIP6 experimental design relies on CMIP6 climate models and includes, for the first time within CMIP, coupled ice-sheet-climate models as well as standalone ice-sheet models. To facilitate analysis of the multi-model ensemble and to generate a set of standard climate inputs for standalone ice-sheet models, ISMIP6 defines a protocol for all variables related to ice sheets. ISMIP6 will provide a basis for investigating the feedbacks, impacts, and sea-level changes associated with dynamic ice sheets and for quantifying the uncertainty in ice-sheet-sourced global sea-level change.

J	Lindblom, L; Cutler, C				Lindblom, Lee; Cutler, Curt			Model waveform accuracy requirements for the Allen chi(2) discriminator	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								This paper derives accuracy standards for model gravitational waveforms required to ensure proper use of the Allen chi(2) discriminator in gravitational wave data analysis. These standards are different from previously established requirements for detection and waveform parameter measurement based on signal-to-noise optimization. We present convenient formulas for evaluating and interpreting the contribution of model errors to measured values of this chi(2) statistic. The new accuracy standards derived here are needed to ensure the reliability of measured values of the Allen chi(2) statistic, both in their traditional role as vetoes and in their current role as elements in evaluating the significance of candidate detections.

THE HIGH-RESOLUTION INFRARED SPECTRUM OF HCl+	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						ISM: molecules; methods: laboratory: molecular; molecular data; techniques: spectroscopic	INTERSTELLAR CHLORONIUM; LINE CATALOG; SUBMILLIMETER; MILLIMETER	The chloroniumyl cation, HCl+, has been recently identified in space from Herschel's spectra. A joint analysis of extensive vis-UV spectroscopy emission data together with a few high-resolution and high-accuracy millimeter-wave data provided the necessary rest frequencies to support the astronomical identification. Nevertheless, the analysis did not include any infrared (IR) vibration-rotation data. Furthermore, with the end of the Herschel mission, IR observations from the ground may be one of the few available means to further study this ion in space.

IC 3639-A NEW BONA FIDE COMPTON-THICK AGN UNVEILED BY NuSTAR	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert; techniques: spectroscopic; X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: individual (IC 3639)	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; X-RAY-EMISSION; SUBARCSECOND MIDINFRARED VIEW; K-ALPHA EMISSION; XMM-NEWTON; MU-M; EXTREME ABSORPTION; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; IRON LINES; BLACK-HOLE	We analyze high-quality NuSTAR observations of the local (z = 0.011) Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 3639, in conjunction with archival Suzaku and Chandra data. This provides the first broadband X-ray spectral analysis of the source, spanning nearly two decades in energy (0.5-30 keV). Previous X-ray observations of the source below 10 keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration on the basis of a pronounced iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray energy coverage of NuSTAR, together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing models, enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of the source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an obscuring column in excess of 3.6 x 10(24) cm(-2), unconstrained at the upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of log(10) (L2-10keV[erg s(-1)] = 43.4(-1.1)(+0.6) to 90% confidence, almost 400 times the observed flux, and consistent with various multiwavelength diagnostics. Such a high ratio of intrinsic to observed flux, in addition to an Fe-K alpha fluorescence line equivalent width exceeding 2 keV, is extreme among known bona fide CTK AGNs, which we suggest are both due to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639. Our study demonstrates that broadband spectroscopic modeling with NuSTAR enables large corrections for obscuration to be carried out robustly and emphasizes the need for improved modeling of AGN tori showing intense iron fluorescence.

NEAR-INFRARED POLARIMETRY AND THE NON-UNIFORM ENVELOPE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxy: disk; ISM: individual objects (L1544); ISM: magnetic fields; magnetic fields; polarization; techniques: polarimetric	POLARIZATION SURVEY GPIPS; CLERK MAXWELL TELESCOPE; OH-ZEEMAN OBSERVATIONS; MOLECULAR CLOUD CORES; STAR-FORMATION; DARK CLOUDS; AMBIPOLAR-DIFFUSION; DENSE CORES; INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS; PRESTELLAR CORES	The magnetic field (B-field) of the starless dark cloud L1544 has been studied using near-infrared (NIR) background starlight polarimetry (BSP) and archival data in order to characterize the properties of the plane-of-sky B-field. NIR linear polarization measurements of over 1700 stars were obtained in the H band and 201 of these were also measured in the K band. The NIR BSP properties are correlated with reddening, as traced using the Rayleigh-Jeans color excess (H-M) method, and with thermal dust emission from the L1544 cloud and envelope seen in Herschel maps. The NIR polarization position angles change at the location of the cloud and exhibit their lowest dispersion there, offering strong evidence that NIR polarization traces the plane-of-sky B-field of L1544. In this paper, the uniformity of the plane-of-sky B-field in the envelope region of L1544 is quantitatively assessed. This allows evaluation of the approach of assuming uniform field geometry when measuring relative mass-to-flux ratios in the cloud envelope and core based on averaging of the radio Zeeman observations in the envelope, as done by Crutcher et al. In L1544, the NIR BSP shows the envelope B-field to be significantly non-uniform and likely not suitable for averaging Zeeman properties without treating intrinsic variations. Deeper analyses of the NIR BSP and related data sets, including estimates of the B-field strength and testing how it varies with position and gas density, are the subjects of later papers in this series.

HERSCHEL OBSERVATIONS AND UPDATED SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS OF FIVE SUNLIKE STARS WITH DEBRIS DISKS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; infrared: planetary systems; stars: individual (eta Cru, HD 33636, HD 50554, HD 52265)	SPITZER INFRARED SPECTROGRAPH; COLLISIONAL CASCADES; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; EPSILON-ERIDANI; KUIPER-BELT; DUST; PLANET; SIZE; CATALOG; HUBBLE	Observations from the Herschel Space Observatory have more than doubled the number of wide debris disks orbiting Sunlike stars to include over 30 systems with R > 100 AU. Here we present new Herschel PACS and re-analyzed Spitzer MIPS photometry of five Sunlike stars with wide debris disks, from Kuiper belt size to R > 150 AU. The disk surrounding HD 105211 is well resolved, with an angular extent of >14" along the major axis, and the disks of HD 33636, HD 50554, and HD 52265 are extended beyond the PACS PSF size (50% of energy enclosed within radius 4.23"). HD 105211 also has a 24 mu m infrared excess that was previously overlooked because of a poorly constrained photospheric model. Archival Spitzer IRS observations indicate that the disks have small grains of minimum radius a(min) similar to 3 mu m, although the a(min) is larger than the radiation pressure blowout size in all systems. If modeled as single-temperature blackbodies, the disk temperatures would all be <60 K. Our radiative transfer models predict actual disk radii approximately twice the radius of model blackbody disks. We find that the Herschel photometry traces dust near the source population of planetesimals. The disk luminosities are in the range 2 x 10(-5) <= L/L-circle dot <= 2 x 10(-4) , consistent with collisions in icy planetesimal belts stirred by Pluto-size dwarf planets.

These lines are important coolants of both the neutral and the ionized medium, and probe multiple phases of the ISM. In the framework of the halo model, we compute predictions of the three-dimensional power spectra for two different surveys, showing that they have the required sensitivity to detect cross-power spectra between the [C II] line and both the [O I] line and the [N II] lines with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The importance of cross-correlating multiple lines with the intensity mapping technique is twofold. On the one hand, we will have multiple probes of the different phases of the ISM, which is key to understanding the interplay between energetic sources, and the gas and dust at high redshift. This kind of study will be useful for a next-generation space observatory such as the NASA Far-IR Surveyor, which will probe the global star formation and the ISM of galaxies from the peak of star formation to the epoch of reionization. On the other hand, emission lines from external galaxies are an important foreground when measuring spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background spectrum with future space-based experiments like PIXIE; measuring fluctuations in the intensity mapping regime will help constrain the mean amplitude of these lines, and will allow us to better handle this important foreground.

II SNe are detected even two decades after discovery (SN 1974E, 1979C, 1980K, 1986J, and 1993J). Warm dust luminosity, temperature, and a lower limit on mass are obtained by fitting the two IRAC bands, assuming an optically thin dust shell. We derive warm dust masses between 10(-6) and 10(-2) M-circle dot and dust color temperatures between 200 and 1280 K. This observed warm dust could be pre-existing or newly created, but in either case represents a lower limit to the dust mass because cooler dust may be present. We present three case studies of extreme SNe.. SN 2011ja (II-P) was over-luminous ([4.5] = -15.6 mag) at 900 days post explosion with increasing hot dust mass, suggesting either an episode of dust formation or intensifying circumstellar material (CSM) interactions heating up pre-existing dust. SN 2014bi (II-P) showed a factor of 10 decrease in dust mass over one month, suggesting either dust destruction or reduced dust heating. The IR luminosity of SN 2014C (Ib) stayed. constant over 800 days, possibly due to strong CSM interaction with an. H-rich shell, which is rare among stripped-envelope SNe. The observations suggest that this CSM shell originated from an LBV-like eruption roughly 100 years pre-explosion. The observed diversity demonstrates the power of mid-IR observations of a large sample of SNe.

During three separate campaigns, we obtained Herschel data for 24 stars at 70, 100, and 160 mu m. We chose stars that were already known or suspected to have circumstellar dust based on excess infrared (IR) emission previously measured with the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) or Spitzer and used Herschel to examine long-wavelength properties of the dust. Fifteen stars were found to be uncontaminated by background sources and possess IR emission most likely due to a circumstellar debris disk. We analyzed the properties of these debris disks to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for dust production and removal. Seven targets were spatially resolved in the Herschel images. Based on fits to their spectral energy distributions, nine disks appear to have two temperature components. Of these nine, in three cases, the warmer dust component is likely the result of a transient process rather than a steady-state collisional cascade. The dust belts at four stars are likely stirred by an unseen planet and merit further investigation.

DISK-WIND CONNECTION DURING THE HEARTBEATS OF GRS 1915+105	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; instabilities; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual (GRS 1915+105)	DOMINATED ACCRETION DISKS; BLACK-HOLE SPIN; TIMING-EXPLORER OBSERVATIONS; X-RAY BINARIES; RADIATION PRESSURE; UNIFIED MODEL; REFLECTION; INSTABILITY; SPECTRA; MASS	Disk and wind signatures are seen in the soft state of Galactic black holes, while the jet is seen in the hard state. Here we study the disk-wind connection in the rho class of variability in GRS 1915+105 using a joint NuSTAR-Chandra observation. The source shows 50 s limit cycle oscillations. By including new information provided by the reflection spectrum. and using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we find that the change in the inner disk inferred from the blackbody emission is not matched by reflection measurements. The latter is almost constant, independent of the continuum model. The two radii are comparable only if the disk temperature color correction factor changes, an effect that could be due to the changing opacity of the disk caused by changes in metal abundances. The disk inclination is similar to that inferred from the jet axis, and oscillates by similar to 10 degrees. The simultaneous Chandra data show the presence of two wind components with velocities between 500 and 5000 km s(-1), and possibly two more with velocities reaching 20,000 km s(-1) (similar to 0.06 c). The column densities are similar to 5 x 10(22) cm(-2). An upper limit to the wind response time of 2 s is measured, implying a launch radius of < 6 x 10(10) cm. The changes in wind velocity and absorbed flux require the geometry of the wind to change during the oscillations, constraining the wind to be launched from a distance of 290-1300 r(g) from the black hole. Both data sets support fundamental model predictions in which a bulge originates in the inner disk and moves outward as the instability progresses.	[Zoghbi, Abderahmen; Miller, J.

Keck Array Bicep2 Collaborations	BICEP2/KECK ARRAY VIII: MEASUREMENT OF GRAVITATIONAL LENSING FROM LARGE-SCALE B-MODE POLARIZATION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; gravitational lensing: weak; polarization	MICROWAVE; CMB; RECONSTRUCTION; MASS	We present measurements of polarization lensing using the 150 GHz maps, which include all data taken by the BICEP2 and Keck Array Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). Despite their modest angular resolution (similar to 0 degrees.5), the excellent sensitivity (similar to 3 mu K-arcmin) of these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the lensing potential using only information at larger angular scales (l <= 700). From the auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential, we measure an amplitude of the spectrum to be A(L)(phi phi) = 1.15 +/- 0.36 (Planck CDM prediction corresponds to A(L)(phi phi) = 1) and reject the no-lensing hypothesis at 5.8s, which is the highest significance achieved to date using an EB lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of the reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields A(L)(phi phi) = 1.13 +/- 0.20. These direct measurements of A(L)(phi phi) are consistent with the CDM cosmology and with that derived from the previously reported BK14 B-mode auto-spectrum (A(L)(BB) = 1.20 +/- 0.17). We perform a series of null tests and consistency checks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are insensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the B modes previously reported by BICEP / Keck at intermediate angular scales (150 less than or similar to l less than or similar to 350) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The good agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing reconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any alternative cosmological sources of B modes at these angular scales.

Timing of optical maturation of recently exposed material on Ceres	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Ceres; maturation; crater; weathering; age	CASSINI-VIMS; SURFACE; CHRONOLOGY; RAY	On Ceres, multispectral imaging data from the Dawn spacecraft show a distinct bluish characteristic for recently exposed material from the subsurface in, for example, crater ejecta. Ejecta blankets of presumably old craters show a more reddish spectrum. We selected areas in which fresh material from the Cerean subsurface was exposed at a specific time in the past, and no later geologic process is expected to have changed its surface composition or its cratering record. For each area, we determined two color ratios and the crater retention age. The measured color ratios show an exponential diminishment of the bluish characteristic over time. Although the cause of the color change remains uncertain, the time-dependent change in spectral properties is evident, which could help identify the process.

High-accuracy measurements of total column water vapor from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						OCO-2; water vapor; TCWV; remote sensing; hyperspectral; near-infrared	RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER; RETRIEVAL; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; MODIS; OCO-2; SPECTROMETER; PERFORMANCE; HUMIDITY; NETWORK	Accurate knowledge of the distribution of water vapor in Earth's atmosphere is of critical importance to both weather and climate studies. Here we report on measurements of total column water vapor (TCWV) from hyperspectral observations of near-infrared reflected sunlight over land and ocean surfaces from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). These measurements are an ancillary product of the retrieval algorithm used to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, with information coming from three highly resolved spectral bands. Comparisons to high-accuracy validation data, including ground-based GPS and microwave radiometer data, demonstrate that OCO-2 TCWV measurements have maximum root-mean-square deviations of 0.9-1.3mm. Our results indicate that OCO-2 is the first space-based sensor to accurately and precisely measure the two most important greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide, at high spatial resolution (1.3 x 2.3 km(2)) and that OCO-2 TCWV measurements may be useful in improving numerical weather predictions and reanalysis products.

Cryogenic flow features on Ceres: Implications for crater-related cryovolcanism	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						cryovolcanism; impact melt; dwarf planet Ceres; subsurface materials; flow features; coefficient of friction	LIQUID-WATER; ORIGIN; AVALANCHES; GANYMEDE; MISSION; STATE; VESTA	Craters on Ceres, such as Haulani, Kupalo, Ikapati, and Occator show postimpact modification by the deposition of extended plains material with pits, multiple lobate flows, and widely dispersed deposits that form a diffuse veneer on the preexisting surface. Bright material units in these features have a negative spectral slope in the visible range, making it appear bluish with respect to the grey-toned overall surface of Ceres. We calculate the drop height-to-runout length ratio of several flow features and obtain a coefficient of friction of<0.1: The results imply higher flow efficiency for flow features on Ceres than for similar features on other planetary bodies with similar gravity, suggesting low-viscosity material. The special association of flow features with impact craters could either point to an impact melt origin or to an exogenic triggering of cryovolcanic processes.

Dissolution of nontronite in chloride brines and implications for the aqueous history of Mars	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Mars; Nontronite; Clay minerals; Dissolution; Brines; Habitability; Chlorides	KAOLINITE DISSOLUTION; MONTMORILLONITE DISSOLUTION; PRECIPITATION KINETICS; SILICATE MINERALS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; PH; WATER; DEPENDENCE; PRESSURE; RATES	Increasing evidence suggests the presence of recent liquid water, including brines, on Mars. Brines have therefore likely impacted clay minerals such as the Fe-rich mineral nontronite found in martian ancient terrains. To interpret these interactions, we conducted batch experiments to measure the apparent dissolution rate constant of nontronite at 25.0 degrees C at activities of water (aH(2)O) of 1.00 (0.01 M CaCl2 or NaCl), 0.75 (saturated NaCl or 3.00 mol kg x 1 CaCl2), and 0.50 (5.00 mol kg x 1 CaCl2). Experiments at aH(2)O = 1.00 (0.01 M CaCl2) were also conducted at 4.0 C, 25.0 C, and 45.0 degrees C to measure an apparent activation energy for the dissolution of nontronite. Apparent dissolution rate constants at 25.0 degrees C in CaCl2-containing solutions decrease with decreasing activity of water as follows: 1.18 x 10(-12) +/- 9 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 1.00) > 2.36 x 10(-13) +/- 3.1 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 0.75) > 2.05 x 10(-14) +/- 2.9 x 10(-15) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 0.50). Similar results were observed at 25.0 degrees C in NaCl-containing solutions: 1.89 x 10(-12) +/- 1 x 10(-13) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 1.00) > 1.98 x 10(-13) +/- 2.3 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 0.75). This decrease in apparent dissolution rate constants with decreasing activity of water follows a relationship of the form: log k(diss) = 3.70 +/- 0.20 x aH(2)O x 15.49, where k(diss) is the apparent dissolution rate constant, and aH(2)O is the activity of water. The slope of this relationship (3.70 x 0.20) is within uncertainty of that of other minerals where the relationship between dissolution rates and activity of water has been tested, including forsteritic olivine (log R = 3.27 +/- 0.91 x aH(2)O x 11.00) (Olsen et al., 2015) and jarosite (log R = 3.85 +/- 0.43 x aH(2)O-12.84) (Dixon et al., 2015), where R is the mineral dissolution rate. This result allows prediction of mineral dissolution as a function of activity of water and suggests that with decreasing activity of water, mineral dissolution will decrease due to the role of water as a ligand in the reaction. Apparent dissolution rate constants in the dilute NaCl solution (1.89 x 10(-12) +/- 1 x 10(-13) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1)) are slightly greater than those in the dilute CaCl2 solutions (1.18 x 10(-12) +/- 9 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1)). We attribute this effect to the exchange of Na with Ca in the nontronite interlayer. An apparent activation energy of 54.6 +/- 1.0 kJ/mol was calculated from apparent dissolution rate constants in dilute CaCl2-containing solutions at temperatures of 4.0 degrees C, 25.0 degrees C, and 45.0 C: 2.33 x 10(-13) +/- 1.3 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (4.0 degrees C), 1.18 x 10(-12) +/- 9 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (25.0 degrees C), and 4.98 x 10(-12) +/- 3.8 x 10(-13) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (45.0 degrees C). The greatly decreased dissolution of nontronite in brines and at low temperatures suggests that any martian nontronite found to be perceptibly weathered may have experienced very long periods of water-rock interaction with brines at the low temperatures prevalent on Mars, with important implications for the paleoclimate and long-term potential habitability of Mars.

A new surface-based multi frequency (Ku-, X- and C-bands) microwave scatterometer system is used quasi-coincident with in situ geophysical snow measurements. A multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate the total co-polarized backscatter coefficient for two snow temperature conditions. The model provides the surface and volume scattering contributions for each snow layer, as well as the frequency-dependent penetration depth. These results aid interpretation of observed backscatter. Joint use of Ku-, X- and C-band microwaves provide an enhanced understanding of diverse variations in geophysical, thermodynamic and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. Our results indicate that the effect of dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers is the dominant factor affecting microwave penetration and backscatter from all three frequencies. The observed and modeled C band backscatter shows good agreement, followed by X- and Ku-bands, at both snow temperature conditions. Microwave backscatter shows greater sensitivity to variations in plot-scale surface roughness, for all three frequencies. Additionally, Ku-band wavelength exhibits greater sensitivity to snow grain radius, over X-, and C bands. Our results demonstrate the future potential of a multi-frequency approach towards the development of snow thickness and snow water equivalent algorithms on first-year sea ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Dimensionless spectral vegetation index values derived from satellite imagery are commonly used to derive crop biomass. However, the highly empirical nature of spectrally derived biomass estimates requires frequent and costly calibration with manually collected ground data. Recently, low cost, autonomously operating terrestrial laser scanners (ATLSs) have become available for near-surface applications. In contrast to the dimensionless nature of spectral index values, autonomous light detection and ranging (lidar) technology measures physical vegetation structure by recording the x, y, z coordinates of canopy components at very high spatial (<10 cm), and temporal (<2 days) resolution. The objective of this study was to assess the suitability of an ATLS to i) monitor crop growth dynamics and ii) calibrate satellite imagery for estimating crop biomass. Wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) growth was monitored by acquiring hypertemporal (every 28 h for a full growing season) ATLS data at three different field sites across a range of experimentally manipulated crop growth conditions. The ATLS-derived crop height explained nearly three-quarters of the variability in destructively sampled wheat biomass (r(2) = 0.74, RMSE = 514.20 kg ha(-1)), showing a slightly stronger correlation to crop biomass than did leaf area index (LAI) measurements collected in the field using a LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 546 kg ha(-1)). Satellite-based crop biomass estimates calibrated with ATLS data captured the variability in wheat biomass throughout a farm field with a biomass error of 730.96 and 727.60 kg ha(-1) (RMSE) during the jointing (Development stage: Zadoks 37) and heading (Development stage: Zadoks 50) growth stages, respectively. These findings suggest that the hypertemporal lidar information provided via ATLS technology could constitute a major step forward in operational monitoring and mapping of crop biomass.

ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						DORIS; GPS; South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA); Jason-2 satellite; Maule earthquake	ORBIT DETERMINATION; CORRECTIVE MODEL; SEA-LEVEL; GPS DATA; NETWORK; SERIES; TOPEX; ERROR	We analyzed time series of daily DORIS and GPS station coordinate estimates derived from Precise Point Positioning (PPP). The DORIS coordinates were estimated using Jason-2 precise orbits based on GPS data only, implying that the station positions from the two techniques are expressed in the same GPS-based terrestrial reference frame. Comparisons of 3-D vectors of such co-located stations show systematic biases in position around South America when compared to local geodetic ties. We conclude that these results could be explained by a sensitivity of the Jason-2/DORIS oscillator to radiation when the satellite passes over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The effect for Jason-2 manifests mainly as an offset in station coordinates, though there is also evidence of a drift at the start of the mission that diminishes in time. This contrasts with the experience on Jason-1, wherein large, persistent drifts were observed for stations in this same (SAA) region. The spurious drift is much (similar to 90%) smaller for Jason-2, which may be attributable to the steps taken prior to launch to harden the oscillator. Analysis of DORIS Doppler residuals may indicate some small degradation after 2009 for these stations. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scalar excursions in large-eddy simulations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Large eddy simulation; Numerical methods; Numerical model error; Scalar mixing; Turbulent mixing	ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; FINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEMES; TURBULENT CHANNEL FLOW; STRETCHED-VORTEX MODEL; SUBGRID-STRESS MODEL; NUMERICAL ERRORS; UPSTREAM INTERPOLATION; INCOMPRESSIBLE-FLOW; MIXING TRANSITION; DISSIPATION	The range of values of scalar fields in turbulent flows is bounded by their boundary values, for passive scalars, and by a combination of boundary values, reaction rates, phase changes, etc., for active scalars. The current investigation focuses on the local conservation of passive scalar concentration fields and the ability of the large-eddy simulation (LES) method to observe the boundedness of passive scalar concentrations. In practice, as a result of numerical artifacts, this fundamental constraint is often violated with scalars exhibiting unphysical excursions. The present study characterizes passive-scalar excursions in LES of a shear flow and examines methods for diagnosis and assesment of the problem. The analysis of scalar-excursion statistics provides support of the main hypothesis of the current study that unphysical scalar excursions in LES result from dispersive errors of the convection-term discretization where the subgrid-scale model (SGS) provides insufficient dissipation to produce a sufficiently smooth scalar field. In the LES runs three parameters are varied: the discretization of the convection terms, the SGS model, and grid resolution. Unphysical scalar excursions decrease as the order of accuracy of non-dissipative schemes is increased, but the improvement rate decreases with increasing order of accuracy. Two SGS models are examined, the stretched-vortex and a constant-coefficient Smagorinsky. Scalar excursions strongly depend on the SGS model. The excursions are significantly reduced when the characteristic SGS scale is set to double the grid spacing in runs with the stretched-vortex model. The maximum excursion and volume fraction of excursions outside boundary values show opposite trends with respect to resolution. The maximum unphysical excursions increase as resolution increases, whereas the volume fraction decreases. The reason for the increase in the maximum excursion is statistical and traceable to the number of grid points (sample size) which increases with resolution. In contrast, the volume fraction of unphysical excursions decreases with resolution because the SGS models explored perform better at higher grid resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH4 are continuing to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH4 sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (similar to biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models, inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations). For the 2003-2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by top-down inversions at 558 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 540-568. About 60% of global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50-65 %). Since 2010, the bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP8.5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up approaches suggest larger global emissions (736 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 596-884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources. Considering the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, it is likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions. Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions (similar to 64% of the global budget, <30 degrees N) as compared to mid (similar to 32 %, 30-60 degrees N) and high northern latitudes (similar to 4 %, 60-90 degrees N). Top-down inversions consistently infer lower emissions in China (similar to 58 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 51-72, -14 %) and higher emissions in Africa (86 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 73-108, + 19 %) than bottom-up values used as prior estimates. Overall, uncertainties for anthropogenic emissions appear smaller than those from natural sources, and the uncertainties on source categories appear larger for top-down inversions than for bottom-up inventories and models. The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show that the wetland extent could contribute 30-40% on the estimated range for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models integrated in top-down inversions.

Here we present a lensless digital holographic microscope approach that provides roughly 1.5 micron resolution in a compact, robust package suitable for remote deployment. High resolution is achieved by generating high numerical-aperture input beams with radial gradient-index rod lenses. The ability to detect and track prokaryotes was explored using bacterial strains of two different sizes. In the larger strain, a variety of motions were seen, while the smaller strain was used to demonstrate a detection capability down to micron scales.

U.). The image of the disk recorded in the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals three dark concentric rings that indicate the presence of dust depleted gaps at about 60, 100, and 160 A. U. from the central star. The maps of the (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, and (CO)-O-18 J = 2 - 1 emission do not show such structures but reveal a change in the slope of the radial intensity profile across the positions of the dark rings in the continuum image. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for the disk emission, we find that the density of CO molecules is reduced inside the middle and outer dust gaps. However, in the inner ring there is no evidence of CO depletion. From the measurements of the dust and gas densities, we deduce that the gas-to-dust ratio varies across the disk and, in particular, it increases by at least a factor 5 within the inner dust gap compared to adjacent regions of the disk. The depletion of both dust and gas suggests that the middle and outer rings could be due to the gravitational torque exerted by two Saturn-mass planets orbiting at 100 and 160 A. U. from the star. On the other hand, the inner dust gap could result from dust accumulation at the edge of a magnetorotational instability dead zone, or from dust opacity variations at the edge of the CO frost line. Observations of the dust emission at higher angular resolution and of molecules that probe dense gas are required to establish more precisely the origins of the dark rings observed in the HD 163296 disk.

EVIDENCE FROM SOFIA IMAGING OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBON FORMATION ALONG A RECENT OUTFLOW IN NGC 7027	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dust, extinction; ISM: abundances; ISM: jets and outflows; photon-dominated region (PDR); planetary nebulae: individual (NGC 7027)	PLANETARY-NEBULA NGC-7027; INFRARED-EMISSION; INTERSTELLAR SHOCKS; MOLECULAR ENVELOPE; GRAIN DESTRUCTION; SPACE-TELESCOPE; DUST; EXCITATION; MODEL; MASS	We report spatially resolved (FWHM similar to 3.'' 8-4.'' 6) mid-IR imaging observations of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027 taken with the 2.5 m telescope on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Images of NGC 7027 were acquired at 6.3, 6.6, 11.1, 19.7, 24.2, 33.6, and 37.1 mu m using the Faint Object Infrared Camera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST). The observations reveal emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and warm dust (T-D similar to 90 K) from the illuminated inner edge of the molecular envelope surrounding the ionized gas and central star. The DustEM code was used to fit the spectral energy distribution of fluxes obtained by FORCAST and the archival infrared spectrum of NGC 7027 acquired by the Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Best-fit dust models provide a total dust mass of 5.8(-2.6)(+2.3) x 10(-3) M-circle dot, where carbonaceous large (a = 1.5 mu m) and very small (a similar to 12 angstrom) grains, and PAHs (3.1 angstrom < a < 12 angstrom) compose 96.5, 2.2, and 1.3% of the dust by mass, respectively. The 37 mu m optical depth map shows minima in the dust column density at regions in the envelope that are coincident with a previously identified collimated outflow from the central star. The optical depth minima are also spatially coincident with enhancements in the 6.2 mu m PAH feature, which is derived from the 6.3 and 6.6 mu m maps. We interpret the spatial anti-correlation of the dust optical depth and PAH 6.2 mu m feature strength and their alignment with the outflow from the central star as evidence of dust processing and rapid PAH formation via grain-grain collisions in the post-shock environment of the dense (n(H) similar to 10(5) cm(-3)) photo-dissociation region and molecular envelope.

ASSOCIATION OF He-3-RICH SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES WITH LARGE-SCALE CORONAL WAVES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						acceleration of particles; shock waves; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: flares; Sun: particle emission; waves	MAGNETIC-FIELD CONNECTION; ELECTRON EVENTS; ISOTOPE SPECTROMETER; MASS EJECTIONS; ALPHA MONITOR; EUV WAVES; ACCELERATION; PLASMA; STEREO; PROTON	Small, He-3-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been commonly associated with extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets and narrow coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are believed to be the signatures of magnetic reconnection, involving field lines open to interplanetary space. The elemental and isotopic fractionation in these events are thought to be caused by processes confined to the flare sites. In this study, we identify 32 He-3-rich SEP events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer, near the Earth, during the solar minimum period 2007-2010, and we examine their solar sources with the high resolution Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) EUV images. Leading the Earth, STEREO-A has provided, for the first time, a direct view on He-3-rich flares, which are generally located on the Sun's western hemisphere. Surprisingly, we find that about half of the He-3-rich SEP events in this survey are associated with large-scale EUV coronal waves. An examination of the wave front propagation, the source-flare distribution, and the coronal magnetic field connections suggests that the EUV waves may affect the injection of He-3-rich SEPs into interplanetary space.

Here, we describe a search for radio transients in the Galactic center, using over 200 hr of archival data from the Very Large Array at 5. and. 8.4 GHz. Every observation of Sgr. A* from 1985 to 2005 has been searched using an automated processing and detection pipeline sensitive to transients with timescales between 30 s and 5 minutes with a typical detection threshold of similar to 100 mJy. Eight possible candidates pass tests to filter false-positives from radio-frequency interference, calibration errors, and imaging artifacts. Two events are identified as promising candidates based on the smoothness of their light curves. Despite the high quality of their light curves, these detections remain suspect due to evidence of incomplete subtraction of the complex structure in the Galactic center, and apparent contingency of one detection on reduction routines. Events of this intensity (similar to 100 mJy) and duration (similar to 100 s) are not obviously associated with known astrophysical sources, and no counterparts are found in data at other wavelengths. We consider potential sources, including Galactic center pulsars, dwarf stars, sources like GCRT. J1745-3009, and bursts from X-ray binaries. None can fully explain the observed transients, suggesting either a new astrophysical source or a subtle imaging artifact. More sensitive multiwavelength studies are necessary to characterize these events, which, if real, occur with a rate of 14(-12)(+32) hr(-1)deg(-2) in the Galactic center.

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric dynamics, detecting its global acoustic oscillations, and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present the first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements. Beyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see a star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which consists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude nu(max) and the mean frequency separation between mode overtones Delta nu, is surprising as the nu(max) measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the accepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu(max,circle dot) = 3100 mu Hz, the asteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear larger by 13.8 +/- 5.8% and 4.3 +/- 1.9%, respectively. The higher nu(max) is caused by a combination of the value of nu(max,circle dot), being larger at the time of observations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10 mu Hz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being 10 times larger than VIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we model 10 overtones for degrees l = 0, 1, 2. We compare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON velocity measurements. The individual frequencies, widths, and amplitudes mostly match those from VIRGO and BiSON within 1 sigma, except for the few peaks with the lowest S/N.

Harmonisation and diagnostics of MIPAS ESA CH4 and N2O profiles using data assimilation	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; CHEMICAL OBSERVATIONS; 4D-VAR ASSIMILATION; NITROUS-OXIDE; METHANE; VALIDATION; MODEL; REANALYSIS; SYSTEM; TRACER	This paper discusses assimilation experiments of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) profiles retrieved from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). Here we focus on data versions 6 and 7 provided by the ESA processor. These data sets have been assimilated by the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). The CH4 and N2O retrieved profiles can oscillate, especially in the tropical lower stratosphere. Using the averaging kernels of the observations and a background error covariance matrix, which has previously been calibrated, allows the system to partly remedy this issue and provide assimilated fields that are more regular vertically. In general, there is a good agreement between the BASCOE analyses and independent observations from ACE-FTS (CH4 and N2O) and MLS (N2O), demonstrating the general good quality of CH4 and N2O retrievals provided by MIPAS ESA. Nevertheless, this study also identifies two issues in these data sets. First, time series of the observations show unexpected discontinuities due to an abrupt change in the gain of MIPAS band B, generally occurring after the instrument decontamination. Since the calibration is performed weekly, the abrupt change in the gain affects the measurements until the subsequent calibration is performed. Second, the correlations between BASCOE analyses and independent observations are poor in the lower stratosphere, especially in the tropics, probably due to the presence of outliers in the assimilated data. In this region, we recommend using MIPAS CH4 and N2O retrievals with caution.

Methods to grow vertically aligned CNTs. directly on Ti substrates were developed. These cathodes can be treated post-growth at elevated temperatures under inert atmosphere which causes the surface-grown CNTs to become anchored to the substrate surface. These samples offer improvements in field emission properties over previously studied silicon (Si) substrate-based cathodes with no anchoring, displaying low threshold voltages, high field enhancement factors, and long operating lifetimes. Current densities of 25 mA cm(-2) were held for over 24 h with anchored samples at low electric fields (observed thresholds as low as 0.5 V mu m(-1)) and more current stability. Higher current densities of up to 150 mA cm(-2) could be reached with anchored samples, limited only by the experimental setup. In efforts to generate even more stable and reproducible field emission, a transfer process of CNTs from polished Si to Ti with copper (Cu) was developed (flipCNTs). These cathodes display extreme improvements over previous results, with observed thresholds as low as 0.2 V mu m(-1) and gamma-factors as high as 30 000. To demonstrate the utility of these robust cathodes, a flipCNT-based cathode was assembled into a fully functioning vacuum triode.

In this context, we demonstrate and certify the simultaneous storage and retrieval of two entangled photons inside a solid-state quantum memory and measure a temporal multimode capacity of ten modes. This is achieved by producing two polarization-entangled pairs from parametric down-conversion and mapping one photon of each pair onto a rare-earth-ion-doped (REID) crystal using the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. We develop a concept of indirect entanglement witnesses, which can be used as Schmidt number witnesses, and we use it to experimentally certify the presence of more than one entangled pair retrieved from the quantum memory. Our work puts forward REID-AFC as a platform compatible with temporal multiplexing of several entangled photon pairs along with a new entanglement certification method, useful for the characterization of multiplexed quantum memories.

Interannual variations of early winter Antarctic polar stratospheric cloud formation and nitric acid observed by CALIOP and MLS	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							HETEROGENEOUS FORMATION; SPECTROSCOPIC EVIDENCE; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; NAT PARTICLES; OZONE LOSS; ICE; TRIHYDRATE; DENITRIFICATION; NUCLEATION; IMPACT	We use satellite-borne measurements collected over the last decade (2006-2015) from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to investigate the nitric acid distribution and the properties of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in the early winter Antarctic vortex. Frequently, at the very start of the winter, we find that synoptic-scale depletion of HNO3 can be detected in the inner vortex before the first lidar detection of geophysically associated PSCs. The generation of "sub-visible" PSCs can be explained as arising from the development of a solid particle population with low number densities and large particle sizes. Assumed to be composed of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT), the sub-visible PSCs form at ambient temperatures well above the ice frost point, but also above the temperature at which supercooled ternary solution (STS) grows out of the background supercooled binary solution (SBS) distribution. The temperature regime of their formation, inferred from the simultaneous uptake of ambient HNO3 into NAT and their Lagrangian temperature histories, is at a depression of a few kelvin with respect to the NAT existence threshold, T-NAT. Therefore, their nucleation requires a considerable supersaturation of HNO3 over NAT, and is consistent with a recently described heterogeneous nucleation process on solid foreign nuclei immersed in liquid aerosol. We make a detailed investigation of the comparative limits of detection of PSCs and the resulting sequestration of HNO3 imposed by lidar, mid-infrared, and microwave techniques. We find that the temperature history of air parcels, in addition to the local ambient temperature, is an important factor in the relative frequency of formation of liquid/solid PSCs. We conclude that the initiation of NAT nucleation and the subsequent development of large NAT particles capable of sedimentation and denitrification in the early winter do not emanate from an ice-seeding process. Finally, we investigate the patterns of interannual variability and compare the relative formation frequency of liquid and solid PSCs in the Antarctic lower polar stratosphere using the results of a cluster analysis to synthesize the combined CALIOP and MLS measurements into a relatively small number of interrelated categories.

What are the greenhouse gas observing system requirements for reducing fundamental biogeochemical process uncertainty? Amazon wetland CH4 emissions as a case study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							METHANE EMISSIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; NORTH-AMERICA; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SENTINEL-5 PRECURSOR; NATURAL WETLANDS; CO2; MODEL; RETRIEVALS	Understanding the processes controlling terrestrial carbon fluxes is one of the grand challenges of climate science. Carbon cycle process controls are readily studied at local scales, but integrating local knowledge across extremely heterogeneous biota, landforms and climate space has proven to be extraordinarily challenging. Consequently, top-down or integral flux constraints at process-relevant scales are essential to reducing process uncertainty. Future satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes - such as CO2 and CH4 - could potentially provide the constraints needed to resolve biogeochemical process controls at the required scales. Our analysis is focused on Amazon wetland CH4 emissions, which amount to a scientifically crucial and methodologically challenging case study. We quantitatively derive the observing system (OS) requirements for testing wetland CH4 emission hypotheses at a process-relevant scale. To distinguish between hypothesized hydrological and carbon controls on Amazon wetland CH4 production, a satellite mission will need to resolve monthly CH4 fluxes at a similar to 333 km resolution and with a <= 10 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) flux precision. We simulate a range of low-earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) CH4 OS configurations to evaluate the ability of these approaches to meet the CH4 flux requirements. Conventional LEO and GEO missions resolve monthly similar to 333 km Amazon wetland fluxes at a 17.0 and 2.7 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) median uncertainty level. Improving LEO CH4 measurement precision by root 2 would only reduce the median CH4 flux uncertainty to 11.9 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). A GEO mission with targeted observing capability could resolve fluxes at a 2.0-2.4 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) median precision by increasing the observation density in high cloud-cover regions at the expense of other parts of the domain. We find that residual CH4 concentration biases can potentially reduce the similar to 5-fold flux CH4 precision advantage of a GEO mission to a similar to 2-fold advantage (relative to a LEO mission). For residual CH4 bias correlation lengths of 100 km, the GEO can nonetheless meet the <= 10 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) requirements for systematic biases <= 10 ppb.

Gridded National Inventory of US Methane Emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; GAS; RETRIEVALS; SYSTEM; FLUXES; STATE; GOSAT; OIL	We present a gridded inventory of US anthropogenic methane emissions with 0.1 degrees X 0.1 degrees spatial resolution, monthly temporal resolution, and detailed scale-dependent error characterization. The inventory is designed to be consistent with the 2016 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (GHGI) for 2012 The EPA inventory is available only as national totals for different source types. We use a wide range of databases at the state, county, local, and point source level to disaggregate the inventory and allocate the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions for individual source types. Results show large differences with the EDGAR v4.2 global gridded inventory commonly used as a priori estimate in inversions of atmospheric methane observations. We derive grid-dependent error statistics for individual source types from comparison with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) regional inventory for Northeast Texas. These error statistics are independently verified by comparison with the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement (CALGEM) grid-resolved emission inventory. Our gridded, time-resolved inventory provides an improved basis for inversion of atmospheric methane observations to estimate US methane emissions and interpret the results in terms of the underlying processes.

The dam is located on the Tigris river and is the biggest hydraulic structure in Iraq. From a geological point of view the dam foundation is poor due to a site geology formed by alternating strata of highly soluble materials including gypsum, anhydrite, marl and limestone. Here we present the first multi-sensor cumulative deformation map for the dam generated from space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements from the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed and the European sensor Sentinel-1a over the period 2014-2016 that we compare to an older dataset spanning 2004-2010 acquired with the European Envisat satellite. We found that deformation was rapid during 2004-2010, slowed in 2012-2014 and increased since August 2014 when grouting operations stopped due to the temporary capture of the dam by the self proclaimed Islamic State. We model the inferred deformation using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to solve for change in volume for simple tensile dislocations. Results from recent and historical geodetic datasets suggests that the volume dissolution rate remains constant when the equivalent volume of total concrete injected during re-grouting operations is included in the calculations.

A complete history of surface measurements in an area can help discriminate contributions from tectonic, hydrologic, and anthropogenic processes. In this study, we use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the active mountain front and adjacent coastal plain of southwestern Taiwan to generate time series of surface deformation from 1995 to 2001 and from 2005 to 2008 based on the InSAR small baseline method. The InSAR measurements agree well with LOS motions estimated from continuous GPS measurements of 3D displacements between 2006 and 2008. A significant range increase in line of sight (LOS) is dominated by land subsidence in the coastal area of Western and southwestern Taiwan. Subsidence rates vary with annual periods and are highly correlated with seasonal precipitation, which are likely associated with groundwater recharge and withdrawal. The long-term deformation is dominated by long-term tectonic loading in SW Taiwan during the interseismic period of the earthquake cycle, including elastic strain along or continuous creep on the active faults. Our results show the ability of InSAR to reveal spatiotemporal crustal deformation in western Taiwan with high spatial resolution and accuracy, which is potentially important for evaluating seismic hazards.

Pulsar Timing at the Deep Space Network	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Instrumentation; miscellaneous		The 70-m DSN's Deep Space Station antenna 14 (DSS-14) at Goldstone has recently been outfitted with instrumentation to enable pulsar searching and timing operation. Systems capable of similar operations are undergoing installation at DSS-63, and are planned for DSS-43. The Goldstone system is thefirst of these to become operational with a 640 MHz bandwidth stretching from 1325-1965 MHz. Initial results from the pulsar timing pipeline show short-term residuals of < 100 ns for pulsar B1937 + 21. Commissioning observations at DSS-14 to obtain a baseline set of time of arrival (TOA) measurements on several millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are currently underway.

Assessing the potential for passive radio sounding of Europa and Ganymede with RIME and REASON	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						RIME; REASON; Icy moon; Ice shell; JUICE; Jovian noise; Decametric emission	THWAITES GLACIER; ICE SHEETS; RADAR; WATER; SURFACE; BENEATH; OCEAN	Recent work has raised the potential for Jupiter's decametric radiation to be used as a source for passive radio sounding of its icy moons. Two radar sounding instruments, the Radar for Icy Moon Exploration (RIME) and the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON) have been selected for ESA and NASA missions to Ganymede and Europa. Here, we revisit the projected performance of the passive sounding concept and assess the potential for its implementation as an additional mode for RIME and REASON. We find that the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of passive sounding can approach or exceed that of active sounding in a noisy sub-Jovian environment, but that active sounding achieves a greater SNR in the presence of quiescent noise and outperforms passive sounding in terms of clutter. We also compare the performance of passive sounding at the 9 MHz HF center frequency of RIME and REASON to other frequencies within the Jovian decametric band. We conclude that the addition of a passive sounding mode on RIME or REASON stands to enhance their science return by enabling sub-Jovian HF sounding in the presence of decametric noise, but that there is not a compelling case for implementation at a different frequency.

Marsh canopy structure changes and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						NASA UAVSAR; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR); Deepwater Horizon oil spill; Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD); Marsh change maps	POLARIMETRIC RADAR; BARATARIA BAY; LOUISIANA; IMPACTS; DIEBACK	Marsh canopy structure was mapped yearly from 2009 to 2012 in the Barataria Bay, Louisiana coastal region that was impacted by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Based on the previously demonstrated capability of NASA's UAVSAR polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) image data to map Spartina alterniflora marsh canopy structure, structure maps combining the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (IAD, orientation) were constructed for yearly intervals that were directly relatable to the 2010 LAI-LAD classification. The yearly LAI-LAD and LAI difference maps were used to investigate causes for the previously revealed dramatic change in marsh structure from prespill (2009) to postspill (2010, spill cessation), and the occurrence of structure features that exhibited abnormal spatial and temporal patterns. Water level and salinity records showed that freshwater releases used to keep the oil offshore did not cause the rapid growth from 2009 to 2010 in marsh surrounding the inner Bay. Photointerpretation of optical image data determined that interior marsh patches exhibiting rapid change were caused by burns and burn recovery, and that the pattern of 2010 to 2011 1AI decreases in backshore marsh and extending along some tidal channels into the interior marsh were not associated with burns. Instead, the majority of 2010 to 2011 shoreline features aligned with vectors displaying the severity of 2010 shoreline oiling from the DWH spill. Although the association is not conclusive of a causal oil impact, the coexistent pattern is a significant discovery. PoISAR marsh structure mapping provided a unique perspective of marsh biophysical status that enhanced detection of change and monitoring of trends important to management effectiveness.

On the Charge Collection Efficiency of the PERCIVAL Detector	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Instrumentation for FEL; Solid state detectors; X-ray detectors	PETRA III	The PERCIVAL soft X-ray imager is being developed by DESY, RAL, Elettra, DLS, and PAL to address the challenges at high brilliance Light Sources such as new-generation Synchrotrons and Free Electron Lasers. Typical requirements for detector systems at these sources are high frame rates, large dynamic range, single-photon counting capability with low probability of false positives, high quantum efficiency, and (multi)-mega-pixel arrangements. PERCIVAL is a monolithic active pixel sensor, based on CMOS technology. It is designed for the soft X-ray regime and, therefore, it is post-processed in order to achieve high quantum efficiency in its primary energy range (250 eV to 1 keV). This work will report on the latest experimental results on charge collection efficiency obtained for multiple back-side-illuminated test sensors during two campaigns, at the P04 beam-line at PETRA III, and the CiPo beam-line at Elettra, spanning most of the primary energy range as well as testing the performance for photon-energies below 250 eV. In addition, XPS surface analysis was used to cross-check the obtained results.	[Correa, J.; Marras, A.; Wunderer, C.

The NuSTAR view of the non-thermal emission from PSR J0437-4715	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: neutron; pulsars: individual: PSR 0437-4715	MILLISECOND PULSAR J0437-4715; HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; EQUATION-OF-STATE; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; X-RAY OBSERVATIONS; NEUTRON-STAR; DENSE MATTER; RADIUS CONSTRAINTS; GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS; IMPROVED MASS	We present a hard X-ray Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observation of PSR J0437-4715, the nearest millisecond pulsar. The known pulsations at the apparent pulse period similar to 5.76 ms are observed with a significance of 3.7 sigma, at energies up to 20 keV above which the NuSTAR background dominates. We measure a photon index Gamma = 1.50 +/- 0.25 (90 per cent confidence) for the power-law fit to the non-thermal emission. It had been shown that spectral models with two or three thermal components fit the XMM-Newton spectrum of PSR J0437-4715, depending on the slope of the power-law component, and the amount of absorption of soft X-rays. The new constraint on the high-energy emission provided by NuSTAR removes ambiguities regarding the thermal components of the emission below 3 keV. We performed a simultaneous spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data to confirm that three thermal components and a power law are required to fit the 0.3-20 keV emission of PSR J0437-4715. Adding a ROSAT-PSPC spectrum further confirmed this result and allowed us to better constrain the temperatures of the three thermal components. A phase-resolved analysis of the NuSTAR data revealed no significant change in the photon index of the high-energy emission. This NuSTAR observation provides further impetus for future observations with the NICER mission (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) whose sensitivity will provide much stricter constraints on the equation of state of nuclear matter by combining model fits to the pulsar's phase-folded light curve with the pulsar's well-defined mass and distance from radio timing observations.

J	Roa, J				Roa, Javier			Non-conservative extension of Keplerian integrals and a new class of integrable system	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						acceleration of particles; radiation: dynamics; methods: analytical; celestial mechanics	ALGEBRAIC 1ST INTEGRALS; CONSERVATION-LAWS; ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE; DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS; MOTION; EXISTENCE; DRAG	The invariance of the Lagrangian under time translations and rotations in Kepler's problem yields the conservation laws related to the energy and angular momentum. Noether's theorem reveals that these same symmetries furnish generalized forms of the first integrals in a special non-conservative case, which approximates various physical models. The system is perturbed by a biparametric acceleration with components along the tangential and normal directions. A similarity transformation reduces the biparametric disturbance to a simpler uniparametric forcing along the velocity vector. The solvability conditions of this new problem are discussed, and closed-form solutions for the integrable cases are provided. Thanks to the conservation of a generalized energy, the orbits are classified as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Keplerian orbits appear naturally as particular solutions to the problem. After characterizing the orbits independently, a unified form of the solution is built based on the Weierstrass elliptic functions. The new trajectories involve fundamental curves such as cardioids and logarithmic, sinusoidal, and Cotes' spirals. These orbits can represent the motion of particles perturbed by solar radiation pressure, of spacecraft with continuous-thrust propulsion, and some instances of Schwarzschild geodesics. Finally, the problem is connected with other known integrable systems in celestial mechanics.

Simultaneous infrared and optical observations of the transiting debris cloud around WD 1145+017	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planets and satellites: individual: WD 1145+017; white dwarfs	ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE; WHITE-DWARF G29-38; DUST CLOUD; DATA RELEASE; SDSS; CANDIDATE; DISCOVERY; FREQUENCY; GRAINS; STARS	We present multiwavelength photometric monitoring of WD 1145+017, a white dwarf exhibiting periodic dimming events interpreted to be the transits of orbiting, disintegrating planetesimals. Our observations include the first set of near-infrared light curves for the object, obtained on multiple nights over the span of 1 month, and recorded multiple transit events with depths varying between similar to 20 and 50 per cent. Simultaneous near-infrared and optical observations of the deepest and longest duration transit event were obtained on two epochs with the Anglo-Australian Telescope and three optical facilities, over the wavelength range of 0.5-1.2 mu m. These observations revealed no measurable difference in transit depths for multiple photometric pass bands, allowing us to place a 2 sigma lower limit of 0.8 mu m on the grain size in the putative transiting debris cloud. This conclusion is consistent with the spectral energy distribution of the system, which can be fit with an optically thin debris disc with minimum particle sizes of 10(-3)(+5) mu m.

J	Crowell, BW; Bock, Y; Liu, Z				Crowell, Brendan W.; Bock, Yehuda; Liu, Zhen			Single-station automated detection of transient deformation in GPS time series with the relative strength index: A case study of Cascadian slow slip	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUBDUCTION ZONE; EPISODIC TREMOR; SILENT SLIP; LOS-ANGELES; EARTHQUAKE; EVENTS; MOTION; PROBABILITY; CALIFORNIA	The discovery of slow-slip events over the past decades has changed our understanding of tectonic hazards and the earthquake cycle. Proper geodetic characterization of slow-slip events is necessary for studies of regional interseismic, coseismic and postseismic deformation, and miscalculations can affect our understanding of the regional stress field and tectonic hazard. Because of the proliferation of GPS data over the last two decades, an automated algorithm is required to analyze the signals and model the deformation on a station by station basis. Using the relative strength index (RSI), a financial momentum oscillator, we test the ability to detect events of various sizes and durations. We first determine the statistics of the RSI under different noise conditions and then use this information as the basis for the automated transient detection algorithm by testing different synthetic signals. We then apply the technique to daily GPS displacement time series from 213 stations along the Cascadia subduction zone to form a record of transient deformation between 2005 and 2016. Our estimates of the spatial extent, duration, and propagation of major episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events are consistent with previous studies. We use the automated detections to remodel the displacement time series and obtain transient deformation rates over the past decade and discuss the tectonic implications. Finally, we analyze the correlation between transient detections and tremor showing good agreement between the two at slab depths commonly associated with ETS events.

Hyperspectral mapping of alteration assemblages within a hydrothermal vug at the Haughton impact structure, Canada	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; DEVON ISLAND; MERIDIANI-PLANUM; IRON MOUNTAIN; MARS; MINERALS; SULFATE; CARBONATE; SYSTEMS; CRATER	Meteorite impacts on Earth and Mars can generate hydrothermal systems that alter the primary mineralogies of rocks and provide suitable environments for microbial colonization. We investigate a calcite-marcasite-bearing vug at the similar to 23 km diameter Haughton impact structure, Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada, using imaging spectroscopy of the outcrop in the field (0.65-1.1 mu m) and samples in the laboratory (0.4-2.5 mu m), point spectroscopy (0.35-2.5 mu m), major element chemistry, and X-ray diffraction analyses. The mineral assemblages mapped at the outcrop include marcasite; marcasite with minor gypsum and jarosite; fibroferrite and copiapite with minor gypsum and melanterite; gypsum, Fe3+ oxides, and jarosite; and calcite, gypsum, clay, microcline, and quartz. Hyperspectral mapping of alteration phases shows spatial patterns that illuminate changes in alteration conditions and formation of specific mineral phases. Marcasite formed from the postimpact hydrothermal system under reducing conditions, while subsequent weathering oxidized the marcasite at low temperatures and water/rock ratios. The acidic fluids resulting from the oxidation collected on flat-lying portions of the outcrop, precipitating fibroferrite + copiapite. That assemblage then likely dissolved, and the changing chemistry and pH resulting from interaction with the calcite-rich host rock formed gypsum-bearing red coatings. These results have implications for understanding water-rock interactions and habitabilities at this site and on Mars.

Mineral chemistry of the Tissint meteorite: Indications of two-stage crystallization in a closed system	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							OLIVINE-PHYRIC SHERGOTTITES; HOSTED MELT INCLUSIONS; MARTIAN METEORITE; CRYSTAL-CHEMISTRY; DIFFERENTIATION HISTORY; PETROGENETIC LINKAGES; MAGMATIC PROCESSES; COOLING HISTORY; MODEL; MERRILLITE	The Tissint meteorite is a geochemically depleted, olivine-phyric shergottite. Olivine megacrysts contain 300-600 mu m cores with uniform Mg# (similar to 80 +/- 1) followed by concentric zones of Fe-enrichment toward the rims. We applied a number of tests to distinguish the relationship of these megacrysts to the host rock. Major and trace element compositions of the Mg-rich core in olivine are in equilibrium with the bulk rock, within uncertainty, and rare earth element abundances of melt inclusions in Mg-rich olivines reported in the literature are similar to those of the bulk rock. Moreover, the P K alpha intensity maps of two large olivine grains show no resorption between the uniform core and the rim. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest the olivine megacrysts are phenocrysts. Among depleted olivine-phyric shergottites, Tissint is the first one that acts mostly as a closed system with olivine megacrysts being the phenocrysts. The texture and mineral chemistry of Tissint indicate a crystallization sequence of: olivine (Mg# 80 +/- 1) --> olivine (Mg# 76) + chromite --> olivine (Mg# 74) + Ti-chromite --> olivine (Mg# 74-63) + pyroxene (Mg# 76-65) + Cr-ulvospinel --> olivine (Mg# 63-35) + pyroxene (Mg# 65-60) + plagioclase, followed by late-stage ilmenite and phosphate. The crystallization of the Tissint meteorite likely occurred in two stages: uniform olivine cores likely crystallized under equilibrium conditions; and a fractional crystallization sequence that formed the rest of the rock. The two-stage crystallization without crystal settling is simulated using MELTS and the Tissint bulk composition, and can broadly reproduce the crystallization sequence and mineral chemistry measured in the Tissint samples. The transition between equilibrium and fractional crystallization is associated with a dramatic increase in cooling rate and might have been driven by an acceleration in the ascent rate or by encounter with a steep thermal gradient in the Martian crust.

Global variations in regolith properties on asteroid Vesta from Dawn's low-altitude mapping orbit	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							INDUCED SEISMIC ACTIVITY; DARK MATERIAL; GALILEO PHOTOMETRY; LUNAR REGOLITH; SURFACE; IMPACT; CAMERA; CONSTRAINTS; QUADRANGLE; THICKNESS	We investigate the depth, variability, and history of regolith on asteroid Vesta using data from the Dawn spacecraft. High-resolution (15-20 m pixel(-1)) Framing Camera images are used to assess the presence of morphologic indicators of a shallow regolith, including the presence of blocks in crater ejecta, spur-and-gully-type features in crater walls, and the retention of small (<300 m) impact craters. Such features reveal that the broad, regional heterogeneities observed on Vesta in terms of albedo and surface composition extend to the physical properties of the upper similar to 1 km of the surface. Regions of thin regolith are found within the Rheasilvia basin and at equatorial latitudes from similar to 0-90 degrees E and similar to 260-360 degrees E. Craters in these areas that appear to excavate material from beneath the regolith have more diogenitic (Rheasilvia, 0-90 degrees E) and cumulate eucrite (260-360 degrees E) compositions. A region of especially thick regolith, where depths generally exceed 1 km, is found from similar to 100-240 degrees E and corresponds to heavily cratered, low-albedo surface with a basaltic eucrite composition enriched in carbonaceous chondrite material. The presence of a thick regolith in this area supports the idea that this is an ancient terrain that has accumulated a larger component of exogenic debris. We find evidence for the gardening of crater ejecta toward more howarditic compositions, consistent with regolith mixing being the dominant form of "weathering" on Vesta.

Monitoring groundwater storage changes in complex basement aquifers: An evaluation of the GRACE satellites over East Africa	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							GLOBAL HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; LAKE VICTORIA BASIN; REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL; INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; HIGH-PLAINS AQUIFER; WATER STORAGE; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; GRAVITY RECOVERY; SOIL-MOISTURE; MIDDLE-EAST	Although the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to monitor groundwater storage changes has become commonplace, our evaluation suggests that careful processing of the GRACE data is necessary to extract a representative signal especially in regions with significant surface water storage (i.e., lakes/reservoirs). In our study, we use cautiously processed data sets, including GRACE, lake altimetry, and model soil moisture, to reduce scaling factor bias and compare GRACE-derived groundwater storage changes to in situ groundwater observations over parts of East Africa. Over the period 2007-2010, a strong correlation between in situ groundwater storage changes and GRACE groundwater estimates (Spearman's rho = 0.6) is found. Piecewise trend analyses for the GRACE groundwater estimates reveal significant negative storage changes that are attributed to groundwater use and climate variability. Further analysis comparing groundwater and satellite precipitation data sets permits identification of regional groundwater characterization. For example, our results identify potentially permeable and/or shallow groundwater systems underlying Tanzania and deep and/or less permeable groundwater systems underlying the Upper Nile basin. Regional groundwater behaviors in the semiarid regions of Northern Kenya are attributed to hydraulic connections to recharge zones outside the subbasin boundary. Our results prove the utility of applying GRACE in monitoring groundwater resources in hydrologically complex regions that are undersampled and where policies limit data accessibility.

Using satellite observations, we describe the synoptic conditions leading to cloud formation. Supersaturation occurs 25% of the time within the cirrus, up to 35% in its middle segment, where relative humidity goes beyond 150%. In clear-sky areas, relative humidity stays consistently low, especially in profiles without clouds. High-troposphere atmospheric waves could initiate the formation of supersaturation conditions, especially on 16 March.

The science payload on MiRaTA consists of a triband microwave radiometer and global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (GPSRO) sensor. The microwave radiometer takes measurements of all-weather temperature (V-band, 50-57 GHz), water vapor (G-band, 175-191 GHz), and cloud ice (G-band, 205 GHz) to provide observations used to improve weather forecasting. The Aerospace Corporation's GPSRO experiment, called the compact total electron content and atmospheric GPS sensor (CTAGS), measures profiles of temperature and pressure in the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere (similar to 20 km) and electron density in the ionosphere (over 100 km). The MiRaTA mission will validate new technologies in both passive microwave radiometry and GPSRO: 1) new ultracompact and low-power technology for multichannel and multiband passive microwave radiometers, 2) the application of a commercial off-the-shelf GPS receiver and custom patch antenna array technology to obtain neutral atmospheric GPSRO retrieval from a nanosatellite, and 3) a new approach to space-borne microwave radiometer calibration using adjacent GPSRO measurements. In this paper, we focus on objective 3, developing operational models to meet a mission goal of 100 concurrent radiometer and GPSRO measurements, and estimating the temperature measurement precision for the CTAGS instrument based on thermal noise Based on an analysis of thermal noise of the CTAGS instrument, the expected temperature retrieval precision is between 0.17 and 1.4 K, which supports the improvement of radiometric calibration to 0.25 K.

A Lidar-Radar Framework to Assess the Impact of Vertical Forest Structure on Interferometric Coherence	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						EM extinction; forest; interferometric coherence; lidar; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); vegetation; vertical structure	SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; WAVE-FORM LIDAR; LASER ALTIMETER; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; MANGROVE FORESTS; CANOPY STRUCTURE; ELEVATION DATA; POL-INSAR; SAR; HEIGHT	In this paper, we present novel modeling approaches to investigate the sensitivity of radar interferometric coherence to variations in the vertical forest canopy profile. We introduce a common framework applicable to model radar microwave extinction and structure from lidar data. To perform this analysis, we make use of interferometric data from the uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) L-band radar and full waveform lidar data from laser vegetation imaging sensor (LVIS). The datasets were acquired over the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve Forest, Quebec, Canada. A twofold analysis of the framework to estimate interferometric coherence is undertaken. First, a sensitivity analysis is performed by incorporating lidar waveform Legendre descriptions into two adapted independent polarimetric interferometry models. Second, we examine the effectiveness of using lidar data in this novel way to model radar interferometric coherence. Where appropriate, coherence estimates are obtained using Legendre solutions up to fourth order and at resolutions up to 75 m. The maximum r(2) values between modeled outputs and observed coherence across hh, vv, and hv polarizations are shown as 0.51(p < 0.05) and 0.76(p < 0.05) at 25 and 75 m pixel resolutions, respectively. The introduction of a common framework to combine lidar and radar enables an estimation of the impact of canopy structure on observed interferometric coherence and provides further insight into the feasibility of assuming uniform microwave extinction rates on different scales through forest canopy. The framework's potential lies in its use to assess performance of canopy structure estimates from future spaceborne radar interferometers in synergy with lidar data.

Uncertainty Quantification in the Infrared Surface Emissivity Model (ISEM)	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Emissivity validation; infrared measurements; multiple reflections; ocean surface; (RTTOV); radiative transfer simulation; sea surface emissivity; sea surface temperature (SST); wind speed	SEA-SURFACE; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; OCEAN; REFLECTION	Accurate modeling of surface emissivity is imperative for accurate radiative transfer simulation and forward modeling of satellite radiance observations. The Radiative Transfer for (A) TOVS (RTTOV) fast radiative transfermodel uses the Infrared Surface Emissivity Model (ISEM) for the computation of sea surface emissivity in the infrared (IR) spectrum. However, the model does not incorporate the effect of surface-emitted surface reflected (SESR) radiation and dependence of wind speed in the emissivity calculation. This paper investigates the uncertainty in the ISEM model caused by ignoring the SESR radiation and wind speed effects in the 3 IR bands, 3.7, 11, and 12 mu m. First, we develop a new model called Surface Emissivity Model in IR with SESR (SEMIS) that takes the SESR radiation and wind speed effects into account. The uncertainty in the ISEM model is then quantified by comparing the ISEM emissivity against SEMIS derived emissivity. The comparison results suggest that two models are in excellent agreement below similar to 60 degrees emission angle, implying no notable uncertainty in the ISEM model at smaller angles. Nevertheless, uncertainty tends to significantly increase with increasing emission angle above similar to 60 degrees, which is even more notable at high wind speed (similar to 15 m/s). Two models are further compared against emissivity measurements from a radiometer. The ISEM model has produced large errors as opposed to the SEMIS.

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies; galaxies: dwarf	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLE MASSES; OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS; CONFIDENCE-LIMITS; SEYFERT-1 GALAXY; DWARF GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION; LINE; LUMINOSITY; QUASARS	Context. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are thought to be the seeds of early supermassive black holes (SMBHs). While greater than or similar to 100 IMBH and small SMBH candidates have been identified in recent years, few have been robustly confirmed to date, leaving their number density in considerable doubt. Placing firmer constraints both on the methods used to identify and confirm IMBHs/SMBHs, as well as characterizing the range of host environments that IMBHs/SMBHs likely inhabit is therefore of considerable interest and importance. Additionally, finding significant numbers of IMBHs in metal-poor systems would be particularly intriguing, since such systems may represent local analogs of primordial galaxies, and therefore could provide clues of early accretion processes. Aims. Here we study in detail several candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN) found in metal-poor hosts. Methods. We utilize new X-ray and optical observations to characterize these metal-poor AGN candidates and compare them against known AGN luminosity relations and well-characterized IMBH/SMBH samples. Results. Despite having clear broad optical emission lines that are long-lived (greater than or similar to 10-13 yr), these candidate AGN appear to lack associated strong X-ray and hard UV emission, lying at least 1-2 dex off the known AGN correlations. If they are IMBHs/SMBHs, our constraints imply that they either are not actively accreting, their accretion disks are fully obscured along our line-of-sight, or their accretion disks are not producing characteristic high energy emission. Alternatively, if they are not AGN, then their luminous broad emission lines imply production by extreme stellar processes. The latter would have profound implications on the applicability of broad lines for mass estimates of massive black holes.	[Simmonds, C.; Bauer, F.

The observation was made in the H-band using the SPHERE instrument. The star is at a distance of 92 +/- 6 pc in the Lower Centaurus Crux association. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, we determined that the debris is likely in the form of a dust ring with an inner edge of 27.7(-3.5)(+2.8) au, position angle -74.3 degrees(-1.5) (+0.5), and an inclination with respect to the line of sight of 6.7 degrees(+3.8)(-0.4). The disk imaged in scattered light has a surface density that is declining with radius of similar to r(-4), which is steeper than expected for grain blowout by radiation pressure. We find only marginal evidence (2 sigma) of eccentricity and rule out planets more massive than 1.0 M-Jup orbiting within 1 au of the inner edge of the ring, since such a planet would have disrupted the disk. The disk has roughly the same fractional disk luminosity (L-disk = L-* = 3.3 x 10(-3)) as HR 4796 A and beta Pictoris, however it was not detected by previous instrument facilities most likely because of its small angular size (radius similar to 0.4"), low albedo (similar to 0.2), and low scattering efficiency far from the star due to high scattering anisotropy. With the arrival of extreme adaptive optics systems, such as SPHERE and GPI, the morphology of smaller, fainter, and more distant debris disks are being revealed, providing clues to planet-disk interactions in young protoplanetary systems.

I.; STRIPE 82; M-V; DEPENDENCE; VARIABLES; FE/H; MODE	The wide-field synoptic sky surveys, known as the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), will accumulate a large number of known and new RR Lyrae. These RR Lyrae are good tracers to study the substructure of the. Galactic halo if their distance, metallicity, and galactocentric velocity can be measured. Candidates of halo RR Lyrae can be identified from their distance and metallicity before requesting spectroscopic observations for confirmation. This is because both quantities can be obtained via their photometric light curves, because the absolute V-band magnitude for RR Lyrae is correlated with metallicity, and the metallicity can be estimated using a metallicity-light curve relation. To fully utilize the PTF and iPTF light-curve data in related future work, it is necessary to derive the metallicity-light curve relation in the native PTF/iPTF R-band photometric system. In this work, we derived such a relation using the known ab- type RR Lyrae located in the Kepler field, and it is found to be [Fe/H](PTF) = -4.089-7.346P + 1.280 phi(31) (where P is pulsational period and phi(31) is one of the Fourier parameters describing the shape of the light curve), with a dispersion of 0.118. dex. We tested our metallicity-light curve relation with new spectroscopic observations of a few RR Lyrae in the Kepler field, as well as several data sets available in the literature. Our tests demonstrated that. the derived metallicity-light curve relation could be used to estimate metallicities for the majority of the RR Lyrae, which are in agreement with the published values.

We are developing a new atmospheric retrieval methodology to help assess the science return and inform the instrument design for such future missions, and ultimately interpret the resulting observations. Our retrieval technique employs a geometric albedo model coupled with both a Markov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble Sampler (emcee) and a multimodal nested sampling algorithm (MultiNest) to map the posterior distribution. This combination makes the global evidence calculation more robust for any given model and highlights possible discrepancies in the likelihood maps. As a proof of concept, our current atmospheric model contains one or two cloud layers, methane as a major absorber, and a H-2-He background gas. This 6-to-9 parameter model is appropriate for Jupiter-like planets and can be easily expanded in the future. In addition to deriving the marginal likelihood distribution and confidence intervals for the model parameters, we perform model selection to determine the significance of methane and cloud detection as a function of expected signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of spectral noise correlations. After internal validation, the method is applied to realistic spectra of Jupiter, Saturn, and HD 99492c, a model observing target. We find that the presence or absence of clouds and methane can be determined with high confidence, while parameter uncertainties are model dependent and correlated. Such general methods will also be applicable to the interpretation of direct imaging spectra of cloudy terrestrial planets.

MAPS OF THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS FROM COMBINED SOUTH POLE TELESCOPE AND PLANCK DATA	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						Magellanic Clouds; methods: data analysis	SOURCE CATALOG; RESULTS. VI.; EMISSION; RADIO; SKY; HFI; SUBMILLIMETER; SPECTRUM; FIELD; DUST	We present maps of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds from combined South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck data. The Planck satellite observes in nine bands, while the SPT data used in this work were taken with the three-band SPT-SZ camera, The SPT-SZ bands correspond closely to three of the nine Planck bands, namely those centered at 1.4, 2.1, and 3.0 mm. The angular resolution of the Planck data ranges from 5 to 10 arcmin, while the SPT resolution ranges from 1.0 to 1.7 arcmin. The combined maps take advantage of the high resolution of the SPT data and the long-timescale stability of the space-based Planck observations to deliver robust brightness measurements on scales from the size of the maps down to similar to 1 arcmin. In each band, we first calibrate and color-correct the SPT data to match the Planck data, then we use noise estimates from each instrument and knowledge of each instrument's beam to make the inverse-variance-weighted combination of the two instruments' data as a function of angular scale. We create maps assuming a range of underlying emission spectra and at a range of final resolutions. We perform several consistency tests on the combined maps and estimate the expected noise in measurements of features in them. We compare maps from this work to those from the Herschel HERITAGE survey, finding general consistency between the data sets. All data products described in this paper are available for download from the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis server.	[Crawford, T. M.; Benson, B. A.; Bleem, L.

Pyrolytic graphite film thermal straps: Characterization testing	CRYOGENICS			English	Article						Pyrolytic graphite film; Flexible thermal link; Annealed pyrolytic graphite		This paper reports on the experimentally-measured conductance, stiffness, and particulate contamination of pyrolytic graphite film thermal straps. This work was aimed at assessing the feasibility of replacing standard aluminum foil in thermal straps with graphite film, which is more conductive and lighter. Four different U-shaped straps with similar cross-sections and terminals were tested in the study. Three of the straps had a three-inch long flexible section. One of these was made from aluminum 1100 foil, and two were made from Pyrovo pyrolytic graphite film (PGF). One of the PGF straps was fabricated with an aluminized mylar blanket that was sealed at the terminals. The last strap was made from PGF, was blanketed, and was six inches long. The conductance of each strap was measured as a function of mean strap temperature ranging from 60 K to 300 K. The peak measured conductance of the three-inch PGF and aluminum straps were 1.0 W/K at 162 K and 0.28 W/K at 64K, respectively. The conductance of all straps converged to around 0.3 W/K as the mean strap temperature approached 60 K. In addition, the peak conductance of the six-inch PGF strap was 0.83 W/K at 150 K. The fact that its peak conductance was near the conductance of the three-inch PGF strap indicated that the thermal resistance of the terminals in the PGF straps was significant. For a given temperature, the conductance varied by as much as 15% for two units of the same strap design. One of the straps was thermally cycled from 300 K to 60 K ten times. Its conductance was unchanged by the thermal cycling. Furthermore, one of the six-inch long PGF straps was subjected to random vibration. The random vibration spectrum was designed so that one terminal achieved a maximum displacement of 0.25 in. from its neutral position in three orthogonal axes while the other was held stationary. The conductance of this strap was unaffected by the random vibration test. The straps were also tested for the level of contamination introduced to the environment. The bare aluminum and bare PGF straps had equal particulate cleanliness levels while the encapsulated PGF strap had a lower one. Finally, the dynamic stiffness of one of the six-inch strap was measured to be less than 0.5 lb/in. in all directions for temperatures between 200 and 300 K. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

JUPITER'S PHASE VARIATIONS FROM CASSINI: A TESTBED FOR FUTURE DIRECT-IMAGING MISSIONS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets	EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; SOUTH TROPICAL ZONE; LIGHT CURVES; REFLECTED-LIGHT; JOVIAN PLANETS; EXOPLANETS; PHOTOMETRY; ALBEDOS; CLOUD; SPECTROPHOTOMETRY	We present empirical phase curves of Jupiter from similar to 0 degrees to 140 degrees as measured in multiple optical bandpasses by Cassini/Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) during the Millennium flyby of Jupiter in late 2000 to early 2001. Phase curves are of interest for studying the energy balance of Jupiter and understanding the scattering behavior of the planet as an exoplanet analog. We find that Jupiter is significantly darker at partial phases than an idealized Lambertian planet by roughly 25% and is not well fit by Jupiter-like exoplanet atmospheric models across all wavelengths. We provide analytic fits to Jupiter's phase function in several Cassini/ ISS imaging filter bandpasses. In addition, these observations show that Jupiter's color is more variable with phase angle than predicted by models. Therefore, the color of even a near Jupiter-twin planet observed at a partial phase cannot be assumed to be comparable to that of Jupiter at full phase. We discuss how the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope and other future direct-imaging missions can enhance the study of cool giants.	[Mayorga, L.

Radar observations of the asteroid 2011 UW158	ASTRONOMY LETTERS-A JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND SPACE ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						NEAs; asteroids; radar observations; orbit determination	SYSTEM	In July 2015 intercontinental bistatic radar observations of the potentially dangerous asteroid 2011 UW158 during its close approach to the Earth were carried out. The asteroid was illuminated at a frequency of 8.4 GHz with the 70-m DSS-14 antenna of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, while the signal reflected from the asteroid was received with the 32-m radio telescopes of the Quasar VLBI network at the Zelenchukskaya and Badary Observatories. The spectra of the reflected radio signals were obtained. The sizes and rotation period of the asteroid consistent with photometric observations and the ratio of the powers of the reflected signals with left- and right-hand circular polarizations were determined. The derived values suggest that the asteroid has an inhomogeneous surface and a prolate shape. The observations of the Doppler shift of the reflected signal frequency were obtained, which allowed the orbital parameters of the asteroid to be improved.	[Ipatov, A. V.; Bondarenko, Yu.

Without detecting individual sources, LIM makes use of all available photons and measures the integrated light in the source confusion limit. to efficiently map the three-dimensional matter distribution on large scales as traced by a given emission line. One particular challenge is the separation of desired signals from astrophysical continuum foregrounds and line interlopers. Here we present a technique to extract large-scale structure information traced by emission lines from different redshifts, embedded in a three-dimensional intensity mapping data cube. The line redshifts are distinguished by the anisotropic shape of the power spectra when projected onto a common coordinate frame. We consider the case where high-redshift [C II] lines are confused with multiple low-redshift CO rotational lines. We present a semi-analytic model for [C II] and CO line estimates based on the cosmic infrared background measurements, and show that with a modest instrumental noise level and survey geometry, the large-scale [C II] and CO power spectrum amplitudes can be successfully extracted from a confusion-limited data set, without external information. We discuss the implications and limits of this technique for possible LIM experiments.	[Cheng, Yun-Ting; Bock, James; Bradford, C.

CONSTRAINING THE ISM PROPERTIES OF THE CLOVERLEAF QUASAR HOST GALAXY WITH HERSCHEL SPECTROSCOPY	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (H11413+117); galaxies: ISM; infrared: galaxies	DENSE MOLECULAR GAS; MU-M LINE; STAR-FORMATION; APM 08279+5255; COSMIC-RAY; PHOTODISSOCIATION REGIONS; INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS; PHYSICAL CONDITIONS; INFRARED-EMISSION; CO EMISSION	We present Herschel observations of the far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure (FS) lines [C II]158 mu m, [O I]63 mu m, [O III]52 mu m, and [Si II]35 mu m in the z = 2.56 Cloverleaf quasar, and combine them with published data in an analysis of the dense interstellar medium (ISM) in this system. Observed [C II]158 mu m, [O I]63 mu m, and FIR continuum flux ratios are reproduced with photodissociation region (PDR) models characterized by moderate far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields with G(0) = 0.3-1 x. 103 and atomic gas densities n(H) = 3-5 x 10(3) cm(-3), depending on contributions to [C II]158 mu m from ionized gas. We assess the contribution to the [C II]158 mu m flux from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) narrow line region (NLR) using ground-based measurements of the [N II]122 mu m transition, finding that the NLR can contribute at most 20%-30% of the observed [C II]158 mu m flux. The PDR density and far-UV radiation fields inferred from the atomic lines are not consistent with the CO emission, indicating that the molecular gas excitation is not solely provided via UV heating from local star formation (SF), but requires an additional heating source. X-ray heating from the AGN is explored, and we find that X-ray-dominated region (XDR) models, in combination with PDR models, can match the CO cooling without overproducing the observed FS line emission. While this XDR/PDR solution is favored given the evidence for both X-rays and SF in the Cloverleaf, we also investigate alternatives for the warm molecular gas, finding that either mechanical heating via low-velocity shocks or an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate may also contribute. Finally, we include upper limits on two other measurements attempted in the Herschel program: [C II]158 mu m in FSC 10214 and [O I]63 mu m in APM 08279+5255.	[Uzgil, Bade D.; Bradford, C.

Its front end consists of triple-push Colpitts oscillators (TPCOs), followed by the first and second stage injection locking frequency dividers (ILFDs) and a divide-by-16 chain. TPCOs are used to triple their fundamental frequencies to 0.53-0.56 THz, while ILFDs and the subsequent divider chain are used to divide such frequencies to 2.7-2.9 GHz. Its back end consists of separate frequency and phase-locked loops with unique CMOS circuit designs to accomplish the desirable frequency/phase locking, including: 1) band-selection inductor switches; 2) simultaneous bulk voltage tuning over TPCOs and the first ILFD; and 3) a dual port injection architecture for the first ILFD. The resultant prototype realizes a 21 GHz frequency locking range with phase noise lower than -74 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, and consumes 174 mW dc power.

This requires consistency in the input brightness temperatures (Tb), which is accomplished by intercalibrating the constellation radiometers using the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) as the calibration reference. The first step in intercalibrating the sensors involves prescreening the sensor Tb to identify and correct for calibration biases across the scan or along the orbit path. Next, multiple techniques developed by teams within the GPM Intersatellite Calibration Working Group (XCAL) are used to adjust the calibrations of the constellation radiometers to be consistent with GMI. Comparing results from multiple approaches helps identify flaws or limitations of a given technique, increase confidence in the results, and provide a measure of the residual uncertainty. The original calibration differences relative to GMI are generally within 2-3K for channels below 92 GHz, although AMSR2 exhibits larger differences that vary with scene temperature. SSMIS calibration differences also vary with scene temperature but to a lesser degree. For SSMIS channels above 150 GHz, the differences are generally within similar to 2 K with the exception of SSMIS on board DMSP F19, which ranges from 7 to 11 K colder than GMI depending on frequency. The calibrations of the cross-track radiometers agree very well with GMI with values mostly within 0.5 K for the Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d'Humidite Intertropicale par Radiometrie (SAPHIR) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) sensors, and within 1 K for the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS).

In practical applications, the cost of computing this inverse matrix with spatially correlated observation errors is prohibitive. Common practices are therefore to subsample or combine the observations so that the errors of the assimilated observations can be considered uncorrelated. As a consequence, a large fraction of the available observational information is not used in practical applications. In this study, a method is developed to account for the correlations of the errors that will be present in the wide-swath sea surface height measurements, for example, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. It basically consists of the transformation of the observation vector so that the inverse of the corresponding covariance matrix can be replaced by a diagonal matrix, thus allowing to genuinely take into account errors that are spatially correlated in physical space. Numerical experiments of ensemble Kalman filter analysis of SWOT-like observations are conducted with three different observation error covariance matrices. Results suggest that the proposed method provides an effective way to account for error correlations in the assimilation of the future SWOT data. The transformation of the observation vector proposed herein yields both a significant reduction of the root-mean-square errors and a good consistency between the filter analysis error statistics and the true error statistics.

Water vapor changes under global warming and the linkage to present-day interannual variabilities in CMIP5 models	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Water vapor; CMIP5; Interannual variations; Climate model; Climate change	CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; ATMOSPHERE; FEEDBACKS; HUMIDITY; SPREAD	The fractional water vapor changes under global warming across 14 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 simulations are analyzed. We show that the mean fractional water vapor changes under global warming in the tropical upper troposphere between 300 and 100 hPa range from 12.4 to 28.0 %/K across all models while the fractional water vapor changes are about 5-8 %/K in other regions and at lower altitudes. The "upper-tropospheric amplification" of the water vapor change is primarily driven by a larger temperature increase in the upper troposphere than in the lower troposphere per degree of surface warming. The relative contributions of atmospheric temperature and relative humidity changes to the water vapor change in each model vary between 71.5 to 131.8 % and 24.8 to -20.1 %, respectively. The inter-model differences in the water vapor change is primarily caused by differences in temperature change, except over the inter-tropical convergence zone within 10A degrees S-10A degrees N where the model differences due to the relative humidity change are significant. Furthermore, we find that there is generally a positive correlation between the rates of water vapor change for long-tem surface warming and those on the interannual time scales. However, the rates of water vapor change under long-term warming have a systematic offset from those on the inter-annual time scales and the dominant contributor to the differences also differs for the two time scales, suggesting caution needs to be taken when inferring long-term water vapor changes from the observed interannual variations.

J	Nilsson, J; Gardner, A; Sorensen, LS; Forsberg, R				Nilsson, Johan; Gardner, Alex; Sorensen, Louise Sandberg; Forsberg, Rene			Improved retrieval of land ice topography from CryoSat-2 data and its impact for volume-change estimation of the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							SURFACE ELEVATION CHANGE; SEA-LEVEL RISE; MASS-BALANCE; CONTINENTAL ICE; SATELLITE RADAR; RETRACKING ALGORITHM; ALTIMETER; GLACIERS; FLUCTUATIONS; ACCURACY	A new methodology for retrieval of glacier and ice sheet elevations and elevation changes from CryoSat-2 data is presented. Surface elevations and elevation changes determined using this approach show significant improvements over ESA's publicly available CryoSat-2 elevation product (L2 Baseline-B). The results are compared to near-coincident airborne laser altimetry from NASA's Operation IceBridge and seasonal height amplitudes from the Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Applying this methodology to CryoSat-2 data collected in interferometric synthetic aperture mode (SIN) over the high-relief regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet we find an improvement in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 27 and 40% compared to ESA's L2 product in the derived elevation and elevation changes, respectively. In the interior part of the ice sheet, where CryoSat-2 operates in low-resolution mode (LRM), we find an improvement in the RMSE of 68 and 55% in the derived elevation and elevation changes, respectively. There is also an 86% improvement in the magnitude of the seasonal amplitudes when compared to amplitudes derived from ICESat data. These results indicate that the new methodology provides improved tracking of the snow/ice surface with lower sensitivity to changes in near-surface dielectric properties. To demonstrate the utility of the new processing methodology we produce elevations, elevation changes, and total volume changes from CryoSat-2 data for the Greenland Ice Sheet during the period January 2011 to January 2015. We find that the Greenland Ice Sheet decreased in volume at a rate of 289 +/- 20 km(3) a(-1), with high interannual variability and spatial heterogeneity in rates of loss. This rate is 65 km(3) a(-1) more negative than rates determined from ESA's L2 product, highlighting the importance of CryoSat-2 processing methodologies.

DYNAMICAL MASS MEASUREMENT OF THE YOUNG SPECTROSCOPIC BINARY V343 NORMAE AaAb RESOLVED WITH THE GEMINI PLANET IMAGER	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: detection; stars: individual (V343 Nor)	STELLAR KINEMATIC GROUPS; PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; SUBSTELLAR COMPANION; FINDING CAMPAIGN; ORBITAL PARAMETERS; STARS; AGE; NEARBY; 1ST; DISCOVERY	We present new spatially resolved astrometry and photometry from the Gemini Planet Imager of the inner binary of the young multiple star system V343 Normae, which is a member of the beta Pictoris (beta Pic) moving group. V343 Normae comprises a K0 and mid-M star in a similar to 4.5 year orbit (AaAb) and a wide 10 '' M5 companion (B). By combining these data with archival astrometry and radial velocities we fit the orbit and measure individual masses for both components of M-Aa = 1.10 +/- 0.10M(circle dot) and M-Ab= 0.290 +/- 0.018 M-circle dot. Comparing to theoretical isochrones, we find good agreement for the measured masses and JHK band magnitudes of the two components consistent with the age of the beta Pic moving group. We derive a model-dependent age for the beta Pic moving group of 26 +/- 3 Myr by combining our results for V343 Normae with literature measurements for GJ. 3305, which is another group member with resolved binary components and dynamical masses.

We are carrying out a Warm Spitzer Cycle. 11 Exploration Science program entitled NEOSurvey-a fast and efficient flux-limited survey of 597. known NEOs in which we derive a diameter and albedo for each target. The vast majority of our targets are too faint to be observed by NEOWISE, though a small sample has been or will be observed by both observatories, which allows for a cross-check of our mutual results. Our primary goal is to create a large and uniform catalog of NEO properties. We present here the first results from this new program: fluxes and derived diameters and albedos for 80 NEOs, together with a description of the overall program and approach, including several updates to our thermal model. The largest source of error in our diameter and albedo solutions, which derive from our single-band thermal emission measurements, is uncertainty in eta, the beaming parameter used in our thermal modeling; for albedos, improvements in solar system absolute magnitudes would also help significantly. All data and derived diameters and albedos from this entire program are being posted on a publicly accessible Web page at nearearthobjects. nau. edu	[Trilling, David E.; Mommert, Michael] No Arizona Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, POB 6010, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Hora, Joseph; Fazio, Giovanni; Smith, Howard] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St,MS-65, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chesley, Steve] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Emery, Joshua] Univ Tennessee, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 306 EPS Bldg,1412 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Harris, Alan] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Planetary Res, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Mueller, Michael] SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, SRON, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Mueller, Michael] Univ Groningen, Kapteyn Astron Inst, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands	Trilling, DE (corresponding author), South African Astron Observ, POB 9, ZA-7935 Cape Town, South Africa.; Trilling, DE (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Dept Phys, ZA-7535 Cape Town, South Africa.

Here, we test infrared selection methods for AGN activity at low galaxy masses. Our parent sample consists of similar to 18,000 nearby dwarf galaxies (M-* < 3 x 10(9) M-circle dot, z < 0.055) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with significant detections in the first three bands of the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). First, we demonstrate that the majority of optically selected AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not selected as AGNs using WISE infrared color diagnostics and that the infrared emission is dominated by the host galaxies. We then investigate the infrared properties of optically selected star-forming dwarf galaxies, finding that the galaxies with the reddest infrared colors are the most compact, with blue optical colors, young stellar ages, and large specific star formation rates. These results indicate that great care must be taken when selecting AGNs in dwarf galaxies using infrared colors, as star-forming dwarf galaxies are capable of heating dust in such a way that mimics the infrared colors of more luminous AGNs. In particular, a simple W1 - W2 color cut alone should not be used to select AGNs in dwarf galaxies. With these complications in mind, we present a sample of 41 dwarf galaxies that fall in the. WISE infrared color space typically occupied by more luminous AGNs and that are worthy of follow-up observations.
