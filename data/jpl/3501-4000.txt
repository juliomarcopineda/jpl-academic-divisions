HST Grism Confirmation of 16 Structures at 1.4 < z < 2.8 from the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN (CARLA) Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: high-redshift	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; MOLONGLO REFERENCE CATALOG; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; DEEP-FIELD; IRAC; SPECTROSCOPY; REDSHIFTS; EVOLUTION	We report spectroscopic results from our 40-orbit Hubble Space Telescope slitless grism spectroscopy program observing the 20 densest Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN (CARLA) candidate galaxy clusters at 1.4 < z < 2.8. These candidate rich structures, among the richest and most distant known, were identified on the basis of [3.6]- [4.5] color from a 408 hr multi-cycle Spitzer program targeting 420 distant radio-loud AGN. We report the spectroscopic confirmation of 16 distant structures at 1.4 < z < 2.8 associated with the targeted powerful high-redshift radio-loud AGN. We also report the serendipitous discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of seven additional structures at 0.87 < z < 2.12 not associated with the targeted radio-loud AGN. We find that 10(10)-10(11) M-circle dot member galaxies of our confirmed CARLA structures form significantly fewer stars than their field counterparts at all redshifts within 1.4 <= z <= 2. We also observe higher star-forming activity in the structure cores up to z = 2, finding similar trends as cluster surveys at slightly lower redshifts (1.0 < z < 1.5). By design, our efficient strategy of obtaining just two grism orbits per field only obtains spectroscopic confirmation of emission line galaxies. Deeper spectroscopy will be required to study the population of evolved, massive galaxies in these (forming) clusters. Lacking multi-band coverage of the fields, we adopt a very conservative approach of calling all confirmations "structures," although we note that a number of features are consistent with some of them being bona fide galaxy clusters. Together this survey represents a unique and large homogenous sample of spectroscopically confirmed structures at high redshifts, potentially more than doubling the census of confirmed, massive clusters at Z > 1.4.

They interpreted these results as evidence of the presence of a binary supermassive black hole with an orbital separation of just a few hundred au, and estimated the gravitational-wave signal implied by such a system. We demonstrate that the claimed periodicities are based on a misinterpretation of the null hypothesis test simulations and an error in the method used to calculate the false alarm probabilities. There is no evidence of periodicity in the data.

Identification of these isolates was routinely performed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Although this technique is an industry standard, it is time consuming and has poor resolving power for some closely related taxa. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is widely used in clinical diagnostics and is a promising method to substitute standard 16S rRNA sequencing. However, manufacturer-provided databases lack the bacterial diversity found in spacecraft-assembly cleanrooms. This study reports the development of the first custom database of MALDI-TOF MS profiles of bacterial isolates obtained from spacecraft and associated cleanroom environments. With the use of this in-house database, 454 bacterial isolates were successfully identified in concurrence with their 16S rRNA sequence-based classifications. Additionally, MALDI-TOF MS resolved strain-level variations, identified potential novel species and distinguished between members of taxonomic groups, which is not possible using conventional 16S rRNA sequencing. MALDI-TOF MS has proved to be an accurate, high-throughput approach for real-time identification of bacterial isolates during the spacecraft assembly process.

Martin			Global Analysis of Climate Change Projection Effects on Atmospheric Rivers	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						water vapor transport; global; atmospheric rivers; climate change; CMIP5	US WEST-COAST; FUTURE CHANGES; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; NORTH-AMERICA; CALIFORNIA; SIMULATIONS; IMPACTS; MODELS; WINTER	A uniform, global approach is used to quantify how atmospheric rivers (ARs) change between Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 historical simulations and future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 warming scenarios. The projections indicate that while there will be similar to 10% fewer ARs in the future, the ARs will be similar to 25% longer, similar to 25% wider, and exhibit stronger integrated water vapor transports (IVTs) under RCP8.5. These changes result in pronounced increases in the frequency (IVT strength) of AR conditions under RCP8.5: similar to 50% (25%) globally, similar to 50% (20%) in the northern midlatitudes, and similar to 60% (20%) in the southern midlatitudes. The models exhibit systematic low biases across the midlatitudes in replicating historical AR frequency (similar to 10%), zonal IVT (similar to 15%), and meridional IVT (similar to 25%), with sizable intermodel differences. A more detailed examination of six regions strongly impacted by ARs suggests that the western United States, northwestern Europe, and southwestern South America exhibit considerable intermodel differences in projected changes in ARs. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are elongated strands of horizontal water vapor transport, accounting for over 90% of the poleward water vapor transport across midlatitudes. These "rivers in the sky" have important implications for extreme precipitation when they make landfall, particularly along the west coasts of many midlatitude continents (e.g., North America, South America, and West Europe) due to orographic lifting. ARs are important contributors to extreme weather and precipitation events, and while their presence can contribute to beneficial rainfall and snowfall, which can mitigate droughts, they can also lead to flooding and extreme winds. This study takes a uniform, global approach that is used to quantify how ARs change between Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 historical simulations and future projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 warming scenarios globally. The projections indicate that while there will be similar to 10% fewer ARs in the future, the ARs will be similar to 25% longer, similar to 25% wider, and exhibit stronger integrated water vapor transports under RCP8.5. These changes result in pronounced increases in the frequency (integrated water vapor transport strength) of AR conditions under RCP8.5: similar to 50% (25%) globally, similar to 50% (20%) in the northern midlatitudes, and similar to 60% (20%) in the southern midlatitudes.

Variable Basal Melt Rates of Antarctic Peninsula Ice Shelves, 1994-2016	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Ice Shelves; Satellite Altimetry; Mass Balance; Climate variability; Antarctic Peninsula	CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; ALTIMETRY; DRIVEN; LAND; FLOW	We have constructed 23-year (1994-2016) time series of Antarctic Peninsula (AP) ice-shelf height change using data from four satellite radar altimeters (ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat, and CryoSat-2). Combining these time series with output from atmospheric and firn models, we partitioned the total height-change signal into contributions from varying surface mass balance, firn state, ice dynamics, and basal mass balance. On the Bellingshausen coast of the AP, ice shelves lost 84 +/- 34Gt a(-1) to basal melting, compared to contributions of 50 +/- 7 Gt a(-1) from surface mass balance and ice dynamics. Net basal melting on the Weddell coast was 51 +/- 71 Gt a(-1). Recent changes in ice-shelf height include increases over major AP ice shelves driven by changes in firn state. Basal melt rates near Bawden Ice Rise, a major pinning point of Larsen C Ice Shelf, showed large increases, potentially leading to substantial loss of buttressing if sustained.

Cloud Feedback Key to Marine Heatwave off Baja California	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; NORTHEAST PACIFIC; IN-SITU; MODEL; ATMOSPHERE; IMPACTS; CLIMATE; SYSTEM	Between 2013 and 2015, the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced the warmest surface temperature anomalies in the modern observational record. This "marine heatwave" marked a shift of Pacific decadal variability to its warm phase and was linked to significant impacts on marine species as well as exceptionally arid conditions in western North America. Here we show that the subtropical signature of this warming, off Baja California, was associated with a record deficit in the spatial coverage of co-located marine boundary layer clouds. This deficit coincided with a large increase in downwelling solar radiation that dominated the anomalous energy budget of the upper ocean, resulting in record-breaking warm sea surface temperature anomalies. Our observation-based analysis suggests that a positive cloud-surface temperature feedback was key to the extreme intensity of the heatwave. The results demonstrate the extent to which boundary layer clouds can contribute to regional variations in climate. Plain Language Summary The northeast Pacific Ocean experienced a "marine heatwave" between 2013 and 2015. This was characterized by the highest surface temperatures ever recorded in a vast swath of the ocean from near the Gulf of Alaska to off the coast of Baja California. The unprecedented warming event was linked to significant impacts on marine life and a severe drought in western North America. We analyze satellite data to show that the heatwave was associated with a record decrease in the typically high cloudiness over an area of the Pacific off Baja California that is roughly half the size of the contiguous United States. Such a deficit in cloud cover coincided with a large increase in the amount of sunlight absorbed by the ocean surface, resulting in extremely warm temperatures. Our findings suggest that a reinforcing interaction (or positive feedback) between clouds and ocean surface temperature can strongly contribute to significant and difficult-to-predict changes in marine climate.

Our analyses make use of a comprehensive set of independent satellite observations collected over decades to show that much larger local changes to cloud (similar to 50%/K) and precipitation (similar to 60%/K) occur than would be expected from the guidance of Clausius-Clapeyron theory (similar to 7%/K). This amplification comes from atmospheric feedbacks involving shifts in the patterns of latent and radiative heating that mutually act on the dynamics enhancing changes to the hydrological cycle. We also confirm the existence of an opposing negative flux feedback at the ocean surface, driven largely by solar radiation changes, that opposes the surface warming. Estimates of the strength of this and other feedback factors associated with warming in the Nino3 region are provided from observations. These observations are also used to examine comparative processes and feedbacks in model experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project. Plain Language Summary It is a widely held paradigm of a warming world the "wet gets wetter and dry drier." It is also argued that in this context precipitation in wet areas is expected to increase at a rate of approximately 7%/K, which is in accordance with expected increases in water vapor availability from elementary theory (the so-called Clausius-Clapeyron response). One of the main wet regions of the planet is the region of deep tropical convection organized into broad convective zones referred to as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, and this region undergoes variability that is often used to test ideas thought to be relevant to climate change. Our study pieces together several independent measurements collected over multiple decades to reveal a strong, positive feedback on tropical convection associated with the short-term climate variations of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. The feedback is a result of coupled dynamical-radiative processes that combine to produce intensification of the tropical hydrological cycle that is more than twice that expected from the CC response alone.

Characterizing biospheric carbon balance using CO2 observations from the OCO-2 satellite	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							GLOBAL FIRE EMISSIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; COLUMN CO2; GOSAT; FLUXES; MODEL; SINKS; XCO2; VARIABILITY	NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite launched in summer of 2014. Its observations could allow scientists to constrain CO2 fluxes across regions or continents that were previously difficult to monitor. This study explores an initial step toward that goal; we evaluate the extent to which current OCO-2 observations can detect patterns in biospheric CO2 fluxes and constrain monthly CO2 budgets. Our goal is to guide top-down, inverse modeling studies and identify areas for future improvement. We find that uncertainties and biases in the individual OCO-2 observations are comparable to the atmospheric signal from biospheric fluxes, particularly during Northern Hemisphere winter when biospheric fluxes are small. A series of top-down experiments indicate how these errors affect our ability to constrain monthly biospheric CO2 budgets. We are able to constrain budgets for between two and four global regions using OCO-2 observations, depending on the month, and we can constrain CO2 budgets at the regional level (i.e., smaller than seven global biomes) in only a handful of cases (16% of all regions and months). The potential of the OCO-2 observations, however, is greater than these results might imply. A set of synthetic data experiments suggests that retrieval errors have a salient effect. Advances in retrieval algorithms and to a lesser extent atmospheric transport modeling will improve the results. In the interim, top-down studies that use current satellite observations are best-equipped to constrain the biospheric carbon balance across only continental or hemispheric regions.

The LP measures solar radiation scattered from the atmospheric limb in ultraviolet and visible spectral ranges between the surface and 80 km. These measurements of scattered solar radiances allow for the retrieval of ozone profiles from cloud tops up to 55 km. The LP started operational observations in April 2012. In this study we evaluate more than 5.5 years of ozone profile measurements from the OMPS LP processed with the new NASA GSFC version 2.5 retrieval algorithm. We provide a brief description of the key changes that had been implemented in this new algorithm, including a pointing correction, new cloud height detection, explicit aerosol correction and a reduction of the number of wavelengths used in the retrievals. The OMPS LP ozone retrievals have been compared with independent satellite profile measurements obtained from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and Odin Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS). We document observed biases and seasonal differences and evaluate the stability of the version 2.5 ozone record over 5.5 years. Our analysis indicates that the mean differences between LP and correlative measurements are well within required +/- 10% between 18 and 42 km. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere (> 43 km) LP tends to have a negative bias. We find larger biases in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, but LP ozone retrievals have significantly improved in version 2.5 compared to version 2 due to the implemented aerosol correction. In the northern high latitudes we observe larger biases between 20 and 32 km due to the remaining thermal sensitivity issue. Our analysis shows that LP ozone retrievals agree well with the correlative satellite observations in characterizing vertical, spatial and temporal ozone distribution associated with natural processes, like the seasonal cycle and quasi-biennial oscillations. We found a small positive drift similar to 0.5% yr(-1) in the LP ozone record against MLS and OSIRIS that is more pronounced at altitudes above 35 km. This pattern in the relative drift is consistent with a possible 100 m drift in the LP sensor pointing detected by one of our altitude-resolving methods.

Folkert			Unexpected slowdown of US pollutant emission reduction in the past decade	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						nitrogen oxides; emission regulations; decadal scale variation	HEAVY-DUTY DIESEL; NOX EMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; DISCOVER-AQ; OZONE; CO; TRENDS; RETRIEVALS; CHEMISTRY; PROFILE	Ground and satellite observations show that air pollution regulations in the United States (US) have resulted in substantial reductions in emissions and corresponding improvements in air quality over the last several decades. However, large uncertainties remain in evaluating how recent regulations affect different emission sectors and pollutant trends. Here we show a significant slowdown in decreasing US emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) for 2011-2015 using satellite and surface measurements. This observed slowdown in emission reductions is significantly different from the trend expected using US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bottom-up inventories and impedes compliance with local and federal agency air-quality goals. We find that the difference between observations and EPA's NOx emission estimates could be explained by: (i) growing relative contributions of industrial, area, and off-road sources, (ii) decreasing relative contributions of on-road gasoline, and (iii) slower than expected decreases in on-road diesel emissions.

The use of incidence angles of 6 and 12 degrees allows for measurement of the directional wave spectrum, which yields accurate corrections of the wave-induced bias in the current measurements. The instrument's design, an algorithm for current vector retrieval and the expected mission performance are presented here. The instrument proposed can reveal features of tropical ocean and marginal ice zone (MIZ) dynamics that are inaccessible to other measurement systems, and providing global monitoring of the ocean mesoscale that surpasses the capability of today's nadir altimeters. Measuring ocean wave properties has many applications, including examining wave-current interactions, air-sea fluxes, the transport and convergence of marine plastic debris and assessment of marine and coastal hazards.

We observed chemical changes in pyroxene, maskelynite (or feldspathic glass), and merrillite in contact with or inside impact melts. All pyroxene grains analyzed here are inside or close to impact melt pockets and contain 10-41 ppm H2O and enriched in D (delta D = +1729 to +3707 parts per thousand), with the highest values found in a grain enclosed in an impact melt pocket. Maskelynite or feldspathic glass contains 6.3 to 98 ppm H2O with delta D values of +1604 to +3938 parts per thousand. The high H2O and delta D values were obtained in those enclosed inside or in contact with the impact melts, whereas low H2O content (4 ppm) and terrestrial-like D/H value (delta D of -90 +/- 82 parts per thousand) were found in one maskelynite grain away from impact melts contains. Rims of similar to 5 mu m thickness of merrillite grains next to impact melts display Na-depletion by similar to 0.9 wt%, and the sides in contact with impact melts show Mg-enrichment by similar to 0.5 wt%. However, the H2O and delta D values of merrillite interiors (39-242 ppm H2O and delta D of +1682 to +3884 parts per thousand) do not show correlation with their proximity to the impact melts. Rather, delta D and 1/H2O of merrillite form a negative trend different from that of impact melt pockets and maskelynite, suggesting post-crystallization or late-crystallization interactions with the crustal fluids.& para;& para;The impact melt pockets in EETA 79001 contain 121-646 ppm H2O, 4.3-13 ppm F, 13-50 ppm Cl, 707-2702 ppm S. and the delta D values of +3368 to +4639 parts per thousand. The correlations between H2O, F. CI, P2O5, and delta D values of impact melts and feldspathic glass are consistent with mixing between a volatile-rich and high delta D (+3000 to +5000%0) endmember and a volatile-poor and low SD endmember. The volatilepoor and low delta D endmember is consistent with magmatic volatiles stored in silicates. The volatile-rich and high delta D endmember represents pre-impact alteration materials by subsurface water. Alteration from the subsurface water, equilibrated with the present-day-like Martian atmosphere, occurred after the crystallization of the rock (similar to 170 Ma) and before impact launch (similar to 0.7 Ma). Our conclusion is different from the previous suggestion of an isotopically distinct subsurface water reservoir with a delta D value of +1000 to +2000 parts per thousand in EETA 79001. Although heterogeneous subsurface water on Mars is possible, the previous study was likely biased by a limited number of analyses (n = 2) and possible terrestrial contamination. The delta D value of the subsurface source in EETA 79001 is similar to+4200 parts per thousand, similar to those in the Tissint meteorite (crystallization at similar to 600 Ma, impact launch at similar to 0.7 Ma) and IAR 06319 (crystallization at similar to 200 Ma, impact launch at similar to 3 Ma), suggesting stable water chemistry for the subsurface environment in the last 600 Myrs.

J	Sui, F; Bux, SK; Kauzlarich, SM				Sui, Fan; Bux, Sabah K.; Kauzlarich, Susan M.			Influence of YbP on the thermoelectric properties of n-type P doped Si95Ge5 alloy	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Thermoelectric materials; Mechanochemical processing; Thermoelectric transport; Silicon	BULK ALLOYS; SILICON; NANOCOMPOSITES	Since the report of high zT in Si95Ge5 there has been significant interest in low Ge alloy compositions for thermoelectric applications. The application of YbP was explored as a means to lower thermal conductivity. A series of 3% phosphorus (P) doped n-type Si95Ge5 (SiGe) alloy was reacted with YbH2 (0, 1, 2%). YbP was formed in the SiGe alloy matrix from the reaction between YbH2 and P during the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) process. Thermoelectric property measurements were performed on sintered pellets from room temperature to 1273 K. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected from the ground powder samples and confirmed the main phase possessed diamond structured Si95Ge5 (space group: Fd (3) over barm) as well as the presence of YbP (space group: Fm (3) over barm). The carrier concentration of the sample was controlled by the amount of YbH2 added, removing some of the phosphorus to form YbP. n-type Si95Ge5 alloy samples with higher YbP amounts showed higher electrical resistivity and lower thermal conductivity attributed to loss of the P dopant. Another composite series of n-type Si95Ge5 with YbP were synthesized with additional P compositions (1, 2%). The thermoelectric properties were characterized from room temperature to 1273 K, and the samples possess electrical resistivity, carrier concentrations, and thermal conductivity as expected from the additional P dopant. The presence of YbP lowered lattice thermal conductivity when the sample was appropriately doped. The Seebeck coefficients were measured with both off-axis and uniaxial axis experimental configurations. These results show that the off-axis measurements overestimate the Seebeck coefficients of the Si95Ge5 alloy samples. This is attributed to a cold finger effect and therefore only the uniaxial data are combined for zT calculations. The n-type Si95Ge5 samples with YbP and less than 3% P dopant show similar zT compared with the Si95Ge5 sample with no YbP inclusions and 3% P dopant with a peak zT of 0.6 at 1200 K.

Spitzer Team; OGLE Collaboration; KMTNet Collaboration	OGLE-2016-BLG-1266: A Probable Brown Dwarf/Planet Binary at the Deuterium Fusion Limit	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; brown dwarfs; gravitational lensing: micro	INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; STARS; DWARF; PLANETS; STELLAR; EARTH; COMPANIONS; PHOTOMETRY; EXOPLANETS; SEARCH	We report the discovery, via the microlensing method, of a new very low mass binary system. By combining measurements from Earth and from the Spitzer telescope in Earth-trailing orbit, we are able to measure the microlensing parallax of the event, and we find that the lens likely consists of a (12.0 +/- 0.6)M-J + (15.7 +/- 1.5) M-J super-Jupiter/brown dwarf pair. The binary is located at a distance of 3.08 +/- 0.18 kpc in the Galactic plane, and the components have a projected separation of 0.43 +/- 0.03 au. Two alternative solutions with much lower likelihoods are also discussed, an 8M(J) and 6M(J) model and a 90M(J) and 70M(J) model. If all photometric measurements were independent and Gaussian distributed with known variances, these alternative solutions would be formally disfavored at the 3 sigma and 5 sigma levels. We show how the more massive of these models could be tested with future direct imaging.	[Albrow, M. D.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Phys & Chem Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Yee, J.

These data reveal the existence of a possible two-component transitional disk system with a radial dust gap of 0.'' 42 +/- 0.'' 05, an azimuthal gap in the HCO+ J = 4-3 moment zero map, as well as two bridge-like features in the gas data. Interestingly these features in the gas disk have no analog in the dust disk making them of particular interest. We modeled the dust disk using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code HOCHUNK3D using a two-disk component. We find that there is a radial gap that extends from 15 to 60 au in all grain sizes, which differs from previous work.

Interplanetary Shocks Inducing Magnetospheric Supersubstorms (SML <-2500nT): Unusual Auroral Morphologies and Energy Flow	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						magnetic reconnection; methods: data analysis; solar wind; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: magnetic fields	2005 JANUARY 20; SUBSTORM ACTIVITY; MAGNETIC-FIELD; EVENTS; STORM; ACCELERATION; CHORUS; PSEUDOBREAKUPS; MAGNETOPAUSE; DEPENDENCES	We present case studies of two interplanetary shock-induced supersubstorms (SSSs) with extremely high intensities (peak SML -4418 and -2668 nT) and long durations (similar to 1.7 and similar to 3.1 hr). The events occurred on 2005 January 21 and 2010 April 5, respectively. It is shown that these SSSs have a different auroral evolution than a nominal Akasofu-type substorm. The auroras associated with the SSSs did not have the standard midnight onset and following expansion. Instead, at the time of the SML index peak, the midnight sector was generally devoid of intense auroras, while the most intense auroras were located in the premidnight and postmidnight magnetic local times. Precursor energy input through magnetic reconnection was insufficient to balance the large ionospheric energy dissipation during the SSSs. It is argued that besides the release of stored magnetotail energy during the SSSs, these were powered by additional direct driving through both dayside magnetic reconnection and solar wind ram energy.

Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report: Present-day distribution and trends of tropospheric ozone relevant to climate and global atmospheric chemistry model evaluation	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						tropospheric ozone; ground-level ozone; Tropospheric composition and chemistry; Global tropospheric ozone burden; Ozone trends	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER MODEL; LONG-TERM CHANGES; MONITORING-EXPERIMENT GOME; MOZAIC AIRBORNE PROGRAM; RISING ASIAN EMISSIONS; GROUND-BASED LIDAR; US AIR-QUALITY; SURFACE OZONE; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; PROFILE RETRIEVALS	The Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) is an activity of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project. This paper is a component of the report, focusing on the present-day distribution and trends of tropospheric ozone relevant to climate and global atmospheric chemistry model evaluation. Utilizing the TOAR surface ozone database, several figures present the global distribution and trends of daytime average ozone at 2702 non-urban monitoring sites, highlighting the regions and seasons of the world with the greatest ozone levels. Similarly, ozonesonde and commercial aircraft observations reveal ozone's distribution throughout the depth of the free troposphere. Long-term surface observations are limited in their global spatial coverage, but data from remote locations indicate that ozone in the 21st century is greater than during the 1970s and 1980s. While some remote sites and many sites in the heavily polluted regions of East Asia show ozone increases since 2000, many others show decreases and there is no clear global pattern for surface ozone changes since 2000. Two new satellite products provide detailed views of ozone in the lower troposphere across East Asia and Europe, revealing the full spatial extent of the spring and summer ozone enhancements across eastern China that cannot be assessed from limited surface observations. Sufficient data are now available (ozonesondes, satellite, aircraft) across the tropics from South America eastwards to the western Pacific Ocean, to indicate a likely tropospheric column ozone increase since the 1990s. The 2014-2016 mean tropospheric ozone burden (TOB) between 60 degrees N-60 degrees S from five satellite products is 300 Tg +/- 4%. While this agreement is excellent, the products differ in their quantification of TOB trends and further work is required to reconcile the differences. Satellites can now estimate ozone's global long-wave radiative effect, but evaluation is difficult due to limited in situ observations where the radiative effect is greatest.	[Gaudel, A.; Cooper, O.

We derive the component structure seen in absorption at visible wavelengths from Ca II, CaI, KI, CH, CH+, and CN and compare it to emission from H I, CO and its isotopologues, and C+ from the GOT C+ survey. The correspondence between components in emission and absorption helps create a more unified picture of diffuse atomic and molecular gas in the interstellar medium. We also discuss how these tracers are related to the CO-dark H-2 gas probed by C+ emission and discuss the kinematic connections among the species observed.	[Rice, Johnathan S.; Federman, S.

Instantaneous variance scaling of AIRS thermodynamic profiles using a circular area Monte Carlo approach	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MESOSCALE ENERGY-SPECTRA; WATER-VAPOR; KINETIC-ENERGY; TEMPERATURE; CLOUD; INVARIANCE; TURBULENCE; PREDICTABILITY; AIRS/AMSU/HSB; FLUCTUATIONS	Satellite observations are used to obtain vertical profiles of variance scaling of temperature (T) and specific humidity (q) in the atmosphere. A higher spatial resolution nadir retrieval at 13.5 km complements previous Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) investigations with 45 km resolution retrievals and enables the derivation of power law scaling exponents to length scales as small as 55 km. We introduce a variable-sized circular-area Monte Carlo methodology to compute exponents instantaneously within the swath of AIRS that yields additional insight into scaling behavior. While this method is approximate and some biases are likely to exist within non-Gaussian portions of the satellite observational swaths of T and q, this method enables the estimation of scale-dependent behavior within instantaneous swaths for individual tropical and extratropical systems of interest. Scaling exponents are shown to fluctuate between beta = -1 and -3 at scales >= 500 km, while at scales <= 500 km they are typically near beta approximate to -2, with q slightly lower than T at the smallest scales observed. In the extratropics, the large-scale beta is near -3. Within the tropics, however, the large-scale beta for T is closer to -1 as small-scale moist convective processes dominate. In the tropics, q exhibits large-scale beta between -2 and -3. The values of beta are generally consistent with previous works of either time-averaged spatial variance estimates, or aircraft observations that require averaging over numerous flight observational segments. The instantaneous variance scaling methodology is relevant for cloud parameterization development and the assessment of time variability of scaling exponents.

The Southeast US is a major source region for methane including large contributions from oil and gas production and wetlands. Our inversion uses state-of-the-art emission inventories as prior estimates, including a gridded version of the anthropogenic EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory and the mean of the WetCHARTs ensemble for wetlands. Inversion results are independently verified by comparison with surface (NOAA/ESRL) and column (TCCON) methane observations. Our posterior estimates for the SoutheastUS are 12.8 +/- 0.9Tga(-1) for anthropogenic sources (no significant change from the gridded EPA inventory) and 9.4 +/- 0.8 Tga(-1) for wetlands (27 % decrease from the mean in the WetCHARTs ensemble). The largest source of error in the WetCHARTs wetlands ensemble is the land cover map specification of wetland areal extent. Our results support the accuracy of the EPA anthropogenic inventory on a regional scale but there are significant local discrepancies for oil and gas production fields, suggesting that emission factors are more variable than assumed in the EPA inventory.

Exoplanet Biosignatures: A Review of Remotely Detectable Signs of Life	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Exoplanets; Biosignatures; Habitability markers; Photosynthesis; Planetary surfaces; Atmospheres; Spectroscopy; Cryptic biospheres; False positives	EARTH-LIKE PLANETS; MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION; COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; LARGE-SCALE ORGANIZATION; ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; METHYL-CHLORIDE; HABITABLE ZONE; M-STARS; TERRESTRIAL PLANETS; SPECTRAL SIGNATURES	In the coming years and decades, advanced space- and ground-based observatories will allow an unprecedented opportunity to probe the atmospheres and surfaces of potentially habitable exoplanets for signatures of life. Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties, has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.

Although these comparisons have been a critical component in our understanding of the Greenland ice sheet sensitivity to past warming, they often rely on modeling experiments that favor minimizing computational expense over increased model physics. Over Paleoclimate timescales, simulating the thermal structure of the ice sheet has large implications on the modeled ice viscosity, which can feedback onto the basal sliding and ice flow. To accurately capture the thermal field, models often require a high number of vertical layers. This is not the case for the stress balance computation, however, where a high vertical resolution is not necessary. Consequently, since stress balance and thermal equations are generally performed on the same mesh, more time is spent on the stress balance computation than is otherwise necessary. For these reasons, running a higher-order ice sheet model (e.g., Blatter-Pattyn) over timescales equivalent to the paleoclimate record has not been possible without incurring a large computational expense. To mitigate this issue, we propose a method that can be implemented within ice sheet models, whereby the vertical interpolation along the z axis relies on higher-order polynomials, rather than the traditional linear interpolation. This method is tested within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) using quadratic and cubic finite elements for the vertical interpolation on an idealized case and a realistic Greenland configuration. A transient experiment for the ice thickness evolution of a single-dome ice sheet demonstrates improved accuracy using the higher-order vertical interpolation compared to models using the linear vertical interpolation, despite having fewer degrees of freedom. This method is also shown to improve a model's ability to capture sharp thermal gradients in an ice sheet particularly close to the bed, when compared to models using a linear vertical interpolation. This is corroborated in a thermal steady-state simulation of the Greenland ice sheet using a higher-order model. In general, we find that using a higher-order vertical interpolation decreases the need for a high number of vertical layers, while dramatically reducing model runtime for transient simulations. Results indicate that when using a higher-order vertical interpolation, runtimes for a transient ice sheet relaxation are upwards of 5 to 7 times faster than using a model which has a linear vertical interpolation, and this thus requires a higher number of vertical layers to achieve a similar result in simulated ice volume, basal temperature, and ice divide thickness. The findings suggest that this method will allow higher-order models to be used in studies investigating ice sheet behavior over paleoclimate timescales at a fraction of the computational cost than would otherwise be needed for a model using a linear vertical interpolation.

Observations and simulations of the seasonal evolution of snowpack cold content and its relation to snowmelt and the snowpack energy budget	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							WESTERN UNITED-STATES; COLORADO FRONT RANGE; SUB-ALPINE FORESTS; WATER AVAILABILITY; MODEL COMPLEXITY; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; SIERRA-NEVADA; LATENT-HEAT; NIWOT RIDGE; LONG-TERM	Cold content is a measure of a snowpack's energy deficit and is a linear function of snowpack mass and temperature. Positive energy fluxes into a snowpack must first satisfy the remaining energy deficit before snowmelt runoff begins, making cold content a key component of the snowpack energy budget. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounds cold content development and its relationship to snowmelt, likely because of a lack of direct observations. This work clarifies the controls exerted by air temperature, precipitation, and negative energy fluxes on cold content development and quantifies the relationship between cold content and snowmelt timing and rate at daily to seasonal timescales. The analysis presented herein leverages a unique long-term snow pit record along with validated output from the SNOWPACK model forced with 23 water years (1991-2013) of quality controlled, infilled hourly meteorological data from an alpine and subalpine site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The results indicated that precipitation exerted the primary control on cold content development at our two sites with snowfall responsible for 84.4 and 73.0% of simulated daily gains in the alpine and subalpine, respectively. A negative surface energy balance - primarily driven by sublimation and longwave radiation emission from the snowpack - during days without snowfall provided a secondary pathway for cold content development, and was responsible for the remaining 15.6 and 27.0% of cold content additions. Non-zero cold content values were associated with reduced snowmelt rates and delayed snowmelt onset at daily to sub-seasonal timescales, while peak cold content magnitude had no significant relationship to seasonal snowmelt timing. These results suggest that the information provided by cold content observations and/or simulations is most relevant to snowmelt processes at shorter timescales, and may help water resource managers to better predict melt onset and rate.

When exposed to liquid water, organic molecules analogous to those found on Titan produce a range of biomolecules such as amino acids. Titan thus provides a natural laboratory for studying the products of prebiotic chemistry. In this work, we examine the ideal locales to search for evidence of, or progression toward, life on Titan. We determine that the best sites to identify biological molecules are deposits of impact melt on the floors of large, fresh impact craters, specifically Sinlap, Selk, and Menrva craters. We find that it is not possible to identify biomolecules on Titan through remote sensing, but rather through in situ measurements capable of identifying a wide range of biological molecules. Given the nonuniformity of impact melt exposures on the floor of a weathered impact crater, the ideal lander would be capable of precision targeting. This would allow it to identify the locations of fresh impact melt deposits, and/or sites where the melt deposits have been exposed through erosion or mass wasting. Determining the extent of prebiotic chemistry within these melt deposits would help us to understand how life could originate on a world very different from Earth.

Amplified Sensitivity of Nitrogen-Vacancy Spins in Nanodiamonds Using All-Optical Charge Readout	ACS NANO			English	Article						nitrogen-vacancy center; nanodiamond; sensing; charge dynamics; spin relaxometry	ELECTRON-SPIN; DIAMOND; FLUORESCENCE; CENTERS; SPECTROSCOPY; NANOSENSORS; DEFECTS; PHYSICS; QUBIT	Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers offer a versatile platform for sensing applications spanning from nanomagnetism to in vivo monitoring of cellular processes. In many cases, however, weak optical signals and poor contrast demand long acquisition times that prevent the measurement of environmental dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the ability to perform fast, high-contrast optical measurements of charge distributions in ensembles of NV centers in nanodiamonds and use the technique to improve the spin-readout signal-to-noise ratio through spin-to-charge conversion. A study of 38 nanodiamonds with sizes ranging between 20 and 70 inn, each hosting a small ensemble of NV centers, uncovers complex, multiple time scale dynamics due to radiative and nonradiative ionization and recombination processes. Nonetheless, the NV-containing nanodiamonds universally exhibit charge-dependent photoluminescence contrasts and the potential for enhanced spin readout using spin-to-charge conversion. We use the technique to speed up a T-1, relaxometry measurement by a factor of 5.

The star is relatively nearby (d = 69 pc) and bright (V = 10.7 mag, K-S = 8.4 mag), making the planetary system an attractive target for radial velocity follow-up and atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope. The inner two planets are hot super-Earths (R-b = 1.40 +/- 0.06 R-circle plus, R-c = 1.34 +/- 0.08 R-circle plus), while the outer planet is a warm sub-Neptune (R-d = 2.6 +/- 0.1 R-circle plus). We estimate the stellar age to be 360(-140)(+490) Myr based on rotation, activity, and kinematic indicators. The K2-233 system is particularly interesting given recent evidence for inflated radii in planets around similarly aged stars, a trend potentially related to photo-evaporation, core cooling, or both mechanisms.

The HOSTS Survey-Exozodiacal Dust Measurements for 30 Stars	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; infrared: stars; planetary systems; techniques: interferometric; zodiacal dust	MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; RAPIDLY ROTATING STAR; SUN-LIKE STARS; P-R DRAG; DEBRIS DISKS; EPSILON-ERIDANI; ETA-CORVI; STELLAR INTERFEROMETRY; CIRCUMSTELLAR MATERIAL; CALIBRATOR STARS	The Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems survey searches for dust near the habitable zones (HZs) around nearby, bright main-sequence stars. We use nulling interferometry in the N band to suppress the bright stellar light and to probe for low levels of HZ dust around the 30 stars observed so far. Our overall detection rate is 18%, including four new detections, among which are the first three around Sun-like stars and the first two around stars without any previously known circumstellar dust. The inferred occurrence rates are comparable for early-type and Sun-like stars, but decrease from 60(-21)(+16)% for stars with previously detected cold dust to 8(-3)(+10)% for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at higher sensitivity. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal excess luminosity function, we put upper limits on the median HZ dust level of 13 zodis (95% confidence) for a sample of stars without cold dust and of 26 zodis when focusing on Sun-like stars without cold dust. However, our data suggest that a more complex luminosity function may be more appropriate. For stars without detectable Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) excess, our upper limits are almost reduced by a factor of two, demonstrating the strength of LBTI target vetting for future exo-Earth imaging missions. Our statistics are limited so far, and extending the survey is critical to informing the design of future exo-Earth imaging surveys.	[Ertel, S.; Hinz, P.; Hoffmann, W.

MOA Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration; KMTNet Collaboration	OGLE-2017-BLG-0482Lb: A Microlensing Super-Earth Orbiting a Low-mass Host Star	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems	GALACTIC BULGE; BINARY-SOURCE; PLANET; PHOTOMETRY; SYSTEMS	We report the discovery of a planetary system in which a super-Earth orbits a late M-dwarf host. The planetary system was found from the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-0482, wherein the planet signal appears as a short-term anomaly to the smooth lensing light curve produced by the host. Despite its weak signal and short duration, the planetary signal was firmly detected from the dense and continuous coverage by three microlensing surveys. We find a planet/host mass ratio of q similar to 1.4 x 10(-4). We measure the microlens parallax pi(E) from the long-term deviation in the observed lensing light curve, but the angular Einstein radius theta(E) cannot be measured because the source trajectory did not cross the planet-induced caustic. Using the measured event timescale and the microlens parallax, we find that the masses of the planet and the host are M-p = 9.0(-4.5)(+9.0) M-circle plus and M-host = 0.20(-0.10)(+0.20) M-circle dot, respectively, and the projected separation between them is a(perpendicular to) = 1.8(-0.7)(+0.6) au. The estimated distance to the lens is D-L = 5.8(-2.1)(+1.8) kpc. The discovery of the planetary system demonstrates that microlensing provides an important method to detect low-mass planets orbiting low-mass stars.

Rotation of Low-mass Stars in Upper Scorpius and rho Ophiuchus with K2	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars: low-mass; stars: pre-main sequence	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; T-TAURI STARS; ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SOLAR-TYPE STARS; ANGULAR-MOMENTUM EVOLUTION; ALPHA-PERSEI CLUSTER; LARGE-AREA SEARCH; SKY SURVEY 2MASS; STELLAR ROTATION; OB ASSOCIATION	We present an analysis of K2 light curves (LCs) for candidate members of the young Upper Sco (USco) association (similar to 8 Myr) and the neighboring rho Oph embedded cluster (similar to 1 Myr). We establish similar to 1300 stars as probable members, similar to 80% of which are periodic. The phased LCs have a variety of shapes which can be attributed to physical causes ranging from stellar pulsation and stellar rotation to disk-related phenomena. We identify and discuss a number of observed behaviors. The periods are similar to 0.2-30 days with a peak near 2 days and the rapid period end nearing breakup velocity. M stars in the young USco region rotate systematically faster than GK stars, a pattern also present in K2 data for the older Pleiades and Praesepe systems. At higher masses (types FGK), the well-defined period-color relationship for slowly rotating stars seen in the Pleiades and Praesepe systems is not yet present in USco. Circumstellar disks are present predominantly among the more slowly rotating M stars in USco, with few disks in the subday rotators. However, M dwarfs with disks rotate faster on average than FGK systems with disks. For four of these disked M dwarfs, we provide direct evidence for disk locking based on the K2 LC morphologies. Our preliminary analysis shows a relatively mass-independent spin-up by a factor of similar to 3.5 between USco and the Pleiades, then mass-dependent spin-down between Pleiades and Praesepe.

The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard NASA's Terra satellite is one of few satellite aerosol sensors providing information of aerosol shape, size and extinction globally for a long and continuous period that can be used to estimate PM2.5 speciation concentrations since year 2000. Currently, MISR only provides a 17.6 km product for its entire mission with global coverage every 9 days, a bit too coarse for air pollution health effects research and to capture local spatial variability of PM2.5 speciation. In this study, generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed using MISR prototype 4.4 km-resolution aerosol data with meteorological variables and geographical indicators, to predict ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in Southern California between 2001 and 2015 at the daily level. The GAMs are able to explain 66%, 62%, 55% and 58% of the daily variability in PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC concentrations during the whole study period, respectively. Predicted concentrations capture large regional patterns as well as fine gradients of the four PM2.5 species in urban areas of Los Angeles and other counties, as well as in the Central Valley. This study is the first attempt to use MISR prototype 4.4 km-resolution AOD (aerosol optical depth) components data to predict PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC concentrations at the sub-regional scale. In spite of its low temporal sampling frequency, our analysis suggests that the MISR 4.4 km fractional AODs provide a promising way to capture the spatial hotspots and long-term temporal trends of PM2.5 speciation, understand the effectiveness of air quality controls, and allow our estimated PM2.5 speciation data to be linked with common spatial units such as census tract or zip code in epidemiological studies. This modeling strategy needs to be validated in other regions when more MISR 4.4 km data becoming available in the future.

Global temperature definition affects achievement of long-term climate goals	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; carbon budgets; global warming; Paris agreement; observational temperature records	SURFACE; MODELS; BUDGET; AIR	The Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit 'global average temperature' rise to 'well below 2 degrees C' but reported temperature depends on choices about how to blend air and water temperature data, handle changes in sea ice and account for regions with missing data. Here we use CMIP5 climate model simulations to estimate how these choices affect reported warming and carbon budgets consistent with the Paris Agreement. By the 2090s, under a low-emissions scenario, modelled global near-surface air temperature rise is 15% higher (5%-95% range 6%-21%) than that estimated by an approach similar to the HadCRUT4 observational record. The difference reduces to 8% with global data coverage, or 4% with additional removal of a bias associated with changing sea-ice cover. Comparison of observational datasets with different data sources or infilling techniques supports our model results regarding incomplete coverage. From high-emission simulations, we find that a HadCRUT4 like definition means higher carbon budgets and later exceedance of temperature thresholds, relative to global near-surface air temperature. 2 degrees C warming is delayed by seven years on average, to 2048 (2035-2060), and CO2 emissions budget for a >50% chance of <2 degrees C warming increases by 67 GtC (246 GtCO(2)).

Geological Evolution of Titan's Equatorial Regions: Possible Nature and Origin of the Dune Material	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Titan surface; Cassini; infrared and radar observations; geological processes	HUYGENS LANDING SITE; CASSINI VIMS; COUPLING PHOTOCHEMISTRY; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; ADAPTIVE OPTICS; FLUVIAL EROSION; HAZE FORMATION; MU-M; SURFACE; RADAR	In 13years, infrared observations from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard Cassini provided significant hints about the spectral and geological diversity of Titan's surface. The analysis of the infrared (IR) signature of spectral units enables constraining the surface composition, which is crucial for understanding possible interactions between Titan's interior, surface, and atmosphere. Here we investigate a selection of areas in the equatorial regions, imaged by Cassini's instruments, which exhibit an apparent transition from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer IR-bright to the IR-blue and IR-brown units (from false-color composites using red: 1.57/1.27m, green: 2.01/1.27m, and blue: 1.27/1.08m). By applying an updated radiative transfer model, we extract the surface albedo of IR units identified in these regions. Then, we compare them with synthetic mixtures of two expected components on Titan's surface, namely, water ice and laboratory tholins. This allows us to reconnect the derived composition and grain size information to the geomorphology observed from Radio Detection and Ranging instrument (RADAR)/Synthetic Aperture Radar images. We interpret IR-bright units as hills and plains coated by organic material and incised by fluvial networks. Erosion products are transported downstream to areas where IR-blue units are seen near the IR-bright units. These units, enriched in water ice, are most likely outwash plains hosting debris from fluvial erosion. Farther away from the IR-bright units, the IR-brown units are dominantly made of organics with varied grain sizes, ranging from dust- to sand-sized particles that form the dune fields. The transition areas therefore exhibit trends in water ice content and grain size supported by geomorphological observations.	[Brossier, J.

Diverse Lithologies and Alteration Events on the Rim of Noachian-Aged Endeavour Crater, Meridiani Planum, Mars: In Situ Compositional Evidence	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars Exploration Rover; Endeavour Crater; geochemistry; impact breccia; Mars alteration	VNIR MULTISPECTRAL OBSERVATIONS; SUEVITE REVISITED-OBSERVATIONS; GUSEV CRATER; GALE CRATER; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; AQUEOUS PROCESSES; ONAPING FORMATION; BURNS FORMATION; SPIRIT ROVER; RIES SUEVITE	We report the results of geological studies by the Opportunity Mars rover on the Endeavour Crater rim. Four major units occur in the region (oldest to youngest): the Matijevic, Shoemaker, Grasberg, and Burns formations. The Matijevic formation, consisting of fine-grained clastic sediments, is the only pre-Endeavour-impact unit and might be part of the Noachian etched units of Meridiani Planum. The Shoemaker formation is a heterogeneous polymict impact breccia; its lowermost member incorporates material eroded from the underlying Matijevic formation. The Shoemaker formation is a close analog to the Bunte Breccia of the Ries Crater, although the average clast sizes are substantially larger in the latter. The Grasberg formation is a thin, fine-grained, homogeneous sediment unconformably overlying the Shoemaker formation and likely formed as an airfall deposit of unknown areal extent. The Burns formation sandstone overlies the Grasberg, but compositions of the two units are distinct; there is no evidence that the Grasberg formation is a fine-grained subfacies of the Burns formation. The rocks along the Endeavour Crater rim were affected by at least four episodes of alteration in the Noachian and Early Hesperian: (i) vein formation and alteration of preimpact Matijevic formation rocks, (ii) low-water/rock alteration along the disconformity between the Matijevic and Shoemaker formations, (iii) alteration of the Shoemaker formation along fracture zones, and (iv) differential mobilization of Fe and Mn, and CaSO4-vein formation in the Grasberg and Shoemaker formations. Episodes (ii) and (iii) possibly occurred together, but (i) and (iv) are distinct from either of these.

Jupiter's Aurora Observed With HST During Juno Orbits 3 to 7	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Jupiter; aurora; Hubble; Juno; magnetosphere	HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; JOVIAN AURORA; SATELLITE FOOTPRINTS; JANUARY 2014; MAGNETOSPHERE; OVAL; EMISSION; FLUX; NORTHERN	A large set of observations of Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora was collected with the Hubble Space Telescope concurrently with the NASA-Juno mission, during an eight-month period, from 30 November 2016 to 18 July 2017. These Hubble observations cover Juno orbits 3 to 7 during which Juno in situ and remote sensing instruments, as well as other observatories, obtained a wealth of unprecedented information on Jupiter's magnetosphere and the connection with its auroral ionosphere. Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora is known to vary rapidly, with timescales ranging from seconds to one Jovian rotation. The main objective of the present study is to provide a simplified description of the global ultraviolet auroral morphology that can be used for comparison with other quantities, such as those obtained with Juno. This represents an entirely new approach from which logical connections between different morphologies may be inferred. For that purpose, we define three auroral subregions in which we evaluate the auroral emitted power as a function of time. In parallel, we define six auroral morphology families that allow us to quantify the variations of the spatial distribution of the auroral emission. These variations are associated with changes in the state of the Jovian magnetosphere, possibly influenced by Io and the Io plasma torus and by the conditions prevailing in the upstream interplanetary medium. This study shows that the auroral morphology evolved differently during the five similar to 2week periods bracketing the times of Juno perijove (PJ03 to PJ07), suggesting that during these periods, the Jovian magnetosphere adopted various states.

A Physical Model of the Proton Radiation Belts of Jupiter inside Europa's Orbit	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Jupiter; proton; radiation belts; physical modeling; wave-particle interaction	TRANSFER CROSS-SECTIONS; SHORT-TERM VARIATION; ENERGETIC PARTICLES; JOVIAN MAGNETOSPHERE; MAGNETIC-FIELD; PIONEER 11; DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; EQUATORIAL PARTICLES; PLASMA TORUS; HEAVY-ION	A physical model of the Jovian trapped protons with kinetic energies higher than 1MeV inward of the orbit of the icy moon Europa is presented. The model, named Salammbo, takes into account the radial diffusion process, the absorption effect of the Jovian moons, and the Coulomb collisions and charge exchanges with the cold plasma and neutral populations of the inner Jovian magnetosphere. Preliminary modeling of the wave-particle interaction with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves near the moon Io is also performed. Salammbo is validated against in situ proton measurements of Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Galileo Probe, and Galileo Orbiter. A prominent feature of the MeV proton intensity distribution in the modeled area is the 2 orders of magnitude flux depletion observed in MeV measurements near the orbit of Io. Our simulations reveal that this is not due to direct interactions with the moon or its neutral environment but results from scattering of the protons by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves.

Zuccaro		JEM-EUSO Collaboration	First observations of speed of light tracks by a fluorescence detector looking down on the atmosphere	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Detectors for UV, visible and IR photons; Lasers; Balloon instrumentation; Space instrumentation		EUSO-Balloon is a pathfinder mission for the Extreme Universe Space Observatory onboard the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO). It was launched on the moonless night of the 25(th) of August 2014 from Timmins, Canada. The flight ended successfully after maintaining the target altitude of 38 km for five hours. One part of the mission was a 2.5 hour underflight using a helicopter equipped with three UV light sources (LED, xenon flasher and laser) to perform an inflight calibration and examine the detectors capability to measure tracks moving at the speed of light. We describe the helicopter laser system and details of the underflight as well as how the laser tracks were recorded and found in the data. These are the first recorded laser tracks measured from a fluorescence detector looking down on the atmosphere. Finally, we present a first reconstruction of the direction of the laser tracks relative to the detector.

This analysis is carried out for galaxies that are selected only by its photometric redshift. An extensive analysis of the systematic effects, using new methods based on simulations is performed, including a Monte Carlo sampling of the selection function of the survey.

High-speed photometry of Gaia14aae: an eclipsing AMCVn that challenges formation models	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						binaries: close; binaries: eclipsing; stars: dwarf novae; stars: individual: Gaia14aae; novae, cataclysmic variables; white dwarfs	AM-CANUM-VENATICORUM; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; MINIMUM ORBITAL PERIOD; WHITE-DWARF; CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES; CVN SYSTEMS; CLOSE BINARIES; X-RAY; ACCRETION DISK; MASS-TRANSFER	AMCVn-type systems are ultracompact, hydrogen-deficient accreting binaries with degenerate or semidegenerate donors. The evolutionary history of these systems can be explored by constraining the properties of their donor stars. We present high-speed photometry of Gaia14aae, an AMCVn with a binary period of 49. 7 min and the first AMCVn in which the central white dwarf is fully eclipsed by the donor star. Modelling of the light curves of this system allows for the most precise measurement to date of the donor mass of an AMCVn, and relies only on geometric and well-tested physical assumptions. We find a mass ratio q = M-2/M-1 = 0.0287 +/- 0.0020 and masses M-1 = 0.87 +/- 0.02M(circle dot) and M-2 = 0.0250 +/- 0.0013M(circle dot). We compare these properties to the three proposed channels for AMCVn formation. Our measured donor mass and radius do not fit with the contraction that is predicted for AMCVn donors descended from white dwarfs or helium stars at long orbital periods. The donor properties we measure fall in a region of parameter space in which systems evolved from hydrogen-dominated cataclysmic variables are expected, but such systems should show spectroscopic hydrogen, which is not seen in Gaia14aae. The evolutionary history of this system is therefore not clear. We consider a helium-burning star or an evolved cataclysmic variable to be the most likely progenitors, but both models require additional processes and/or fine-tuning to fit the data. Additionally, we calculate an updated ephemeris which corrects for an anomalous time measurement in the previously published ephemeris.	[Green, M. J.; Marsh, T. R.; Steeghs, D. T. H.; Ashley, R.

A measurement of CMB cluster lensing with SPT and DES year 1 data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmic background radiation	CALIBRATION; PHYSICS; IMPACT	Clusters of galaxies gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, resulting in a distinct imprint in the CMB on arcminute scales. Measurement of this effect offers a promising way to constrain the masses of galaxy clusters, particularly those at high redshift. We use CMB maps from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) survey to measure the CMB lensing signal around galaxy clusters identified in optical imaging from first year observations of the Dark Energy Survey. The cluster catalogue used in this analysis contains 3697 members with mean redshift of (z) over bar = 0.45. We detect lensing of the CMB by the galaxy clusters at 8.1 sigma significance. Using the measured lensing signal, we constrain the amplitude of the relation between cluster mass and optical richness to roughly 17 per cent precision, finding good agreement with recent constraints obtained with galaxy lensing. The error budget is dominated by statistical noise but includes significant contributions from systematic biases due to the thermal SZ effect and cluster miscentring.	[Baxter, E. J.; D'Andrea, C.

Low-amplitude clustering in low-redshift 21-cm intensity maps cross-correlated with 2dF galaxy densities	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						line: identification; galaxies: evolution; large-scale structure of Universe	HALO OCCUPATION DISTRIBUTION; POWER-SPECTRUM; H-I; VIRGO CLUSTER; RADIO-SOURCES; DATA RELEASE; MASS; HYDROGEN; UNIVERSE; CATALOG	We report results from 21-cm intensity maps acquired from the Parkes radio telescope and cross-correlatedwith galaxy maps from the 2dF galaxy survey. The data span the redshift range 0.057 < z < 0.098 and cover approximately 1300 deg(2) over two long fields. Cross-correlation is detected at a significance of 5.7 sigma. The amplitude of the cross-power spectrum is low relative to the expected dark matter power spectrum, assuming a neutral hydrogen (H-I) bias andmass density equal to measurements from the ALFALFA survey. The decrement is pronounced and statistically significant at small scales. At k similar to 1.5 h Mpc(-1), the cross-power spectrum is more than a factor of 6 lower than expected, with a significance of 15.3 sigma. This decrement indicates a lack of clustering of neutral hydrogen (H-I), a small correlation coefficient between optical galaxies and H-I, or some combination of the two. Separating 2dF into red and blue galaxies, we find that red galaxies are much more weakly correlated with H-I on k similar to 1.5 h Mpc(-1) scales, suggesting that H-I is more associated with blue star-forming galaxies and tends to avoid red galaxies.

We developed a new automated protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos [clean]), that outperforms single-tube extractions while processing at least five times as fast. KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% (standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n = 192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n = 388, 337), and an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (n = 192, 123), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm, with four (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., and Novosphingobium) being present in >75% of the samples. According to microbial spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffii, is related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious disease, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine environment rather than human input. Consequently, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using the KatharoSeq protocol. IMPORTANCE Various indoor, outdoor, and host-associated environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits and methods to determine the limit of detection of these pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.

The soil moisture dynamics given by the change in soil moisture between two time periods can provide information on the intensification or improvement of drought conditions. The aim of this work is to analyze how the soil moisture dynamics respond to changes in drought conditions over multiple time intervals. The change in soil moisture estimated from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite observations was compared with the United States Drought Monitor (USDM) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The results indicated that the soil moisture change over 13-week and 26-week intervals is able to capture the changes in drought intensity levels in the USDM, and the change over a four-week interval correlated well with the one-month SPI values. This suggested that a short-term negative soil moisture change may indicate a lack of precipitation, whereas a persistent long-term negative soil moisture change may indicate severe drought conditions. The results further indicate that the inclusion of soil moisture change will add more value to the existing drought-monitoring products.

At low radar frequencies, e.g. L-band (1.2 GHz) but also at higher frequency, e.g. C-band (5.6 GHz), the ionosphere has been documented to be an important source of noise in these data. In this paper, we employ a split-spectrum technique and investigate its performance for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice velocity measurements in Greenland and Antarctica. Three case studies using ALOS PALSAR data are used to assess the performance of the split spectrum technique for ionosphere correction over a range of environmental parameters. We employ several approaches to evaluate the results, including visual inspection, profile analysis, comparison of experimental and theoretic errors, comparison with reference data from other sources, generation of double difference interferograms, and analysis of time series of multi-temporal data. Our experiments show that ionospheric distortions are observed regularly, and in our analyzed Greenland dataset and Antarctic dataset the ionospheric noise reaches 14 m/yr and 10 m/yr, respectively, which exceeds the signal associated with ice motion. Our analysis using several different approaches demonstrates that the split-spectrum technique provides an effective correction. The split spectrum technique is also found to be superior to currently used approaches such as baseline fitting and multi-temporal averaging. The noise level is reduced by a factor of 70% in Greenland test areas and 90% in Antarctic test areas.

Airborne small-footprint waveform lidar data are increasingly used for vegetation classification and above-ground carbon estimates at a range of spatial scales in woody or homogeneous grass and savanna ecosystems. However, a gap remains in understanding how waveform features represent and ultimately can be used to constrain the PFTs in heterogeneous semi-arid ecosystems. This study evaluates lidar waveform features and classification performance of six major PFTs, including shrubs and trees, along with bare ground in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA. Waveform lidar data were obtained with the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). From these data we derived waveform features at two spatial scales (1 m and 10 m rasters) by applying a Gaussian decomposition and a frequency-domain deconvolution. An ensemble random forest algorithm was used to assess classification performance and to select the most important waveform features. Classification models developed with the 10 m waveform features outperformed those at 1 m (Kappa (kappa) = 0.81-0.86 vs. 0.60-0.70, respectively). At 1 m resolution, lidar height features improved the PFT classification accuracy by 10% compared to the analysis without these features. However, at 10 m resolution, the inclusion of lidar derived heights with other waveform features decreased the PFT classification performance by 4%. Pulse width, rise time, percent energy, differential target cross section, and radiometrically calibrated backscatter coefficient were the most important waveform features at both spatial scales. A significant finding is that bare ground was clearly differentiated from shrubs using pulse width. Though the overall accuracy ranges between 0.72 and 0.89 across spatial scales, the two shrub PFTs showed 0.45-0.87 individual classification success at 1 m, while bare ground and tree PFTs showed high (0.72-1.0) classification accuracy at 10 m. We conclude that small-footprint waveform features can be used to characterize the heterogeneous vegetation in this and similar semi-arid ecosystems at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, waveform features such as pulse width can be used to constrain the uncertainty of terrain modeling in environments where vegetation and bare ground lidar returns are close in time and space. The dependency on spatial resolution plays a critical role in classification performance in tree-shrub co-dominant ecosystems.

This study assesses the impact of these factors on simulating the SMAP horizontally (p = H) and vertically (p = V) polarized T-B(P) K-measurements and retrieving the liquid soil water content (theta(liq)) for both frozen and thawed soils in the typical Tibetan desert and meadow ecosystems. For this investigation, the zero-order approximation of the radiative transfer equations, i.e., tau-omega emission model, is configured with surface roughness and tau(P) parameterizations adopted by current SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithms, and the es is computed with the four-phase dielectric mixing model that epsilon(s) is applicable for both frozen and thawed soils. For the Tibetan desert site, the tau-omega emission model with above configurations underestimates year-round the SMAP T-B(H) measurements (bias > 20 K), while T-B(V) are underestimated during the cold season. Implementation of a new surface roughness parameterization reduces the T-B(H) underestimation, and the improved T-B(P) simulations lead to better theta(liq) retrievals produced by the single channel algorithm (SCA) using the T-B(V) as well as T-B(H) measurements. The remaining T-B(H) and T-B(V) underestimations are removed by further adopting a new epsilon(s) parameterization. For the Tibetan meadow site, the tau-omega emission model overestimates both T-B(H) and T-B(V) during the warm season and underestimates T-B(H) during the cold season when the vegetation is sparse. Implementation of the new surface roughness parameterization reduces the T-B(H) underestimation, and further the T-B(P) overestimation is mitigated by adopting a new tau(P) parameterization derived from a discrete radiative transfer model previously developed and tested for the same site. The in-situ measured theta(liq) dynamics are better captured by corresponding retrievals for both frozen and thawed soils with implementation of the new surface roughness and tau(P) parameterizations, which reduces the unbiased RMSEs by more than 40%. The parameterizations developed in this study are useful to provide consistent and reasonable T-B(P) simulations and theta(liq) retrievals over the Tibetan Plateau for both frozen and thawed soils based on both SMAP T-B(H) and T-B(V) measurements.

Although its primary mission is to measure the column-averaged mixing ratio of CO2 (Xco(2)) to constrain global carbon source/sink distribution, one of the OCO-2 spectrometers allows for a robust SIF retrieval solely based on solar Fraunhofer lines. Here we present a technical overview of the OCO-2 SIF product, aiming to provide the scientific community guidance on best practices for data analysis, interpretation, and application. This overview consists of the retrieval algorithms, OCO-2 specific bias correction, retrieval uncertainty evaluation, cross-mission comparison with other existing SIF products, and a global-scale examination of the SIF-GPP relationship. With the initial three years of data (September 2014 onward), we compared OCO-2 SIF with retrievals from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and examined its relationship with FLUXCOM and MODIS GPP datasets. Our results show that OCO-2 SIF, along with GOSAT products, closely resemble the mean spatial and temporal patterns of FLUXCOM GPP from regions to the globe. Compared with GOME-2, however, OCO-2 depicts a more realistic spatial contrast between the tropics and extra-tropics. The linear relationship between OCO-2 SIF and existing modeled GPP products diverges somewhat across biomes at the global scale, consistent with previous GOSAT or GOME-2 based findings when modeled GPP products were used, but in contrast to a consistent cross-biome SIF-GPP relationship obtained at flux tower sites with OCO-2 products. This contrast suggests a critical need to reconcile differences in diverse SIF and GPP products and the relationships among them. Overall, the OCO-2 SIF products are robust and valuable for monitoring the global terrestrial carbon cycle and for constraining the carbon source/sink strengths of the Earth system. Finally, insights are offered for future satellite missions optimized for SIF retrievals.

It is different from "engineering with models," which has been a common practice in the engineering profession for decades. MBSE is a holistic, systems engineering approach centered on the evolving system model, which serves as the "sole source of truth" about the system. It comprises system specification, design, validation, and configuration management. Even though MBSE is beginning to see a fair amount of use in multiple industries, specific advances are needed on multiple fronts to realize its full benefits. This paper discusses the motivation for MBSE, and its current state of maturity. It presents systems modeling methodologies and the role of ontologies and metamodels in MBSE. It presents model-based verification and validation (V&V) as an example of MBSE use. An illustrative example of the use of MBSE for design synthesis is presented to demonstrate an important MBSE capability. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges to widescale adoption and offers promising research directions to fully realize the potential benefits of MBSE.

The Total Drainable Water Storage of the Amazon River Basin: A First Estimate Using GRACE	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; CLIMATE EXPERIMENT; GRAVITY RECOVERY; MIDDLE-EAST; FRESH-WATER; SEPARATION	In the Amazon River basin, water stored for months to years in the soils and subsurface provide a persistent resource that regulates local and global climate via teleconnections and provides water to plants in times of little rain. While Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have provided the hydrological community with large advances in the understanding of large river basin dynamics and for water resources monitoring applications, the relative storage measurements from GRACE satellites have not yet been utilized for the quantification of total available freshwater on landmasses. In this study, we quantify the total drainable water storage (TDWS) in the Amazon basin by characterizing the relationship between the water storage anomaly of a large catchment and its base flow. Previous studies have shown that these two hydrological parameters behave like a linear time-independent system over a catchment like the Amazon dominated by fully humid tropical climate. This linear relationship allows us to determine a zero water storage level, at which the storage-driven discharge becomes zero. We quantify the TDWS of the Amazon basin as 1,766 km(3) and estimate an average 2 month residence time for stored waters. An independent analysis over nine major subbasins confirms our estimate for the entire basin. We show that our estimated TDWS values for individual subbasins, varying between 15 and 654 km3, follow two different linear relationships with their mean annual input. Through these relationships we also quantify the storage-driven portion of the streamflow and the total streamflow for Amazon and its subbasins. Furthermore, we estimate surface water storage variation of the Amazon River system by combining the water level time series from satellite altimetry and surface water extent time series from satellite imagery. Our results show that 61% of total basin water storage variation occurs in the surface water compartment. In addition, we find that 65% of the TDWS is available in its surface water system.

We analyze an 18 year interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series of 881 interferograms in conjunction with global positioning system (GPS) data within the groundwater basins. The large data set required the development of a distributed time series analysis framework able to automatically decompose both the InSAR and GPS time series into short-term and long-term signals. We find that short-term, seasonal oscillations of ground elevations due to annual groundwater withdrawal and recharge are unsteady due to changes in seasonal withdrawal by major water districts. The spatial pattern of seasonal ground deformation near the center of the basin corresponds to a diffusion process with peak deformation occurring at locations with highest groundwater production. Long-term signals occur over broader areas and are ultimately caused by long-term changes in groundwater production. Comparison of the geodetic data with hydraulic head data from major water districts suggests that different regions of the groundwater system are responsible for different temporal components in the observed ground deformation. Short-term, seasonal ground deformation is caused by compaction of shallower aquifers used for the majority of groundwater production whereas long-term ground deformation is correlated with delayed compaction of deeper aquifers and potential compressible clay layers. These results demonstrate the potential for geodetic analysis to be an important tool for groundwater management to maintain sustainable pumping practices.

P.			realfast: Real-time, Commensal Fast Transient Surveys with the Very Large Array	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						instrumentation: interferometers; methods: data analysis; radio continuum: general; surveys	FAST RADIO-BURSTS; WIDE-FIELD; PULSAR; TELESCOPE; DISCOVERY; SEARCH; SYSTEM; IMAGES; STARS; HOST	Radio interferometers have the ability to precisely localize and better characterize the properties of sources. This ability is having a powerful impact on the study of fast radio transients, where a few milliseconds of data is enough to pinpoint a source at cosmological distances. However, recording interferometric data at millisecond cadence produces a terabyte-per-hour data stream that strains networks, computing systems, and archives. This challenge mirrors that of other domains of science, where the science scope is limited by the computational architecture as much as the physical processes at play. Here, we present a solution to this problem in the context of radio transients: realfast, a commensal, fast transient search system at the Jansky Very Large Array. realfast uses a novel architecture to distribute fast-sampled interferometric data to a 32-node, 64-GPU cluster for real-time imaging and transient detection. By detecting transients in situ, we can trigger the recording of data for those rare, brief instants when the event occurs and reduce the recorded data volume by a factor of 1000. This makes it possible to commensally search a data stream that would otherwise be impossible to record. This system will search for millisecond transients in more than 1000 hr of data per year, potentially localizing several Fast Radio Bursts, pulsars, and other sources of impulsive radio emission. We describe the science scope for realfast, the system design, expected outcomes, and ways in which real-time analysis can help in other fields of astrophysics.	[Law, C.

We evaluated a novel analytical model, the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC1.2), that physically integrates T-R observations into a combined Penman-Monteith Shuttleworth-Wallace (PM-SW) framework for directly estimating E, and overcoming the uncertainties associated with T0 and gA determination. An evaluation of STIC1.2 against high temporal frequency SEB flux measurements across an aridity gradient in Australia revealed a systematic error of 10-52% in E from mesic to arid ecosystem, and low systematic error in sensible heat fluxes (H) (12-25%) in all ecosystems. Uncertainty in TR versus moisture availability relationship, stationarity assumption in surface emissivity, and SEB closure corrections in E were predominantly responsible for systematic E errors in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. A discrete correlation (r) of the model errors with observed soil moisture variance (r = 0.33-0.43), evaporative index (r = 0.77-0.90), and climatological dryness (r = 0.60-0.77) explained a strong association between ecohydrological extremes and T-R in determining the error structure of STIC1.2 predicted fluxes. Being independent of any leaf-scale biophysical parameterization, the model might be an important value addition in working group (WG2) of the Australian Energy and Water Exchange (OzEWEX) research initiative which focuses on observations to evaluate and compare biophysical models of energy and water cycle components. Plain Language Summary Evapotranspiration modeling and mapping in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are uncertain due to empirical approximation of surface and atmospheric conductances. Here we demonstrate the performance of a fully analytical model which is independent of any leaf-scale empirical parameterization of the conductances and can be potentially used for continental scale mapping of ecosystem water use as well as water stress using thermal remote sensing satellite data.d	[Mallick, Kaniska; Toivonen, Erika; Trebs, Ivonne] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Toivonen, Erika; Koivusalo, Harri] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Sch Engn, Espoo, Finland; [Toivonen, Erika] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Climate Syst Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Toivonen, Erika] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Boegh, Eva] Roskilde Univ, Dept Sci & Environm, Roskilde, Denmark; [Boegh, Eva] Danish Agcy Data Supply & Efficiency, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Cleverly, James; Eamus, Derek] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Terr Ecohydrol Res Grp, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Drewry, Darren] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Drewry, Darren] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Arndt, Stefan K.; Griebel, Anne] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Beringer, Jason] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Garcia, Monica] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Lyngby, Denmark; [Garcia, Monica] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, Palisades, NY USA	Mallick, K; Toivonen, E (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Belvaux, Luxembourg.; Toivonen, E (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, Sch Engn, Espoo, Finland.; Toivonen, E (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Climate Syst Res, Helsinki, Finland.; Toivonen, E (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland.	kaniska.mallick@gmail.com; erika.a.toivonen@gmail.com	Eamus, Derek/F-7375-2017; Toivonen, Erika/Q-4329-2019; Koivusalo, Harri J/I-5555-2012; Griebel, Anne/AAC-6458-2020; Setala, Heikki M/P-7354-2015; Garcia, Monica/N-1206-2014; Trebs, Ivonne/L-9125-2013; Cleverly, James/L-2134-2016; Arndt, Stefan K/G-5021-2013; Beringer, Jason/B-8528-2008	Eamus, Derek/0000-0003-2765-8040; Toivonen, Erika/0000-0002-2224-8133; Koivusalo, Harri J/0000-0002-3713-1579; Griebel, Anne/0000-0002-4476-8279; Garcia, Monica/0000-0002-4587-8920; Cleverly, James/0000-0002-2731-7150; Arndt, Stefan K/0000-0001-7086-9375; Beringer, Jason/0000-0002-4619-8361; Trebs, Ivonne/0000-0001-5966-4942	Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) under project BIOTRANS [00001145]; FNR-DFG CAOS-2 project [INTER/DFG/14/02]; HiWET (High-resolution modeling and monitoring of Water and Energy Transfers in wetland ecosystems) consortium; FNR under the programme STEREOIII (INTER/STEREOIII/13/03/HiWET) [NR SR/00/301]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0344744, DP0772981, DP120101735, DP130101566, LE0882936]; ARCAustralian Research Council [FT110100602]; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); BELSPOBelgian Federal Science Policy Office	This study was funded by the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) under project BIOTRANS (project code 00001145).

DTN communications rely heavily on its core bundle protocol (BP) for reliable data delivery. To date, little work has been seen in theoretical analysis of the performance of BP in deep-space communications. In particular, an analytical understanding of the performance of BP for reliable data delivery in a deep-space communication environment in the presence of link disruptions is quickly needed. In this paper, we present a study of the effect of link disruption on transmission performance of BP, in both analytical and experimental manners, in a deep-space communications system characterized by link disruptions accompanied by an extremely long propagation delay and lossy data links. For the first time, an analytical framework is built to estimate the effect of link disruption on the total bundle delivery time of BP depending on its starting time with respect to bundle delivery. The analytical models are validated by running experiments using a test bed.

Hydrologically Induced Karst Deformation: Insights From GPS Measurements in the Adria-Eurasia Plate Boundary Zone	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						Global Positioning System; time series analysis; Alps; karsts; precipitation; hydrology	POSITION TIME-SERIES; TECTONIC LINEAMENT ANALYSIS; DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM; MATLAB-BASED TOOLBOX; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; SOUTHERN ALPS; CANSIGLIO PLATEAU; EARTHQUAKE SWARM; SATELLITE IMAGES; WATER	We apply a blind source separation algorithm to the ground displacement time series recorded at continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations in the European Eastern Alps and Northern Dinarides. As a result, we characterize the temporal and spatial features of several deformation signals. Seasonal displacements are well described by loading effects caused by Earth surface mass redistributions. More interestingly, we highlight a horizontal, nonseasonal, transient deformation signal, with spatially variable amplitudes and directions. The stations affected by this signal reverse the sense of movement with time, implying a sequence of dilatational and compressional deformation that is oriented normal to rock fractures in karst areas. The temporal evolution of this deformation signal is correlated with the history of cumulated precipitations at monthly time scales. This transient horizontal deformation can be explained by pressure changes associated with variable water levels within vertical fractures in the vadose zones of karst systems. The water level changes required to open or close these fractures are consistent with the fluctuations of precipitation and with the dynamics of karst systems. Plain Language Summary Groundwater levels in aquifers are commonly monitored at local scales by wells. Space geodesy, however, can provide measurements of time-variable deformation associated with variable groundwater levels at mesoscales. Here we show how Global Positioning System (GPS) time series from regional networks can precisely measure spatially integrated deformation signals related to variable water levels in karst aquifers, which are an important source of drinking water worldwide. Blind source separation algorithms, as the one used in this work, help scientists to detect and precisely measure ground displacements associated with both tectonic and nontectonic processes, improving our ability to describe the space and time evolution of surface movements and the dynamics of faults and geological bodies.

This new dataset termed the Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL), is created by the merging of the UW-Madison MODIS baseline-fit emissivity dataset (UWIREMIS) and JPL's ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset v4 (GEDv4). CAMEL consists of a monthly, 0.05 degrees resolution emissivity for 13 hinge points within the 3.6-14.3 mu m region and is extended to 417 infrared spectral channels using a principal component regression approach. An uncertainty product is provided for the 13 hinge point emissivities by combining temporal, spatial, and algorithm variability as part of a total uncertainty estimate. Part 1 of this paper series describes the methodology for creating the CAMEL emissivity product and the corresponding high spectral resolution algorithm. This paper, Part 2 of the series, details the methodology of the CAMEL uncertainty calculation and provides an assessment of the CAMEL emissivity product through comparisons with (1) ground site lab measurements; (2) a long-term Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) emissivity dataset derived from 8 years of data; and (3) forward-modeled IASI brightness temperatures using the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) radiative transfer model. Global monthly results are shown for different seasons and International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme land classifications, and case study examples are shown for locations with different land surface types.

Multi-sensor observation and reanalysis datasets are used to examine the relationships among dust deposition, sea surface temperature (SST), and wind speed, as they may contribute to anomalous phytoplankton blooms, through time-series and correlation analyses. A positive correlation was found at 0-3 months lag between chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) anomalies and dust anomalies over the Red Sea regions. Dust deposition process was further examined with dust aerosols' vertical distribution using satellite lidar data. Conversely, a negative correlation was found at 0-3 months lag between SST anomalies and Chl-a that was particularly strong in the southern Red Sea during summertime. The negative relationship between SST and phytoplankton is also evident in the continuously low levels of Chl-a during 2015 to 2016, which were the warmest years in the region on record. The overall positive correlation between wind speed and Chl-a relate to the nutritious water supply from the Gulf of Aden to the southern Red Sea and the vertical mixing encountered in the northern part. Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) dataset experience some temporal inconsistencies due to the inclusion of different datasets.

On the Desiccation of the South Aral Sea Observed from Spaceborne Missions	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						lake level; lake volume; evaporation; streamflow; Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE); altimetry; Landsat; Aral Sea	ATMOSPHERE WATER FLUX; WACMOS-ET PROJECT; MODEL; LAKES; RESERVOIRS; FLUCTUATIONS; GROUNDWATER; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; POOPO	The South Aral Sea has been massively affected by the implementation of a mega-irrigation project in the region, but ground-based observations have monitored the Sea poorly. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the mass balance of the South Aral Sea and its basin, using multiple instruments from ground and space. We estimate lake volume, evaporation from the lake, and the Amu Darya streamflow into the lake using strengths offered by various remote-sensing data. We also diagnose the attribution behind the shrinking of the lake and its possible future fate. Terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission from the Aral Sea region can approximate water level of the East Aral Sea with good accuracy (1.8% normalized root mean square error (RMSE), and 0.9 correlation) against altimetry observations. Evaporation from the lake is back-calculated by integrating altimetry-based lake volume, in situ streamflow, and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation. Different evapotranspiration (ET) products (Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Water Gap Hydrological Model (WGHM)), and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) significantly underestimate the evaporation from the lake. However, another MODIS based Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET estimate shows remarkably high consistency (0.76 correlation) with our estimate (based on the water-budget equation). Further, streamflow is approximated by integrating lake volume variation, PT-JPL ET, and GPCP datasets. In another approach, the deseasonalized GRACE signal from the Amu Darya basin was also found to approximate streamflow and predict extreme flow into the lake by one or two months. They can be used for water resource management in the Amu Darya delta. The spatiotemporal pattern in the Amu Darya basin shows that terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the central region (predominantly in the primary irrigation belt other than delta) has increased. This increase can be attributed to enhanced infiltration, as ET and vegetation index (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) from the area has decreased. The additional infiltration might be an indication of worsening of the canal structures and leakage in the area. The study shows how altimetry, optical images, gravimetric and other ancillary observations can collectively help to study the desiccating Aral Sea and its basin. A similar method can be used to explore other desiccating lakes.

Complex Basal Thermal Transition Near the Onset of Petermann Glacier, Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						subglacial hydrology; Greenland Ice Sheet; radar sounding; ice sheet modeling; onset of fast flow; Petermann Glacier	ICE-PENETRATING RADAR; WEST ANTARCTICA; THWAITES GLACIER; GROUNDING-ZONE; NORTH GREENLAND; SHEAR-MARGIN; SHEET; FLOW; BENEATH; MODEL	The basal thermal regime of ice sheets exerts a strong control on ice-sheet stability and the onset of rapidly streaming flow. However, the nature of this thermal transition where sliding initiates is largely unconstrained by geophysical observations. In the Greenland Ice Sheet, topographic troughs or elevated geothermal heat fluxes typically define the onset of outlet glaciers. In contrast, Petermann Glacier in Northern Greenland does not have any distinct bed troughs or localized geothermal heating associated with its onset, making it an ideal site to investigate the basal thermal state and examine its role in the onset of Petermann Glacier. Here we use radar bed reflectivity and an ice-sheet thermomechanical model to examine the basal thermal regime beneath Petermann Glacier. Our results reveal a complex thermal transition near the onset of Petermann Glacier. As the bed shifts from largely frozen to largely thawed with increasing distances from the ice divide, our results show that this thermal transition happens through alternating bands of frozen and thawed bands. The complex thermal state across the onset region suggests that lateral meltwater injection and local meltwater production determine the location of Petermann Glacier. Given the lack of topographic pinning at the onset location, the upstream margin of Petermann is vulnerable to migrate depending on a combination of advective cooling and meltwater supply from the interior of the ice sheet. Plain Language Summary Petermann Glacier is one of the largest outlet glaciers in Northern Greenland. Its fast-flowing ice reaches deep into the ice interior, drawing similar to 13km(3) of ice every year from the divide to the coast. But what determines the onset of this enigmatic glacier? Different from other large outlet glaciers in Greenland, the head of Petermann Glacier does not sit in any distinct subglacial basins. Without this topographic forcing to promote its ice velocity, other internal process related to the temperature of ice sheet base could be the critical factor that controls the location of Petermann Glacier. However, currently, there are very few observations on this basal thermal condition. Using a novel ice-penetrating radar analysis technique, we present the first detailed observations on the basal thermal condition of Petermann Glacier. Our results reveal that as the ice sheet bed begins to warm up as the ice moves closer to the coast, the bed shifts from a frozen to a thawed condition multiple times before it reaches a persistent thawed condition. These results explain why ice sheet models that assume a simple, single frozen-to-thawed bed transition struggle to reproduce the upstream margin of Petermann Glacier accurately.

The Thermophysical Properties of the Bagnold Dunes, Mars: Ground-Truthing Orbital Data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars Science Laboratory; Thermal Emission Imaging System; Bagnold dunes; thermal inertia; particle size	THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; IMAGING-SYSTEM THEMIS; PARTICULATE MATERIALS; TEMPERATURE SENSOR; MARTIAN SURFACE; GALE CRATER; CONDUCTIVITY MEASUREMENTS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; LAYERED DEPOSITS	We compare the thermophysical properties and particle sizes derived from the Mars Science Laboratory rover's Ground Temperature Sensor of the Bagnold dunes, specifically Namib dune, to those derived orbitally from Thermal Emission Imaging System, ultimately linking these measurements to ground truth particle sizes determined from Mars Hand Lens Imager images. In general, we find that all three datasets report consistent particle sizes for the Bagnold dunes (similar to 110-350m and are within measurement and model uncertainties), indicating that particle sizes of homogeneous materials inferred from temperature measurements and thermophysical models are reliable. Furthermore, we examine the effects of two physical characteristics that could influence the modeled thermal inertia and particle sizes, including (1) fine-scale (centimeter to meter scale) ripples and (2) thin layering of indurated/armored materials. To first order, we find that small-scale ripples and thin (approximately centimeter scale) layers do not significantly affect the determination of bulk thermal inertia from orbital thermal data using a single nighttime temperature. Modeling of a layer of coarse or indurated material reveals that a thin layer (< similar to 5mm; similar to what was observed by the Curiosity rover) would not significantly change the observed thermal properties of the surface and would be dominated by the properties of the underlying material. Thermal inertia and particle sizes of relatively homogeneous materials derived from nighttime orbital data should be considered as reliable, as long as there are no significant subpixel anisothermality effects (e.g., lateral mixing of multiple thermophysically distinct materials). Plain Language Summary The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover spent approximately 20 Martian days interrogating an active sand dune field informally named the Bagnold dunes. The suite of measurements made by Curiosity provide a unique opportunity to link orbital data to ground truth. In this specific instance, we investigate if particle sizes derived from orbital data are reliable. Using a numerical model that describes how surface temperature varies as a function of a variety of input parameters, including observation geometry (e.g., season and time of day) and surface properties (e.g., reflectance, slope, azimuth, and elevation), we can model the response of the surface to various particle sizes. By using Curiosity's Ground Temperature Sensor as the link between fine-scale Mars Hand Lens Imager ground truth data and the Thermal Emission Imaging System's orbital perspective, we conclude that indeed particle sizes determined from orbital observations are reliable. Furthermore, we find that relatively thin armoring lags of coarser particles and dune ripples do not dramatically affect these orbitally determined particle sizes.

J	Jones, DR				Jones, Drew Ryan			Trajectories for Flyby Sample Return at Icy Moons	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							MISSION; ENCELADUS; STARDUST; EUROPA	Ballistic trajectories are computed that aim to achieve a sample-return mission to Europa, Enceladus, or Titan without capturing, descending, or landing. The low-cost mission concept uses a free-return trajectory that also involves a close flyby of the icy moon. A broad-search algorithm is developed to construct feasible itineraries, and Venus and Earth gravity-assist sequences are considered. Select solutions from the broad search are then optimized to be continuous using gravity of the full ephemeris. Solution characteristics are examined over a complete 12-year Jupiter period and 30-year Saturn period. For Europa and Titan, the outbound Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist (VEEGA) option can significantly reduce launch C-3, compared to alternate options. For Europa, various optimized results are computed with C-3 as low as 16.0 k m(2) /s(2), reentry speeds comparable to the Stardust capsule, and flight times of 9-15 years. Unfortunately, an Enceladus mission requires a flight time of 25 years or more and incurs fairly high relative speeds. Optimized direct and VEEGA missions to Titan are presented, with total flight times of 16 and 25 years, respectively.

However, its composition has never been unambiguously identified, although it is widely assumed to be composed primarily of either ammonia or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) ice. Here, we present evidence of a clear detection of gaseous H2S above this cloud deck in the wavelength region 1.57-1.59 mu m with a mole fraction of 0.4-0.8 ppm at the cloud top. Its detection constrains the deep bulk sulfur/nitrogen abundance to exceed unity (> 4.4-5.0 times the solar value) in Uranus's bulk atmosphere, and places a lower limit on the mole fraction of H2S below the observed cloud of (1.0-2.5) x 10(-5). The detection of gaseous H2S at these pressure levels adds to the weight of evidence that the principal constituent of 1.2-3-bar cloud is likely to be H2S ice.	[Irwin, Patrick G.

To better understand the drivers of this variability, we used airborne lidar to measure forest canopy height and estimate biomass over 4529ha at Serra do Conduru Park in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We measured trees in 30 georeferenced field plots (0.25-ha each) to estimate biomass using allometry. Then we estimated aboveground biomass density (ABD) across the lidar study area using a statistical model developed from our field plots. This model related the 95th percentile of the distribution of lidar return heights to ABD. We overlaid this map of ABD on a Landsat-derived forest age map to determine rates of biomass accumulation. We found rapid initial biomass regeneration (similar to 6Mg/ha yr), which slowed as forests aged. We also observed high variability in both height and biomass across the landscape within forests of similar age. Nevertheless, a regression model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation and included forest age, slope, and distance to roads or open areas explained 62 and 77 percent of the landscape variation in ABD and canopy height, respectively. Thus, while there is high spatial heterogeneity in forest recovery, and the drivers of this heterogeneity warrant further investigation, we suggest that a relatively simple set of predictor variables is sufficient to explain the majority of variance in both height and ABD in this landscape. RESUMO Florestas secundarias constituem mais da metade das florestas tropicais e representam um importante sumidouro de carbono; entretanto taxas de acumulo de biomassa variam por fator superior a dois mesmo entre parcelas numa mesma paisagem. Para compreender quais fatores controlam esta variabilidade, utilizamos lidar aerotransportado para medir altura de dossel florestal e estimar biomassa em 4529ha no Parque Estadual da Serra do Conduru, Bahia, Brasil. Nos medimos arvores em 30 parcelas georreferenciadas (0.25-ha cada) para estimar biomassa com equacoes alometricas. Posteriormente, estimamos densidade de biomassa acima do solo (ABD) na area sobrevoada utilizando um modelo estatistico desenvolvido a partir das parcelas de campo. Este modelo relacionou o 95 degrees percentil da distribuicAo de alturas de retorno do lidar a ADB. Este mapa de ABD foi sobreposto a um mapa de idades de floresta baseado no Landsat, para determinar taxas de acumulo de biomassa. Verificaram-se taxas de regeneracAo inicialmente rapidas (similar to 6 Mg/ha ano), que diminuiram conforme as florestas envelheceram. Observamos tambem grande variabilidade em altura e biomassa ao longo da paisagem entre florestas de idade semelhantes. Apesar disto, um modelo de regressAo considerando autocorrelacAo espacial e incluindo idade da floresta, declividade e distancia ate estradas ou areas abertas explicou 62% e 77% da variacAo em escala de paisagem para ABD e altura do dossel, respectivamente. Embora haja grande heterogeneidade espacial em recuperacAo florestal, e determinantes desta heterogeneidade requeiram investigacoes adicionais, nossos resultados sugerem que conjuntos relativamente simples de variaveis preditoras sAo suficientes para explicar grande parte da variancia de altura e ABD nesta paisagem.

Near-critical density filling of the SF6 fluid cell for the ALI-R-DECLIC experiment in weightlessness	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC)	SEP 25-29, 2017	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA			Slightly off-critical sulfur-hexafluoride; Liquid-gas density diameter; Liquid-gas coexisting densities	DIAMETERS	Analyses of ground-based experiments on near-critical fluids to precisely determine their density can be hampered by several effects, especially the density stratification of the sample, the liquid wetting behavior at the cell walls, and a possible singular curvature of the "rectilinear" diameter of the density coexisting curve. For the latter effect, theoretical efforts have been made to understand the amplitude and shape of the critical hook of the density diameter, which depart from predictions from the so-called ideal lattice-gas model of the uniaxial 3D-Ising universality class. In order to optimize the observation of these subtle effects on the position and shape of the liquid-vapor meniscus in the particular case of SF6, we have designed and filled a cell that is highly symmetrized with respect to any median plane of the total fluid volume. In such a viewed quasi-perfect symmetrical fluid volume, the precise detection of the meniscus position and shape for different orientations of the cell with respect to the Earth's gravity acceleration field becomes a sensitive probe to estimate the cell mean density filling and to test the singular diameter effects. After integration of this cell in the ALI-R insert, we take benefit of the high optical and thermal performances of the DECLIC Engineering Model. Here we present the sensitive imaging method providing the precise ground-based SF6 benchmark data. From these data analysis it is found that the temperature dependence of the meniscus position does not reflect the expected critical hook in the rectilinear density diameter. Therefore the off-density criticality of the cell is accurately estimated, before near future experiments using the same ALI-R insert in the DECLIC facility already on-board the International Space Station.

MMX will explore the Martian moons and return a sample from Phobos. This paper presents the mission analysis work, focusing on the transfer legs and comparing several architectures, such as hybrid options with chemical and electric propulsion modules. The selected baseline is a chemical-propulsion Phobos sample return, which is discussed in detail with the launch- and return-window analysis. The trajectories are optimized with the jTOP software, using planetary ephemerides for Mars and the Earth; Earth re-entry constraints are modeled with simple analytical equations. Finally, we introduce an analytical approximation of the three-burn capture strategy used in the Mars system. The approximation can be used together with a Lambert solver to quickly determine the transfer Delta nu costs.

J	Robinson, TD; Crisp, D				Robinson, Tyler D.; Crisp, David			Linearized Flux Evolution (LiFE): A technique for rapidly adapting fluxes from full-physics radiative transfer models	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							DISCRETE-ORDINATE-METHOD; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; THERMAL-EQUILIBRIUM; SOLAR-RADIATION; VENUS; ATMOSPHERE; CLIMATE; ABSORPTION; CO2	Solar and thermal radiation are critical aspects of planetary climate, with gradients in radiative energy fluxes driving heating and cooling. Climate models require that radiative transfer tools be versatile, computationally efficient, and accurate. Here, we describe a technique that uses an accurate full-physics radiative transfer model to generate a set of atmospheric radiative quantities which can be used to linearly adapt radiative flux profiles to changes in the atmospheric and surface state-the Linearized Flux Evolution (LiFE) approach. These radiative quantities describe how each model layer in a plane-parallel atmosphere reflects and transmits light, as well as how the layer generates diffuse radiation by thermal emission and by scattering light from the direct solar beam. By computing derivatives of these layer radiative properties with respect to dynamic elements of the atmospheric state, we can then efficiently adapt the flux profiles computed by the full-physics model to new atmospheric states. We validate the LiFE approach, and then apply this approach to Mars, Earth, and Venus, demonstrating the information contained in the layer radiative properties and their derivatives, as well as how the LiFE approach can be used to determine the thermal structure of radiative and radiative-convective equilibrium states in one-dimensional atmospheric models.

Saturn's gravitational field Induced by its equatorially antisymmetric zonal winds	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitation; planets and satellites: individual (Saturn); planets and satellites: interiors	GIANT PLANETS; JUPITER; HARMONICS; CONVECTION; INTERIORS; MODEL; DEPTH; JETS	The cloud-level zonal winds of Saturn are marked by a substantial equatorially antisymmetric component with a speed of about 50ms(-1) which, if they are sufficiently deep, can produce measurable odd zonal gravitational coefficients Delta J(2k+1,) k = 1,2,3,4. This study, based on solutions of the thermal-gravitational wind equation, provides a theoretical basis for interpreting the odd gravitational coefficients of Saturn in terms of its equatorially antisymmetric zonal flow. We adopt a Saturnian model comprising an ice-rock core, a metallic dynamo region and an outer molecular envelope. We use an equatorially antisymmetric zonal flow that is parameterized, confined in the molecular envelope and satisfies the solvability condition required for the thermal-gravitational wind equation. The structure and amplitude of the zonal flow at the cloud level are chosen to be consistent with observations of Saturn. We calculate the odd zonal gravitational coefficients Delta J(2k+1,) k = 1,2,3,4 by regarding the depth of the equatorially antisymmetric winds as a parameter. It is found that Delta J(3) is -4.197 x 10(-8) if the zonal winds extend about 13 000km downward from the cloud tops while it is -0.765 x 10(-8) if the depth is about 4000 km. The depth/profile of the equatorially antisymmetric zonal winds can eventually be estimated when the high-precision measurements of the Cassini Grand Finale become available.

Online Chemical Characterization of Food-Cooking Organic Aerosols: Implications for Source Apportionment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETER DATA; HIGH-RESOLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; COLLECTION EFFICIENCIES; SUBMICRON PARTICLES; INORGANIC AEROSOLS; BURNING EMISSIONS; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; NORTHWEST CHINA	Food-cooking organic aerosols (COA) are one of the primary sources of submicron particulate matter in urban environments. However, there are still many questions surrounding source apportionment related to instrumentation as well as semivolatile partitioning because COA evolve rapidly in the ambient air, making source apportionment more complex. Online measurements of emissions from cooking different types of food were performed in a laboratory to characterize particles and gases. Aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements showed that the relative ionization efficiency for OA was higher (1.56-3.06) relative to a typical value of 1.4, concluding that AMS is over-estimating COA and suggesting that previous studies likely over-estimated COA concentrations. Food-cooking mass spectra were generated using AMS, and gas and particle food markers were identified with filter inlets for gases and aerosols-chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) measurements to be used in future food cooking-source apportionment studies. However, there is a considerable variability in both gas and particle markers, and dilution plays an important role in the particle mass budget, showing the importance of using these markers with caution during receptor modeling. These findings can be used to better understand the chemical composition of COA, and they provides useful information to be used in future source-apportionment studies.

An on-chip direct digital frequency synthesizer and digital-to-analog converter digitally generates a chirping waveform which then drives a ring oscillator-based K-u-Band phase-locked loop to provide the final K-u-band FMCW signal. Employing a ring oscillator as opposed to a tuned inductor-based oscillator (LC-VCO) allows the radar to achieve wide chirp bandwidth resulting in a higher axial resolution (7.5 cm), which is needed to accurately quantify the snowpack profile. The demonstrated radar chip is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. The chip consumes 252.4 mW of power under 1.1-V supply, making its payload requirements suitable for observations from a small unmanned aerial vehicle.

An Improved Transit Measurement for a 2.4 R-circle plus Planet Orbiting A Bright Mid-M Dwarf K2-28	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: fundamental parameters; planets and satellites: individual (K2-28b); techniques: photometric	EXTRASOLAR PLANET; HOT JUPITERS; SPITZER; STAR; K2; ATMOSPHERES; EXOPLANETS; CAMERA	We present a new Spitzer transit observation of K2-28b, a sub-Neptune (R-p = 2.45 +/- 0.28 R-circle plus) orbiting a relatively bright (V-mag = 16.06, K-mag = 10.75) metal-rich M4 dwarf (EPIC 206318379). This star is one of only seven with masses less than 0.2 M-circle dot known to host transiting planets, and the planet appears to be a slightly smaller analogue of GJ 1214b (2.85 +/- 0.20 R-circle plus). Our new Spitzer observations were taken two years after the original K2 discovery data and have a significantly higher cadence, allowing us to derive improved estimates for this planet's radius, semimajor axis, and orbital period, which greatly reduce the uncertainty in the prediction of near future transit times for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. We also evaluate the system's suitability for atmospheric characterization with JWST and find that it is currently the only small (<3 R-circle plus) and cool (<600 K) planet aside from GJ 1214b with a potentially detectable secondary eclipse. We also note that this system is a favorable target for near-infrared radial velocity instruments on larger telescopes (e.g., the Habitable Planet Finder on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope), making it one of only a handful of small, cool planets accessible with this technique. Finally, we compare our results with the simulated catalog of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and find K2-28b to be representative of the kind of mid-M systems that should be detectable in the TESS sample.

Contribution of environmental forcings to US runoff changes for the period 1950-2010	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						US runoff; detection and attribution; MsTMIP	MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; PROGRAM MULTISCALE SYNTHESIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; LAND-USE; CARBON; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; TRENDS; TEMPERATURE	Runoff in the United States is changing, and this study finds that the measured change is dependent on the geographic region and varies seasonally. Specifically, observed annual total runoff had an insignificant increasing trend in the US between 1950 and 2010, but this insignificance was due to regional heterogeneity with both significant and insignificant increases in the eastern, northern, and southern US, and a greater significant decrease in the western US. Trends for seasonal mean runoff also differed across regions. By region, the season with the largest observed trend was autumn for the east (positive), spring for the north (positive), winter for the south (positive), winter for the west (negative), and autumn for the US as a whole (positive). Based on the detection and attribution analysis using gridded WaterWatch runoff observations along with semi-factorial land surface model simulations from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), we found that while the roles of CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, and land use and land cover were inconsistent regionally and seasonally, the effect of climatic variations was detected for all regions and seasons, and the change in runoff could be attributed to climate change in summer and autumn in the south and in autumn in the west. We also found that the climate-only and historical transient simulations consistently underestimated the runoff trends, possibly due to precipitation bias in the MsTMIP driver or within the models themselves.

Characterizing the Impact of Aerosols on Pre-Hurricane Sandy	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						African dust; hurricane sandy; nucleation; remote sensing	SAHARAN AIR LAYER; OPTICAL DEPTH; NILE DELTA; DUST; ATLANTIC; CLOUD; MODIS; PRODUCTS; SIMULATIONS; DYNAMICS	This study focuses on the role that African dust over the Atlantic had on the persistence of the tropical system that eventually became Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. On October 8, a Saharan dust event in the Mauritania region of West Africa transported significant amounts of mineral dust into the troposphere and along the path of an easterly wave created by a break in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The Terra/Aqua-MODIS satellite observations clearly define the spatial distribution of the coarse/fine aerosols, while the CALIPSO observations of the total attenuated backscatter at 532 nm provide a detailed view of the vertical structure and aerosol types in the dust-laden layer. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis data show the distribution of aerosols along the path of the pre-Sandy wave as well as a second wave that formed north of the ITCZ under different condition. The second wave, which started in an area of relatively larger aerosol optical depth (AOD), moved into an area with abnormally low convective available potential energy and AOD, subsequently dying out, while the wave that became Sandy had light aerosol loading (AOD between 0.15-0.5) along a majority of its path. The evidence suggests that aerosols played a nontrivial role in the maintenance of this system until it moved into an environment favorable for cyclogenesis.

For the case of agricultural areas, these ambiguities have been mainly related to complex vegetation dynamics, i.e., vegetation growth. This study intends to explore the potential of a synergistic use of DInSAR with SAR Polarimetry (PolDInSAR) in tracking changes within agricultural vegetation covers. The connection between the PolDInSAR observables (i.e., herein, the DInSAR phases at various polarization channels and/or their linear combinations) with wet biomass and soil water content changes is empirically investigated with linear regression techniques. This is done in the frame of an L-band airborne DInSAR dataset. The impact of vegetation vigor differs depending on the type of crop analyzed. For those crops exhibiting a birefringent electromagnetic propagation (i.e., barley, wheat, and rapeseed), the influence of wet biomass is particularly pronounced in the VV DIn-SAR phase but also in the HH-VV phase difference. Contrarily to the former, the latter shows also a scarce sensitivity to changes in soil water content. Therefore, this PolDInSAR observable is used to generate biomass maps of the analyzed test site. The predicted biomass variations are in good agreement with the collected in situ measurements, i.e., the coefficient of determination varies between 0.8 and 0.9.

Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We developed the first calibration-grade, national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we tested whether imagery from multiple sensors, Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar, Landsat, and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n = 409, RMSE = 310 g/m2, 10.3% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model results were improved by scaling field-measured biomass calibration data by NAIP-derived 30 m fraction green vegetation. With a mean plant carbon content of 44.1% (n = 1384, 95% C.I. = 43.99%-44.37%), we generated regional 30 m aboveground carbon density maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon densities and stocks that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean %C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the highest C density (2.67 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha). Estimated C stocks for predefined jurisdictional areas ranged from 1023 +/- 39 Mg in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington to 507,761 +/- 14,822 Mg in the Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes in Louisiana. This modeling and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal marshes to be included in the coastal wetland section of the U.S. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. With the increased availability of free post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global extent as well.

Given that the strength of its infrared excess (L-IR/L-* similar or equal to 0.1) appears to be more consistent with a young protoplanetary disc, we present the first optical spectra of the star and reassess its evolutionary and membership status. We find WISE J0808-6443 to be a Li-rich M5 star with strong Ha emission (-125 < EW < -65 angstrom over 4 epochs) whose strength and broad width are consistent with accretion at a low level (similar to 10(-10)M(circle dot) yr(-1)) from its disc. The spectral energy distribution of the star is consistent with a primordial disc and is well-fitted using a two-temperature blackbody model with T-inner similar or equal to 1100K and T-outer similar or equal to 240 K. AllWISE multi-epoch photometry shows the system exhibits significant variability in the 3.4 and 4.6 mu m bands. We calculate an improved proper motion based on archival astrometry, and combined with a newradial velocity, the kinematics of the star are consistent with membership in Carina at a kinematic distance of 90 +/- 9 pc. The spectroscopic and photometric data are consistent with WISE J0808-6443 being a similar to 0.1M(circle dot) Classical T-Tauri star and one of the oldest known accreting M-type stars. These results provide further evidence that the upper limit on the lifetimes of gas-rich discs -and hence the time-scales to form and evolve protoplanetary systems -around the lowest mass stars may be longer than previously recognized, or some mechanism may be responsible for regenerating short-lived discs at later stages of pre-main sequence evolution.

David			GoAmazon2014/5 campaign points to deep-inflow approach to deep convection across scales	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						tropical precipitation; moist convection; mesoscale convective system; convective parameterization; entrainment	OCEAN AMAZON GOAMAZON2014/5; AIRBORNE DOPPLER RADAR; COLUMN WATER-VAPOR; CLIMATE MODELS; PRECIPITATING CONVECTION; TROPICAL CONVECTION; TRANSILIENT MATRIX; MOIST CONVECTION; WESTERN PACIFIC; PARAMETERIZATION	A substantial fraction of precipitation is associated with meso-scale convective systems (MCSs), which are currently poorly represented in climate models. Convective parameterizations are highly sensitive to the assumptions of an entraining plume model, in which high equivalent potential temperature air from the boundary layer is modified via turbulent entrainment. Here we show, using multiinstrument evidence from the Green Ocean Amazon field campaign (2014-2015; GoAmazon2014/5), that an empirically constrained weighting for inflow of environmental air based on radar wind profiler estimates of vertical velocity and mass flux yields a strong relationship between resulting buoyancy measures and precipitation statistics. This deep-inflow weighting has no free parameter for entrainment in the conventional sense, but to a leading approximation is simply a statement of the geometry of the inflow. The structure further suggests the weighting could consistently apply even for coherent inflow structures noted in field campaign studies for MCSs over tropical oceans. For radar precipitation retrievals averaged over climate model grid scales at the GoAmazon2014/5 site, the use of deep-inflow mixing yields a sharp increase in the probability and magnitude of precipitation with increasing buoyancy. Furthermore, this applies for both mesoscale and smaller-scale convection. Results from reanalysis and satellite data show that this holds more generally: Deep-inflow mixing yields a strong precipitation-buoyancy relation across the tropics. Deep-inflow mixing may thus circumvent inadequacies of current parameterizations while helping to bridge the gap toward representing mesoscale convection in climate models.

The time series approach allows variations of station coordinates that are neither reduced by observational corrections nor considered in the functional model to be taken into account. These variations are primarily due to non-tidal geophysical loading effects that are not reduced according to the current IERS Conventions (2010). It is standard practice that the process noise models applied in Kalman filter TRF solutions are derived from time series of loading displacements and account for station dependent differences. So far, it has been assumed that the parameters of these process noise models are constant over time. However, due to the presence of seasonal and irregular variations, this assumption does not truly reflect reality. In this study, we derive a station coordinate process noise model allowing for such temporal variations. This process noise model and one that is a parameterized version of the former are applied in the computation of TRF solutions based on very long baseline interferometry data. In comparison with a solution based on a constant process noise model, we find that the station coordinates are affected at the millimeter level. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Speed-dependent Voigt lineshape parameter database from dual frequency comb measurements up to 1305 K. Part I: Pure H2O absorption, 6801-7188 cm(-1)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							SELF-BROADENED WIDTHS; SPECTRAL-LINE SHAPES; WATER-VAPOR LINES; PRESSURE; TEMPERATURE; AIR; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSITIONS; ASYMMETRIES; POSITIONS	We measure speed-dependent Voigt lineshape parameters with temperature-dependence exponents for several hundred spectroscopic features of pure water spanning 6801-7188 cm(-1). The parameters are extracted from broad bandwidth, high-resolution dual frequency comb absorption spectra with multispectrum fitting techniques. The data encompass 25 spectra ranging from 296 K to 1305 K and 1 to 17 Torr of pure water vapor. We present the extracted parameters, compare them to published data, and present speed-dependence, self-shift, and self-broadening temperature-dependent parameters for the first time. Lineshape data is extracted using a quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profile and a single self-broadening power law temperature-dependence exponent over the entire temperature range. The results represent an important step toward a new high-temperature database using advanced lineshape profiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The phase function and density of the dust observed at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						space vehicles; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	GRAIN IMPACT ANALYZER; ONBOARD ROSETTA; SOLAR-SYSTEM; INNER COMA; CALIBRATIONS; SIMULATIONS; ACCUMULATOR; SPACECRAFT; SCATTERING; MISSION	The OSIRIS camera onboard Rosetta measured the phase function of both the coma dust and the nucleus. The two functions have a very different slope versus the phase angle. Here, we show that the nucleus phase function should be adopted to convert the brightness to the size of dust particles larger than 2.5 mm only. This makes the dust bursts observed close to Rosetta by OSIRIS, occurring about every hour, consistent with the fragmentation on impact with Rosetta of parent particles, whose flux agrees with the dust flux observed by GIADA. OSIRIS also measured the antisunward acceleration of the fragments, thus providing the first direct measurement of the solar radiation force acting on the dust fragments and thus of their bulk density, excluding any measurable rocket effect by the ice sublimation from the dust. The obtained particle density distribution has a peak matching the bulk density of most COSIMA particles, and represents a subset of the density distribution measured by GIADA. This implies a bias in the elemental abundances measured by COSIMA, which thus are consistent with the 67P dust mass fractions inferred by GIADA, i.e. (38 +/- 8) per cent of hydrocarbons versus the (62 +/- 8) per cent of sulphides and silicates.

They can now retrieve the elevations of some rivers < 200 m wide. However, as these satellite missions are primarily designed to observe ocean surface topography, they are not always able to observe continental surfaces. For steep-sided rivers (i.e. in river valleys no more than a few km wide and surrounded by slopes over 50 m high), altimeters tend to observe the top of the surrounding topography rather than the river itself. The Jason-3 altimetry mission, launched in January 2016, has an alternative instrument operation mode, the so called Open-Loop (OL) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tracking mode. This mode is intended to help overcome this issue, by using an on-board DEM. However it was not used in 2016 as the operational mode because of difficulties in defining an accurate on-board global-scale DEM. Mainland France has been chosen to test the OL tracking mode, as water masks and DEMs of sufficient accuracy are available. Following the launch of Jason-3, Jason-2 (its predecessor) was maintained on the same nominal orbit as its follow-on, for more than 6 months. During this tandem period, data from the first 10 Jason-3 cycles (a Jason-2/-3 cycle corresponds to 10 days) were acquired in the traditional Closed-Loop (CL) tracking mode. Jason-3 data from the last 13 cycles were acquired in OL tracking mode. Jason-2 was always in CL tracking mode. Compared to nearby in situ gages and for river wider than 100 m, Jason-3 water elevation anomalies have a RMSE between 0.20 and 0.30 m for most reaches. Jason-3 performance over narrow rivers is similar to that of Jason-2. In CL tracking mode, Jason-3 altimeter tends to be locked over the surrounding topography more frequently than Jason-2 (due to the specific post-launch Jason-2 altimeter tuning). This study shows that Jason-2 observed 60% of river reaches studied (48 of 86 reaches), whereas Jason-3 in OL tracking mode was able to measure all river reaches for every cycle. This result clearly highlights the significant advantages of the OL tracking mode for observation of steep-sided rivers. However, further investigations are required to compute an accurate on-board global-scale DEM and to determine those locations where the use of OL tracking mode is or is not appropriate.

A Semianalytical Model of the Synthetic Aperture, Interferometric Radar Altimeter Mean Echo, and Echo Cross-Product and Its Statistical Fluctuations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Geophysical sea measurements; ocean surface; radar altimetry; radar remote sensing; spaceborne radar; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)	SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; ORBIT DETERMINATION; IMPULSE-RESPONSE; ROUGH-SURFACE; WAVE HEIGHTS; OCEAN; PRECISION; MISSION; GEOSAT; VARIABILITY	This paper develops a model of the synthetic aperture, interferometric satellite radar altimeter echo power, and echo cross-product. The model uses the smallness of the satellite pitch and roll angles, and the limited range of satellite altitude to provide a semianalytical echo model, whose numerical dimensions are limited to two in the synthetic aperture case or three in the interferometric case at large roll angles, making its application to extensive data practical. By not implementing the synthetic beam formation, it is demonstrated that the model recovers the conventional case of a pulse-limited altimeter. A theoretical description of the fluctuations in the multilooked, interferometric cross-product, and the synthetic aperture and pulse-limited powers is given by extending the model to describe correlations between individual looks in each case. The model offers the potential to retrieve ocean-surface parameters from synthetic aperture and pulse-limited altimeter data simultaneously, with obvious application to the new generation of altimeters onboard CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, and Sentinel-6 during the transition to operational synthetic aperture radar altimetry.

The discrete dipole approximation is commonly used to compute scattering and absorption by snow particles, because of its geometry flexibility and numerical low cost. However, this method becomes inefficient when the scattering quantities need to be calculated for a large number of orientations. To overcome this limitation, we apply, in this paper, a direct solver-based method, known as the characteristic basis function method (CBFM), to the modeling of scattering by randomly oriented and complex-shaped snow particles. This domain decomposition technique is based on the generation of a new set of basis functions adapted to the geometry of the scatterer in order to significantly reduce the numerical size of the EM problem. This enables us to use a direct solver for the resolution of the final compressed system of linear equations, which is better adapted for multiple excitation problems. When applied to numerically large snow particles, our CBFM-based model, named Numerically Efficient Scattering by Complex Particles, has been shown to yield good results, which compare well with those obtained with discrete dipole scattering, while providing a dramatic reduction in the CPU time.

J	Loikith, PC; Waliser, DE; Kim, J; Ferraro, R				Loikith, Paul C.; Waliser, Duane E.; Kim, Jinwon; Ferraro, Robert			Evaluation of cool season precipitation event characteristics over the Northeast US in a suite of downscaled climate model hindcasts	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Climate model downscaling; Climate model evaluation; Precipitation event characteristics; Northeast US; Regional climate modeling	GREAT-LAKES BASIN; UNITED-STATES; PROJECTIONS; TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY; RESOLUTION; EXTREMES; CMIP5; SNOW	Cool season precipitation event characteristics are evaluated across a suite of downscaled climate models over the northeastern US. Downscaled hindcast simulations are produced by dynamically downscaling the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model (RCM) and the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) global climate model. NU-WRF RCM simulations are produced at 24, 12, and 4-km horizontal resolutions using a range of spectral nudging schemes while the MERRA2 global downscaled run is provided at 12.5-km. All model runs are evaluated using four metrics designed to capture key features of precipitation events: event frequency, event intensity, even total, and event duration. Overall, the downscaling approaches result in a reasonable representation of many of the key features of precipitation events over the region, however considerable biases exist in the magnitude of each metric. Based on this evaluation there is no clear indication that higher resolution simulations result in more realistic results in general, however many small-scale features such as orographic enhancement of precipitation are only captured at higher resolutions suggesting some added value over coarser resolution. While the differences between simulations produced using nudging and no nudging are small, there is some improvement in model fidelity when nudging is introduced, especially at a cutoff wavelength of 600 km compared to 2000 km. Based on the results of this evaluation, dynamical regional downscaling using NU-WRF results in a more realistic representation of precipitation event climatology than the global downscaling of MERRA2 using GEOS-5.

Our goal is to test the classical theory that OB associations are the expanded remnants of dense and compact star clusters disrupted by processes such as residual gas expulsion. Gaia astrometry is available for 258 out of 433 members of the association, with revised Hipparcos astrometry used for the remainder. We use these data to confirm that the three subgroups of Sco-Cen are gravitationally unbound and have non-isotropic velocity dispersions, suggesting that they have not had time to dynamically relax. We also explore the internal kinematics of the subgroups to search for evidence of expansion. We test Blaauw's classical linear model of expansion, search for velocity trends along the Galactic axes, compare the expanding and non-expanding convergence points, perform traceback analysis assuming both linear trajectories and using an epicycle approximation, and assess the evidence for expansion in proper motions corrected for virtual expansion/ contraction. None of these methods provide coherent evidence for expansion of the subgroups, with no evidence to suggest that the subgroups had a more compact configuration in the past. We find evidence for kinematic substructure within the subgroups that supports the view that they were not formed by the disruption of individual star clusters. We conclude that Sco-Cen was likely to have been born highly substructured, with multiple small-scale star formation events contributing to the overall OB association, and not as single, monolithic burst of clustered star formation.

(2013), solar cycle variation of carbon monoxide (CO) is analyzed with MLS observation, which covers more than thirteen years (2004-2017) including maximum of solar cycle 24. Being produced primarily by the carbon dioxide (CO2) photolysis in the lower thermosphere, the variations of the mesospheric CO concentration are largely driven by the solar cycle modulated ultraviolet (UV) variation. This solar signal extends down to the lower altitudes by the dynamical descent in the winter polar vortex, showing a time lag that is consistent with the average descent velocity. To characterize a global distribution of the solar impact, MLS CO is correlated with the SORCE measured total solar irradiance (TSI) and UV. As high as 0.8 in most of the polar mesosphere, the linear correlation coefficients between CO and UV/TSI are more robust than those found in the previous work. The photochemical contribution explains most (68%) of the total variance of CO while the dynamical contribution accounts for 21% of the total variance at upper mesosphere. The photochemistry driven CO anomaly signal is extended in the tropics by vertical mixing. The solar cycle signal in CO is further examined with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) 3.5 simulation by implementing two different modeled Spectral Solar Irradiances (SSIs): SRPM 2012 and NRLSSI. The model simulations underestimate the mean CO amount and solar cycle variations of CO, by a factor of 3, compared to those obtained from MIS observation. Different inputs of the solar spectrum have small impacts on CO variation.

Assessing the long-term variability of acetylene and ethane in the stratosphere of Jupiter	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter, atmosphere; Spectroscopy; Abundances, atmospheres; Atmospheres, structure	COMPOSITE INFRARED SPECTROMETER; MERIDIONAL TRANSPORT; SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION; TIME-DEPENDENCE; COOLING RATES; CASSINI; TEMPERATURES; ATMOSPHERE; CIRS; CIRCULATION	Acetylene (C2H2) and ethane (C2H6) are both produced in the stratosphere of Jupiter via photolysis of methane (CH4). Despite this common source, the latitudinal distribution of the two species is radically different, with acetylene decreasing in abundance towards the pole, and ethane increasing towards the pole. We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared observations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane. We confirm that the latitudinal distributions of ethane and acetylene are decoupled, and that this is a persistent feature over multiple years. The acetylene distribution falls off towards the pole, peaking at similar to 30 degrees N with a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of similar to 0.8 parts per million (ppm) at 1 mbar and still falling off at +/- 70 degrees with a VMR of similar to 0.3 ppm. The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we move from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric about the equator. We suggest that both the short term changes in acetylene and its latitudinal asymmetry is driven by changes to the vertical stratospheric mixing, potentially related to propagating wave phenomena. Unlike acetylene, ethane has a symmetric distribution about the equator that increases toward the pole, with a peak mole fraction of similar to 18 ppm at about +/- 50 degrees latitude, with a minimum at the equator of similar to 10 ppm at 1 mbar. The ethane distribution does not appear to respond to mid-latitude stratospheric mixing in the same way as acetylene, potentially as a result of the vertical gradient of ethane being much shallower than that of acetylene. The equator-to-pole distributions of acetylene and ethane are consistent with acetylene having a shorter lifetime than ethane that is not sensitive to longer advective timescales, but is augmented by short-term dynamics, such as vertical mixing. Conversely, the long lifetime of ethane allows it to be transported to higher latitudes faster than it can be chemically depleted. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The opposition effect in Saturn's main rings as seen by Cassini ISS: 4. Correlations of the surge morphology with surface albedos and VIMS spectral properties	ICARUS			English	Article							BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; DISCRETE RANDOM-MEDIA; SOLAR-SYSTEM OBJECTS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PHASE CURVES; COHERENT BACKSCATTERING; LIGHT-SCATTERING; WEAK-LOCALIZATION; HST OBSERVATIONS; ELECTROMAGNETIC-WAVES	In this paper, we continue our analysis of the saturnian ring opposition effect seen by Cassini ISS. The ring opposition effect is a peak in the rings' reflectivity caused as the directions from a spot on the rings to the observer and to the light source, respectively, converge toward zero degrees. So far, the exact origin of the ring's opposition effect is still a matter of debate. In our previous work (Deau, et al., 2013, Icarus, 226, 591-603), we compared the opposition effect morphology with the rings' optical depth and found that only the slope of the linear part of the rings' phase curves was strongly correlated with the optical depth. We interpreted this as an indication of the predominant role of interparticle shadowing at moderate phase angles (alpha similar to 10-40 degrees). More recently (Deau, 2015, Icarus, 253, 311-345), we showed that interparticle shadowing cannot explain the behavior at low phase angles (alpha < 1 degrees), indirectly confirming our 2013 result. These findings led to the idea that coherent backscattering is preponderant at the smallest phase angles. Coherent backscattering depends on the microscopic scale of the regolith, and there is a growing body of evidence that regolith grain size, porosity, roughness, and composition control the opposition surge behavior for alpha < 1 degrees. To test this hypothesis, we compare the opposition surge morphology to the regolith albedo and other spectral properties related to the regolith, such as water ice band depths and spectral slopes derived from Cassini VIMS data (Hedman et al., 2013, Icarus, 223, 105-130). Indeed, it has been recently proven that coherent backscattering affects the water ice band depth variations with phase angle for icy saturnian regoliths (Kolokolova et al., 2010, The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 711, L71-L74). We find that the opposition surge morphology is strongly correlated with the water ice band depth and the regolith albedo. We interpret this finding as an indication that coherent backscattering plays a role in affecting both the water ice band depths and the opposition surge at low phase angles (alpha < 1 degrees). As the regolith albedo and spectral properties are related to the grain size, porosity, roughness, and composition, we try to assess which of these regolith properties are preponderant in coherent backscattering. Our study is able to narrow down the parameter space of these properties, whose values allow a good match between the angular width predicted by models of coherent backscattering and the width of the observed peak.

Biohydrogen production from space crew's waste simulants using thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Biohydrogen; Space crew's waste; Human waste simulants; Thermophilic consortia	MIXED CULTURE; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; DEGREES-C; FERMENTATION; BACTERIA; SLUDGE	Human waste simulants were for the first time converted into biohydrogen by a newly developed anaerobic microbial consortium via thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing. Four different BioH2-producing consortia (denoted as C1, C2, C3 and C4) were isolated, and developed using human waste simulants as substrate. The thermophilic consortium C3, which contained Thermoanaerobacterium, Caloribacterium, and Caldanaerobius species as the main constituents, showed the highest BioH(2) production (3.999 mmol/g) from human waste simulants under optimized conditions (pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C). The consortium C3 also produced significant amounts of BioH2 (5.732 mmol/g and 2.186 mmol/g) using wastewater and activated sludge, respectively. The developed consortium in this study is a promising candidate for H-2 production in space applications as in situ resource utilization.

This compact system was developed for measuring spatial and temporal patterns of clouds and their optical depth in support of applications including Earth-space optical communications. The camera is mounted to the side of the reflective sphere to leave the zenith sky unobstructed. The resulting geometric distortion is removed through an angular map derived from a combination of checkerboard-target imaging, geometric ray tracing, and sun-location-based alignment. A tape of high-emissivity material on the side of the reflector acts as a reference that is used to estimate and remove thermal emission from the metal sphere. Once a bias that is under continuing study was removed, sky radiance measurements from the all-sky imager in the 8-14 mu m wave-length range agreed to within 0.91 W/(m(2) sr) of measurements from a previously calibrated, lens-based infrared cloud imager over its 110 degrees field of view.

Detection of Artificially Generated Seismic Signals Using Balloon-Borne Infrasound Sensors	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							EARTHQUAKE; PRESSURE; WAVES; VENUS	We conducted an experiment in Pahrump, Nevada, in June 2017, where artificial seismic signals were created using a seismic hammer, and the possibility of detecting them from their acoustic signature was examined. In this work, we analyze the pressure signals recorded by highly sensitive barometers deployed on the ground and on tethers suspended from balloons. Our signal processing results show that wind noise experienced by a barometer on a free-flying balloon is lower compared to one on a moored balloon. This has never been experimentally demonstrated in the lower troposphere. While seismoacoustic signals were not recorded on the hot air balloon platform owing to operational challenges, we demonstrate the detection of seismoacoustic signals on our moored balloon platform. Our results have important implications for performing seismology in harsh surface environments such as Venus through atmospheric remote sensing. Plain Language Summary Seismology has traditionally been performed by placing sensors on the ground. However, on Venus, high temperature and pressure on the surface drastically shorten the lifetime of sensors placed on the ground. This is one of the major reasons why we know so little about the interior of Venus. Earthquakes are known to generate pressure waves in the atmosphere at various frequencies. The low-frequency components are found to travel long distances with relatively little damping. Here we demonstrate that these waves can be detected by pressure sensors floating on balloons. By demonstrating that we can detect artificial earthquakes from their atmospheric signature using a pressure sensor suspended on a balloon, we motivate a new way to perform seismology on Venus-by detecting seismic waves while floating at a high altitude, where the temperature and pressure are more benign. The success of this technology offers a compelling alternative to landing on the surface and surviving for long periods of time to study the internal structure of Venus.

A massive core for a cluster of galaxies at a redshift of 4.3	NATURE			English	Article							DARK-MATTER HALOS; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; ELLIPTIC GALAXY; SPACE-TELESCOPE; EMISSION-LINE; PROTOCLUSTER; SEARCH; SIMULATIONS; PREDICTIONS; EVOLUTION	Massive galaxy clusters have been found that date to times as early as three billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs(1-3). The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters-termed 'protoclusters'-can be identified in cosmological simulations that have the highest overdensities (greater-than-average densities) of dark matter(4-6). Protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts7. However, recent detections of possible protoclusters hosting such starbursts(8-11) do not support the kind of rapid cluster-core formation expected from simulations(12): the structures observed contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad region, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon emission from the source SPT234956. We find that this source consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies, all lying at redshifts of 4.31. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1,000 times more quickly than our own Milky Way, and that all are located within a projected region that is only around 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than ten times the average blank-field value (integrated over all redshifts), and more than 1,000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion (approximately 410 kilometres per second) of these galaxies and the enormous gas and star-formation densities suggest that this system represents the core of a cluster of galaxies that was already at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.	[Miller, T. B.; Chapman, S.

Simulating ice thickness and velocity evolution of Upernavik Isstrom 1849-2012 by forcing prescribed terminus positions in ISSM	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							OUTLET GLACIER DYNAMICS; MASS-LOSS; JAKOBSHAVN ISBRAE; CALVING DYNAMICS; SUBMARINE MELT; GREENLAND; SHEET; MODEL; ACCELERATION; VARIABILITY	Tidewater glacier velocity and mass balance are known to be highly responsive to terminus position change. Yet it remains challenging for ice flow models to reproduce observed ice margin changes. Here, using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM; Larour et al., 2012), we simulate the ice velocity and thickness changes of Upernavik Isstrom (north-western Greenland) by prescribing a collection of 27 observed terminus positions spanning 164 years (18492012). The simulation shows increased ice velocity during the 1930s, the late 1970s and between 1995 and 2012 when terminus retreat was observed along with negative surface mass balance anomalies. Three distinct mass balance states are evident in the reconstruction: (1849-1932) with near zero mass balance, (1932-1992) with ice mass loss dominated by ice dynamical flow, and (1998-2012), when increased retreat and negative surface mass balance anomalies led to mass loss that was twice that of any earlier period. Over the multi-decadal simulation, mass loss was dominated by thinning and acceleration responsible for 70% of the total mass loss induced by prescribed change in terminus position. The remaining 30% of the total ice mass loss resulted directly from prescribed terminus retreat and decreasing surface mass balance. Although the method can not explain the cause of glacier retreat, it enables the reconstruction of ice flow and geometry during 1849-2012. Given annual or seasonal ob-served terminus front positions, this method could be a useful tool for evaluating simulations investigating the effect of calving laws.

Characterization of a functionally graded material of Ti-6Al-4V to 304L stainless steel with an intermediate V section	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Transition metal alloys and compounds; Laser processing; Powder metallurgy; Crystal structure; Mechanical properties; Thermodynamic modeling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TITANIUM; ALLOY; VANADIUM; JOINTS; SYSTEM	This work examines a functionally graded material, fabricated using additive manufacturing, that grades from Ti-6Al-4V to 304L stainless steel (SS304L) through an intermediate introduction of V. V was incorporated to preclude the formation of Fe-Ti phases in the direct joining of stainless steels and Ti-alloys. The addition of V resulted in cracking at the transition from 25 vol% SS304L/75 vol% V to 50 vol % SS304L/50 vol% V, thus the build was halted prior to the transition to 100 vol% SS304L. Through experimental investigations and thermodynamic calculations, this crack was found to be due to the formation of brittle sigma-FeV. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data from OMI has been used in a wide range of applications and research resulting in many new findings. Due to its unprecedented spatial resolution, in combination with daily global coverage, OMI plays a unique role in measuring trace gases important for the ozone layer, air quality, and climate change. With the operational very fast delivery (VFD; direct readout) and near real-time (NRT) availability of the data, OMI also plays an important role in the development of operational services in the atmospheric chemistry domain.

We analyze new Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) PAN observations over North America from July 2006 to July 2009. Using aircraft observations from the Colorado Front Range, we demonstrate that TES can be sensitive to elevated PAN in the boundary layer (similar to 750 hPa) even in the presence of clouds. In situ observations have shown that wildfire emissions can rapidly produce PAN, and PAN decomposition is an important component of ozone production in smoke plumes. We identify smoke-impacted TES PAN retrievals by co-location with NOAA Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke plumes. Depending on the year, 15-32% of cases where elevated PAN is identified in TES observations (retrievals with degrees of freedom (DOF) > 0.6) overlap smoke plumes during July. Of all the retrievals attempted in the July 2006 to July 2009 study period, 18% is associated with smoke. A case study of smoke transport in July 2007 illustrates that PAN enhancements associated with HMS smoke plumes can be connected to fire complexes, providing evidence that TES is sufficiently sensitive to measure elevated PAN several days downwind of major fires. Using a subset of retrievals with TES 510 hPa carbon monoxide (CO) > 150 ppbv, and multiple estimates of background PAN, we calculate enhancement ratios for tropospheric average PAN relative to CO in smoke-impacted retrievals. Most of the TES-based enhancement ratios fall within the range calculated from in situ measurements.

Lett. 118, 060401 (2017)], in this paper we report on the design and characterization of a device that, with 20-nanosecond latency, outputs a bit based on whether the wavelength of an incoming photon is greater than or less than approximate to 700 nm. Using the one-meter telescope at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Table MountainObservatory, we generated random bits from astronomical photons in both color channels from 50 stars of varying color and magnitude, and from 12 quasars with redshifts up to z = 3.9. With stars, we achieved bit rates of similar to 1 x 10(6) Hz/m(2), limited by saturation of our single-photon detectors, and with quasars of magnitudes between 12.9 and 16, we achieved rates between similar to 10(2) and 2 x 10(3) Hz/m(2). For bright quasars, the resulting bitstreams exhibit sufficiently low amounts of statistical predictability as quantified by the mutual information. In addition, a sufficiently high fraction of bits generated are of true astronomical origin in order to address both the locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes when used to set the measurement settings in a test of the Bell-CHSH inequality.

In particular, the impacts of locally emitted anthropogenic and dust aerosols, and aerosols transported from outside California are studied. We differentiate three pathways of aerosol effects: aerosol-radiation interaction (ARI), aerosol-snow interaction (ASI), and aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI). The convection-permitting model simulations show that precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), and surface air temperature averaged over the whole domain (34-42 degrees N, 117-124 degrees W, not including ocean points) are reduced when aerosols are included, therefore reducing large biases in these variables due to the absence of aerosol effects in the model. Aerosols affect California water resources through the warming of mountaintops and the reduction of precipitation; however, different aerosol sources play different roles in changing surface temperature, precipitation, and snowpack in California by means of various weights of the three pathways. ARI by all aerosols mainly cools the surface, leading to slightly increased SWE over the mountains. Locally emitted dust aerosols warm the surface of mountaintops through ASI, in which the reduced snow albedo associated with dusty snow leads to more surface absorption of solar radiation and reduced SWE. Transported aerosols and local anthropogenic aerosols play a dominant role in increasing nonprecipitating clouds but reducing precipitation through ACI, leading to reduced SWE and runoff on the Sierra Nevada, as well as the warming of mountaintops associated with decreased SWE and hence lower surface albedo. The average changes in surface temperature from October 2012 to June 2013 are about -0.19 and 0.22 K for the whole domain and over mountaintops, respectively. Overall, the averaged reduction during October to June is about 7% for precipitation, 3% for SWE, and 7% for surface runoff for the whole domain, while the corresponding numbers are 12, 10, and 10% for the mountaintops. The reduction in SWE is more significant in a dry year, with 9% for the whole domain and 16% for the mountaintops. The maximum reduction of similar to 20% in precipitation occurs in May and is associated with the maximum aerosol loading, leading to the largest decrease in SWE and surface runoff over that period. It is also found that dust aerosols can cause early snowmelt on the mountaintops and reduced surface runoff after April.

Ionization Efficiency in the Dayside Martian Upper Atmosphere	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual (Mars)	CRUSTAL MAGNETIC-FIELD; SOLAR-WIND INTERACTION; MARS; PHOTOELECTRONS; MODEL; MAVEN; IONOSPHERE; ANOMALIES; REGIONS; WAVES	Combining the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution measurements of neutral atmospheric density, solar EUV/X-ray flux, and differential photoelectron intensity made during 240 nominal orbits, we calculate the ionization efficiency, defined as the ratio of the secondary (photoelectron impact) ionization rate to the primary (photon impact) ionization rate, in the dayside Martian upper atmosphere under a range of solar illumination conditions. Both the CO2 and O ionization efficiencies tend to be constant from 160. km up to 250. km, with respective median values of 0.19 +/- 0.03 and 0.27 +/- 0.04. These values are useful for fast calculation of the ionization rate in the dayside Martian upper atmosphere, without the need to construct photoelectron transport models. No substantial diurnal and solar cycle variations can be identified, except for a marginal trend of reduced ionization efficiency approaching the terminator. These observations are favorably interpreted by a simple scenario with ionization efficiencies, as a first approximation, determined by a comparison between relevant cross sections. Our analysis further reveals a connection between regions with strong crustal magnetic fields and regions with high ionization efficiencies, which are likely indicative of more efficient vertical transport of photoelectrons near magnetic anomalies.

With the exception of the Bullet cluster, the sample is drawn from the Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey and the Frontier Fields program, containing five relaxed and six merging clusters. The ICL fraction is calculated in three optical filters using the CHEFs ICL estimator, a robust and accurate algorithm free of a priori assumptions. We find that the ICL fraction in the three bands is, on average, higher for the merging clusters, ranging between similar to 7% and 23%, compared with the similar to 2%-11% found for the relaxed systems. We observe a nearly constant value (within the error bars) in the ICL fraction of the regular clusters at the three wavelengths considered, which would indicate that the colors of the ICL and the cluster galaxies are, on average, coincident and, thus, so are their stellar populations. However, we find a higher ICL fraction in the F606W filter for the merging clusters, consistent with an excess of lower-metallicity/younger stars in the ICL, which could have migrated violently from the outskirts of the infalling galaxies during the merger event.

Life produces gases and other substances, such as pigments, which can have distinct spectral or photometric signatures. Whether or not life is found with future data must be expressed with probabilities, requiring a framework of biosignature assessment. We present a framework in which we advocate using biogeochemical Exo-Earth System models to simulate potential biosignatures in spectra or photometry. Given actual observations, simulations are used to find the Bayesian likelihoods of those data occurring for scenarios with and without life. The latter includes false positives wherein abiotic sources mimic biosignatures. Prior knowledge of factors influencing planetary inhabitation, including previous observations, is combined with the likelihoods to give the Bayesian posterior probability of life existing on a given exoplanet. Four components of observation and analysis are necessary. (1) Characterization of stellar (e.g., age and spectrum) and exoplanetary system properties, including external exoplanet parameters (e.g., mass and radius), to determine an exoplanet's suitability for life. (2) Characterization of internal exoplanet parameters (e.g., climate) to evaluate habitability.

Design and results of the ice sheet model initialisation initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; FUTURE SEA-LEVEL; NORTHEAST GREENLAND; HEAT-FLUX; SPATIAL SENSITIVITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ELEVATION FEEDBACK; OUTLET GLACIERS; LOCAL GLACIERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Earlier large-scale Greenland ice sheet sea-level projections (e.g. those run during the ice2sea and SeaRISE initiatives) have shown that ice sheet initial conditions have a large effect on the projections and give rise to important uncertainties. The goal of this initMIP-Greenland intercomparison exercise is to compare, evaluate, and improve the initialisation techniques used in the ice sheet modelling community and to estimate the associated uncertainties in modelled mass changes. initMIP-Greenland is the first in a series of ice sheet model intercomparison activities within ISMIP6 (the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6), which is the primary activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) focusing on the ice sheets. Two experiments for the large-scale Greenland ice sheet have been designed to allow intercomparison between participating models of (1) the initial present-day state of the ice sheet and (2) the response in two idealised forward experiments. The forward experiments serve to evaluate the initialisation in terms of model drift (forward run without additional forcing) and in response to a large perturbation (prescribed surface mass balance anomaly); they should not be interpreted as sea-level projections. We present and discuss results that highlight the diversity of data sets, boundary conditions, and initialisation techniques used in the community to generate initial states of the Greenland ice sheet. We find good agreement across the ensemble for the dynamic response to surface mass balance changes in areas where the simulated ice sheets overlap but differences arising from the initial size of the ice sheet. The model drift in the control experiment is reduced for models that participated in earlier intercomparison exercises.

O-3 is retrieved from microwindows in the 14.8 and 10 mu m spectral regions and requires non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling of the O-3 v(1) and v(3) vibrational levels. Ozone is reliably retrieved from 20 km in the MA mode (40 km for UA and NLC) up to similar to 105 km during dark conditions and up to similar to 95 km during illuminated conditions. Daytime MIPAS O-3 has an average vertical resolution of 3-4 km below 70 km, 6-8 km at 70-80 km, 8-10 km at 80-90, and 5-7 km at the secondary maximum (90-100 km). For nighttime conditions, the vertical resolution is similar below 70 km and better in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere: 4-6 km at 70-100 km, 4-5 km at the secondary maximum, and 6-8 km at 100-105 km. The noise error for daytime conditions is typically smaller than 2% below 50 km, 2-10% between 50 and 70 km, 10-20% at 70-90 km, and similar to 30% above 95 km. For nighttime, the noise errors are very similar below around 70 km but significantly smaller above, being 10-20% at 75-95 km, 20-30% at 95-100 km, and larger than 30% above 100 km. The additional major O-3 errors are the spectroscopic data uncertainties below 50 km (10-12 %) and the non-LTE and temperature errors above 70 km. The validation performed suggests that the spectroscopic errors below 50 km, mainly caused by the O-3 air-broadened half-widths of the v(2) band, are overestimated. The non-LTE error (including the uncertainty of atomic oxygen in nighttime) is relevant only above similar to 85 km with values of 15-20 %. The temperature error varies from similar to 3% up to 80 km to 15-20% near 100 km. Between 50 and 70 km, the pointing and spectroscopic errors are the dominant uncertainties. The validation performed in comparisons with SABER, GOMOS, MLS, SMILES, and ACE-FTS shows that MIPAS O-3 has an accuracy better than 5% at and below 50 km, with a positive bias of a few percent. In the 50-75 km region, MIPAS O-3 has a positive bias of similar to 10 %, which is possibly caused in part by O-3 spectroscopic errors in the 10 mu m region. Between 75 and 90 km, MIPAS nighttime O-3 is in agreement with other instruments by 10 %, but for daytime the agreement is slightly larger, similar to 10-20 %. Above 90 km, MIPAS daytime O-3 is in agreement with other instruments by 10 %. At night, however, it shows a positive bias increasing from 10% at 90 km to 20% at 95-100 km, the latter of which is attributed to the large atomic oxygen abundance used. We also present MIPAS O-3 distributions as function of altitude, latitude, and time, showing the major O-3 features in the middle and upper mesosphere. In addition to the rapid diurnal variation due to photochemistry, the data also show apparent signatures of the diurnal migrating tide during both day-and nighttime, as well as the effects of the semi-annual oscillation above similar to 70 km in the tropics and mid-latitudes. The tropical daytime O-3 at 90 km shows a solar signature in phase with the solar cycle.

Praseodymium Telluride: A High-Temperature, High-ZT Thermoelectric Material	JOULE			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS; WAVE PAW CODE; TRANSPORT; BAND	Refractory rare-earth tellurides with the Th3P4 structure type have attracted considerable interest as high-performance thermoelectric materials since the 1980s due to their high dimensionless figure of merit (ZT). Extensive work has been conducted on La3-xTe4 with peak ZT values greater than 1.1 at 1,273 K. The high ZT of La3-xTe4 is in part due to a large peak in the density of states near the Fermi level from the La 5d states. Here, we revisit Pr3-xTe4, for which our electronic structure calculations predict a favorable modification of the density of states by the introduction of praseodymium's 4f electrons. This was experimentally verified by preparing Pr3-xTe4 samples with varying Pr vacancy concentrations using a mechanochemical synthesis approach. The thermoelectric properties were measured and a ZT of 1.7 at 1,200 K was achieved with Pr2.74Te4. The 50% improvement in peak ZT compared with La3-xTe4 resulted from an increased effective mass, improved Seebeck coefficient, and lower thermal conductivity.

The thermal emission rapidly fades, suggesting extremely rapid cooling of small clasts. The duration and evolution of the explosive eruption are akin to what might be expected from a strombolian or vulcanian explosion. The presence of such events provides an additional volcanic process that can be imaged by future missions with the intent of determining lava composition from eruption temperature, an important constraint on the internal composition of lo. These data promise to be of particular use in understanding the mechanics of explosive volcanic processes on lo.	[Davies, A. G.; Johnson, T.

Snowmelt-Driven Trade-Offs Between Early and Late Season Productivity Negatively Impact Forest Carbon Uptake During Drought	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							BLACK SPRUCE FORESTS; WATER AVAILABILITY; HIGH-ELEVATION; CLIMATE; BALANCE; BOREAL; ASSIMILATION; RESPIRATION; RESPONSES; ARIDITY	Future projections of declining snowpack and increasing potential evaporation are predicted to advance the timing of snowmelt in mountain ecosystems globally with unknown implications for snowmelt-driven forest productivity. Accordingly, this study combined satellite-and tower-based observations to investigate the forest productivity response to snowpack and potential evaporation variability between 1989 and 2012 throughout the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion, United States. Our results show that early and late season productivity were significantly and inversely related and that future shifts toward earlier and/or reduced snowmelt could decrease snowmelt water use efficiency and thus restrict productivity despite a longer growing season. This was explained by increasing snow aridity, which incorporated evaporative demand and snow water supply, and was modified by summer precipitation to determine total annual productivity. The combination of low snow accumulation and record high potential evaporation in 2012 resulted in the 34 year minimum ecosystem productivity that could be indicative of future conditions. Plain Language Summary Snow is melting earlier, and there is potential for greater evaporation as a result of warmer, drier conditions in semiarid mountain regions around the world. These changes combine to affect seasonal moisture availability on the landscape, which is essential to proper ecosystem function. This research used 34 years of satellite-and field-based data that included three distinct droughts to show that forest activity, measured as the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere, may decrease as a result of this scenario. This work has broad implications for global climate change since forests in seasonally snow-covered areas currently contribute to mitigating carbon dioxide emissions.

Compared with liquid clouds, the observational evidence for the aerosol impact on ice clouds is much more limited and shows conflicting results, partly because the distinct features of different ice cloud and aerosol types were seldom considered. Using 9-year satellite retrievals, we find that, for convection-generated (anvil) ice clouds, cloud optical thickness, cloud thickness, and cloud fraction increase with small-to-moderate aerosol loadings (<0.3 aerosol optical depth) and decrease with further aerosol increase. For in situ formed ice clouds, however, these cloud properties increase monotonically and more sharply with aerosol loadings. An increase in loading of smoke aerosols generally reduces cloud optical thickness of convection-generated ice clouds, while the reverse is true for dust and anthropogenic pollution aerosols. These relationships between different cloud/aerosol types provide valuable constraints on the modeling assessment of aerosol-ice cloud radiative forcing.

The observations reveal that CO2, Ar, N-2, CO, and O densities all increase up to similar to 200% compared to the longer-term running median densities. The density increases are seen throughout this altitude region, and the relative variations are seen to be stronger at higher altitudes. Density increases indicating the solar extreme ultraviolet influence are also seen. This study is consistent with that during increased dust load, the whole atmosphere expands and rises, and other processes may also be involved. The results agree with the general circulation model predictions, providing observational evidence for how dust increases affect different atmospheric species in the thermosphere.

A Century of Stability of Avannarleq and Kujalleq Glaciers, West Greenland, Explained Using High-Resolution Airborne Gravity and Other Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ICE-SHEET; JAKOBSHAVN ISBRAE; BED ELEVATION; OCEAN WATERS; ACCELERATION	The evolution of Greenland glaciers in a warming climate depends on their depth below sea level, flow speed, surface melt, and ocean-induced undercutting at the calving front. We present an innovative mapping of bed topography in the frontal regions of Sermeq Avannarleq and Kujalleq, two major glaciers flowing into the ice-choked Torssukatak Fjord, central west Greenland. The mapping combines a mass conservation algorithm inland, multibeam echo sounding data in the fjord, and high-resolution airborne gravity data at the ice-ocean transition where other approaches have traditionally failed. We obtain a reliable, precision (+/- 40 m) solution for bed topography across the ice-ocean boundary. The results reveal a 700 m deep fjord that abruptly ends on a 100-300 m deep sill along the calving fronts. The shallow sills explain the presence of stranded icebergs, the resilience of the glaciers to ocean-induced undercutting by warm Atlantic water, and their remarkable stability over the past century.

Four major sources of systematic errors were considered over the 9-year record of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E): clear-sky bias, cloud-rain partition (CRP) bias, cloud-fraction-dependent bias, and cloud temperature bias. Errors were estimated using a unique merged AMSR-E/Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Level 2 data set as well as observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar. To quantify the CRP bias more accurately, a new parameterization was developed to improve the inference of CLWP in warm rain. The cloud-fraction-dependent bias was found to be a combination of the CRP bias, an in-cloud bias, and an adjacent precipitation bias. Globally, the mean net bias was 0.012kg/m(2), dominated by the CRP and in-cloud biases, but with considerable regional and seasonal variation. Good qualitative agreement between a bias-corrected AMSR-E CLWP climatology and ship observations in the Northeast Pacific suggests that the bias estimates are reasonable. However, a possible underestimation of the net bias in certain conditions may be due in part to the crude method used in classifying precipitation, underscoring the need for an independent method of detecting rain in warm clouds. This study demonstrates the importance of combining visible-infrared imager data and passive microwave CLWP observations for estimating uncertainties and improving the accuracy of these observations.

Data recorded from 1985 to 2016 from a dozen ground-based sites have been analyzed, mostly between 30 and 67 degrees N. At clean-air sites such as Alaska, Sweden, New Mexico, or the mountains of California, the ethene columns were always less than 1 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) and therefore undetectable. In urban sites such as JPL, California, ethene was measurable with column amounts of 20 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) observed in the 1990s. Despite the increasing population and traffic in southern California, a factor 3 decrease in ethene column density is observed over JPL over the past 25 years, accompanied by a decrease in CO. This is likely due to southern California's increasingly stringent vehicle exhaust regulations and tighter enforcement over this period.

The Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC): history, status and perspectives	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PROPOSED STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS; ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; TEMPERATURE ALGORITHMS; VERTICAL RESOLUTION; LIDAR OZONE; CLO MEASUREMENTS; UV IRRADIANCE; NITRIC-ACID; VALIDATION	The Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) is an international global network of more than 90 stations making high-quality measurements of atmospheric composition that began official operations in 1991 after 5 years of planning. Apart from sonde measurements, all measurements in the network are performed by ground-based remote-sensing techniques. Originally named the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC), the name of the network was changed to NDACC in 2005 to better reflect the expanded scope of its measurements. The primary goal of NDACC is to establish long-term databases for detecting changes and trends in the chemical and physical state of the atmosphere (meso-sphere, stratosphere, and troposphere) and to assess the coupling of such changes with climate and air quality. NDACC's origins, station locations, organizational structure, and data archiving are described. NDACC is structured around categories of ground-based observational techniques (sonde, lidar, microwave radiometers, Fourier-transform infrared, UV-visible DOAS (differential optical absorption spectroscopy)type, and Dobson-Brewer spectrometers, as well as spectral UV radiometers), timely cross-cutting themes (ozone, water vapour, measurement strategies, cross-network data integration), satellite measurement systems, and theory and analyses. Participation in NDACC requires compliance with strict measurement and data protocols to ensure that the network data are of high and consistent quality. To widen its scope, NDACC has established formal collaborative agreements with eight other cooperating networks and Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW). A brief history is provided, major accomplishments of NDACC during its first 25 years of operation are reviewed, and a forward-looking perspective is presented.

Evaluating the lower-tropospheric COSMIC GPS radio occultation sounding quality over the Arctic	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; TEMPERATURE; INVERSION; ASSIMILATION; PROFILES; CLOUD; UNCERTAINTIES; RETRIEVALS; SIGNALS; IMPACT	Lower-tropospheric moisture and temperature measurements are crucial for understanding weather prediction and climate change. Global Positioning System radio occultation (GPS RO) has been demonstrated as a high-quality observation technique with high vertical resolution and subkelvin temperature precision from the upper troposphere to the stratosphere. In the tropical lower troposphere, particularly the lowest 2 km, the quality of RO retrievals is known to be degraded and is a topic of active research. However, it is not clear whether similar problems exist at high latitudes, particularly over the Arctic, which is characterized by smooth ocean surface and often negligible moisture in the atmosphere. In this study, 3-year (2008-2010) GPS RO soundings from COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) over the Arctic (65-90 degrees N) show uniform spatial sampling with average penetration depth within 300m above the ocean surface. Over 70% of RO soundings penetrate deep into the lowest 300m of the troposphere in all non-summer seasons. However, the fraction of such deeply penetrating profiles reduces to only about 50-60% in summer, when near-surface moisture and its variation increase. Both structural and parametric uncertainties of GPS RO soundings were also analyzed. The structural uncertainty (due to different data processing approaches) is estimated to be within similar to 0.07% in refractivity, similar to 0.72K in temperature, and similar to 0.05 g kg(-1) in specific humidity below 10 km, which is derived by comparing RO retrievals from two independent data processing centers. The parametric uncertainty (internal uncertainty of RO sounding) is quantified by comparing GPS RO with near-coincident radiosonde and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF) ERA-Interim profiles. A systematic negative bias up to similar to 1% in refractivity below 2 km is only seen in the summer, which confirms the moisture impact on GPS RO quality.

Recent advances in satellite geodesy mean we can now measure this interseismic strain accumulation with a high degree of accuracy. But it remains unclear how to interpret short-term geodetic observations, measured over decades, when estimating the seismic hazard of faults accumulating strain over centuries. Here, we show that strain accumulation rates calculated from geodetic measurements around a major transform fault are constant for its entire 250-year interseismic period, except in the similar to 10 years following an earthquake. The shear strain rate history requires a weak fault zone embedded within a strong lower crust with viscosity greater than similar to 10(20) Pa s. The results support the notion that short-term geodetic observations can directly contribute to long-term seismic hazard assessment and suggest that lower-crustal viscosities derived from postseismic studies are not representative of the lower crust at all spatial and temporal scales.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; stars: imaging; stars: individual (MWC 758)		Large-scale spiral arms have been revealed in scattered light images of a few protoplanetary disks. Theoretical models suggest that such arms may be driven by and corotate with giant planets, which has called for remarkable observational efforts to look for them. By examining the rotation of the spiral arms for the MWC 758 system over a 10 year timescale, we are able to provide dynamical constraints on the locations of their perturbers. We present reprocessed Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/NICMOS F110W observations of the target in 2005, and the new Keck/NIRC2 L'-band observations in 2017. MWC. 758's two well-known spiral arms are revealed in the NICMOS archive at the earliest observational epoch. With additional Very Large Telescope (VLT)/SPHERE data, our joint analysis leads to a pattern speed of 0.6 degrees(+3.3 degrees)(-0.6 degrees) yr(-1) at 3 sigma for the two major spiral arms. If the two arms are induced by a perturber on a near-circular orbit, its best-fit orbit is at 89 au (0''.59), with a 3 sigma lower limit of 30 au (0 ''.20). This finding is consistent with the simulation prediction of the location of an arm-driving planet for the two major arms in the system.

UKIRT-2017-BLG-001Lb: A Giant Planet Detected through the Dust	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						binaries: general; Galaxy: bulge; gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems	MICROLENSING OPTICAL DEPTH; INTERSTELLAR EXTINCTION; GALACTIC BULGE; MILKY-WAY; SEXTRACTOR; EXOPLANETS; EVENT; MODEL; COLOR; MASS	We report the discovery of a giant planet in event UKIRT-2017-BLG-001, detected by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) microlensing survey. The mass ratio between the planet and its host is q = 1.50(-0.14)(+0.17) x 10(-3), about 1.5 times the Jupiter/Sun mass ratio. The event lies 0 degrees.35 from the Galactic center and suffers from high extinction of A(K) = 1.68. Therefore, it could be detected only by a near-infrared (NIR) survey. The field also suffers from large spatial differential extinction, which makes it difficult to estimate the source properties required to derive the angular Einstein radius. Nevertheless, we find evidence suggesting that the source is located in the far disk. If correct, this would be the first source star of a microlensing event to be identified as belonging to the far disk. We estimate the lens mass and distance using a Bayesian analysis to find that the planet's mass is 1.28(-0.44)(+0.37)M(J), and it orbits a 0.81(-0.27)(+0.21)M(circle dot) star at an instantaneous projected separation of 4.18(-0.88)(+0.96) au. The system is at a distance of 6.3(-2.1) (+1.6) kpc, and so likely resides in the Galactic bulge. In addition, we find a non-standard extinction curve in this field, in agreement with previous results toward high-extinction fields near the Galactic center.

In the meantime, remotely sensed observations of the continental water cycle variables such as soil moisture, lakes and river elevations are more frequent and accurate. Therefore, those two different types of information can be combined, using data assimilation techniques to reduce a model's uncertainties in its state variables or/and in its input parameters. The objective of this study is to present a data assimilation platform that assimilates into the large-scale ISBA-CTRIP LSM a punctual river discharge product, derived from ENVISAT nadir altimeter water elevation measurements and rating curves, over the whole Amazon basin. To deal with the scale difference between the model and the observation, the study also presents an initial development for a localization treatment that allows one to limit the impact of observations to areas close to the observation and in the same hydrological network. This assimilation platform is based on the ensemble Kalman filter and can correct either the CTRIP river water storage or the discharge. Root mean square error (RMSE) compared to gauge discharges is globally reduced until 21% and at Obidos, near the outlet, RMSE is reduced by up to 52% compared to ENVISAT-based discharge. Finally, it is shown that localization improves results along the main tributaries.

Atmospheric correction, which obtains water-leaving radiance from the total radiance measured by satellite-borne or airborne sensors, remains a challenging task for coastal waters due to the complex optical properties of aerosols and ocean waters. In this paper, we report a research algorithm on aerosol and ocean color retrieval with emphasis on coastal waters, which uses coupled atmosphere and ocean radiative transfer model to fit polarized radiance measurements at multiple viewing angles and multiple wavelengths. Ocean optical properties are characterized by a generalized bio-optical model with direct accounting for the absorption and scattering of phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and non-algal particles (NAP). Our retrieval algorithm can accurately determine the water-leaving radiance and aerosol properties for coastal waters, and may be used to improve the atmospheric correction when apply to a hyperspectral ocean color instrument.

Photochemistry in the upper atmosphere generates a complex array of organic molecules from the simple precursors N-2 and CH4. These organics continue to react and combine, forming aerosol layers and ultimately depositing on the surface. Organics are transported via pluvial (rain) and fluvial (rivers/flooding) processes into the methane-based hydrocarbon lakes, where evaporation of volatile liquids can create evaporite deposits of remnant dissolved molecules. Within such deposits, chemical and physical processes may be occurring even at low temperatures. We have demonstrated in previous work that benzene and ethane rapidly form a unique and stable co-crystal at Titan surface temperatures (90-95 K), akin to a salt on Earth, where the weak van der Waals interactions in the benzene-ethane co-crystal are analogous to the ionic bonds in a salt. Here, we report the formation of a second co-crystal between acetylene and ammonia, which forms even more quickly and is stable through anticipated conditions of Titan "rain" events of liquid methane, ethane, and propane. Such co-crystals represent an exciting new class of possible minerals for Titan's surface and may be responsible for processes such as selective sequestration and storage of species as well as having new properties for construction and erosive resistance of geological materials.

Historical and Contemporary Trends in the Size, Drift, and Color of Jupiter's Great Red Spot	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets	POTENTIAL-VORTICITY DYNAMICS; HIGH-RESOLUTION; CLOUD FEATURES; ATMOSPHERE; CASSINI; OVAL; SATELLITES; VOYAGER-1; TRACKING; VELOCITY	Observations of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) span more than 150 years. This allows for careful measurements of its size and drift rate. High spatial resolution spacecraft data also allow tracking of its spectral characteristics and internal dynamics and structure. The GRS continues to shrink in longitudinal length at an approximately linear rate of 0 degrees.194 yr(-1) and in latitudinal width at 0 degrees.048 yr(-1). Its westward drift rate (relative to System III W. longitude) has increased from similar to 0 degrees.26/day in the 1980s to similar to 0 degrees.36/day currently. Since 2014, the GRS's short wavelength (<650 nm) reflectance has continued to decrease, while it has become brighter at 890 nm, indicating a change in clouds/haze at high altitudes. In addition, its north-south color asymmetry has decreased, and the dark core has become smaller. Internal velocities have increased on its east and west edges, and decreased on the north and south, resulting in decreased relative vorticity and circulation. The GRS's color changes from 2014 to 2017 may be explained by changes in stretching vorticity or divergence acting to balance the decrease in relative vorticity.

The pulsars were observed with the Arecibo Observatory and/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies ranging from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately monthly cadence, and six high-timing-precision pulsars were observed weekly. All were observed at widely separated frequencies at each observing epoch in order to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods for data processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a new, automated method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each pulsar that includes spin, astrometric, and (for binary pulsars) orbital parameters; time-variable dispersion delays; and parameters that quantify pulse-profile evolution with frequency. The timing solutions provide three new parallax measurements, two new Shapiro delay measurements, and two new measurements of significant orbital-period variations. We fit models that characterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We find that 11 pulsars show significant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically measured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin. A companion paper uses these data to constrain the strength of the gravitational-wave background.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: The Photometric Data Set for Cosmology	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						catalogs; cosmology: observations; surveys; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; ANGULAR MASKS; DEEP SURVEY; ALL-SKY; CALIBRATION; GALAXIES; CFHTLENS; CATALOG; QUALITY; SEXTRACTOR	We describe the creation, content, and validation of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) internal year-one cosmology data set, Y1A1 GOLD, in support of upcoming cosmological analyses. The Y1A1 GOLD data set is assembled from multiple epochs of DES imaging and consists of calibrated photometric zero-points, object catalogs, and ancillary data products-e.g., maps of survey depth and observing conditions, star galaxy classification, and photometric redshift estimates that are necessary for accurate cosmological analyses. The Y1A1 GOLD wide area object catalog consists of similar to 137 million objects detected in co-added images covering similar to 1800 deg(2) in the DES grizY filters. The 10 sigma limiting magnitude for galaxies is g = 23.4, r = 23.2, i = 22.5, z = 21.8, and Y = 20.1. Photometric calibration of Y1A1 GOLD was performed by combining nightly zero-point solutions with stellar locus regression, and the absolute calibration accuracy is better than 2% over the survey area. DES Y1A1 GOLD is the largest photometric data set at the achieved depth to date, enabling precise measurements of cosmic acceleration at z less than or similar to 1.

The Aliso Canyon natural gas leak as a natural tracer experiment: reducing errors in aircraft atmospheric inversion estimates of point-source emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						urban greenhouse gas emissions; inverse modeling; Aliso Canyon natural gas leak; aircraft observations; transport model error	TOP-DOWN ESTIMATE; METHANE EMISSIONS; CO2 EMISSIONS; LOS-ANGELES; MODELING TECHNIQUE; WEATHER RESEARCH; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SURFACE FLUX; TRANSPORT; AREA	Urban greenhouse gas (GHG) flux estimation with atmospheric measurements and modeling, i.e. the 'top-down' approach, can potentially support GHG emission reduction policies by assessing trends in surface fluxes and detecting anomalies from bottom-up inventories. Aircraft-collected GHG observations also have the potential to help quantify point-source emissions that may not be adequately sampled by fixed surface tower-based atmospheric observing systems. Here, we estimate CH4 emissions from a known point source, the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak in Los Angeles, CA from October 2015-February 2016, using atmospheric inverse models with airborne CH4 observations from twelve flights approximate to 4 km downwind of the leak and surface sensitivities from a mesoscale atmospheric transport model. This leak event has been well-quantified previously using various methods by the California Air Resources Board, thereby providing high confidence in the mass-balance leak rate estimates of (Conley et al 2016), used here for comparison to inversion results. Inversions with an optimal setup are shown to provide estimates of the leak magnitude, on average, within a third of the mass balance values, with remaining errors in estimated leak rates predominantly explained by modeled wind speed errors of up to 10 ms(-1), quantified by comparing airborne meteorological observations with modeled values along the flight track. An inversion setup using scaled observational wind speed errors in the model-data mismatch covariance matrix is shown to significantly reduce the influence of transport model errors on spatial patterns and estimated leak rates from the inversions. In sum, this study takes advantage of a natural tracer release experiment (i.e. the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak) to identify effective approaches for reducing the influence of transport model error on atmospheric inversions of point-source emissions, while suggesting future potential for integrating surface tower and aircraft atmospheric GHG observations in top-down urban emission monitoring systems.

J	Garcia, M; Saatchi, S; Ustin, S; Balzter, H				Garcia, Mariano; Saatchi, Sassan; Ustin, Susan; Balzter, Heiko			Modelling forest canopy height by integrating airborne LiDAR samples with satellite Radar and multispectral imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						LiDAR; SAR; Canopy height; Forest structure; Support vector regression	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BAND SAR BACKSCATTER; LEAF-AREA INDEX; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; GROUND BIOMASS; VEGETATION; CARBON; LANDSCAPE; MISSION	Spatially-explicit information on forest structure is paramount to estimating aboveground carbon stocks for designing sustainable forest management strategies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. LiDAR measurements provide samples of forest structure that must be integrated with satellite imagery to predict and to map landscape scale variations of forest structure. Here we evaluate the capability of existing satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multispectral data to estimate forest canopy height over five study sites across two biomes in North America, namely temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. Pixel size affected the modelling results, with an improvement in model performance as pixel resolution coarsened from 25 m to 100 m. Likewise, the sample size was an important factor in the uncertainty of height prediction using the Support Vector Machine modelling approach. Larger sample size yielded better results but the improvement stabilised when the sample size reached approximately 10% of the study area. We also evaluated the impact of surface moisture (soil and vegetation moisture) on the modelling approach. Whereas the impact of surface moisture had a moderate effect on the proportion of the variance explained by the model (up to 14%), its impact was more evident in the bias of the models with bias reaching values up to 4 m. Averaging the incidence angle corrected radar backscatter coefficient (gamma degrees) reduced the impact of surface moisture on the models and improved their performance at all study sites, with R-2 ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, RMSE between 2.02 and 5.64 and bias between 0.02 and -0.06, respectively, at 100 m spatial resolution. An evaluation of the relative importance of the variables in the model performance showed that for the study sites located within the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome ALOS-PALSAR HV polarised backscatter was the most important variable, with Landsat Tasselled Cap Transformation components barely contributing to the models for two of the study sites whereas it had a significant contribution at the third one. Over the temperate conifer forests, Landsat Tasselled Cap variables contributed more than the ALOS-PALSAR HV band to predict the landscape height variability. In all cases, incorporation of multispectral data improved the retrieval of forest canopy height and reduced the estimation uncertainty for tall forests. Finally, we concluded that models trained at one study site had higher uncertainty when applied to other sites, but a model developed from multiple sites performed equally to site-specific models to predict forest canopy height. This result suggest that a biome level model developed from several study sites can be used as a reliable estimator of biome-level forest structure from existing satellite imagery.

Despite this, there are large across-model variations in the simulation and projection of carbon cycling. Several model intercomparison projects (MIPs), for example, the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) (historical simulations), Trends in Net Land-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange (TRENDY), and Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), have sought to understand intermodel differences. In this study, the authors developed a suite of new techniques to conduct post-MIP analysis to gain insights into uncertainty sources across 25 models in the three MIPs. First, terrestrial carbon storage dynamics were characterized by a three-dimensional (3D) model output space with coordinates of carbon residence time, net primary productivity (NPP), and carbon storage potential. The latter represents the potential of an ecosystem to lose or gain carbon. This space can be used to measure how and why model output differs. Models with a nitrogen cycle generally exhibit lower annual NPP in comparison with other models, and mostly negative carbon storage potential. Second, a transient traceability framework was used to decompose any given carbon cycle model into traceable components and identify the sources of model differences. The carbon residence time (or NPP) was traced to baseline carbon residence time (or baseline NPP related to the maximum carbon input), environmental scalars, and climate forcing. Third, by applying a variance decomposition method, the authors show that the intermodel differences in carbon storage can be mainly attributed to the baseline carbon residence time and baseline NPP (>90% in the three MIPs). The three techniques developed in this study offer a novel approach to gain more insight from existing MIPs and can point out directions for future MIPs. Since this study is conducted at the global scale for an overview on intermodel differences, future studies should focus more on regional analysis to identify the sources of uncertainties and improve models at the specified mechanism level.

CORE Collaboration	Exploring cosmic origins with CORE: Cosmological parameters	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						cosmological parameters from CMBR; CMBR experiments; neutrino masses from cosmology	FINE-STRUCTURE CONSTANT; MICROWAVE-ANISOTROPY-PROBE; TEMPERATURE-REDSHIFT RELATION; ANGULAR POWER SPECTRUM; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; COLD DARK-MATTER; NEUTRINO MASS; BACKGROUND ANISOTROPIES; FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS; CMB POLARIZATION	We forecast the main cosmological parameter constraints achievable with the CORE space mission which is dedicated to mapping the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). CORE was recently submitted in response to ESA's fifth call for medium-sized mission proposals (M5). Here we report the results from our pre-submission study of the impact of various instrumental options, in particular the telescope size and sensitivity level, and review the great, transformative potential of the mission as proposed. Specifically, we assess the impact on a broad range of fundamental parameters of our Universe as a function of the expected CMB characteristics, with other papers in the series focusing on controlling astrophysical and instrumental residual systematics. In this paper, we assume that only a few central CORE frequency channels are usable for our purpose, all others being devoted to the cleaning of astrophysical contaminants. On the theoretical side, we assume ACDM as our general framework and quantify the improvement provided by CORE over the current constraints from the Planck 2015 release. We also study the joint sensitivity of CORE and of future Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Large Scale Structure experiments like DESI and Euclid. Specific constraints on the physics of inflation are presented in another paper of the series. In addition to the six parameters of the base ACDM, which describe the matter content of a spatially flat universe with adiabatic and scalar primordial fluctuations from inflation, we derive the precision achievable on parameters like those describing curvature, neutrino physics, extra light relics, primordial helium abundance, dark matter annihilation, recombination physics, variation of fundamental constants, dark energy, modified gravity, reionization and cosmic birefringence. In addition to assessing the improvement on the precision of individual parameters, we also forecast the post-CORE overall reduction of the allowed parameter space with figures of merit for various models increasing by as much as similar to 10(7) as compared to Planck 2015, and 10(5) with respect to Planck 2015 + future BAO measurements.

Modeling the dynamic response of outlet glaciers to observed ice-shelf thinning in the Bellingshausen Sea Sector, West Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						glacier flow; glacier modeling; glaciological model experiments; ice-ocean interactions; ice shelves	SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; PINE ISLAND GLACIER; FLOW; STABILITY; GREENLAND; DISCHARGE; COLLAPSE; RETREAT	Satellite observations of gravity anomalies, ice-surface elevation and glacier velocity show significant increases in net grounded-ice-mass loss over the past decade along the Bellingshausen Sea sector (BSS), West Antarctica, in areas where warm (> 1 degrees C) sea water floods the continental shelf. These observations provide compelling but indirect evidence that mass losses are driven primarily by reduced buttressing from the floating ice shelves caused by ocean-driven ice-shelf thinning. Here, we combine recent observations of ice velocity, thickness and thickness changes with an ice flow model to study the instantaneous dynamic response of BSS outlet glaciers to observed ice-shelf thinning, alone. Our model results show that multiple BSS outlet glaciers respond instantaneously to observed ice-shelf thinning, particularly in areas where ice shelves ground at discrete points. Increases in modeled and observed dynamic mass losses, however, account for similar to 5% of the mass loss rates estimated from gravity anomalies and changes in ice-surface elevation, suggesting that variations in surface mass balance may be key to understanding recent BSS mass loss. Our approach isolates the impact of ice-shelf thinning on glacier flow and shows that if ice-shelf thinning continues at or above current rates, total BSS mass loss will increase in the next decade.

J	Tang, GQ; Behrangi, A; Long, D; Li, CM; Hong, Y				Tang, Guoqiang; Behrangi, Ali; Long, Di; Li, Changming; Hong, Yang			Accounting for spatiotemporal errors of gauges: A critical step to evaluate gridded precipitation products	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Precipitation; IMERG; Rain gauge; Gauge density; Evaluation; Error function	GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; MULTISCALE EVALUATION; DAY-1 IMERG; REAL-TIME; RAINFALL; TMPA; TRMM; VARIABILITY; MICROWAVE; BASINS	Rain gauge observations are commonly used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation products. However, the inherent difference between point-scale gauge measurements and areal satellite precipitation, i.e. a point of space in time accumulation v.s. a snapshot of time in space aggregation, has an important effect on the accuracy and precision of qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. This study aims to quantify the uncertainty caused by various combinations of spatiotemporal scales (0.1 degrees-0.8 degrees and 1-24 h) of gauge network designs in the densely gauged and relatively flat Ganjiang River basin, South China, in order to evaluate the state-of-the-art satellite precipitation, the Integrated Multi satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG). For comparison with the dense gauge network serving as "ground truth", 500 sparse gauge networks are generated through random combinations of gauge numbers at each set of spatiotemporal scales. Results show that all sparse gauge networks persistently underestimate the performance of IMERG according to most metrics. However, the probability of detection is overestimated because hit and miss events are more likely fewer than the reference numbers derived from dense gauge networks. A nonlinear error function of spatiotemporal scales and the number of gauges in each grid pixel is developed to estimate the errors of using gauges to evaluate satellite precipitation. Coefficients of determination of the fitting are above 0.9 for most metrics. The error function can also be used to estimate the required minimum number of gauges in each grid pixel to meet a predefined error level. This study suggests that the actual quality of satellite precipitation products could be better than conventionally evaluated or expected, and hopefully enables non-subject-matter expert researchers to have better understanding of the explicit uncertainties when using point-scale gauge observations to evaluate areal products.

Utilizing primary crater clusters to study crater populations and meteoroid properties	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Issues in Crater Studies and the Dating of Planetary Surfaces	MAY, 2015	Baltimore, MD				SATURATION EQUILIBRIUM; MARS; CHRONOLOGY; ATMOSPHERE	Images from Mars Global Surveyor and later images from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal that roughly half of the meteoroids striking Mars (at meter to few decameter crater diameters) fragment in the Martian atmosphere, producing small clusters of primary impact craters. Statistics of these "primary clusters" yield valuable information about important Martian phenomena and properties of interplanetary bodies, including meteoroid behavior in the Martian atmosphere, bulk strengths of bodies striking Mars, and the fraction of Martian "field secondary" craters, a datum that would improve crater count chronometry. Many Martian impactors fragment at altitudes significantly higher than 18 km above the mean surface of Mars, and we find that most bodies striking Mars and Earth have low bulk strengths, consistent with crumbly or highly fractured objects. Applying statistics of primary clusters at various elevations and independent diameter bins, we describe a technique to estimate the percentage of semirandomly scattered "field secondary" craters. Our provisional estimate of this percentage, in the diameter range similar to 250 m down to similar to 22 m, is similar to 40% to similar to 80% of the total impacts, with the higher percentages at smaller diameters. Our data argue against earlier suggestions of overwhelming dominance by either primaries or secondaries in this diameter range.	[Hartmann, William K.; Joseph, Emily C.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: curved-sky weak lensing mass map	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; surveys; dark matter	SCIENCE VERIFICATION DATA; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; SHEAR-PEAK STATISTICS; 3D COSMIC SHEAR; GALAXY CLUSTERS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; NOISE BIAS; MATTER; CONSTRAINTS; COSMOLOGY	We construct the largest curved-sky galaxy weak lensing mass map to date from the DES first-year (DES Y1) data. The map, about 10 times larger than the previous work, is constructed over a contiguous approximate to 1500 deg(2), covering a comoving volume of approximate to 10 Gpc(3). The effects of masking, sampling, and noise are tested using simulations. We generate weak lensing maps from two DES Y1 shear catalogues, METACALIBRATION and IM3SHAPE, with sources at red-shift 0.2 < z < 1.3, and in each of four bins in this range. In the highest signal-to-noise map, the ratio between the mean signal to noise in the E-mode map and the B-mode map is similar to 1.5 (similar to 2) when smoothed with a Gaussian filter of sigma(G) = 30 (80) arcmin. The second and third moments of the convergence kappa in the maps are in agreement with simulations. We also find no significant correlation of kappa with maps of potential systematic contaminants. Finally, we demonstrate two applications of the mass maps: (1) cross-correlation with different foreground tracers of mass and (2) exploration of the largest peaks and voids in the maps.

UV-luminous, star-forming hosts of z similar to 2 reddened quasars in the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; quasars: general; galaxies: star formation; ultraviolet: galaxies	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; RADIO-QUIET QUASARS; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; INTERSTELLAR DUST; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; FORMATION HISTORY; TYPE-1 QUASARS; MILKY-WAY; H-ALPHA	We present the first rest-frame UV population study of 17 heavily reddened, high-luminosity [E(B - V)(QSO) greater than or similar to 0.5; L-bol > 10(46) erg s(-1)] broad-line quasars at 1.5 < z < 2.7. We combine the first year of deep, optical, ground-based observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey and UKIDSS Large Area Survey data, from which the reddened quasars were initially identified. We demonstrate that the significant dust reddening towards the quasar in our sample allows host galaxy emission to be detected at the rest-frame UV wavelengths probed by the DES photometry. By exploiting this reddening effect, we disentangle the quasar emission from that of the host galaxy via spectral energy distribution fitting. We find evidence for a relatively unobscured, star-forming host galaxy in at least 10 quasars, with a further three quasars exhibiting emission consistent with either star formation or scattered light. From the rest-frame UV emission, we derive instantaneous, dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) in the range 25 < SFRUV < 365 M-circle dot yr(-1), with an average SFRUV = 130 + 95 M-circle dot yr(-1). We find a broad correlation between SFRUV and the bolometric quasar luminosity. Overall, our results show evidence for coeval star formation and black hole accretion occurring in luminous, reddened quasars at the peak epoch of galaxy formation.	[Wethers, C.

The characteristics of the plasma environment inside these diamagnetic regions are studied using in situ measurements by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium instruments. Although the unmagnetized plasma density has been observed to exhibit little dynamics compared to the very dynamical magnetized cometary plasma, we detected several localized dynamic plasma structures inside those diamagnetic regions. These plasma structures are not related to the direct ionization of local cometary neutrals. The structures are found to be steepened, asymmetric plasma enhancements with typical rising-to-descending slope ratio of similar to 2.8 (+/- 1.9), skewness similar to 0.43 (+/- 0.36), mean duration of similar to 2.7 (+/- 0.9) min and relative density variation Delta N/N of similar to 0.5 (+/- 0.2), observed close to the electron exobase. Similar steepened plasma density enhancements were detected at the magnetized boundaries of the diamagnetic cavity as well as outside the diamagnetic region. The plausible scalelength and propagation direction of the structures are estimated from simple plasma dynamics considerations. It is suggested that they are large-scale unmagnetized plasma enhancements, transmitted from the very dynamical outer magnetized region to the inner magnetic field-free cavity region.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: the impact of galaxy neighbours on weak lensing cosmology with IM3SHAPE	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: statistics; cosmological parameters; cosmology: observations	SCIENCE VERIFICATION DATA; COSMIC SHEAR; NOISE BIAS; PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; SHAPE MEASUREMENTS; CFHTLENS; GRAVITY; SIMULATIONS; DISTORTIONS; CALIBRATION	We use a suite of simulated images based on Year 1 of the Dark Energy Survey to explore the impact of galaxy neighbours on shape measurement and shear cosmology. The HOOPOE image simulations include realistic blending, galaxy positions, and spatial variations in depth and point spread function properties. Using the IM3SHAPE maximum-likelihood shape measurement code, we identify four mechanisms by which neighbours can have a non-negligible influence on shear estimation. These effects, if ignored, would contribute a net multiplicative bias of m similar to 0.03-0.09 in the Year One of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1) IM3SHAPE catalogue, though the precise impact will be dependent on both the measurement code and the selection cuts applied. This can be reduced to percentage level or less by removing objects with close neighbours, at a cost to the effective number density of galaxies n(eff) of 30 per cent. We use the cosmological inference pipeline of DES Y1 to explore the cosmological implications of neighbour bias and show that omitting blending from the calibration simulation for DES Y1 would bias the inferred clustering amplitude S-8 equivalent to sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) by 2 sigma towards low values. Finally, we use the HOOPOE simulations to test the effect of neighbour-induced spatial correlations in the multiplicative bias. We find the impact on the recovered S-8 of ignoring such correlations to be subdominant to statistical error at the current level of precision.	[Samuroff, S.; Bridle, S. L.; Rollins, R.

Rings and gaps in the disc around Elias 24 revealed by ALMA	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planet-disc interactions; protoplanetary discs; dust, extinction	SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; NON-AXISYMMETRICAL STRUCTURES; ORBITAL COROTATION TORQUE; GIANT PLANET FORMATION; HIGH-MASS PLANETS; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; HL TAU; GRAIN-GROWTH; GAS-GIANT; DUSTY GAS	We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 2 observations of the 1.3-mm dust continuum emission of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star Elias 24 with an angular resolution of similar to 0.2 arcsec (similar to 28 au). The dust continuum emission map reveals a dark ring at a radial distance of 0.47 arcsec (similar to 65 au) from the central star, surrounded by a bright ring at 0.58 arcsec (similar to 81 au). In the outer disc, the radial intensity profile shows two inflection points at 0.71 and 0.87 arcsec (similar to 99 and 121 au, respectively). We perform global three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic gas/dust simulations of discs hosting a migrating and accreting planet. Combining the dust density maps of small and large grains with three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we produce synthetic ALMA observations of a variety of disc models in order to reproduce the gap-and ring-like features observed in Elias 24. We find that the dust emission across the disc is consistent with the presence of an embedded planet with a mass of similar to 0.7 M-J at an orbital radius of similar to 60 au. Our model suggests that the two inflection points in the radial intensity profile are due to the inward radial motion of large dust grains from the outer disc. The surface brightness map of our disc model provides a reasonable match to the gap-and ring-like structures observed in Elias 24, with an average discrepancy of similar to 5 per cent of the observed fluxes around the gap region.

Global and local re-impact and velocity regime of ballistic ejecta of boulder craters on Ceres	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							SECONDARY CRATERS; OBLIQUE IMPACTS; LUNAR; SIZE; BLOCKS; DISTRIBUTIONS; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; REGOLITH; SURFACE	Imaging by the Dawn-spacecraft reveals that fresh craters on Ceres below 40 km often exhibit numerous boulders. We investigate how the fast rotating, low-gravity regime on Ceres influences their deposition. We analyze size-frequency distributions of ejecta blocks of twelve boulder craters. Global and local landing sites of boulder crater ejecta and boulder velocities are determined by the analytical calculation of elliptic particle trajectories on a rotating body. The cumulative distributions of boulder diameters follow steep-sloped power-laws. We do not find a correlation between boulder size and the distance of a boulder to its primary crater. Due to Ceres' low gravitational acceleration and fast rotation, ejecta of analyzed boulder craters (8-31 km) can be deposited across the entire surface of the dwarf planet. The particle trajectories are strongly influenced by the Coriolis effect as well as the impact geometry. Fast ejecta of high-latitude craters accumulate close to the pole of the opposite hemisphere. Fast ejecta of low-latitude craters wraps around the equator. Rotational effects are also relevant for the low-velocity regime. Boulders are ejected at velocities up to 71 m/s.

J	Franklin, M; Kalashnikova, OV; Garay, MJ; Fruin, S				Franklin, Meredith; Kalashnikova, Olga V.; Garay, Michael J.; Fruin, Scott			Characterization of Subgrid-Scale Variability in Particulate Matter with Respect to Satellite Aerosol Observations	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						subgrid variability; aerosol optical depth; PM2.5; PM10; spatial scale; variograms; exposure assessment	AIR-POLLUTION; OPTICAL DEPTH; PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS; EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT; SPATIAL VARIATION; MISR; MORTALITY; DISEASE; ASTHMA	Recent use of satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to characterize surface concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution has proven extremely valuable in estimating exposures for health effects studies. While the spatial resolutions of satellite data provide far better coverage than existing fixed site surface monitoring stations, they are not able to capture atmospheric processes such as dilution of primary pollutants that vary at small spatial scales. As a result, small-scale variability due to highly localized sources such as traffic may be poorly represented, which in turn may lead to exposure measurement error in epidemiological analyses. Using a fixed spatial grid representing 4.4 km Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol observations, we examined the spatial variability in fine and coarse mode PM (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 respectively) measured at ground monitors from a unique spatially-dense sampling campaign in Southern California. We found that while the variance in measured PM2.5 differed seasonally (warm 6.82 mu g(2)/m(6) and cool 24.5 mu g(2)/m(6)) across the study region, the average subgrid (<4.4 km) variance did not (warm 2.03 mu g(2)/m(6) and cool 2.43 mu g(2)/m(6)) and was significantly smaller. On the other hand, ground monitor PM2.5-10 concentrations showed large variance in warm (18.6 mu g(2)/m(6)) and cool (20.6 mu g(2)/m(6)) seasons, as well as seasonal differences in subgrid variance (warm 8.90 mu g(2)/m(6) and cool 3.28 mu g(2)/m(6)). Geostatistical analysis of the semivariance as a function of distance indicated that variability in measured PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 concentrations was relatively constant for spatial scales of one to five kilometers, but there was evidence of small-scale (-500 m) variability in PM2.5-10 concentrations in the cool season. The lack of small-scale spatial variability in the warm season was likely due to large photochemical contributions to regional PM2.5, and greater regional contributions to PM2.5-10 from windblown dust. In contrast, in the cool season there tends to be greater localized concentrations from primary traffic sources due to stronger nocturnal inversions and delayed morning winds reducing dilution that contribute to greater spatial heterogeneity. Overall, these results suggest that regional contributions tend to dominate PM2.5, and spatial resolutions of satellite observations including the 4.4 km MISR and 3 km MODIS aerosol products aptly capture relevant spatial variability. Coarse PM2.5-10 can have seasonally dependent localized contributions, leading to small-scale variability below current satellite aerosol product resolutions.

RECONSTRUCTION OF CLOUD GEOMETRY FROM HIGH-RESOLUTION MULTI-ANGLE IMAGES	INVERSE PROBLEMS AND IMAGING			English	Article						Cloud reconstructions; integral geometry; inverse linear transport; boundary reconstructions; satellite measurements	IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MISR; RESEARCH SCANNING POLARIMETER; RETRIEVAL; MOTION	We consider the reconstruction of the interface of compact, connected "clouds" from satellite or airborne light intensity measurements. In a two-dimensional setting, the cloud is modeled by an interface, locally represented as a graph, and an outgoing radiation intensity that is consistent with a diffusion model for light propagation in the cloud. Light scattering inside the cloud and the internal optical parameters of the cloud are not modeled explicitly. The main objective is to understand what can or cannot be reconstructed in such a setting from intensity measurements in a finite (on the order of 10) number of directions along the path of a satellite or an aircraft. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical predictions. Finally, we explore a kinematic extension of the algorithm for retrieving cloud motion (wind) along with its geometry.

This new Combined ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) ESDR was produced by merging two current state-of-the-art emissivity datasets: the UW-Madison MODIS Infrared emissivity dataset (UW BF) and the JPL ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset Version 4 (GEDv4). The dataset includes monthly global records of emissivity and related uncertainties at 13 hinge points between 3.6-14.3 [tm, as well as principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients at 5-km resolution for the years 2000 through 2016.

J	Kim, SB; Huang, HT; Liao, TH; Colliander, A				Kim, Seung-Bum; Huang, Huanting; Liao, Tien-Hao; Colliander, Andreas			Estimating Vegetation Water Content and Soil Surface Roughness Using Physical Models of L-Band Radar Scattering for Soil Moisture Retrieval	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						surface roughness; vegetation water content; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar	BACKSCATTERING MODEL; TIME-SERIES; PARAMETERS; CANOPIES	Soil surface roughness and above-ground vegetation water content (VWC) are estimated by inverting physical models for L-band scattering and absorption at 40' incidence angle using ground, airborne and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radar data. The spatial resolution varies from field scale (airborne and ground) to 3 km (SMAP). The temporal resolution is defined by the length and interval of observation time windows (weeks to three months for surface roughness, and three to seven days for VWC). The validation of the roughness estimates shows an accuracy of 25% (bare surface) and 29 to 46% (croplands and pasture). The correlation degrades as vegetation becomes thicker, indicating the stronger scattering and absorption by thicker vegetation. The roughness retrievals with the SMAP data are within the physical range of 0.5 cm to 4 cm. They show larger values in croplands than in natural terrain. The VWC estimate modifies a ' first guess' (in situ values for the airborne experiment; and 16-daily climatology for SMAP). The VWC retrievals correctly follow the full growth of crops and the RMSE is smaller than 20% in the airborne retrievals: the correlation ranges from 0.57 to 0.91. These results demonstrate that the forward model inversion has a potential to retrieve VWC for the four major crops over the entire phase of the crop growth. The VWC retrievals from the SMAP data revised the climatology first guess more in the croplands, where the climatology is more likely to depart from the contemporaneous condition than in natural landcover. The value of this work lies in the fact that the surface roughness at the footprint scale is difficult to characterize and a global VWC product at SMAP's spatial scale from microwave observations is rare, and that this paper presents a plausible pathway towards such products. The estimates at these temporal and spatial scales derived from microwave observations will be useful for studies of climate, agriculture, and soil moisture.

Uncertainties in current climate models result in disagreement on the amount of water resources. Soil moisture and vegetation water content are key environmental variables on evaporation and transpiration at the land-atmosphere boundary. Radar remote sensing helps to improve our estimate of water resources spatially and temporally. This work proposes a backscattered power formulation for the Ku-band. Li et al. (2010) retrieved soil moisture and vegetation water content values using Windsat data and simultaneous collocated QuikSCAT backscattered power are used to estimate different parameters of backscatter formulation. These parameters are used to estimate soil moisture and vegetation water content using QuikSCAT power everywhere and every day during the summer season. The 2-folded cross validation method is used to evaluate the performance of soil moisture and vegetation water content retrieval. A relatively large correlation is observed between vegetation water content using WindSat and QuikSCAT data in land classes of Evergreen Needleleaf, Evergreen Broadleaf, Deciduous Broadleaf, and Mixed Forests. Similarly, the retrieved soil moisture using QuikSCAT in areas with bare surface fraction of greater than 60% shows relatively high correlation with WindSat values. QuikSCAT satellite collects data over land globally almost every day. Therefore, QuikSCAT data can be used to generate a global map of soil moisture and vegetation water content daily from 2000 to 2009.

Topography and Three-Dimensional Structure Can Estimate Tree Diversity along a Tropical Elevational Gradient in Costa Rica	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Costa Rica; lidar; montane gradient; neotropical forest; remote sensing; tree diversity	LARGE-FOOTPRINT LIDAR; SPECIES RICHNESS; FOREST STRUCTURE; RAIN-FOREST; VASCULAR EPIPHYTES; DRY FORESTS; VEGETATION; PATTERNS; SCALE; BIOMASS	This research seeks to understand how tree species richness and diversity relates to field data (1-ha plots) on forest structure (stems, basal area) and lidar derived data on topography and three-dimensional forest structure along an elevational gradient in Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica. In 2016 we calculated tree species richness and diversity indices for twenty 1-ha plots located along a gradient ranging from 56 to 2814 m in elevation. Field inventory data were combined with large footprint (20 m) airborne lidar data over plots in 2005, in order to quantify variations in topography and three-dimensional structure across plots and landscapes. A distinct pattern revealing an increase in species' richness and the Shannon diversity index was observed in correlation with increasing elevation, up to about 600 m; beyond that, at higher elevations, a decrease was observed. Stem density and basal area both peaked at the 2800 m site, with a mini-peak at 600 m, and were both negatively associated with species richness and diversity. Species richness and diversity were negatively correlated with elevation, while the two tallest relative height metrics (rhl00, rh75) derived from lidar were both significantly positively correlated with species richness and diversity. The best lidar-derived topographical and three-dimensional forest structural models showed a strong relationship with the Shannon diversity index (r(2) = 0.941, p < 0.01), with ten predictors; conversely, the best species richness model was weaker (r(2) = 0.599, p < 0.01), with two predictors. We realize that our high r2 has to be interpreted with caution due to possible overfitting, since we had so few ground plots in which to develop the relationship with the numerous topographical and structural explanatory variables. However, this is still an interesting analysis, even with the issue of overfitting. To reduce issues with overfitting we used ridge regression, which acted as a regularization method, shrinking coefficients in order to decrease their variability and multicollinearity. This study is unique because it uses paired 1-ha plot and airborne lidar data over a tropical elevation gradient, and suggests potential for mapping species richness and diversity across elevational gradients in tropical montane ecosystems using topography and relative height metrics from spaceborne lidar with greater spatial coverage (e.g., GEDI).

DopplerScatt is an airborne Ka-band scatterometer that has been developed under NASA's Instrument Incubator Program ( 1IP) to provide a proof of concept of the feasability of measuring these variables using pencil-beam scanning Doppler scatterometry. In the first half of this paper, we present the Doppler scatterometer measurement and processing principles, paying particular attention to deriving a complete measurement error budget. Although Doppler radars have been used for the estimation of surface currents, pencil-beam Doppler Scatterometry offers challenges and opportunities that require separate treatment. The calibration of the Doppler measurement to remove platform and instrument biases has been a traditional challenge for Doppler systems, and we introduce several new techniques to mitigate these errors when conical scanning is used. The use of Ka-band for airborne Doppler scatterometry measurements is also new, and, in the second half of the paper, we examine the phenomenology of the mapping from radar cross section and radial velocity measurements to winds and surface currents. To this end, we present new Ka-band Geophysical Model Functions ( GMFs) for winds and surface currents obtained from multiple airborne campaigns. We find that the wind Ka-band GMF exhibits similar dependence on wind speed as that for Ku-band scatterometers, such as QuikSCAT, albeit with much greater upwind-crosswind modulation. The surface current GMF at Ka-band is significantly different from that at C-band, and, above 4.5 m/ s has a weak dependence on wind speed, although still dependent on wind direction. We examine the effects of Bragg-wave modulation by long waves through a Modululation Transfer Function ( MTF), and show that the observed surface current dependence on winds is consistent with past Ka-band MTF observations. Finally, we provide a preliminary validation of our geophysical retrievals, which will be expanded in subsequent publications. Our results indicate that Ka-band Doppler scatterometry could be a feasible method for wide-swath simultaneous measurements of winds and currents from space.

Methods and results: Pressure, flow, and anatomical values were obtained from patients in 251 vessels from two different centers. Fractional flow reserve (FFR), Coronary flow reserve (CFR), hyperemic stenosis resistance index (HSR) and hyperemic microvascular index (HMR) were calculated. Anatomical data was corrected for the presence of guidewire and the LFC values were calculated. LFC was correlated with FFR, CFR, HSR, HMR, individually and in combination with % AS. The p < 0.05 was used for statistical significance. LFC correlated significantly when the FFR (pressure-based), CFR (flow-based), and anatomical measure % AS were combined (r = 0.64; p < 0.05). Similarly, LFC correlated significantly when HSR, HMR, and % AS were combined (r = 0.72; p < 0.05). LFC was able to significantly (p < 0.05) distinguish between the two concordant and the two discordant groups of FFR and CFR, corresponding to the clinically used cut-off values (FFR=0.80 and CFR=2.0). The LFC could also significantly (p < 0.05) distinguish between the normal and abnormal microvasculature conditions in the presence of non-significant epicardial stenosis, while the comparison was borderline significant (p=0.09) in the presence of significant stenosis. Conclusion: LFC, a parameter that combines both the anatomical and functional end-points, has the potential for application in a clinical setting for CAD evaluation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, not all species are equally likely to disperse over long distances. In mangroves, which possess seafaring propagules, it is largely unknown which species are more likely to reach the ocean and contribute to long-distance dispersal. This is because dispersal has been mainly studied under reductionist laboratory conditions and via localized release-recapture experiments. Direct interceptions of propagules at sea have hardly been attempted because of the high labor intensity. Here, we set up a local citizen-science network and engaged local fishermen to collect floating mangrove propagules over a period of 27 months. By comparing the dispersing community of propagules from the local stands in which they were produced, the open water of the bay, and the open ocean beyond the coral reef barrier, we could study the transition between local and long-distance dispersal. The composition of the dispersing community changed from the local stands toward the ocean, suggesting that this transition imposes an important selective filter for leaving the local system. With the exception of three rare species (Lumnitzera racemosa, Pemphis acidula, and Xylocarpus moluccensis), we intercepted dispersing propagules of every mangrove species occurring in the East African region. Most intercepted propagules were produced by Rhizophora mucronata and Ceriops tagal, followed by Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Avicennia marina, which also represent the most abundant species in the nearby mangrove forest. A larger number of propagules were intercepted during the wet season, with fewer propagules recovered during the dry season. Overall, our study indicates that differences in the dispersal capacity of mangrove propagules are not straightforward and that some species may better disperse at local scales within an estuary or embayment, while others might be more suitable for dispersal over longer distances. The presence of such trade-offs may help explain why current attempts to use mangrove traits to predict mangrove species distributions at different scales have remained only moderately successful.

The unilateral rupture scenario earthquakes are hypothetically located at 6 locations spread out uniformly along the southern section of the fault, each associated with two hypocenters and rupture directions. Probabilities of occurrence over the next 30 years are assigned to each of these earthquakes by mapping the probabilities of 10,445 plausible earthquakes postulated for this section of the fault by the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast. Three-component broadband ground motion histories are computed at 636 sites in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area by superposing short-period ( 0.2-2.0 s) empirical Green's function synthetics on top of long-period (>2.0 s) spectral element synthetics. The earthquake probabilities and the computed ground motions are combined to develop probabilistic estimates of ground shaking in the region from San Andreas fault earthquakes over the next 30 years. The results could be useful in city planning, emergency management, and building code enhancement.

Fabrication of (111)-faced single-crystal diamond plates by laser nucleated cleaving	DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS			English	Article						Single-crystal diamond; Cleaving; (111) orientation; Surface roughness	CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; RAMAN LASER; PHOSPHORUS; SEMICONDUCTORS; NANOPHOTONICS; PHOTONICS; SURFACE; SPINS; WAFER; NM	Single-crystal diamond plates with surfaces oriented in a (111) crystal plane are required for high-performance solid-state device platforms ranging from power electronics to quantum information processing architectures. However, producing plates with this orientation has proven challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for reliably and precisely fabricating (111)-faced plates from commercially available, chemical-vapor-deposition-grown, type-IIa single-crystal diamond substrates with (100) faces. Our method uses a nanosecond-pulsed visible laser to nucleate and propagate a mechanical cleave in a chosen (111) crystal plane, resulting in faces as large as 3.0mm x 0.3mm with atomically flat surfaces, negligible miscut angles, and near zero kerf loss. We discuss the underlying physical mechanisms of the process along with potential improvements that will enable the production of millimeter-scale (111)-faced single-crystal diamond plates for a variety of emerging devices and applications.

Effect of Mars Atmospheric Loss on Snow Melt Potential in a 3.5 Gyr Mars Climate Evolution Model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; atmospheric loss	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; EARLY MARTIAN CLIMATE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; HIGH OBLIQUITY; LIQUID WATER; ALLUVIAL FANS; ION ESCAPE; CRATER; ICE; PRECIPITATION	Post-Noachian Martian paleochannels indicate the existence of liquid water on the surface of Mars after about 3.5 Gya (Irwin et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.10.012; Palucis et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004905). In order to explore the effects of variations in CO2 partial pressure and obliquity on the possibility of surface water, we created a zero-dimensional surface energy balance model. We combine this model with physically consistent orbital histories to track conditions over the last 3.5 Gyr of Martian history. We find that melting is allowed for atmospheric pressures corresponding to exponential loss rates of dP/dt. alpha t(-3.73) or faster, but this rate is within 0.5 sigma of the rate calculated from initial measurements made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, if we assume all the escaping oxygen measured by MAVEN comes from atmospheric CO2 (Lillis et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JA023525; Tu et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526146). Melting at this loss rate matches selected key geologic constraints on the formation of Hesperian river networks, assuming optimal melt conditions during the warmest part of each Mars year (Irwin et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.10.012; Kite, Gao, et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo3033; Kite, Sneed et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL072660; Stopar et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2006.07.039). The atmospheric pressure has a larger effect on the surface energy than changes in Mars's mean obliquity. These results show that initial measurements of atmosphere loss by MAVEN are consistent with atmospheric loss being the dominant process that switched Mars from a melt-permitting to a melt-absent climate (Jakosky et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aai7721), but non-CO2 warming will be required if <2 Gya paleochannels are confirmed or if most of the escaping oxygen measured by MAVEN comes from H2O.

An introductory study using impedance spectroscopy technique with polarizable microelectrode for amino acids characterization	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE; FUEL-CELL; BIOSENSOR; ELECTRICITY; GENERATION; LIFE; ELECTROPHORESIS; RECOGNITION; TRANSPORT; ELECTRODE	Portable, low power, yet ultra-sensitive life detection instrumentations are vital to future astrobiology flight programs at NASA. In this study, initial attempts to characterize amino acids in an aqueous environment by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using polarizable (blocking) electrodes in order to establish a means of detection via their electrical properties. Seven amino acids were chosen due to their scientific importance in demonstrating sensitivity levels in the range of part per billion concentration. Albeit more challenging in real systems of analyst mixtures, we found individual amino acids in aqueous environment do exhibit some degree of chemical and physical uniqueness to warrant characterization by EIS. The polar amino acids (Asp, Glu, and His) exhibited higher electrochemical activity than the non-polar amino acids (Ala, Gly, Val, and Leu). The non-polar amino acids (Gly and Ala) also exhibited unique electrical properties which appeared to be more dependent on physical characteristics such as molecular weight and structure. At concentrations above 1 mM where the amino acids play a more dominant transport role within the water, the conductivity was found to be more sensitive to concentrations. At lower concentrations < 1 mM, however, the polar amino acid solution conductivity remained constant, suggesting poor chemical activity with water. As revealed by equivalent circuit modeling, the relaxation times showed a 1-2 order of magnitude difference between polar and non-polar amino acids. The pseudo-capacitance from EIS measurements on sample mixtures containing salt water and individual amino acids revealed the possibility for improvement in amino acid selectivity using gold nanoporous surface enhanced electrodes. This work establishes important methodologies for characterizing amino acids using EIS combined with microscale electrodes, supporting the case for instrumentation development for life detection and origin of life programs.

J	Li, C; Ingersoll, AP; Oyafuso, F				Li, Cheng; Ingersoll, Andrew P.; Oyafuso, Fabiano			Moist Adiabats with Multiple Condensing Species: A New Theory with Application to Giant-Planet Atmospheres	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article							SATURNS THERMAL EMISSION; 5-MICRON HOT-SPOTS; JUPITERS ATMOSPHERE; 2.2-CM WAVELENGTH; JOVIAN PLANETS; PARA-HYDROGEN; AMMONIA; SIMULATIONS; SPACECRAFT; CONVECTION	A new formula is derived for calculating the moist adiabatic temperature profile of an atmosphere consisting of ideal gases with multiple condensing species. This expression unifies various formulas published in the literature and can be generalized to account for chemical reactions. Unlike previous methods, it converges to machine precision independent of mesh size. It accounts for any ratio of condensable vapors to dry gas, from zero to infinity, and for variable heat capacities as a function of temperature. Because the derivation is generic, the new formula is not only applicable to planetary atmospheres in the solar system but also to hot Jupiters and brown dwarfs in which a variety of alkali metals, silicates, and exotic materials condense. It is demonstrated that even though the vapors are ideal gases, they interact in their effects on the moist adiabatic lapse rate. Finally, the authors apply the new thermodynamic model to study the effects of downdrafts on the distribution of minor constituents and the thermal profile in the Galileo probe hot spot. The authors find that the Galileo probe measurements can be interpreted as a strong downdraft that displaces an air parcel from the 1-bar to the 4-bar level (1 bar = 100 000 Pa).

In this study, density thresholds are used to partition the retrieved ice particle size distribution (PSD) into small, median, and large particle size modes from millimeter cloud radar (MMCR) observations in the tropics and global CloudSat and CALIPSO ice cloud property product (2C-ICE) observations. It shows that the small mode can contribute to more than 60% of the total ice water content (IWC) above 12 km (colder than 220 K). Below that, dominant small mode transitions to dominant median mode. The large mode contributes to less than 10%-20% at all height levels. The PSD assumption in retrieval may cause about 10% error in the IWC partition ratio. The lidar-only region in 2C-ICE is dominated by the small mode, while the median mode dominates the radar-only region. For the three-species ice-phase bulk microphysics parameterization, the cloud ice mass mainly consists of the small mode. But snow and graupel in the models are not equivalent to the median and large modes in the observations, respectively. Therefore, they need to be repartitioned with rebuilt PSDs from the model assumptions using the same partition technique as the observations. The repartitioned IWCs in each mode from different ice species need to be added together and then compared with the corresponding mode from observations.

These globally distributed habitats need frequent and broad systematic assessments, but field surveys only cover a small fraction of these areas. Satellite-based sensors can repeatedly record the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra that contain the absorption, scattering, and fluorescence signatures of functional phytoplankton groups, colored dissolved matter, and particulate matter near the surface ocean, and of biologically structured habitats (floating and emergent vegetation, benthic habitats like coral, seagrass, and algae). These measures can be incorporated into Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), including the distribution, abundance, and traits of groups of species populations, and used to evaluate habitat fragmentation. However, current and planned satellites are not designed to observe the EBVs that change rapidly with extreme tides, salinity, temperatures, storms, pollution, or physical habitat destruction over scales relevant to human activity. Making these observations requires a new generation of satellite sensors able to sample with these combined characteristics: (1) spatial resolution on the order of 30 to 100-m pixels or smaller; (2) spectral resolution on the order of 5nm in the visible and 10nm in the short-wave infrared spectrum (or at least two or more bands at 1,030, 1,240, 1,630, 2,125, and/or 2,260nm) for atmospheric correction and aquatic and vegetation assessments; (3) radiometric quality with signal to noise ratios (SNR) above 800 (relative to signal levels typical of the open ocean), 14-bit digitization, absolute radiometric calibration <2%, relative calibration of 0.2%, polarization sensitivity <1%, high radiometric stability and linearity, and operations designed to minimize sunglint; and (4) temporal resolution of hours to days. We refer to these combined specifications as H4 imaging. Enabling H4 imaging is vital for the conservation and management of global biodiversity and ecosystem services, including food provisioning and water security. An agile satellite in a 3-d repeat low-Earth orbit could sample 30-km swath images of several hundred coastal habitats daily. Nine H4 satellites would provide weekly coverage of global coastal zones. Such satellite constellations are now feasible and are used in various applications.

The distribution of precipitation rates retrieved using two new datasets, the Global Precipitation Measurement radar-microwave radiometer combined product (GPM-CMB) and the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM product (IMERG), is compared with CloudSat, and the differences are discussed. For reference, the composites of AMSR-E, GPCP, and two reanalyses are also examined. Cyclone-centered precipitation rates are found to be the largest with the IMERG and CloudSat datasets and lowest with GPM-CMB. A series of tests is conducted to determine the roles of swath width, swath location, sampling frequency, season, and epoch. In all cases, these effects are less than similar to 0.14 mm h(-1) at 50-km resolution. Larger differences in the composites are related to retrieval biases, such as ground-clutter contamination in GPM-CMB and radar saturation in CloudSat. Overall the IMERG product reports precipitation more often, with larger precipitation rates at the center of the cyclones, in conditions of high precipitable water (PW). The CloudSat product tends to report more precipitation in conditions of dry or moderate PW. The GPM-CMB product tends to systematically report lower precipitation rates than the other two datasets. This intercomparison provides 1) modelers with an observational uncertainty and range (0.21-0.36 mm h(-1) near the cyclone centers) when using composites of precipitation for model evaluation and 2) retrieval-algorithm developers with a categorical analysis of the sensitivity of the products to PW.

A model of Saturn inferred from its measured gravitational field	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitation; planets and satellites: individual (Saturn); planets and satellites: interiors	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; GIANT PLANETS; ZONAL WINDS; INTERIORS; ROTATION; EQUATION; JUPITER	We present an interior model of Saturn with an ice-rock core, a metallic region, an outer molecular envelope and a thin transition layer between the metallic and molecular regions. The shape of Saturn's 1 bar surface is irregular and determined fully self-consistently by the required equilibrium condition. While the ice-rock core is assumed to have a uniform density, three different equations of state are adopted for the metallic, molecular and transition regions. The Saturnian model is constrained by its known mass, its known equatorial and polar radii, and its known zonal gravitational coefficients, J(2n), n = 1, 2, 3. The model produces an ice-rock core with equatorial radius 0.203 R-S, where R-S is the equatorial radius of Saturn at the 1-bar pressure surface; the core density rho(c) = 10388.1 kg m(-3) corresponding to 13.06 Earth masses; and an analytical expression describing the Saturnian irregular shape of the 1-bar pressure level. The model also predicts the values of the higher-order gravitational coefficients, J(8), J(10) and J(12), for the hydrostatic Saturn and suggests that Saturn's convective dynamo operates in the metallic region approximately defined by 0.2 R-S < r(e) < 0.7 R-S, where r(e) denotes the equatorial radial distance from the Saturnian center of figure.

The effect of the equatorially symmetric zonal winds of Saturn on its gravitational field	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitation; planets and satellites: individual (Saturn); planets and satellites: interiors	CONVECTION; JUPITER; SIGNATURE; PLANETS; MODEL	The penetration depth of Saturn's cloud-level winds into its interior is unknown. A possible way of estimating the depth is through measurement of the effect of the winds on the planet's gravitational field. We use a self-consistent perturbation approach to study how the equatorially symmetric zonal winds of Saturn contribute to its gravitational field. An important advantage of this approach is that the variation of its gravitational field solely caused by the winds can be isolated and identified because the leading-order problem accounts exactly for rotational distortion, thereby determining the irregular shape and internal structure of the hydrostatic Saturn. We assume that (i) the zonal winds are maintained by thermal convection in the form of non-axisymmetric columnar rolls and (ii) the internal structure of the winds, because of the Taylor-Proundman theorem, can be uniquely determined by the observed cloud-level winds. We calculate both the variation Delta J(n), n = 2, 4, 6 ... of the axisymmetric gravitational coefficients J(n) caused by the zonal winds and the non-axisymmetric gravitational coefficients Delta J(nm) produced by the columnar rolls, where m is the azimuthal wavenumber of the rolls. We consider three different cases characterized by the penetration depth 0.36 R-S, 0.2 R-S and 0.1 R-S, where R-S is the equatorial radius of Saturn at the 1-bar pressure level. We find that the high-degree gravitational coefficient (J(12) + Delta J(12)) is dominated, in all the three cases, by the effect of the zonal flow with vertical bar Delta J(12)/J(12)vertical bar > 100% and that the size of the non-axisymmetric coefficients Delta J(mn) directly reflects the depth and scale of the flow taking place in the Saturnian interior.

Measuring impact crater depth throughout the solar system	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Issues in Crater Studies and the Dating of Planetary Surfaces	MAY, 2015	Baltimore, MD				ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER; SMALL-SCALE FEATURES; DEEP IMPACT; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; GEOMETRIC MODEL; RADAR ALTIMETRY; SINUS SABAEUS; CENTRAL PEAK; CENTRAL PIT; LUNAR	One important, almost ubiquitous, tool for understanding the surfaces of solid bodies throughout the solar system is the study of impact craters. While measuring a distribution of crater diameters and locations is an important tool for a wide variety of studies, so too is measuring a crater's "depth." Depth can inform numerous studies including the strength of a surface and modification rates in the local environment. There is, however, no standard data set, definition, or technique to perform this data-gathering task, and the abundance of different definitions of "depth" and methods for estimating that quantity can lead to misunderstandings in and of the literature. In this review, we describe a wide variety of data sets and methods to analyze those data sets that have been, are currently, or could be used to derive different types of crater depth measurements. We also recommend certain nomenclature in doing so to help standardize practice in the field. We present a review section of all crater depths that have been published on different solar system bodies which shows how the field has evolved through time and how some common assumptions might not be wholly accurate. We conclude with several recommendations for researchers which could help different data sets to be more easily understood and compared.

Magnetic field strength of a neutron-star-powered ultraluminous X-ray source	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							CYCLOTRON LINE; PULSAR; DISCOVERY; FEATURES; SPECTRA	Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are bright X-ray sources in nearby galaxies not associated with the central supermassive black hole. Their luminosities imply they are powered by either an extreme accretion rate onto a compact stellar remnant, or an intermediate mass (similar to 100-10(5) M-circle dot) black hole(1). Recently detected coherent pulsations coming from three bright ULXs(2-5) demonstrate that some of these sources are powered by accretion onto a neutron star, implying accretion rates significantly in excess of the Eddington limit, a high degree of geometric beaming, or both. The physical challenges associated with the high implied accretion rates can be mitigated if the neutron star surface field is very high (10(14)G)(6), since this suppresses the electron scattering cross-section, reducing the radiation pressure that chokes off accretion for high luminosities. Surface magnetic field strengths can be determined through cyclotron resonance scattering features(7,8) produced by the transition of charged particles between quantized Landau levels. Here, we present the detection at a significance of 3.8 sigma of an absorption line at 4.5 keV in the Chandra spectrum of a ULX in M51. This feature is likely to be a cyclotron resonance scattering feature produced by the strong magnetic field of a neutron star. Assuming scattering off electrons, the magnetic field strength is implied to be similar to 10(11) G, while protons would imply a magnetic field of B similar to 10(15) G.	[Brightman, M.; Harrison, F.

To evaluate GCM simulations of the MJO, the U.S. CLIVAR MJO Working Group developed a standardized set of diagnostics, providing a comprehensive assessment of statistical properties of the MJO. Here, a suite of complementary diagnostics has been developed that provides discrimination and assessment of MJO simulations based on the perception that the MJO propagation has characteristic dynamic and thermodynamic structures. The new dynamics-oriented diagnostics help to evaluate whether a model produces eastward-propagating MJOs for the right reasons. The diagnostics include 1) the horizontal structure of boundary layer moisture convergence (BLMC) that moistens the lower troposphere to the east of a convection center, 2) the preluding eastward propagation of BLMC that leads the propagation of MJO precipitation by about 5 days, 3) the horizontal structure of 850-hPa zonal wind and its equatorial asymmetry (Kelvin easterly versus Rossby westerly intensity), 4) the equatorial vertical-longitudinal structure of the equivalent potential temperature and convective instability index that reflects the premoistening and predestabilization processes, 5) the equatorial vertical-longitudinal distribution of diabatic heating that reflects the multicloud structure of the MJO, 6) the upper-level divergence that reflects the influence of stratiform cloud heating, and 7) the MJO available potential energy generation that reflects the amplification and propagation of an MJO. The models that simulate better three-dimensional dynamic and thermodynamic structures of MJOs generally reproduce better eastward propagations.

Most of them were part of surveys looking for substellar companions or resolved circumstellar disks to young nearby stars, making the NICMOS coronagraphic archive a valuable database for exoplanets and disks studies. As part of the Archival Legacy Investigations of Circumstellar Environments program, we have consistently reprocessed a large fraction of the NICMOS coronagrahic archive using advanced starlight subtraction methods. We present here the high-level science products of these re-analyzed data, which we delivered back to the community through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes: doi: 10.17909/T9W89V. We also present the second version of the HCI-FITS format (for High-Contrast Imaging FITS format), which we developed as a standard format for data exchange of imaging reduced science products. These re-analyzed products are openly available for population statistics studies, characterization of specific targets, or detected point-source identification.	[Hagan, J.

Massive celestial neighbors can facilitate the formation of planetary cores and modify the influx of asteroids and comets toward Earth analogs later on. Furthermore, giant planets can indirectly change the climate of terrestrial worlds by gravitationally altering their orbits. Investigating 147 well-characterized exoplanetary systems known to date that host a main-sequence star and a giant planet, we show that the presence of "giant neighbors" can reduce a terrestrial planet's chances to remain habitable, even if both planets have stable orbits. In a small fraction of systems, however, giant planets slightly increase the extent of habitable zones provided that the terrestrial world has a high climate inertia. In providing constraints on where giant planets cease to affect the habitable zone size in a detrimental fashion, we identify prime targets in the search for habitable worlds.

A Foreground Masking Strategy for [C II] Intensity Mapping Experiments Using Galaxies Selected by Stellar Mass and Redshift	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: observations; dark ages, reionization, first stars; diffuse radiation; intergalactic medium; large-scale structure of universe	ALMA SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; STAR-FORMATION; EAGLE SIMULATIONS; COSMIC EVOLUTION; MOLECULAR GAS; LEGACY SURVEY; MU-M; FIELD; SUBMILLIMETER; LUMINOSITY	Intensity mapping provides a unique means to probe the epoch of reionization (EoR), when the neutral intergalactic medium was ionized by energetic photons emitted from the first galaxies. The [C II] 158 mu m fine-structure line is typically one of the brightest emission lines of star-forming galaxies and thus a promising tracer of the global EoR star formation activity. However, [C II] intensity maps at 6 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 8 are contaminated by interloping CO rotational line emission (3 <= J(upp) <= 6) from lower-redshift galaxies. Here we present a strategy to remove the foreground contamination in upcoming [C II] intensity mapping experiments, guided by a model of CO emission from foreground galaxies. The model is based on empirical measurements of the mean and scatter of the total infrared luminosities of galaxies at z < 3 and with stellar massesM(*) > 10(8) M-circle dot selected in the K-band from the COSMOS/UltraVISTA survey, which can be converted to CO line strengths. For a mock field of the Tomographic Ionizedcarbon Mapping Experiment, we find that masking out the "voxels" (spectral-spatial elements) containing foreground galaxies identified using an optimized CO flux threshold results in a z-dependent criterion m(K)(AB) less than or similar to 22 (or M-* greater than or similar to 10(9) M-circle dot) at z < 1 and makes a [C II]/COtot power ratio of greater than or similar to 10 at k = 0.1 h/Mpc achievable, at the cost of a moderate less than or similar to 8% loss of total survey volume.

Evidence for Pulsar-like Emission Components in the Broadband ULX Sample	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars: neutron; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual (NGC 5907 ULX)	X-RAY SOURCE; MASS BLACK-HOLE; SUPER-EDDINGTON ACCRETION; NGC 7793 P13; NEUTRON-STAR; SOLAR MASSES; XMM-NEWTON; GALAXIES; DISTANCE; MODEL	We present broadband X-ray analyses of a sample of bright ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) with the goal of investigating the spectral similarity of this population to the known ULX pulsars, M82 X-2, NGC 7793 P13,. and NGC 5907 ULX. We perform a phase-resolved analysis of the broadband XMM-Newton vertical bar NuSTAR data set of NGC 5907 ULX, finding that the pulsed emission from the accretion column in this source exhibits a similar spectral shape to that seen in both M82 X-2. and NGC 7793 P13, and that this is responsible for the excess emission observed at the highest energies when the spectra are fit with accretion disk models. We then demonstrate that similar "hard" excesses are seen in all ULXs in the broadband sample. Finally, for ULXs where the nature of the accretor is currently unknown, we test whether the hard excesses are all consistent with being produced by an accretion column similar to those present in M82 X-2, NGC 7793 P13, and NGC 5907 ULX. Based on the average shape of the pulsed emission, we find that in all cases a similar accretion column can successfully reproduce the observed data, consistent with the hypothesis that this ULX sample may be dominated by neutron star accretors. Compared to the known pulsar ULXs, our spectral fits for the remaining ULXs suggest that the non-pulsed emission from the accretion flow beyond the magnetosphere makes a stronger relative contribution than the component associated with the accretion column. If these sources do also contain neutron star accretors, this may help to explain the lack of detected pulsations.	[Walton, D. J.; Fabian, A.

On interannual timescales, the summer mean subtropical MBL clouds to the southeast of the NASH is actively coupled with the NASH and local SSTs: a stronger (weaker) NASH is often accompanied with an increase (a decrease) of MBL clouds and abnormally cooler (warmer) SSTs along the southeast flank of the NASH. To understand the physical processes between the NASH and the MBL clouds, the authors conduct a data diagnostic analysis and implement a numerical modeling investigation using an idealized anomalous atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). Results suggest that significant northeasterly anomalies in the southeast flank of the NASH associated with an intensified NASH tend to induce stronger cold advection and coastal upwelling in the MBL cloud region, reducing the boundary surface temperature. Meanwhile, warm advection associated with the easterly anomalies from the African continent leads to warming over the MBL cloud region at 700 hPa. Such warming and the surface cooling increase the atmospheric static stability, favoring growth of the MBL clouds. The anomalous diabatic cooling associated with the growth of the MBL clouds dynamically excites an anomalous anticyclone to its north and contributes to strengthening of the NASH circulation in its southeast flank. The dynamical and thermodynamical couplings and their associated variations in the NASH, MBL clouds, and SSTs constitute an important aspect of the summer climate variability over the North Atlantic.

Laboratory simulations of a possible thermal and irradiation history of these bodies were conducted on ice mixtures while monitoring their spectral properties. These simulations tested the hypothesis that the presence or absence of sulfur explains the two distinct visible near-infrared spectral groups observed in each population and that Trojans and KBOs share a common formation location. Mixed ices consisting of water, methanol, and ammonia, in mixtures both with and without hydrogen sulfide, were deposited and irradiated with 10 keV electrons. Deposition and initial irradiation were performed at 50 K to simulate formation at 20 au in the early solar system, then heated to Trojan-like temperatures and irradiated further. Finally, irradiation was concluded and resulting samples were observed during heating to room temperature. Results indicated that the presence of sulfur resulted in steeper spectral slopes. Heating through the 140-200 K range decreased the slopes and total reflectance for both mixtures. In addition, absorption features at 410, 620, and 900 nm appeared under irradiation, but only in the H2S-containing mixture. These features were lost with heating once irradiation was concluded. While the results reported here are consistent with the hypothesis, additional work is needed to address uncertainties and to simulate conditions not included in the present work.

In particular, a generic physical InSAR scattering model is derived by accounting for the forest disturbance information as well as the normal temporal decorrelation effects that are later compensated for using the modified Random Volume over Ground model. Based on the generic model, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is retrieved, namely, disturbance index that varies from 0 (no disturbance) to 1 (complete deforestation). This index is compared with that identified using a time series of Landsat sensor data over a selective logging area and has a relative root mean square error of 13% at a spatial resolution of 0.8 ha. This paper highlights the use of the co-pol InSAR correlation magnitude for forest disturbance detection, which serves as a complimentary application to using the cross-pol counterpart for forest height inversion in a companion work. Given the global availability of this type of data (e.g., Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's ALOS-1/2 and NASA-ISRO's NISAR), the method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring.

Incorporating HTCs from previous studies and multiple comet visits, we have a total of 21 stacked visits, 13 of which are active and 8 for which we calculated upper limits of production. We determined the nucleus sizes of 27P, P/2006 HR30, P/2012 NJ, and C/2016 S1. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationships between dust production and heliocentric distance, and gas production and heliocentric distance. We concluded that for this population of HTCs, ranging in heliocentric distance from 1.21 to 2.66 au, there was no significant correlation between dust production and heliocentric distance, nor between gas production and heliocentric distance.

In this work, we explore to which extent the CFIRB anisotropies can be reproduced by a simple physical framework for galaxy evolution, the gas regulator (bathtub) model. This model is based on continuity equations for gas, stars, and metals, taking into account cosmic gas accretion, star formation, and gas ejection. We model the large-scale galaxy bias and small-scale shot noise self-consistently, and we constrain our model using the CFIRB power spectra measured by Planck. Because of the simplicity of the physical model, the goodness of fit is limited. We compare our model predictions with the observed correlation between CFIRB and gravitational lensing, bolometric infrared luminosity functions, and submillimetre source counts. The strong clustering of CFIRB indicates a large galaxy bias, which corresponds to haloes of mass 10(12.5) M-circle dot at z = 2, higher than the mass associated with the peak of the star formation efficiency. We also find that the far-infrared luminosities of haloes above 10(12) M-circle dot are higher than the expectation from the SFR observed in ultraviolet and optical surveys.

The weak [C II] emission is consistent in velocity and line width with the strongest H I component produced by the cold neutral medium. The H I column density and kinetic temperature are known from the 21 cm data and, assuming a fractional abundance of ionized carbon, we calculate the volume density and thermal pressure of each source, which vary considerably, with 27 cm(-3) <= n(H-0) <= 210 cm(-3) considering only the atomic hydrogen along the lines of sight to be responsible for the C+, while 13 cm(-3) <= n(H-0 + H-2) <= 190 cm(-3) including the hydrogen in both forms. The thermal pressure varies widely with 1970 cm(-3) K <= P-th/k <= 10,440 cm(-3) K for H-0 alone and 750 cm(-3) K <= P-th/k <= 9360 cm(-3) K including both H-0 and H-2. The molecular hydrogen fraction varies between 0.10 and 0.67. Photoelectric heating is the dominant heating source, supplemented by a moderately enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate, constrained by the relatively low 45 K to 73 K gas temperatures of the clouds. The resulting thermal balance for the two lower-density clouds is satisfactory, but for the two higher-density clouds, the combined heating rate is insufficient to balance the observed C+ cooling.

We detect 14.0(-3.7)(+4.8) counts from the quasar in the observed-frame energy range 0.5-7.0 keV (6 sigma detection), representing the most distant non-transient astronomical source identified in X-rays to date. The present data are sufficient only to infer rough constraints on the spectral parameters. We find an X-ray hardness ratio of HR = -0.51(-0.28)(+0.26) between the 0.5-2.0 keV and 2.0-7.0 keV ranges and derive a power-law photon index of Gamma= 1.95(-0.53)(+0.55). Assuming a typical value for high-redshift quasars of Gamma = 1.9, ULAS J1342+0928 has a 2-10 keV rest-frame X-ray luminosity of L2-10 = 11.6(-3.5)(+4.3) x 10(44) erg s(-1). Its X-ray-to-optical power-law slope is alpha(OX) = -1.67(-0.10)(+0.16), consistent with the general trend indicating that the X-ray emission in the most bolometrically powerful quasars is weaker relative to their optical emission.

J	Park, J; Choi, YS				Park, Jungmin; Choi, Yong-Sang			Influence of inhomogeneous surface heat capacity on the estimation of radiative response coefficients in a two-zone energy balance model	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSIENT CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; FEEDBACK PROCESSES; CIRCULATION	Observationally constrained values of the global radiative response coefficient are pivotal to assess the reliability of modeled climate feedbacks. A widely used approach is to measure transient global radiative imbalance related to surface temperature changes. However, in this approach, a potential error in the estimate of radiative response coefficients may arise from surface inhomogeneity in the climate system. We examined this issue theoretically using a simple two-zone energy balance model. Here, we dealt with the potential error by subtracting the prescribed radiative response coefficient from those calculated within the two-zone framework. Each zone was characterized by the different magnitude of the radiative response coefficient and the surface heat capacity, and the dynamical heat transport in the atmosphere between the zones was parameterized as a linear function of the temperature difference between the zones. Then, the model system was forced by randomly generated monthly varying forcing mimicking time-varying forcing like an observation. The repeated simulations showed that inhomogeneous surface heat capacity causes considerable miscalculation (down to -1.4 W m(-2) K-1 equivalent to 31.3% of the prescribed value) in the global radiative response coefficient. Also, the dynamical heat transport reduced this miscalculation driven by inhomogeneity of surface heat capacity. Therefore, the estimation of radiative response coefficients using the surface temperature-radiation relation is appropriate for homogeneous surface areas least affected by the exterior.

Validation and Initial Characterization of the Long-period Planet Kepler-1654 b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: detection	TRANSITING EXOPLANETS; SIZED EXOPLANET; ATMOSPHERE; TELESCOPE; I.	Fewer than 20 transiting Kepler planets have periods longer than one year. Our early search of the Kepler light curves revealed one such system, Kepler-1654b (originally KIC 8410697b), which shows exactly two transit events and whose second transit occurred only five days before the failure of the second of two reaction wheels brought the primary Kepler mission to an end. A number of authors have also examined light curves from the Kepler mission searching for long-period planets and identified this candidate. Starting in 2014 September, we began an observational program of imaging, reconnaissance spectroscopy, and precision radial velocity (RV) measurements that confirm with a high degree of confidence that Kepler-1654b is a bona fide transiting planet orbiting a mature G5V star (T-eff = 5580 K, [ Fe/H] = -0.08) with a semimajor axis of 2.03 au, a period of 1047.84 days, and a radius of 0.82. +/-. 0.02 R-Jup. RV measurements using Keck's HIRES spectrometer obtained over 2.5 years set a limit to the planet's mass of <0.5 (3 sigma) M-Jup. The bulk density of the planet is similar to that of Saturn or possibly lower. We assess the suitability of temperate gas giants like Kepler-1654b for transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope, as their relatively cold equilibrium temperatures (T-pl similar to 200 K) make them interesting from the standpoint of exoplanet atmospheric physics. Unfortunately, these low temperatures also make the atmospheric scale heights small and thus transmission spectroscopy challenging. Finally, the long time between transits can make scheduling JWST observations difficult-as is the case with Kepler-1654b.	[Beichman, C.

In early 2004, NASA-JPL successfully landed two Rovers on Mars (i.e., Spirit and Opportunity), one of which is still operational and has completed over 4900 sols of operation (or over 13 years of operation). In August 2012, NASA-JPL's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity Rover landed on Mars, and has currently completed over 1500 Sols of operation and has driven > 14.5 km. The Li-ion battery chemistry developed for these missions, and established as the "heritage", consists of meso-carbon microbeads (MCMB) anodes, LiNixCo1-xO2 (NCO) cathodes, and a low temperature ternary carbonate-based electrolyte developed at JPL. For future missions requiring high specific energy and the ability to operate over a wider temperature range, such as the Mars InSight mission, the next generation chemistry, consisting of graphite anodes, LiNiCoAlO2 (NCA) cathodes and a new low temperature electrolyte, is more attractive and has been demonstrated to provide improved performance, especially at very low temperatures. In order to demonstrate the capability of these technologies to meet mission requirements, as well as generate necessary data to aid in mission planning, a number of performance verification tests were performed on large capacity "proto-flight" prismatic EaglePicher-Yardney Division Li-ion cells, including Mars mission surface operation simulation testing. As described, these cells have been demonstrated to have excellent life characteristics and the ability to operate over a wide temperature range, with both charging and discharging at very low temperatures.

Petal rotation trajectories alternate long- and short-period nonresonant transfers between one or more gravity assist bodies to rotate the line of apsides relative to the central body. These petal rotation trajectories are typically computed using the patched-conic model, and they have been used in a number of different missions and mission concepts, including Cassini, JUICE, and planned Europa missions. Petal rotation trajectories are first analyzed here using the patched-conic model to quantify their characteristics and search for cases with fast rotation of the line of apsides. When petal rotation trajectories are computed in the CRTBP, they are unstable periodic orbits with corresponding stable and unstable manifolds. The characteristics of these orbits are explored from a dynamical systems perspective in the second phase of the study, and differences with patched-conic results are analyzed.

Stratigraphy, sedimentology and paleontology of Upper Cretaceous deposits of Day Nunatak, Snow Hill Island, Antarctica	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH			English	Article						Day Nunatak; Snow Hill Island; James Ross; Antarctica; Paleontology; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy	JAMES-ROSS-BASIN; SEYMOUR ISLAND; MARAMBIO GROUP; AMMONITES; EXTINCTION; EVOLUTION; PENINSULA; PATTERNS; SECTION; RECORD	Day Nunatak exposes an actively emergent stratigraphic section located on Snow Hill Island to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula. Strata exposed on Snow Hill Island were deposited in the James Ross Basin, which includes marine units of Cretaceous Paleogene (K-Pg) age. Here we provide the first report of the sedirnentology and paleontology of Day Nunatak, and place it into the broader stratigraphic context of the basin. Day Nunatak was previously unexplored due to difficulties accessing the site, and the historically poor exposure which has recently improved due to warming of the Antarctic Peninsula. Deposits exposed at Day Nunatak are assigned to the Karisen Cliffs Member (KCM) of the Snow Hill Island Formation, and are better preserved than deposits at the type section of the KCM at Karlsen Cliffs, which has been altered by cross-cutting basaltic dikes. Correlation of lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data from Day Nunatak with other outcrops in the basin allows the section to be placed within a previously developed stratigraphic framework, and assigned an early Maastrichtian age. Our observations, and previous descriptions of the KCM, are consistent with a middle- to inner-shelf depositional environment below storm-wave base. Ammonites of the genus Gunnarites are very common, with other ammonite genera and benthic mollusks an order of magnitude less common. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope values obtained from bivalve shells are similar to values previously reported from Seymour Island, and suggest seawater temperatures of similar to 7 degrees C . Measured bedding orientations suggest the presence of a structural offset between Day Nunatak and other sections exposed further north on Snow Hill Island. Day Nunatak preserves a similar depositional environment to deposits reported from the uppermost Maastrichtian on Seymour Island, and is the deeper-water equivalent of contemporaneous proximal sections reported from Vega Island.

However, these grippers still face challenges in grasping large objects and in achieving high-strength grasps. This work investigates the combination of fluidic elastomer actuators and gecko-inspired adhesives to both enhance existing soft gripper properties and generate new capabilities. On rocky or dirty surfaces where adhesion is limited, the gripper retains the functionality of a pneumatically actuated elastomer gripper with no measured loss in performance. Design strategies for using the unique properties of the gecko-inspired adhesives are presented. By modeling fluidic elastomer actuators as a series of joints with associated joint torques, we designed an actuator that takes advantage of the unique properties of the gecko-inspired adhesive. Experiments showed higher strength grasps at lower pressures compared to nongecko actuators, in many cases enabling the gripper to actuate more quickly and use less energy. The gripper weighs 48.7 g, uses $7.25 of raw materials, and can support loads of over 50 N. A second gripper, using three fingers for a larger adhesive surface, demonstrated a grasping force of 111 N (25 lbf) when actuated at an internal pressure of 40 kPa.

Predictive Perception With Applications to Planetary Exploration	IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS			English	Article						Motion and path planning; visual-based pavigation; space robotics and automation	UNCERTAINTY	Planetary rovers exploring the surface of Mars rely on vision-based localization and navigation algorithms to estimate their state and plan their motion during autonomous traverses. The accurate estimation of rover's motion enables safe navigation across environments with potentially hazardous terrain that would otherwise require careful human intervention. The accuracy of these vision-based localization and navigation methods are directly related to the amount of visual texture observed by the rover's sensors. This poses a challenge for Mars navigation, where texture-limited surfaces such as smooth sand is prevalent. To overcome this issue, we propose making use of a rover's ability to actively steer its visual sensors with the goal of maximizing actionable visual information content. This letter answers the question of where and when to look by presenting a method to predict the sensor trajectory that maximizes rover localization performance. This is accomplished through an online search of possible trajectories using synthetic, future camera views created from observed data. Proposed trajectories are quantified and chosen based on expected localization performance. We validate our algorithm in a high-fidelity simulation of a Mars-analogue environment and show how intelligently choosing where to look during a traverse can increase navigation accuracy compared to traditional fixed-sensor configurations.

Nearly a century after the ultraviolet (UV) contrasts of Venus' cloud layer were discovered with Earth-based photographs, the substances and mechanisms responsible for the changes in Venus' contrasts and albedo are still unknown. While current models include sulfur dioxide and iron chloride as the UV absorbers, the temporal and spatial changes in contrasts, and albedo, between 330 and 500nm, remain to be fully explained. Within this context, we present a discussion regarding the potential for microorganisms to survive in Venus' lower clouds and contribute to the observed bulk spectra. In this article, we provide an overview of relevant Venus observations, compare the spectral and physical properties of Venus' clouds to terrestrial biological materials, review the potential for an iron- and sulfur-centered metabolism in the clouds, discuss conceivable mechanisms of transport from the surface toward a more habitable zone in the clouds, and identify spectral and biological experiments that could measure the habitability of Venus' clouds and terrestrial analogues. Together, our lines of reasoning suggest that particles in Venus' lower clouds contain sufficient mass balance to harbor microorganisms, water, and solutes, and potentially sufficient biomass to be detected by optical methods. As such, the comparisons presented in this article warrant further investigations into the prospect of biosignatures in Venus' clouds.

This warming deepened the soil active layer and triggered large mass losses from the watershed's glaciers, resulting in a similar to 10 times increase in delivery of glacial melt-waters, sediment, organic carbon and legacy contaminants to Lake Hazen, a >70% decrease in lake water residence time, and near certainty of summer ice-free conditions. Concomitantly, the community assemblage of diatom primary producers in the lake shifted dramatically with declining ice cover, from shoreline benthic to open-water planktonic species, and the physiological condition of the only fish species in the lake, Arctic Char, declined significantly. Collectively, these changes place Lake Hazen in a biogeochemical, limnological and ecological regime unprecedented within the past similar to 300 years.

Discovery of a point-like source and a third spiral arm in the transition disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 758	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; planet-disk interactions; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: individual: MWC 758 (HD 36112)	DUST; PLANETS; MASS; GAS	Context. Transition disks offer the extraordinary opportunity to look for newly born planets and to investigate the early stages of planet formation. Aims. In this context we observed the Herbig A5 star MWC 758 with the L'-band vector vortex coronagraph installed in the near-infrared camera and spectrograph NIRC2 at the Keck II telescope, with the aim of unveiling the nature of the spiral structure by constraining the presence of planetary companions in the system. Methods. Our high-contrast imaging observations show a bright (Delta L' = 7.0 +/- 0.3 mag) point-like emission south of MWC 758 at a deprojected separation of similar to 20 au (r = 0 ''.111 +/- 0 ''.004) from the central star. We also recover the two spiral arms (southeast and northwest), already imaged by previous studies in polarized light, and discover a third arm to the southwest of the star. No additional companions were detected in the system down to 5 Jupiter masses beyond 0 ''.6 from the star. Results. We propose that the bright L'-band emission could be caused by the presence of an embedded and accreting protoplanet, although the possibility of it being an asymmetric disk feature cannot be excluded. The spiral structure is probably not related to the protoplanet candidate, unless on an inclined and eccentric orbit, and it could be due to one (or more) yet undetected planetary companions at the edge of or outside the spiral pattern. Future observations and additional simulations will be needed to shed light on the true nature of the point-like source and its link with the spiral arms.

Present-Day Mars' Seismicity Predicted From 3-D Thermal Evolution Models of Interior Dynamics	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; thermal evolution; seismicity; interior dynamics; InSight	SPACE GEODETIC STRAIN; THERMOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION; TECTONIC ACTIVITY; FOSSAE REGION; ALBA-PATERA; CONSISTENCY; EARTHQUAKES; HEMISPHERE; CENTERS; SURFACE	The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport mission, to be launched in 2018, will perform a comprehensive geophysical investigation of Mars in situ. The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure package aims to detect global and regional seismic events and in turn offer constraints on core size, crustal thickness, and core, mantle, and crustal composition. In this study, we estimate the present-day amount and distribution of seismicity using 3-D numerical thermal evolution models of Mars, taking into account contributions from convective stresses as well as from stresses associated with cooling and planetary contraction. Defining the seismogenic lithosphere by an isotherm and assuming two end-member cases of 573 K and the 1073 K, we determine the seismogenic lithosphere thickness. Assuming a seismic efficiency between 0.025 and 1, this thickness is used to estimate the total annual seismic moment budget, and our models show values between 5.7 x 10(16) and 3.9 x 10(19) Nm.

A New Model of Jupiter's Magnetic Field From Juno's First Nine Orbits	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter magnetosphere; Juno mission; magnetic field; dynamo generation; planetary magnetic field	GEOMAGNETIC-FIELD	A spherical harmonic model of the magnetic field of Jupiter is obtained from vector magnetic field observations acquired by the Juno spacecraft during its first nine polar orbits about the planet. Observations acquired during eight of these orbits provide the first truly global coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field with a coarse longitudinal separation of similar to 45 degrees between perijoves. The magnetic field is represented with a degree 20 spherical harmonic model for the planetary ("internal") field, combined with a simple model of the magnetodisc for the field ("external") due to distributed magnetospheric currents. Partial solution of the underdetermined inverse problem using generalized inverse techniques yields a model ('Juno Reference Model through Perijove 9") of the planetary magnetic field with spherical harmonic coefficients well determined through degree and order 10, providing the first detailed view of a planetary dynamo beyond Earth.

Vulnerability of Southeast Greenland Glaciers to Warm Atlantic Water From Operation IceBridge and Ocean Melting Greenland Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ICE-SHEET; AIRBORNE GRAVITY; WEST GREENLAND; OUTLET GLACIER; ELEVATION; FLUCTUATIONS; BATHYMETRY; ANTARCTICA; CLIMATE; COASTAL	We employ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Operation IceBridge high-resolution airborne gravity from 2016, NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland bathymetry from 2015, ice thickness from Operation IceBridge from 2010 to 2015, and BedMachine v3 to analyze 20 major southeast Greenland glaciers. The results reveal glacial fjords several hundreds of meters deeper than previously thought; the full extent of the marine-based portions of the glaciers; deep troughs enabling warm, salty Atlantic Water (AW) to reach the glacier fronts and melt them from below; and few shallow sills that limit the access of AW. The new oceanographic and topographic data help to fully resolve the complex pattern of historical ice front positions from the 1930s to 2017:glaciers exposed to AW and resting on retrograde beds have retreated rapidly, while glaciers perched on shallow sills or standing in colder waters or with major sills in the fjords have remained stable. Plain Language Summary Over the last century, the glaciers in southeast Greenland have exhibited different behaviors from one fjord to the next. This complex spatial pattern has been difficult to explain due to a dearth of information about fjord depths and ocean properties in the fjords. Here we use National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Operation Icebridge and Ocean Melting Greenland data to map the depth of fjords and glacier bed topography. We detect glacial valleys several hundreds of meters deeper than previously thought. We find that retreating glaciers stood in deep valleys exposed to warm Atlantic water, whereas stable glaciers are perched on sills away from warm water. These results improve our understanding of the evolution of the glaciers and their impact on mass balance of the ice sheet.

Monte Carlo simulation of III-nitride photocathodes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							BAND-STRUCTURE; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; WURTZITE GAN; STEADY-STATE; BULK GAN; SCATTERING; SEMICONDUCTORS; PERFORMANCE; DETECTORS; METALS	We report on the development and verification of a Monte Carlo simulator for III-nitride photocathode structures. Due to the complexity of the process, attributing experimental photoemission results to physical origins can be difficult. We discuss the distribution of emitted electrons, including physical contributions for the shape and implications for device design. Although the Monte Carlo technique has shown promise in GaAs photocathodes, uncertainty in III-nitride band parameters makes simulation difficult. Here, a range of satellite valley band parameters were studied in the context of photoemission and compared to experimental results. We find that contrary to most published studies for Monte Carlo of III-nitrides, a lower effective mass in the satellite valley gives a closer match to experimental results.

Vista-LA: Mapping methane-emitting infrastructure in the Los Angeles megacity	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA			English	Article							FUEL CO2 EMISSIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLARS-FTS; QUANTIFICATION; PERSPECTIVE; INVENTORY; TRENDS; FLUXES; REGION; SCALE	Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and a critical target of climate mitigation efforts. However, actionable emission reduction efforts are complicated by large uncertainties in the methane budget on relevant scales. Here, we present Vista, a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based approach to map potential methane emissions sources in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) that encompasses Los Angeles, an area with a dense, complex mixture of methane sources. The goal of this work is to provide a database that, together with atmospheric observations, improves methane emissions estimates in urban areas with complex infrastructure. We aggregated methane source location information into three sectors (energy, agriculture, and waste) following the frameworks used by the State of California GHG Inventory and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for GHG Reporting. Geospatial modeling was applied to publicly available datasets to precisely geolocate facilities and infrastructure comprising major anthropogenic methane source sectors. The final database, Vista-Los Angeles (Vista-LA), is presented as maps of infrastructure known or expected to emit CH4. Vista-LA contains over 33 000 features concentrated on < 1% of land area in the region. Currently, Vista-LA is used as a planning and analysis tool for atmospheric measurement surveys of methane sources, particularly for airborne remote sensing, and methane "hotspot" detection using regional observations. This study represents a first step towards developing an accurate, spatially resolved methane flux estimate for point sources in SoCAB, with the potential to address discrepancies between bottom-up and top-down methane emissions accounting in this region. The Vista-LA datasets and associated metadata are available from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center for Biogeochemical Dynamics (ORNL DAAC; https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1525).

However, optical properties of aerosols from individual wildfire smoke plumes and their resultant impact on regional climate are highly variable. Therefore, there is a critical need for observations that can constrain the partitioning between different types of aerosols. Here we present the apparent influence of regional ecosystem types on optical properties of wildfire-induced aerosols based on remote sensing observations from two satellite instruments and three ground stations. The independent observations commonly show that the ratio of the absorbing aerosols is significantly lower in smoke plumes from the Maritime Continent than those from Central Africa, so that their impacts on regional climate are different. The observed light-absorbing properties of wildfire-induced aerosols are explained by dominant ecosystem types such as wet peatlands for the Maritime Continent and dry savannah for Central Africa, respectively. These results suggest that the wildfire-aerosol-climate feedback processes largely depend on the terrestrial environments from which the fires originate. These feedbacks also interact with climate under greenhouse warming. Our analysis shows that aerosol optical properties retrieved based on satellite observations are critical in assessing wildfire-induced aerosols forcing in climate models. The optical properties of carbonaceous aerosol mixtures used by state-of-the-art chemistry climate models may overestimate emissions for absorbing aerosols from wildfires over the Maritime Continent.

The retrieval is composed of three major steps: (1) initial estimate of the mean droplet size distribution across the entire image of 80-100km along track by 10-25km across track from polarimetric cloudbow observations, (2) coupled retrieval of image-scale cloud and above-cloud aerosol properties by fitting the polarimetric data at all observation angles, and (3) iterative retrieval of 1-D radiative transfer-based COD and droplet size distribution at pixel scale (25m) by establishing relationships between COD and droplet size and fitting the total radiance measurements. Our retrieval is tested using 134 AirMSPI data sets acquired during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) field campaign ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS. The retrieved above-cloud AOD and CTH are compared to coincident HSRL-2 (HSRL-2, NASA Langley Research Center) data, and COD and droplet size distribution parameters (effective radius r(eff) and effective variance v(eff)) are compared to coincident Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) (NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies) data. Mean absolute differences between AirMSPI and HSRL-2 retrievals of above-cloud AOD at 532nm and CTH are 0.03 and <0.5km, respectively. At RSP's footprint scale (similar to 323m), mean absolute differences between RSP and AirMSPI retrievals of COD, r(eff), and v(eff) in the cloudbow area are 2.33, 0.69m, and 0.020, respectively. Neglect of smoke aerosols above cloud leads to an underestimate of image-averaged COD by similar to 15%.

First Top-Down Estimates of Anthropogenic NOx Emissions Using High-Resolution Airborne Remote Sensing Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						inverse modeling; Kalman filter; GCAS; remote sensing; NOx emissions	SATELLITE NO2; DECADAL CHANGES; OZONE; RETRIEVAL; ASSIMILATION; REFLECTANCE; INVERSION; HOUSTON; MODELS; O-3	A number of satellite-based instruments have become an essential part of monitoring emissions. Despite sound theoretical inversion techniques, the insufficient samples and the footprint size of current observations have introduced an obstacle to narrow the inversion window for regional models. These key limitations can be partially resolved by a set of modest high-quality measurements from airborne remote sensing. This study illustrates the feasibility of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns from the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events Airborne Simulator (GCAS) to constrain anthropogenic NOx emissions in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area. We convert slant column densities to vertical columns using a radiative transfer model with (i) NO2 profiles from a high-resolution regional model (1x1km(2)) constrained by P-3B aircraft measurements, (ii) the consideration of aerosol optical thickness impacts on radiance at NO2 absorption line, and (iii) high-resolution surface albedo constrained by ground-based spectrometers. We characterize errors in the GCAS NO2 columns by comparing them to Pandora measurements and find a striking correlation (r>0.74) with an uncertainty of 3.5x10(15)moleculescm(-2). On 9 of 10 total days, the constrained anthropogenic emissions by a Kalman filter yield an overall 2-50% reduction in polluted areas, partly counterbalancing the well-documented positive bias of the model. The inversion, however, boosts emissions by 94% in the same areas on a day when an unprecedented local emissions event potentially occurred, significantly mitigating the bias of the model. The capability of GCAS at detecting such an event ensures the significance of forthcoming geostationary satellites for timely estimates of top-down emissions.

Spatial Representativeness of PM2.5 Concentrations Obtained Using Observations From Network Stations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						representative area; PM2; 5; spatial variation; network observation	AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MODIS; SATELLITE; VARIABILITY; EXTINCTION; POLLUTION; CLOUD; HAZE; AOD	Haze has been a focused air pollution phenomenon in China, and its characterization is highly desired. Aerosol properties obtained from a single station are frequently used to represent the haze condition over a large domain, such as tens of kilometers, which could result in high uncertainties due to their spatial variation. Using a high-resolution network observation over an urban city in North China from November 2015 to February 2016, this study examines the spatial representativeness of ground station observations of particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5m (PM2.5). We developed a new method to determine the representative area of PM2.5 measurements from limited stations. The key idea is to determine the PM2.5 spatial representative area using its spatial variability and temporal correlation. We also determine stations with large representative area using two grid networks with different resolutions. Based on the high spatial resolution measurements, the representative area of PM2.5 at one station can be determined from the grids with high correlations and small differences of PM2.5. The representative area for a single station in the study period ranges from 0.25 to 16.25km(2) but is less than 3km(2) for more than half of the stations. The representative area varies with locations, and observation at 10 optimal stations would have a good representativeness of those obtained from 169 stations for the 4month time scale studied. Both evaluations with an empirical orthogonal function analysis and with independent data set corroborate the validity of the results found in this study.

MIPAS acts as a proxy for typical infrared limb emission sounders, while MLS acts as a proxy for microwave limb sounders. These biases were calculated for temperature and several trace gases by interpolating model fields to real sampling patterns and, additionally, screening those locations as directed by their corresponding quality criteria. Both instruments have dense uniform sampling patterns typical of limb emission sounders, producing almost identical sampling biases. However, there is a substantial difference between the number of locations discarded. MIPAS, as a mid-infrared instrument, is very sensitive to clouds, and measurements affected by them are thus rejected from the analysis. For example, in the tropics, the MIPAS yield is strongly affected by clouds, while MLS is mostly unaffected. The results show that upper-tropospheric sampling biases in zonally averaged data, for both instruments, can be up to 10 to 30 %, depending on the species, and up to 3 K for temperature. For MIPAS, the sampling reduction due to quality screening worsens the biases, leading to values as large as 30 to 100% for the trace gases and expanding the 3 K bias region for temperature. This type of sampling bias is largely induced by the geophysical origins of the screening (e.g. clouds). Further, analysis of long-term time series reveals that these additional quality screening biases may affect the ability to accurately detect upper-tropospheric long-term changes using such data. In contrast, MLS data quality screening removes sufficiently few points that no additional bias is introduced, although its penetration is limited to the upper troposphere, while MIPAS may cover well into the mid-troposphere in cloud-free scenarios. We emphasize that the results of this study refer only to the representativeness of the respective data, not to their intrinsic quality.

Simultaneous aerosol mass spectrometry and chemical ionisation mass spectrometry measurements during a biomass burning event in the UK: insights into nitrate chemistry	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; LIGHT-ABSORPTION; BROWN CARBON; SUBMICRON PARTICLES; PARTICULATE MATTER; MULTILINEAR ENGINE; FIREWORK EVENTS; CENTRAL LONDON	Over the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in short-term events that negatively affect air quality such as bonfires and fireworks. High aerosol and gas concentrations generated from public bonfires or fireworks were measured in order to understand the night-time chemical processes and their atmospheric implications. Nitrogen chemistry was observed during Bonfire Night with nitrogen containing compounds in both gas and aerosol phases and further N2O5 and ClNO2 concentrations, which depleted early next morning due to photolysis of NO3 radicals and ceasing production. Particulate organic oxides of nitrogen (PONS) concentrations of 2.8 mu g M-3 were estimated using the m/z 46 : 30 ratios from aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements, according to previously published methods. Multilinear engine 2 (ME-2) source apportionment was performed to determine organic aerosol (OA) concentrations from different sources after modifying the fragmentation table and it was possible to identify two PON factors representing primary (pPON_ME2) and secondary (sPON_ME2) contributions. A slight improvement in the agreement between the source apportionment of the AMS and a collocated AE-31 Aethalometer was observed after modifying the prescribed fragmentation in the AMS organic spectrum (the fragmentation table) to determine PON sources, which resulted in an r(2) = 0.894 between biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) and babs 470wb compared to an r(2) = 0.861 obtained without the modification. Correlations between OA sources and measurements made using time-of-flight chemical ionisation mass spectrometry with an iodide adduct ion were performed in order to determine possible gas tracers to be used in future ME-2 analyses to constrain solutions. During Bonfire Night, strong correlations (r(2)) were observed between BBOA and methacrylic acid (0.92), acrylic acid (0.90), nitrous acid (0.86), propionic acid, (0.85) and hydrogen cyanide (0.76). A series of oxygenated species and chlorine compounds showed good correlations with sPON_ME2 and the low volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LVOOA) factor during Bonfire Night and an event with low pollutant concentrations. Further analysis of pPON_ME2 and sPON_ME2 was performed in order to determine whether these PON sources absorb light near the UV region using an Aethalometer. This hypothesis was tested by doing multilinear regressions between b(abs_470wb) and BBOA, sPON_ME2 and pPON_ME2.

J	Castiglioni, G; Bellan, J				Castiglioni, Giacomo; Bellan, Josette			On models for predicting thermodynamic regimes in high-pressure turbulent mixing and combustion of multispecies mixtures	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						mixing; turbulent mixing; turbulent reacting flows	MASS DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; CRITICAL-POINTS; FUEL-INJECTION; DIESEL SPRAYS; ENGINE; STATE; EQUATIONS; FLAMES; JETS	The thermodynamic regime of a complex mixture depends on the composition, the pressure and the temperature; the spinodal locus separates the regime of thermodynamic instability from the remainder of the phase space. Since diffusion is one of the phenomena affecting the local chemical composition, the first focus is here on evaluating diffusion models in the context of high-pressure (high-p) multispecies mixing and combustion. It is shown that the diffusion model equations previously used to create two high-p direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases can reproduce classical experimental observations of uphill diffusion in an accurate spatiotemporal manner, whereas the popular model which has a diagonal diffusion matrix and uses a velocity correction lacks spatiotemporal accuracy. Further, a mathematical formalism is used to compute the spinodal locus for mixtures for which either experimental data or previous computations from the literature are available, and it is shown that the agreement of the present calculations with that previously existing information is excellent. Using the spinodal-calculation mathematical formalism, the aforementioned DNS databases are then examined to determine the thermodynamic regime of the mixture at important stages of the simulations. In the first subset of the DNS databases that portrays mixing of five species under high-p conditions, this stage is that of the transitional state representing the individual time station at which each simulation, having been initiated in a laminar state, transitions to a state having turbulent characteristics. In the second subset of the DNS databases that portrays high-p turbulent combustion, this stage represents the individual time station at the peak p achieved during the calculations. In both databases, the influence of the initial Reynolds number, the free-stream composition and the free-stream p is studied. The results show that in all cases the mixture is in the single-phase regime. The present DNS databases have only five species, but it is shown that the methodology for computing the spinodal locus can be applied to very complex mixtures, with examples given for a twelve-species mixture and surrogate diesel fuels, thereby boding well for determining the thermodynamic regime of practical mixtures in high-p turbulent flow simulations for engineering applications. According to these calculations, diesel-fuel surrogates are always in the single-phase regime at injection-conditions p and temperatures existing in diesel-engine combustion chambers.

A Search for Globular Cluster Substructures in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster Core	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: individual (Virgo); galaxies: individual (M87); galaxies: star clusters: general; globular clusters: general	STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; PARSEC EVOLUTIONARY TRACKS; MILES SPECTRAL COVERAGE; GIANT BRANCH STARS; RADIATIVE OPACITIES; INTRACLUSTER LIGHT; MASSIVE STARS; MODELS; SEQUENCES; LIBRARY	Substructure in globular cluster (GC) populations around large galaxies is expected in galaxy formation scenarios that involve accretion or merger events, and it has been searched for using direct associations between GCs and structure in the diffuse galaxy light, or with GC kinematics. Here, we present a search for candidate substructures in the GC population around the Virgo cD galaxy M87 through the analysis of the spatial distribution of the GC colors. The study is based on a sample of similar to 1800 bright GCs with high-quality u, g, r, i, z, K-s photometry, selected to ensure a low contamination by foreground stars or background galaxies. The spectral energy distributions of the GCs are associated with formal estimates of age and metallicity, which are representative of its position in a 4D color space relative to standard single stellar population models. Dividing the sample into broad bins based on the relative formal ages, we observe inhomogeneities that reveal signatures of GC substructures.. The most significant of these is a spatial overdensity of GCs with relatively young age labels, of diameter similar to 0 degrees.1 (similar to 30 kpc), located to the south of M87. The significance of this detection is larger than about 5 sigma after accounting for estimates of random and systematic errors. Surprisingly, no large Virgo galaxy is present in this area that could potentially host these GCs. But candidate substructures in the M87 halo with equally elusive hosts have been described based on kinematic studies in the past. The number of GC spectra available around M87 is currently insufficient to clarify the nature of the new candidate substructure.

The BANYAN Sigma Multivariate Bayesian Algorithm to Identify Members of Young Associations with 150 pc	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; methods: data analysis; proper motions; stars: kinematics and dynamics; stars: low-mass	T-TAURI STARS; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; ALL-SKY SURVEY; LOW-MASS STARS; X-RAY SOURCES; REFINED MK CLASSIFICATION; STELLAR KINEMATIC GROUPS; A-TYPE STARS; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; ETA-CHAMAELEONTIS CLUSTER	BANYAN Sigma is a new Bayesian algorithm to identify members of young stellar associations within 150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young associations with ages in the range similar to 1-800 Myr, modeled with multivariate Gaussians in six-dimensional (6D) XYZUVW space. It is the first such multi-association classification tool to include the nearest sub-groups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the IC. 2602, IC. 2391, Pleiades and Platais. 8 clusters, and the rho Ophiuchi, Corona Australis, and Taurus star formation regions. A model of field stars is built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians based on the Besancon Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion, but can also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in color-magnitude or spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN Sigma S benefits from an analytical solution to the Bayesian marginalization integrals over unknown radial velocities and distances that makes it more accurate and significantly faster than its predecessor BANYAN. II. A contamination versus hit rate analysis is presented and demonstrates that BANYAN Sigma S achieves a better classification performance than other moving group tools available in the literature, especially in terms of cross-contamination between young associations. An updated list of bona fide members in the 27 young associations, augmented by the Gaia-DR1 release, as well as all parameters for the 6D multivariate Gaussian models for each association and the Galactic field neighborhood within 300 pc are presented. This new tool will make it possible to analyze large data sets such as the upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify new young stars. IDL and Python versions of BANYAN Sigma S are made available with this publication, and a more limited online web tool is available at http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/banyansigma.php.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion; accretion disks; ISM: individual objects (HH 212); ISM: jets and outflows; stars: formation	YOUNG STARS; JET; MOLECULES; EVOLUTION; OUTFLOWS; DRIVEN	HH 212 is a Class 0 protostellar system found to host a "hamburger"-shaped dusty disk with a rotating disk atmosphere and a collimated SiO jet at a distance of similar to 400 pc. Recently, a compact rotating outflow has been detected in SO and SO2 toward the center along the jet axis at similar to 52 au (0 13) resolution. Here we resolve the compact outflow into a small-scale wide-opening rotating outflow shell and a collimated jet, with the observations in the same S-bearing molecules at similar to 16 au (0 '' 04) resolution. The collimated jet is aligned with the SiO jet, tracing the shock interactions in the jet. The wide-opening outflow shell is seen extending out from the inner disk around the SiO jet and has a width of similar to 100 au. It is not only expanding away from the center, but also rotating around the jet axis. The specific angular momentum of the outflow shell is similar to 40 au km s(-1). Simple modeling of the observed kinematics suggests that the rotating outflow shell can trace either a disk wind or disk material pushed away by an unseen wind from the inner disk or protostar. We also resolve the disk atmosphere in the same S-bearing molecules, confirming the Keplerian rotation there.	[Lee, Chin-Fei; Ho, Paul T.

An X-Ray Imaging Survey of Quasar Jets: The Complete Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: jets; quasars: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; LARGE-SCALE JETS; RADIO JETS; CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS; EXTRAGALACTIC JETS; COMPLETE SAMPLE; PKS 0637-752; 3C 273; H I; EMISSION	We present Chandra X-ray imaging of a flux-limited sample of flat spectrum radio-emitting quasars with jet-like structure. X-rays are detected from 59% of 56 jets. No counter-jets were detected. The core spectra are fitted by power-law spectra with a photon index Gamma(x), whose distribution is consistent with a normal distribution, with a mean of 1.61(-0.05)(+0.04) and dispersion of 0.15(-0.03)(+0.04). We show that the distribution of alpha(rx), the spectral index between the X-ray and radio band jet fluxes, fits a Gaussian with a mean of 0.974 +/- 0.012 and dispersion of 0.077 +/- 0.008. We test the model in which kiloparsec-scale X-rays result from inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons off the jet's relativistic electrons (the IC-CMB model). In the IC-CMB model, a quantity Q computed from observed fluxes and the apparent size of the emission region depends on redshift as (1 + z)(3+alpha). We fit Q proportional to (1 + z)(a), finding a = 0.88 +/- 0.90, and reject at 99.5% confidence the hypothesis that the average alpha(rx) depends on redshift in the manner expected in the IC-CMB model. This conclusion is mitigated by a lack of detailed knowledge of the emission region geometry, which requires deeper or higher resolution X-ray observations. Furthermore, if the IC-CMB model is valid for X-ray emission from kiloparsec-scale jets, then the jets must decelerate on average: bulk Lorentz factors should drop from about 15 to 2-3 between parsec and kiloparsec scales. Our results compound the problems that the IC-CMB model has in explaining the X-ray emission of kiloparsec-scale jets.	[Marshall, H. L.; Gelbord, J.

The Interplay between Radiation Pressure and the Photoelectric Instability in Optically Thin Disks of Gas and Dust	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						hydrodynamics; instabilities; methods: numerical; radiation: dynamics; zodiacal dust	DEBRIS DISKS; BETA-PICTORIS; AU MICROSCOPII; SOLAR NEBULA; PLANETS; MODELS; SYSTEM; TURBULENCE; DYNAMICS; RINGS	In optically thin disks, dust grains are photoelectrically stripped of electrons by starlight, heating nearby gas and possibly creating a dust clumping instability-the photoelectric instability (PeI)-that significantly alters global disk structure. In the current work, we use the Pencil Code to perform the first numerical models of the PeI that include stellar radiation pressure on dust grains in order to explore the parameter regime in which the instability operates. In some models with low gas and dust surface densities, we see a variety of dust structures, including sharp concentric rings. In the most gas-and dust-rich models, nonaxisymmetric clumps, arcs, and spiral arms emerge that represent dust surface density enhancements of factors of similar to 5-20. In one high gas surface density model, we include a large, low-order gas viscosity and find that it observably smooths the structures that form in the gas and dust, suggesting that resolved images of a given disk may be useful for deriving constraints on the effective viscosity of its gas. Our models show that radiation pressure does not preclude the formation of complex structure from the PeI, but the qualitative manifestation of the PeI depends strongly on the parameters of the system. The PeI may provide an explanation for unusual disk morphologies, such as the moving blobs of the AU Mic disk, the asymmetric dust distribution of the 49 Ceti disk, and the rings and arcs found in the HD 141569A disk.

High-redshift Extremely Red Quasars in X-Rays	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; quasars: emission lines; quasars: general; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; ABSORPTION-LINE QUASARS; RADIO-QUIET QUASARS; ULTRALUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES; IONIZED-GAS NEBULAE; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; DRIVEN DISK WINDS; STELLAR OBJECTS; XMM-NEWTON; CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS	Quasars may have played a key role in limiting the stellar mass of massive galaxies. Identifying those quasars in the process of removing star formation fuel from their hosts is an exciting ongoing challenge in extragalactic astronomy. In this paper, we present X-ray observations of 11 extremely red quasars (ERQs) with L-bol similar to 10(47) erg s(-1) at z = 1.5-3.2 with evidence for high-velocity (v >= 1000 km s(-1)) [O III] lambda 5007 outflows. X-rays allow us to directly probe circumnuclear obscuration and to measure the instantaneous accretion luminosity. We detect 10 out of 11 ERQs available in targeted and archival data. Using a combination of X-ray spectral fitting and hardness ratios, we find that all of the ERQs show signs of absorption in the X-rays with inferred column densities of N-H approximate to 10(23) cm(-2), including four Compton-thick candidates (N-H >= 10(24) cm(-2)). We stack the X-ray emission of the seven weakly detected sources, measuring an average column density of N-H similar to 8 x 10(23) cm(-2). The absorption-corrected (intrinsic) 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of the stack is 2.7. x. 10(45) erg s(-1), consistent with X-ray luminosities of type 1 quasars of the same infrared luminosity. Thus, we find that ERQs are a highly obscured, borderline Compton-thick population, and based on optical and infrared data we suggest that these objects are partially hidden by their own equatorial outflows. However, unlike some quasars with known outflows, ERQs do not appear to be intrinsically underluminous in X-rays for their bolometric luminosity. Our observations indicate that low X-rays are not necessary to enable some types of radiatively driven winds.

Spatial variation of the rain-snow temperature threshold across the Northern Hemisphere	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DECLINING MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK; PRECIPITATION-PHASE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-SURFACE; SWISS ALPS; WESTERN; WATER; SIMULATION; TRENDS; DISCRIMINATION	Despite the importance of precipitation phase to global hydroclimate simulations, many land surface models use spatially uniform air temperature thresholds to partition rain and snow. Here we show, through the analysis of a 29-year observational dataset (n = 17.8 million), that the air temperature at which rain and snow fall in equal frequency varies significantly across the Northern Hemisphere, averaging 1.0 degrees C and ranging from -0.4 to 2.4 degrees C for 95% of the stations. Continental climates generally exhibit the warmest rain-snow thresholds and maritime the coolest. Simulations show precipitation phase methods incorporating humidity perform better than air temperature-only methods, particularly at relative humidity values below saturation and air temperatures between 0.6 and 3.4 degrees C. We also present the first continuous Northern Hemisphere map of rain-snow thresholds, underlining the spatial variability of precipitation phase partitioning. These results suggest precipitation phase could be better predicted using humidity and air temperature in large-scale land surface model runs.

Brightest cluster galaxy UV upturn and the FUV-NUV color up to redshift 0.35	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ultraviolet: galaxies; galaxies: ellipticals and lenticulars, cD; galaxies: stellar content	EVOLVED STELLAR POPULATIONS; HORIZONTAL-BRANCH STARS; BACK TIME EVOLUTION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; RADIATION; FLUX; M32; PHOTOMETRY; EMISSION	Context. At low redshift, early-type galaxies often exhibit a rising flux with decreasing wavelength in the 1000-2500 angstrom range, called "UV upturn". The origin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly constrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV upturn approximately to redshift 0.5. Aims. We provide constraints on the existence of the UV upturn up to redshift similar to 0.4 in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS survey. Methods. We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed magnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase the number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a few tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively small error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec aperture. By using the r-band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can separate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases. We use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases. Results. We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift range 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by increasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range with no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past. These galaxies bring new constraints that can help distinguish between assumptions concerning the stellar populations causing the UV upturn phenomenon. The existence of a large number of UV upturns around redshift 0.25 favors the existence of a binary channel among the sources proposed in the literature.

We present polarimetric lidar measurements of turbulence in a laboratory generated turbulent flow. We found that the nearforward light depolarization characterized by the depolarization rate gamma(z), varies with the turbulent flow parameter: chi(z) epsilon (z)(1/4), where chi(z) and epsilon(z) are the respective depth dependent, temperature variance, and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates. The presence of particles in the flow modifies the values of gamma in such a way that the ratio gamma(z)/alpha(z) becomes independent of the particle concentration and depends only on chi(z)epsilon(z)(1/4). We posit that the mechanism of light depolarization in turbulent flow with particles is forward scattered light interaction between turbulent refractive index inhomogeneities and flow particles. Such interactions result so that the observed depolarization rate, gamma(z), is much larger than expected from 'pure' turbulent flow. Our observations open up the fascinating possibility of using lidar for turbulence measurements of aquatic flows.

Photometric Modeling and VIS-IR Albedo Maps of Dione From Cassini-VIMS	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Dione; photometric correction; phase function; albedo maps; water ice band depth map; Cassini; VIMS	SATURNS ICY SATELLITES; MOON	We report about visible and infrared albedo maps and spectral indicators of Dione's surface derived from the complete Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data set acquired between 2004 and 2017 during the Cassini tour in Saturn's system. Maps are derived by applying a photometric correction necessary to disentangle the intrinsic albedo of the surface from illumination and viewing geometry occurring at the time of the observation. The photometric correction is based on the Shkuratov et al. (2011, ) method which yields values of the surface equigonal albedo. Dione's surface albedo maps are rendered at five visible (VIS: 0.35, 0.44, 0.55, 0.7, and 0.95 mu m) and five infrared (IR: 1.046, 1.540, 1.822, 2.050, and 2.200 mu m) wavelengths in cylindrical projection with a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees angular resolution in latitude and longitude, corresponding to a spatial resolution of 4.5km/bin. Apart from visible and infrared albedo maps, we report about the distribution of the two visible spectral slopes (0.35-0.55 and 0.55-0.95 mu m) and water ice 2.050m band depth computed after having applied the photometric correction. The derived spectral indicators are employed to trace Dione's composition variability on both global and local scales allowing to study the dichotomy between the bright-leading and dark-trailing hemispheres, the distribution of fresh material on the impact craters and surrounding ejecta, and the resurfacing of the bright material within the chasmata caused by tectonism.

GIA Model Statistics for GRACE Hydrology, Cryosphere, and Ocean Science	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						GIA; Bayesian; statistics; uncertainty; GRACE	GLACIAL-ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; SEA-LEVEL RISE; ICE-SHEET; MANTLE VISCOSITY; MASS TRENDS; GRAVITY; ANTARCTICA; WATER; GREENLAND; SURFACE	We provide a new analysis of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) with the goal of assembling the model uncertainty statistics required for rigorously extracting trends in surface mass from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Such statistics are essential for deciphering sea level, ocean mass, and hydrological changes because the latter signals can be relatively small (2mm/yr water height equivalent) over very large regions, such as major ocean basins and watersheds. With abundant new >7year continuous measurements of vertical land motion (VLM) reported by Global Positioning System stations on bedrock and new relative sea level records, our new statistical evaluation of GIA uncertainties incorporates Bayesian methodologies. A unique aspect of the method is that both the ice history and 1-D Earth structure vary through a total of 128,000 forward models. We find that best fit models poorly capture the statistical inferences needed to correctly invert for lower mantle viscosity and that GIA uncertainty exceeds the uncertainty ascribed to trends from 14years of GRACE data in polar regions.

Siting Background Towers to Characterize Incoming Air for Urban Greenhouse Gas Estimation: A Case Study in the Washington, DC/Baltimore Area	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						greenhouse gas; urban; inversion; emissions; carbon dioxide; background	CO2 EMISSIONS; EXCHANGE; VARIABILITY; FLUXES	There is increased interest in understanding urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To accurately estimate city emissions, the influence of extraurban fluxes must first be removed from urban greenhouse gas (GHG) observations. This is especially true for regions, such as the U.S. Northeastern Corridor-Baltimore/Washington, DC (NEC-B/W), downwind of large fluxes. To help site background towers for the NEC-B/W, we use a coupled Bayesian Information Criteria and geostatistical regression approach to help site four background locations that best explain CO2 variability due to extraurban fluxes modeled at 12 urban towers. The synthetic experiment uses an atmospheric transport and dispersion model coupled with two different flux inventories to create modeled observations and evaluate 15 candidate towers located along the urban domain for February and July 2013. The analysis shows that the average ratios of extraurban inflow to total modeled enhancements at urban towers are 21% to 36% in February and 31% to 43% in July. In July, the incoming air dominates the total variability of synthetic enhancements at the urban towers (R-2=0.58). Modeled observations from the selected background towers generally capture the variability in the synthetic CO2 enhancements at urban towers (R-2=0.75, root-mean-square error (RMSE)=3.64ppm; R-2=0.43, RMSE=4.96ppm for February and July). However, errors associated with representing background air can be up to 10ppm for any given observation even with an optimal background tower configuration. More sophisticated methods may be necessary to represent background air to accurately estimate urban GHG emissions.

Model evaluation was conducted using satellite tropospheric NO2 retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and aircraft observations from the 2014 Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE). Agreement against satellite retrievals improved greatly at 1.1 and 0.56 degrees resolutions (compared to 2.8 degrees resolution) over polluted and biomass burning regions. The 1.1 degrees simulation generally captured the regional distribution of the tropospheric NO2 column well, whereas 0.56 degrees resolution was necessary to improve the model performance over areas with strong local sources, with mean bias reductions of 67% over Beijing and 73% over San Francisco in summer. Validation using aircraft observations indicated that high-resolution simulations reduced negative NO2 biases below 700 hPa over the Denver metropolitan area. These improvements in high-resolution simulations were attributable to (1) closer spatial representativeness between simulations and observations and (2) better representation of large-scale concentration fields (i.e., at 2.8 degrees) through the consideration of small-scale processes. Model evaluations conducted at 0.5 and 2.8 degrees bin grids indicated that the contributions of both these processes were comparable over most polluted regions, whereas the latter effect (2) made a larger contribution over eastern China and biomass burning areas. The evaluations presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of using a high-resolution global CTM for studying megacity-scale air pollutants across the entire globe, potentially also contributing to global satellite retrievals and chemical data assimilation.

Information content of OCO-2 oxygen A-band channels for retrieving marine liquid cloud properties	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MOLECULAR LINE ABSORPTION; SCATTERING ATMOSPHERE; GEOMETRICAL THICKNESS; GLOBAL SURVEY; TOP HEIGHT; B BANDS; CALIPSO; MISSION; MODEL; INSTRUMENT	Information content analysis is used to select channels for a marine liquid cloud retrieval using the high-spectral-resolution oxygen A-band instrument on NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). Desired retrieval properties are cloud optical depth, cloud-top pressure and cloud pressure thickness, which is the geometric thickness expressed in hectopascals. Based on information content criteria we select a micro-window of 75 of the 853 functioning OCO-2 channels spanning 763.5-764.6 nm and perform a series of synthetic retrievals with perturbed initial conditions. We estimate posterior errors from the sample standard deviations and obtain +/- 0.75 in optical depth and +/- 12.9 hPa in both cloud-top pressure and cloud pressure thickness, although removing the 10% of samples with the highest +/- 2 reduces posterior error in cloud-top pressure to +/- 2.9 hPa and cloud pressure thickness to +/- 2.5 hPa. The application of this retrieval to real OCO-2 measurements is briefly discussed, along with limitations and the greatest caution is urged regarding the assumption of a single homogeneous cloud layer, which is often, but not always, a reasonable approximation for marine boundary layer clouds.

Low temperature studies of the removal reactions of (CH2)-C-1 with particular relevance to the atmosphere of Titan	ICARUS			English	Article							VERY-LOW TEMPERATURES; OUTER SOLAR-SYSTEM; H ATOM YIELDS; METHANE PHOTOLYSIS; BRANCHING RATIOS; RATE CONSTANTS; 295 K; KINETICS; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; METHYLENE	Methylene, CH2, is one of the major photolysis products of methane by Lyman-alpha radiation and is involved in the photochemistry of the atmospheres of Titan and the giant planets. The kinetics of the reactions of the first excited state of methylene, (CH2)-C-1, with He, N-2, O-2, H-2 and CH4 have been measured over the temperature range 43-160K by pulsed laser photolysis, monitoring (CH2)-C-1 removal by laser induced fluorescence. Low temperatures were obtained with either a pulsed Laval expansion (43-134 K) or a, slow flow reaction cell (160 K). The rate coefficients for the reactions with N-2, O-2, H-2 and CH4 all showed a strong negative temperature dependence. In combination with other literature data, the rate coefficients can be parameterised as: k(He) (43 < T/K < 800)= (1.90 +/- 0.23) x 10(-12) x (T/298)(1.74 +/- 016) x exp(((88 +/- 23)/T)) k(N2) (43 < T/K < 800) = (2.29 +/- 1.12) x 10(-12) x (T/298)(-2.15 +/- 138) x exp(((-74 +/- 96)/T)) + (3.91 +/- 0.78) x 10(-11) x exp(((-469 +/- 114)/T)) k(O2) (43 < T/K < 300) = (6.16 +/- 1.09) x 10 (-11) x (T/298)(-0.65 +/- 0.14) k(H2) (43 < T/K < 800) = (1.10 +/- 0.04)x 10(-10) x (T/298)(-0.40 +/- 0.06) x exp(((111 +/- 6.9)/T)) k(CH4) (43 < T/K < 475) = (8.20 +/- 0.46) x 10(-11) x (T/298)(-0.93 +/- 0.10) x exp(((-20.5 +/- 12.8)/T)) For the reactions of (CH2)-C-1 with H-2 and CH4, the branching ratio for quenching to ground state, (CH2)-C-3 , vs chemical reaction was also determined at 160 and 73 K. The values measured (H-2 : 0.39 +/- 0.10 at 160 K, 0.78 +/- 0.15 at 73 K; CH4 : 0.49 +/- 0.09 at 160 K, 0.64 +/- 0.19 at 73 K) confirm trends of an increased proportion of reactive loss with increasing temperature determined at higher temperatures. The impacts of the new measurements for Titan's atmosphere have been ascertained using a 10 chemistry and transport model. A significant decrease (similar to 40%) in the mixing ratio of ethane between 800 and 1550 km is calculated due to the decrease contribution of methyl production from the reaction of (CH2)-C-1 with CH4, with smaller increases in the concentrations of ethene and acetylene. Ethene production is enhanced by more methylene being converted to methylidene, CH, and the subsequent reaction of CH with CH4 to generate ethene. Photolysis of ethene is the major route to acetylene formation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Douglas, Kevin; Blitz, Mark A.; Feng, Wuhu; Heard, Dwayne E.; Plane, John M.

J	Lorenz, RD; Panning, M				Lorenz, Ralph D.; Panning, Mark			Empirical recurrence rates for ground motion signals on planetary surfaces	ICARUS			English	Article						Instrumentation; Geophysics; Interiors	INSIGHT MISSION; NOISE; MARS; SEISMOMETER; LANDER	We determine the recurrence rates of ground motion events as a function of sensed velocity amplitude at several terrestrial locations, and make a first interplanetary comparison with measurements on the Moon, Mars, Venus and Titan. This empirical approach gives an intuitive order-of-magnitude guide to the observed ground motion (including both tectonic and ocean-and atmosphere-forced signals) of these locations as a guide to instrument expectations on future missions, without invoking interior models and specific sources: for example a Venera-14 observation of possible ground motion indicates a microseismic environment midway between noisy and quiet terrestrial locations. Quiet terrestrial regions see a peak velocity amplitude in mm/s roughly equal to 0.3*N(-07), where N is the number of "events" (half-hour intervals in which a given peak ground motion is exceeded) observed per year. The Apollo data show endogenous seismic signals for a given recurrence rate that are typically about 10,000 times smaller in amplitude than a quiet site on Earth, although local thermally-induced moonquakes are much more common. Viking data masked for low-wind periods appear comparable with a quiet terrestrial site, whereas a Venera observation of microseisms suggests ground motion more similar to a more active terrestrial location. Recurrence rate plots from in-situ measurements provide a context for seismic instrumentation on future planetary missions, e.g. to guide formulation of data compression schemes. While even small geophones can discriminate terrestrial activity rates, observations with guidance accelerometers are typically too insensitive to provide meaningful constraints (i.e. a non-zero number of "events") on actual ground motion observations unless operated for very long periods.

An assessment of the differences between spatial resolution and grid size for the SMAP enhanced soil moisture product over homogeneous sites	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAP; Soil moisture; Spatial resolution; In situ		Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing typically involves a scanning antenna that makes measurements at irregularly spaced locations. These locations can change on a day to day basis. Soil moisture products derived from satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing are usually resampled to a fixed Earth grid that facilitates their use in applications. In many cases the grid size is finer than the actual spatial resolution of the observation, and often this difference is not well understood by the user. Here, this issue was examined for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced version of the passive-based soil moisture product, which has a grid size of 9-km and a nominal spatial resolution of 33-km. In situ observations from core validation sites were used to compute comparison metrics. For sites that satisfied the established reliability and scaling criteria, the impact of validating the 9-km grid product with in situ data collected over a 9-km versus a 33-km domain was very small for the sites studied (0.039 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root mean square difference for the 9-km case versus 0.037 m(3)/m(3) for the 33-km case). This result does not mean that the resolution of the product is 9-km but that for the conditions studied here the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over 9-km is a close approximation of the soil moisture estimated from in situ observations over the 33-km resolution. The implication is that using the enhanced SMAP product at its grid resolution of 9-km should not introduce large errors in most applications.	[Colliander, A.; Chan, S. K.; Yueh, S.

Application to 8567 (1996 HW1)	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; Near-earth objects; Spectroscopy; Infrared observations	NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS; THERMAL PHYSICS; SPECTROGRAPH; CALIBRATION; STARS; SPEX	We apply a new shape-based thermophysical model, SHERMAN, to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 8567 (1996 HW1) to derive surface properties. We use the detailed shape model of Magri et al. (2011) for this contact binary NEA to analyze spectral observations (2-4.1 microns) obtained at the NASA JRTF on several different dates to find thermal parameters that match all the data. Visible and near-infrared (0.8-2.5 microns) spectral observations are also utilized in a self-consistent way. We find that an average visible albedo of 0.33, thermal inertia of 70 (SI units) and surface roughness of 50% closely match the observations. The shape and orientation of the asteroid is very important to constrain the thermal parameters to be consistent with all the observations. Multiple viewing geometries are equally important to achieve a robust solution for small, non-spherical NEAs. We separate the infrared beaming effects of shape, viewing geometry and surface roughness for this asteroid and show how their effects combine. We compare the diameter and albedo that would be derived from the thermal observations assuming a spherical shape with those from the shape-based model. We also discuss how observations from limited viewing geometries compare to the solution from multiple observations. The size that would be derived from the individual observation dates varies by 20% from the best-fit solution, and can be either larger or smaller. If the surface properties are not homogeneous, many solutions are possible, but the average properties derived here are very tightly constrained by the multiple observations, and give important insights into the nature of small NEAs.

The Global Space-based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology, or GloSSAC, provided the input data to the construction of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project stratospheric aerosol forcing data set (1979-2014) and we have extended it through 2016 following an identical process. GloSSAC focuses on the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) series of instruments through mid-2005, and on the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data thereafter. We also use data from other space instruments and from ground-based, air, and balloon borne instruments to fill in key gaps in the data set. The end result is a global and gap-free data set focused on aerosol extinction coefficient at 525 and 1020 nm and other parameters on an "as available" basis. For the primary data sets, we developed a new method for filling the post-Pinatubo eruption data gap for 1991-1993 based on data from the Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer. In addition, we developed a new method for populating wintertime high latitudes during the SAGE period employing a latitude-equivalent latitude conversion process that greatly improves the depiction of aerosol at high latitudes compared to earlier similar efforts. We report data in the troposphere only when and where it is available. This is primarily during the SAGE II period except for the most enhanced part of the Pinatubo period. It is likely that the upper troposphere during Pinatubo was greatly enhanced over non-volcanic periods and that domain remains substantially under-characterized. We note that aerosol levels during the OSIRIS/CALIPSO period in the lower stratosphere at mid-and high latitudes is routinely higher than what we observed during the SAGE II period. While this period had nearly continuous low-level volcanic activity, it is possible that the enhancement in part reflects deficiencies in the data set. We also expended substantial effort to quality assess the data set and the product is by far the best we have produced.

Empirical Modeling of the Redshift Evolution of the [N II]/H alpha Ratio for Galaxy Redshift Surveys	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: observations; galaxies: fundamental parameters; galaxies: ISM	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; MASS-METALLICITY RELATION; EMISSION-LINE RATIOS; PROBING DARK ENERGY; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; H-ALPHA EMITTERS; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; NEBULAR EMISSION; STELLAR; UNIVERSE	We present an empirical parameterization of the [N II]/H alpha flux ratio as a function of stellar mass and redshift valid at 0 < z < 2.7 and 8.5 < log(M/M-circle dot) < 11.0. This description can easily be applied to (i) simulations for modeling [N II]lambda 6584 line emission, (ii) deblend [N II] and H alpha in current low-resolution grism and narrow-band observations to derive intrinsic H alpha fluxes, and (iii) to reliably forecast the number counts of H alpha emission-line galaxies for future surveys, such as those planned for Euclid and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). Our model combines the evolution of the locus on the Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich (BPT) diagram measured in spectroscopic data out to z similar to 2.5 with the strong dependence of [N II]/H alpha on stellar mass and [O III]/H beta observed in local galaxy samples. We find large variations in the [N II]/H alpha flux ratio at a fixed redshift due to its dependency on stellar mass; hence, the assumption of a constant [N II] flux contamination fraction can lead to a significant under- or overestimate of H alpha luminosities. Specifically, measurements of the intrinsic H alpha luminosity function derived from current low-resolution grism spectroscopy assuming a constant 29% contamination of [N II] can be overestimated by factors of similar to 8 at log(L) > 43.0 for galaxies at redshifts z similar to 1.5. This has implications for the prediction of H alpha emitters for Euclid and WFIRST. We also study the impact of blended H alpha and [N II] on the accuracy of measured spectroscopic redshifts.

Wave-optical treatment of the shadow cast by a large sphere	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							APPROXIMATION; SCATTERING	We study the electromagnetic (EM) field in the shadow cast by a large opaque sphere. For this, we consider the scattering of a high-frequency monochromatic EM wave by the large sphere and develop a Mie theory that accounts for the presence of this obscuration. Applying fully absorbing boundary conditions, we find a solution for the Debye potentials, which we use to determine the EM field in the shadow in the wave zone at large distances from the sphere. We use the standard tools available from the nuclear scattering theory to develop the wave-optical treatment of the problem. Based on this treatment, we demonstrate that there is no EM field deep in the shadow, except for the field that is diffracted into the shadow by the edges of the sphere, as anticipated.

Clusters of cyclones encircling Jupiter's poles	NATURE			English	Article							SHALLOW-WATER TURBULENCE; VORTEX CRYSTALS; GEOSTROPHIC TURBULENCE; MOIST CONVECTION; JUNO SPACECRAFT; VORTICES; JETS; CIRCULATION; SIMULATIONS; ATMOSPHERE	The familiar axisymmetric zones and belts that characterize Jupiter's weather system at lower latitudes give way to pervasive cyclonic activity at higher latitudes(1). Two-dimensional turbulence in combination with the Coriolis beta-effect (that is, the large meridionally varying Coriolis force on the giant planets of the Solar System) produces alternating zonal flows(2). The zonal flows weaken with rising latitude so that a transition between equatorial jets and polar turbulence on Jupiter can occur(3,4). Simulations with shallow-water models of giant planets support this transition by producing both alternating flows near the equator and circumpolar cyclones near the poles(5-9). Jovian polar regions are not visible from Earth owing to Jupiter's low axial tilt, and were poorly characterized by previous missions because the trajectories of these missions did not venture far from Jupiter's equatorial plane. Here we report that visible and infrared images obtained from above each pole by the Juno spacecraft during its first five orbits reveal persistent polygonal patterns of large cyclones. In the north, eight circumpolar cyclones are observed about a single polar cyclone; in the south, one polar cyclone is encircled by five circumpolar cyclones. Cyclonic circulation is established via time-lapse imagery obtained over intervals ranging from 20 minutes to 4 hours. Although migration of cyclones towards the pole might be expected as a consequence of the Coriolis beta-effect, by which cyclonic vortices naturally drift towards the rotational pole, the configuration of the cyclones is without precedent on other planets (including Saturn's polar hexagonal features). The manner in which the cyclones persist without merging and the process by which they evolve to their current configuration are unknown.

Measurement of Jupiter's asymmetric gravity field	NATURE			English	Article							ATMOSPHERE; DEPTH	The gravity harmonics of a fluid, rotating planet can be decomposed into static components arising from solid-body rotation and dynamic components arising from flows. In the absence of internal dynamics, the gravity field is axially and hemispherically symmetric and is dominated by even zonal gravity harmonics J(2n) that are approximately proportional to q(n), where q is the ratio between centrifugal acceleration and gravity at the planet's equator(1). Any asymmetry in the gravity field is attributed to differential rotation and deep atmospheric flows. The odd harmonics, J(3), J(5), J(7), J(9) and higher, are a measure of the depth of the winds in the different zones of the atmosphere(2,3). Here we report measurements of Jupiter's gravity harmonics (both even and odd) through precise Doppler tracking of the Juno spacecraft in its polar orbit around Jupiter. We find a north-south asymmetry, which is a signature of atmospheric and interior flows. Analysis of the harmonics, described in two accompanying papers(4,5), provides the vertical profile of the winds and precise constraints for the depth of Jupiter's dynamical atmosphere.

Jupiter's atmospheric jet streams extend thousands of kilometres deep	NATURE			English	Article							ODD GRAVITATIONAL HARMONICS; ZONAL-WIND-PROFILE; GIANT PLANETS; GRAVITY; DYNAMICS; GALILEO; FLOWS	The depth to which Jupiter's observed east-west jet streams extend has been a long-standing question(1,2). Resolving this puzzle has been a primary goal for the Juno spacecraft(3,4), which has been in orbit around the gas giant since July 2016. Juno's gravitational measurements have revealed that Jupiter's gravitational field is north-south asymmetric(5), which is a signature of the planet's atmospheric and interior flows(6). Here we report that the measured odd gravitational harmonics J(3), J(5), J(7) and J(9) indicate that the observed jet streams, as they appear at the cloud level, extend down to depths of thousands of kilometres beneath the cloud level, probably to the region of magnetic dissipation at a depth of about 3,000 kilometres(7,8). By inverting the measured gravity values into a wind field(9), we calculate the most likely vertical profile of the deep atmospheric and interior flow, and the latitudinal dependence of its depth. Furthermore, the even gravity harmonics J(8) and J(10) resulting from this flow profile also match the measurements, when taking into account the contribution of the interior structure(10). These results indicate that the mass of the dynamical atmosphere is about one per cent of Jupiter's total mass.

A suppression of differential rotation in Jupiter's deep interior	NATURE			English	Article							GIANT PLANETS; ATMOSPHERE; HELIUM; GALILEO; CONSTRAINTS; DYNAMICS; FLOW	Jupiter's atmosphere is rotating differentially, with zones and belts rotating at speeds that differ by up to 100 metres per second. Whether this is also true of the gas giant's interior has been unknown(1,2), limiting our ability to probe the structure and composition of the planet(3,4). The discovery by the Juno spacecraft that Jupiter's gravity field is north-south asymmetric(5) and the determination of its non-zero odd gravitational harmonics J(3), J(5), J(7) and J(9) demonstrates that the observed zonal cloud flow must persist to a depth of about 3,000 kilometres from the cloud tops(6). Here we report an analysis of Jupiter's even gravitational harmonics J(4), J(6), J(8) and J(10) as observed by Juno(5) and compared to the predictions of interior models. We find that the deep interior of the planet rotates nearly as a rigid body, with differential rotation decreasing by at least an order of magnitude compared to the atmosphere. Moreover, we find that the atmospheric zonal flow extends to more than 2,000 kilometres and to less than 3,500 kilometres, making it fully consistent with the constraints obtained independently from the odd gravitational harmonics. This depth corresponds to the point at which the electric conductivity becomes large and magnetic drag should suppress differential rotation(7). Given that electric conductivity is dependent on planetary mass, we expect the outer, differentially rotating region to be at least three times deeper in Saturn and to be shallower in massive giant planets and brown dwarfs.

Key reasons for this good performance are the excellent image quality frequently achievable for K-s imaging from the ground, a highly effective photometric selection of background galaxies, and a galaxy ellipticity dispersion that is noticeably lower than for optically observed high-redshift galaxy samples. Incorporating results from the 3D-HST and UltraVISTA surveys we also obtained a more accurate calibration of the source redshift distribution than previously achieved for similar optical weak lensing data sets. Here we studied the extremely massive galaxy cluster RCS2 J232727.7-020437 (z = 0.699), combining deep VLT/HAWK-I K-s images (point spread function with a 0''.35 full width at half maximum) with LBT/LBC photometry. The resulting weak lensing mass reconstruction suggests that the cluster consists of a single overdensity, which is detected with a peak significance of 10.1 sigma. We constrained the cluster mass to M-200c/(10(15) M-circle dot) = 2.06(-0.26)(+0.28)(stat.) +/- 0.12(sys.) assuming a spherical Navarro, Frenk & White model and simulation-based priors on the concentration, making it one of the most massive galaxy clusters known in the z greater than or similar to 0.7 Universe. We also cross-checked the HAWK-I measurements through an analysis of overlapping HST/ACS images, yielding fully consistent estimates of the lensing signal.

Thermal superradiant emitter assemblies with variable photon far-field coupling rates are known to be capable of outperforming their conventional, nonsuperradiant counterparts. However, due to the inability to account for assemblies comprising emitters with various materials and dimensional configurations, existing thermal superradiant models are inadequate and incongruent. In this paper, a generalized thermal superradiant assembly for nanophotonic emitters is developed from first principles. Spectral analysis shows that not only does the proposed model outperform existing models in power delivery, but also portrays unforeseen and startling characteristics during emission. These electromagnetically induced transparency like (EIT-like) and superscattering-like characteristics are reported here for a superradiant assembly, and the effects escalate as the emitters become increasingly disparate. The fact that the EIT-like characteristics are in close agreement with a recent experimental observation involving the superradiant decay of qubits strongly bolsters the validity of the proposed model.

Summarizing performance for genome scale measurement of miRNA: reference samples and metrics	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						microRNA; miRNA; Reference samples; Process controls; Dashboard	GENE-EXPRESSION MEASUREMENTS; RNA REFERENCE SAMPLES; PLATFORMS; MIXTURES	Background: The potential utility of microRNA as biomarkers for early detection of cancer and other diseases is being investigated with genome-scale profiling of differentially expressed microRNA. Processes for measurement assurance are critical components of genome-scale measurements. Here, we evaluated the utility of a set of total RNA samples, designed with between-sample differences in the relative abundance of miRNAs, as process controls. Results: Three pure total human RNA samples (brain, liver, and placenta) and two different mixtures of these components were evaluated as measurement assurance control samples on multiple measurement systems at multiple sites and over multiple rounds. In silico modeling of mixtures provided benchmark values for comparison with physical mixtures. Biomarker development laboratories using next-generation sequencing (NGS) or genome-scale hybridization assays participated in the study and returned data from the samples using their routine workflows. Multiplexed and single assay reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm in silico predicted sample differences. Data visualizations and summary metrics for genome-scale miRNA profiling assessment were developed using this dataset, and a range of performance was observed. These metrics have been incorporated into an online data analysis pipeline and provide a convenient dashboard view of results from experiments following the described design. The website also serves as a repository for the accumulation of performance values providing new participants in the project an opportunity to learn what may be achievable with similar measurement processes. Conclusions: The set of reference samples used in this study provides benchmark values suitable for assessing genome-scale miRNA profiling processes. Incorporation of these metrics into an online resource allows laboratories to periodically evaluate their performance and assess any changes introduced into their measurement process.	[Pine, P.

This record covers the +/- 40 degrees latitude belt and includes estimates of the zonally averaged monthly mean specific humidity from 700 up to 400 hPa. It includes three major climate zones: (a) the deep tropics (+/- 15 degrees), (b) the trade winds belts (+/- 15-30 degrees), and (c) the subtropics (+/- 30-40 degrees). We find that the RO observations agree very well with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim), the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) by capturing similar magnitudes and patterns of variability in the monthly zonal mean specific humidity and interannual anomaly over annual and interannual timescales. The JPL and UCAR specific humidity climatologies differ by less than 15% (depending on location and pressure level), primarily due to differences in the retrieved refractivity. In the middle-to-upper troposphere, in all climate zones, JPL is the wettest of all data sets, AIRS is the driest of all data sets, and UCAR, ERA-Interim, and MERRA are in very good agreement, lying between the JPL and AIRS climatologies. In the lower-to-middle troposphere, we present a complex behavior of discrepancies, and we speculate that this might be due to convection and entrainment. Conclusively, the RO observations could potentially be used as a climate variable, but more thorough analysis is required to assess the structural uncertainty between centers and its origin.

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: The Two-season ACTPol Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect Selected Cluster Catalog	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						cosmology: large-scale structure of universe; cosmology: observations; galaxies: clusters: general	GALAXY CLUSTERS; X-RAY; MASS; IMPACT; CALIBRATION; REDSHIFTS; MERGERS; SAMPLE; SCALE; I.	We present a catalog of 182 galaxy clusters detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in a contiguous 987.5 deg(2) field. The clusters were detected as SZ decrements by applying a matched filter to 148 GHz maps that combine the original ACT equatorial survey with data from the first two observing seasons using the ACTPol receiver. Optical/IR confirmation and redshift measurements come from a combination of large public surveys and our own follow-up observations. Where necessary, we measured photometric redshifts for clusters using a pipeline that achieves accuracy Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.015 when tested on Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. Under the assumption that clusters can be described by the so-called universal pressure profile (UPP) and its associated mass scaling law, the full signal-to-noise ratio > 4 sample spans the mass range 1.6 < M-500c(UPP)/10(14) M-circle dot < 9.1, with median M-500c(UPP) = 3.1 x 10(14) M-circle dot. The sample covers the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.4 (median z = 0.49), and 28 clusters are new discoveries (median z = 0.80). We compare our catalog with other overlapping cluster samples selected using the SZ, optical, and X-ray wavelengths. We find that the ratio of the UPP-based SZ mass to richness-based weak-lensing mass is < M-500c(UPP)>/< M-500c(lambda WL)> = 0.68 +/- 0.11. After applying this calibration, the mass distribution for clusters with M-500c > 4 x 10(14) M-circle dot is consistent with the number of such clusters found in the South Pole Telescope SZ survey.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) finally answered this question by discovering a new dark vortex at 45 degrees south planetographic latitude, named SDS-2015 for "southern dark spot discovered in 2015." SDS-2015 is only the fifth dark vortex ever seen on Neptune. In this paper, we report on imaging of SDS-2015 using HST's Wide Field Camera 3 across four epochs: 2015 September, 2016 May, 2016 October, and 2017 October. We find that the size of SDS-2015 did not exceed 20 degrees of longitude, more than a factor of two smaller than the Voyager dark spots, but only slightly smaller than previous northern-hemisphere dark spots. A slow (1.7-2.5 deg/year) poleward drift was observed for the vortex. Properties of SDS-2015 and its surroundings suggest that the meridional wind shear may be twice as strong at the deep level of the vortex as it is at the level of cloud-tracked winds. Over the 2015-2017 period, the dark spot's contrast weakened from about -7% to about -3%, while companion clouds shifted from offset to centered, a similar evolution to some historical dark spots. The properties and evolution of SDS-2015 highlight the diversity of Neptune's dark spots and the need for faster cadence dark spot observations in the future.

In these areas, wetlands provide habitats for migratory birds and have a critical role in socio-ecological systems. Generally, in these areas, changing water-use patterns because of land-use change and water limitation because of climate change have led to the loss of wide areas of wetlands. Wetland restoration is suggested to restore the functions and values of wetlands that have been destroyed or affected by stresses. In this paper, a new application of wetland restoration prioritizing is introduced; restoration prioritizing to reduce the negative effects of drought. In this method, areas with the highest priority for restoration will be determined in a wetland destroyed because of water limitations. Multicriteria-spatial decision support system (MC-SDSS) was used to plan a scheme for Hamun wetlands restoration prioritizing in order to reduce the negative effects of drought and to restore the wetlands. This prioritization-determined areas that are valuable for Long-term water conservation, reduce the negative effects of dust storms and conserve water bird's habitats. This method was used in a wetland that is the only water resource in the middle of a wide arid plain. Because of water limitation, it is not possible to restore the hole wetland; therefore, different parts of this wetland were prioritized for restoration. Based on the results, it is possible to produce a model to determine which priority can be restored in each amount of water volume. In this way, it becomes clear for decision-makers to select areas for restoration in different volumes of water. The result of this study shows that since MC-SDSS decreases conflicts between alternatives in a decision-making process and uses their spatial situation, it is a preferred method to balance among conflicting goals. Furthermore, because spatial data are the most important parts of MC-SDSS, this paper shows the ability of remote sensing to be used in MC-SDSS method. It seems that in the future; remote sensing will have the most important role in MC-SDSS.

The strength and sensitivity of these couplings are not yet well known at the global scale, which contributes to uncertainty in predicting the terrestrial water and carbon budgets. We now have synchronous, global-scale satellite observations of critical terrestrial carbon and water cycle components: solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and soil moisture. We used these observations within the framework of a global terrestrial biosphere model (Simplified Simple Biosphere Model version 2.0, SSiB2) to investigate carbon-water coupling processes. We updated SSiB2 to include a mechanistic representation of SIF and tested the sensitivity of model parameters to improve the simulation of both SIF and soil moisture with the ultimate objective of improving the first-order terrestrial carbon component, gross primary production. Although several vegetation parameters, such as leaf area index and the green leaf fraction, improved the simulated SIF, and several soil parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity, improved simulated soil moisture, their effects were mainly limited to their respective cycles. One root-mean-square error parameter emerged as the key coupler between the carbon and water cycles: the wilting point. Updates to the wilting point significantly improved the simulations for SIF and gross primary production although substantial mismatches with the satellite data still existed. This study demonstrates the value of synchronous global measurements of the terrestrial carbon and water cycles in improving the understanding of coupled carbon-water cycles.

Magnetospheric considerations for solar system ice state	ICARUS			English	Article							WATER ICE; GALILEAN SATELLITES; CASSINI VIMS; SURFACE; EUROPA; CRYSTALLINE; ENCELADUS; ORIGIN; IRRADIATION; GANYMEDE	The current lattice configuration of the water ice on the surfaces of the inner satellites of Jupiter and Saturn is likely shaped by many factors. But laboratory experiments have found that energetic proton irradiation can cause a transition in the structure of pure water ice from crystalline to amorphous. It is not known to what extent this process is competitive with other processes in solar system contexts. For example, surface regions that are rich in water ice may be too warm for this effect to be important, even if the energetic proton bombardment rate is very high. In this paper, we make predictions, based on particle flux levels and other considerations, about where in the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn the similar to MeV proton irradiation mechanism should be most relevant. Our results support the conclusions of Hansen and McCord (2004), who related relative level of radiation on the three outer Galilean satellites to the amorphous ice content within the top 1 mm of surface. We argue here that if magnetospheric effects are considered more carefully, the correlation is even more compelling. Crystalline ice is by far the dominant ice state detected on the inner Saturnian satellites and, as we show here, the flux of bombarding energetic protons onto these bodies is much smaller than at the inner Jovian satellites. Therefore, the ice on the Saturnian satellites also corroborates the correlation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Paranicas, C.; Hibbitts, C.

The interferometric coherence has been restricted in the conventional damage-mapping approaches because the decorrelation sources are too complicated to interpret accurately and temporal decorrelation effects caused by slowly occurring natural changes and disaster events are often coupled together. To overcome these limitations, we formulate a coherence model that accounts for temporal decorrelation in two simplified layers, ground and volume layers, for long-temporal repeat-pass scenarios with zero spatial baseline. The model parameters include: 1) ground-to-volume ratio, a factor to determine the relative scattering contribution of ground and volume layers; 2) temporally correlated change, which captures the exponentially decaying behavior of coherence with time; and 3) temporally uncorrelated change, which is associated with random temporal changes. We estimate the model parameters in three steps: coherence optimization, interferometric pair-invariant parameter estimation, and interferometric pair-variant parameter estimation. To isolate the effects of disaster events from background natural changes, we calculate the probability density functions of historical change pixel by pixel and produce a probability map of damage. We tested the algorithm with uninhabited aerial vehicle data acquired from 2009 to 2015 for mapping the area damaged by the 2015 Lake Fire in California. Based on performance evaluation using receiver operating characteristic curves for optimized coherences and averaged probability maps, the proposed method reduced the false alarm from 0.25 to 0.07 when the probability of detection was 0.85 compared to coherence products alone.

Imaging Spectroscopy BRDF Correction for Mapping Louisiana's Coastal Ecosystems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG); bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); hyperspectral imaging; imaging spectroscopy; remote sensing	ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; WATER-QUALITY; RETRIEVAL; MANGROVE; DISCRIMINATION; REFLECTANCES; DERIVATION	This paper presents the adaptive reflectance geometric correction (ARGC), a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction algorithm to address intensity gradients across remotely sensed images. The ARGC is developed and tested on data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) collected over Louisiana's Atchafalaya River Delta, an area of complex wetland vegetation and waterbodies suited to AVIRIS-NG's fine spatial and spectral resolutions. Changing view and solar geometry, in conjunction with surfaces' anisotropic properties, impact a scene's observed reflectance. As traditional BRDF corrections may not be appropriate for wetland environments that have distinctive vegetation and hydrologic structures, more flexible functional corrections are shown to improve results. We compared two existing methods and the ARGC. The first method fits a quadratic function over image column averages, and the second is based on the inversion of the Ross Thick and Li Sparse kernels. Building upon the principles of these methods, the ARGC uses a multiple regression-based BRDF correction whereby the image's solar and view geometric descriptors form the independent variables. Each BRDF correction method was applied to the set of six partially overlapping AVIRIS-NG scenes. Assuming the actual surface reflectance of a given land cover type is independent of geometry, we used adjacent images' overlapping regions to quantitatively assess each correction method's efficacy. The ARGC produced the lowest overall root-mean-square difference and the lowest overlap mean absolute difference across the vast majority of bands. The ARGC is proposed as a practical new BRDF correction option for investigators using AVIRIS-NG data.

Unlike the previous diagnostic cloud-cover scheme (DIAGCS), PROGCS considers the formation and dissipation of cloud cover by physically connecting it to the cumulus convection and large-scale stratiform condensation processes. Our simulation results show that clouds in mid-high latitudes arise mainly from large-scale stratiform condensation processes, while cumulus convection and large-scale condensation processes jointly determine cloud cover in low latitudes. Compared with DIAGCS, PROGCS captures more consistent vertical distributions of cloud cover with the observations from Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) program at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site and simulates more realistic diurnal cycle of marine stratocumulus with the ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The low, high, and total cloud covers that are determined via PROGCS appear to be more realistic than those simulated via DIAGCS when both are compared with satellite retrievals though the former maintains slight negative biases. In addition, the simulations of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) from PROGCS runs have been considerably improved as well, resulting in less biases in radiative heating rates at heights below 850 hPa and above 400 hPa of GRAPES_GFS. Our results indicate that a prognostic method of cloud-cover calculation has significant advantage over the conventional diagnostic one, and it should be adopted in both weather and climate simulation and forecast.

Observation-Driven Estimation of the Spatial Variability of 20(th) Century Sea Level Rise	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						sea level; trends; 20th century	VERTICAL LAND MOTION; TIDE-GAUGE; REANALYSIS; TRENDS	Over the past two decades, sea level measurements made by satellites have given clear indications of both global and regional sea level rise. Numerous studies have sought to leverage the modern satellite record and available historic sea level data provided by tide gauges to estimate past sea level rise, leading to several estimates for the 20(th) century trend in global mean sea level in the range between 1 and 2 mm/yr. On regional scales, few attempts have been made to estimate trends over the same time period. This is due largely to the inhomogeneity and quality of the tide gauge network through the 20(th) century, which render commonly used reconstruction techniques inadequate. Here, a new approach is adopted, integrating data from a select set of tide gauges with prior estimates of spatial structure based on historical sea level forcing information from the major contributing processes over the past century. The resulting map of 20(th) century regional sea level rise is optimized to agree with the tide gauge-measured trends, and provides an indication of the likely contributions of different sources to regional patterns. Of equal importance, this study demonstrates the sensitivities of this regional trend map to current knowledge and uncertainty of the contributing processes.	[Hamlington, B.

Pancake Ice Thickness Mapping in the Beaufort Sea From Wave Dispersion Observed in SAR Imagery	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						pancake ice; COSMO-SkyMed; SAR imagery; wave dispersion in sea ice; Beaufort Sea	SOUTHERN-OCEAN; GREENLAND SEA; INVERSION; SPECTRA; FRAZIL; WATER	The early autumn voyage of RV Sikuliaq to the southern Beaufort Sea in 2015 offered very favorable opportunities for observing the properties and thicknesses of frazil-pancake ice types. The operational region was overlaid by a dense network of retrieved satellite imagery, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK). This enabled us to fully test and apply the SAR-waves technique, first developed by Wadhams and Holt (1991), for deriving the thickness of frazil-pancake icefields from changed wave dispersion. A line of subimages from a main SAR image (usually CSK) is analyzed running into the ice along the main wave direction. Each subimage is spectrally analyzed to yield a wave number spectrum, and the change in the shape of the spectrum between open water and ice, or between two thicknesses of ice, is interpreted in terms of the viscous equations governing wave propagation in frazil-pancake ice. For each of the case studies considered here, there was good or acceptable agreement on thickness between the extensive in situ observations and the SAR-wave calculation. In addition, the SAR-wave analysis gave, parametrically, effective viscosities for the ice covering a consistent and narrow range of 0.03-0.05 m(2) s(-1). Plain Language Summary It is known from work at open ocean boundaries such as Antarctica and the Greenland Sea that ocean waves interact with icefields to break up the ice and strip it away from the ice-water boundary, enhancing ice retreat. Also, in a wave field, new ice is forced to grow in the form of pancakes, an array of small cakes. The Beaufort Sea in late summer now counts as an open ocean boundary, and on the 2015 cruise of Sikuliaq it was found that vast fields of pancake ice were being created at the advancing edge as summer ended. We were able to map the thickness of these pancakes, and hence their contribution to the volume of the icefield, using a satellite technique developed by two of the authors in 1991. This uses synthetic aperture radar images of the ice to determine the frequency spectrum of wave energy, and since the speed of waves in ice depends on the frequency and the ice thickness, we can extract thicknesses from this analysis. The results were tested against direct measurements from the ship. This technique can be used worldwide to determine the overall contribution of pancake ice to the world's sea ice.

Intervals of Intense Energetic Electron Beams Over Jupiter's Poles	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						MeV electron beams; swirl region; Jupiter; Jovian aurora	POLAR-REGIONS; X-RAY; MAGNETOSPHERE; RADIATION; AURORA; JUNO/JEDI	Juno's Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument often detects energetic electron beams over Jupiter's polar regions. In this paper, we document a subset of intense magnetic field-aligned beams of energetic electrons moving away from Jupiter at high magnetic latitudes both north and south of the planet. The number fluxes of these beams are often dominated by electrons with energies above about 1MeV. These very narrow beams can create broad angular responses in the Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument with unique signatures in the detector count rates, probably because of >10MeV electrons. We use these signatures to identify the most intense beams. These beams occur primarily above the swirl region of the polar cap aurora. This polar region is described as being of low brightness and high absorption and the most magnetically "open" at Jupiter.	[Paranicas, C.; Mauk, B. H.; Haggerty, D.

The attitude control system, in particular, is closely tied to many critical spacecraft maneuvers and often drives science performance. Because of the central role attitude control plays, simulation and test capabilities are becoming increasingly important tools. Many air-bearing-based testbeds have been developed to provide hardware testing opportunities. However, relatively few of these small-satellite-focused testbeds address the simulation capabilities necessary to extend results obtained from the reduced-degree-of-freedom hardware environment to a reasonable prediction for a system's in-flight performance. This paper describes the simulation developed in NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Small Satellite Dynamics Testbed, which supports component-to-satellite level models and enables the simulation of dynamics in constrained air-bearing testbed and flight space environments. The paper addresses the simulator architecture, key software elements, the coordinate frames used by the tool, and the use of the simulator for predicting both ground and flight data. The paper then describes how the tool was validated against ground data collected on the testbed's air bearings at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and flight data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MicroMAS satellite.

We apply the method to confirm a sample of 88 clusters with redshifts 0.05 < z < 0.8 in the recently published 2RXS catalogue from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) over the 208 deg(2) region overlapped by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (DES-SV) data set. In our pilot study, we examine all X-ray sources, regardless of their extent. Our method employs a multicolour red sequence (RS) algorithm that incorporates the X-ray count rate and peak position in determining the region of interest for follow-up and extracts the positionally and colour-weighted optical richness lambda(MCMF) as a function of redshift for each source. Peaks in the lambda(MCMF)-redshift distribution are identified and used to extract photometric redshifts, richness and uncertainties. The significances of all optical counterparts are characterized using the distribution of richnesses defined along random lines of sight. These significances are used to extract cluster catalogues and to estimate the contamination by random superpositions of unassociated optical systems. The delivered photometric redshift accuracy is delta z/(1 + z) = 0.010. We find a well-defined X-ray luminosity-lambda(MCMF) relation with an intrinsic scatter of dln delta In(lambda(MCMF)|L-x) = 0.21. Matching our catalogue with the DES-SV redMaPPer catalogue yields good agreement in redshift and richness estimates; comparing our catalogue with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) selected clusters shows no inconsistencies. SPT clusters in our data set are consistent with the high-mass extension of the RASS-based lambda(MCMF)-mass relation.	[Klein, M.; Mohr, J. J.; Israel, H.; Dietrich, J.

Heavy X-ray obscuration in the most luminous galaxies discovered by WISE	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; DUST-OBSCURED GALAXIES; EXTREMELY RED QUASARS; INFRARED-SPECTRA; TYPE-1 QUASARS; COSMOS FIELD; AGN; LUMINOSITIES; TORI	Hot dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are hyperluminous (L8-1000 mu m > 10(13) L-circle dot) infrared galaxies with extremely high (up to hundreds of K) dust temperatures. The sources powering both their extremely high luminosities and dust temperatures are thought to be deeply buried and rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Hot DOGs could therefore represent a key evolutionary phase in which the SMBH growth peaks. X-ray observations can be used to study their obscuration levels and luminosities. In this work, we present the X-ray properties of the 20 most luminous (L-bol greater than or similar to 10(14) L-circle dot) known hot DOGs at z = 2-4.6. Five of them are covered by long-exposure (10-70 ks) Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, with three being X-ray detected, and we study their individual properties. One of these sources (W0116-0505) is a Compton-thick candidate, with column density N-H = (1.0-1.5) x 1024 cm(-2) derived from X-ray spectral fitting. The remaining 15 hot DOGs have been targeted by a Chandra snapshot (3.1 ks) survey. None of these 15 are individually detected; therefore, we applied a stacking analysis to investigate their average emission. From hardness ratio analysis, we constrained the average obscuring column density and intrinsic luminosity to be log N-H (cm(-2)) > 23.5 and L-X greater than or similar to 10(44) erg s(-1), which are consistent with results for individually detected sources. We also investigated the L-X-L-6 (mu m) and L-X-L-bol relations, finding hints that hot DOGs are typically X-ray weaker than expected, although larger samples of luminous obscured quasi-stellar objects are needed to derive solid conclusions.

An H-band Vector Vortex Coronagraph for the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics System	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						infrared: planetary systems; instrumentation: high angular resolution; planets and satellites: detection; techniques: high angular resolution	PHASE-MASK CORONAGRAPH; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM	The vector vortex is a coronagraphic imaging mode of the recently commissioned Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) platform on the 8 m Subaru Telescope. This multi-purpose high-contrast visible and near-infrared (R-to K-band) instrument is not only intended to serve as a VLT-class "planet-imager" instrument in the northern hemisphere, but also to operate as a technology demonstration testbed ahead of the ELTs-era, with a particular emphasis on small inner-working angle (IWA) coronagraphic capabilities. The given priority to small-IWA imaging led to the early design choice to incorporate focal-plane phase-mask coronagraphs. In this context, a test H-band vector vortex liquid crystal polymer waveplate was provided to SCExAO, to allow a one-to-one comparison of different small-IWA techniques on the same telescope instrument, before considering further steps. Here we present a detailed overview of the vector vortex coronagraph, from its installation and performances on the SCExAO optical bench, to the on-sky results in the extreme AO regime, as of late 2016/early 2017. To this purpose, we also provide a few recent on-sky imaging examples, notably high-contrast ADI detection of the planetary-mass companion.

Two instruments will be mounted on HyspIRl platform: 1) a hyperspectral instrument which can sense earth surface between 0.4 and 2.5 pm at 10 nm intervals and 2) a multispectral infrared sensor will acquire images between 3 and 12 pm in eight spectral bands (one in Mid infrared (MIR) and seven in Thermal Infrared (TIR)). The TIR spectral wavebands will be positioned based on their importance in various applications. This study aimed to identify HyspIRI optimal TIR wavebands position for earth compositional mapping. A Genetic Algorithm coupled with the Spectral Angle Mapper (GA-SAM) was used as a spectral bands selector. High dimensional HyTES (Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer) emissivity spectra comprised of 202 spectral bands of Cuprite and Death Valley regions were used to select meaningful subsets of bands for earth compositional mapping. The GA-SAM was trained for fifteen mineral classes and the algorithms were run iteratively 50 times. High calibration ( > 95%) and validation ( > 90%) accuracies were achieved with a limited number (seven) of spectral bands selected by GA-SAM. The knowledge of important band positions will help the scientists of the HyspIRI group to place spectral bands in regions where accuracies of earth compositional mapping can be enhanced.

In Hampton Roads, the Intergovernmental Pilot Project's Scientific Advisory Committee recommended an integrated network of ocean, earth, and atmospheric data collection from both private and public sector organizations that engage in active scientific monitoring and observing. Since its establishment, the network has grown to include monitoring of water levels, land subsidence, wave measurements, current measurements, and atmospheric conditions. High-resolution land elevation and land cover data sets have also been developed. These products have been incorporated into a number of portals and integrated tools to help support resilience planning. Significant challenges to building the network included establishing consistent data standards across organizations to allow for the integration of the data into multiple, unique products and funding the expansion of the network components. Recommendations to the network development in Hampton Roads include the need to continue to support and expand the publicly available network of sensors; enhance integration between ocean, earth, and atmospheric networks; and improve shallow water bathymetry data used in spatial flooding models.

The ongoing HSC-SSP survey will uncover thousands of galaxy clusters to z less than or similar to 1.5. In deriving cluster masses viaWL, a critical source of systematics is contamination and dilution of the lensing signal by cluster members, and by foreground galaxies whose photometric redshifts are biased. Using the first-year CAMIRA catalog of similar to 900 clusters with richness larger than 20 found in similar to 140 deg(2) of HSC-SSP data, we devise and compare several source selection methods, including selection in color-color space (CC-cut), and selection of robust photometric redshifts by applying constraints on their cumulative probability distribution function (P-cut). We examine the dependence of the contamination on the chosen limits adopted for each method. Using the proper limits, these methods give mass profiles with minimal dilution in agreement with one another. We find that not adopting either the CC-cut or P-cut methods results in an underestimation of the total cluster mass (13% +/- 4%) and the concentration of the profile (24% +/- 11%). The level of cluster contamination can reach as high as similar to 10% at R approximate to 0.24 Mpc/ h for low-z clusters without cuts, while employing either the P-cut or CC-cut results in cluster contamination consistent with zero to within the 0.5% uncertainties. Our robust methods yield a similar to 60 sigma detection of the stacked CAMIRA surface mass density profile, with a mean mass of M-200c = [1.67 +/- 0.05(stat)] x 10(14) M-circle dot/h.

We seek to classify them and look toward how the future study of these minerals will enhance our understanding of this planetary body. The classification uses the basis of intermolecular interactions, with the materials grouped into "Molecular solids," "Molecular co-crystals," and "Hydrates" classes alongside speculation on other possible classes of potential Titan minerals.

Transformation of Deep Water Masses Along Lagrangian Upwelling Pathways in the Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Southern Ocean; upwelling; Lagrangian; water mass transformation; mixing; topography	OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; GLOBAL CONVEYOR; NEUTRAL DENSITY; STATE ESTIMATE; INVERSE METHOD; DRAKE PASSAGE; TURBULENCE; PROFILES; DEPTHS; MODELS	Upwelling of northern deep waters in the Southern Ocean is fundamentally important for the closure of the global meridional overturning circulation and delivers carbon and nutrient-rich deep waters to the sea surface. We quantify water mass transformation along upwelling pathways originating in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific and ending at the surface of the Southern Ocean using Lagrangian trajectories in an eddy-permitting ocean state estimate. Recent related work shows that upwelling in the interior below about 400 m depth is localized at hot spots associated with major topographic features in the path of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, while upwelling through the surface layer is more broadly distributed. In the ocean interior upwelling is largely isopycnal; Atlantic and to a lesser extent Indian Deep Waters cool and freshen while Pacific deep waters are more stable, leading to a homogenization of water mass properties. As upwelling water approaches the mixed layer, there is net strong transformation toward lighter densities due to mixing of freshwater, but there is a divergence in the density distribution as Upper Circumpolar Deep Water tends become lighter and dense Lower Circumpolar Deep Water tends to become denser. The spatial distribution of transformation shows more rapid transformation at eddy hot spots associated with major topography where density gradients are enhanced; however, the majority of cumulative density change along trajectories is achieved by background mixing. We compare the Lagrangian analysis to diagnosed Eulerian water mass transformation to attribute the mechanisms leading to the observed transformation.	[Tamsitt, V.; Mazloff, M. R.; Talley, L.

Defined as the wavelength with equal balanced and unbalanced motion kinetic energy (KE) spectral density, L-t is detected to be geographically highly inhomogeneous: it falls below 40 km in the western boundary current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current regions, increases to 40-100 km in the interior subtropical and subpolar gyres, and exceeds, in general, 200 km in the tropical oceans. With the exception of the Pacific and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, the seasonal KE fluctuations of the surface balanced and unbalanced motions are out of phase because of the occurrence of mixed layer instability in winter and trapping of unbalanced motion KE in shallow mixed layer in summer. The combined effect of these seasonal changes renders L-t to be 20 km during winter in 80% of the Northern Hemisphere oceans between 25 degrees and 45 degrees N and all of the Southern Hemisphere oceans south of 25 degrees S. The transition scale's geographical and seasonal changes are highly relevant to the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. To improve the detection of balanced submesoscale signals from SWOT, especially in the tropical oceans, efforts to remove stationary internal tidal signals are called for.

An Experimental Scattering Matrix for Lunar Regolith Simulant JSC-1A at Visible Wavelengths	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						Moon; polarization; scattering	LIGHT-SCATTERING; PARTICLES; DATABASE; SHAPE	We present the experimental scattering matrix as a function of the scattering angle of the lunar soil simulant JSC-1A. The measurements were performed at 488, 520, and 647 nm, covering the range of scattering angles from 3 degrees to 177 degrees. The effect of sub-micron-sized particles on the measured phase function and degree of linear polarization has been studied. After removing particles smaller than a 1 mu m radius, the forward-scattering peak becomes steeper. Furthermore, the maximum of the degree of linear polarization increases, moving toward smaller scattering angles. Interestingly, the negative branch in the backward direction disappears as the small particles are removed from the sample. Because multiple scattering calculations with polarization included require single scattering matrices throughout the scattering range (from 0 degrees to 180 degrees), we computed the corresponding synthetic scattering matrix through an extrapolation method, considering theoretical boundary conditions. From the extrapolated results, the asymmetry parameter g and the back-scattering linear depolarization factor delta(L) were computed.

The NuSTAR Extragalactic Surveys: Source Catalog and the Compton-thick Fraction in the UDS Field	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; X-rays: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; HEAVILY OBSCURED QUASARS; RAY LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; SWIFT-BAT SURVEY; DEEP SURVEY; NUMBER COUNTS; SKY SURVEY; CHANDRA; AGNS	We present the results and the source catalog of the NuSTAR survey in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) field, bridging the gap in depth and area between NuSTAR's ECDFS and COSMOS surveys. The survey covers a similar to 0.6 deg(2) area of the field for a total observing time of similar to 1.75 Ms, to a half-area depth of similar to 155 ks corrected for vignetting at 3-24 keV, and reaching sensitivity limits at half-area in the full (3-24 keV), soft (3-8 keV), and hard (8-24 keV) bands of 2.2 x 10(-14) erg cm(-2) s(-1), 1.0 x 10(-14) erg cm(-2) s(-1), and 2.7 x 10(-14) erg cm(-2) s(-1), respectively. A total of 67 sources are detected in at least one of the three bands, 56 of which have a robust optical redshift with a median of < z > similar to 1.1. Through a broadband (0.5-24 keV) spectral analysis of the whole sample combined with the NuSTAR hardness ratios, we compute the observed Compton-thick (CT; N-H > 10(24) cm(-2)) fraction. Taking into account the uncertainties on each N-H measurement, the final number of CT sources is 6.8 +/- 1.2. This corresponds to an observed CT fraction of 11.5% +/- 2.0%, providing a robust lower limit to the intrinsic fraction of CT active galactic nuclei and placing constraints on cosmic X-ray background synthesis models.

The resulting velocity map reveals (1) a velocity gradient across the Altyn Tagh fault, (2) a sharp velocity change along a structure following the base of the alluvial fans in southern Tarim, and (3) a broad velocity gradient, following the Jinsha suture. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar velocity field is combined with published GPS data to constrain the geometry and slip rates of a fault model consisting of a vertical fault plane under the Altyn Tagh fault and a shallow flat decollement ending in a steeper ramp on the Tarim side. The solutions converge toward 0.7 mm/yr of pure thrusting on the decollement-ramp system and 10.5 mm/yr of left-lateral strike-slip movement on the Altyn Tagh fault, below a 17 km locking depth. A simple elastic dislocation model across the Jinsha suture shows that data are consistent with 4-8 mm/yr of left-lateral shear across this structure. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar processing steps include implementing a stepwise unwrapping method starting with high-quality interferograms to assist in unwrapping noisier interferograms, iteratively estimating long-wavelength spatial ramps, and referencing all interferograms to bedrock pixels surrounding sedimentary basins. A specific focus on atmospheric delay estimation using the ERA-Interim model decreases the uncertainty on the velocity across the Tibet border by a factor of 2.

Additionally, the common practice of representing boundary-layer turbulence, shallow convection, and deep convection by discontinuously different parameterizations schemes, each with its own set of parameters, has contributed to the proliferation of adjustable parameters in large-scale models. Here we lay the theoretical foundations for an extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme that has explicit time-dependence and memory of subgrid-scale variables and is designed to represent all subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, from boundary layer dynamics to deep convection, in a unified manner. Coherent up and downdrafts in the scheme are represented as prognostic plumes that interact with their environment and potentially with each other through entrainment and detrainment. The more isotropic turbulence in their environment is represented through diffusive fluxes, with diffusivities obtained from a turbulence kinetic energy budget that consistently partitions turbulence kinetic energy between plumes and environment. The cross-sectional area of up and downdrafts satisfies a prognostic continuity equation, which allows the plumes to cover variable and arbitrarily large fractions of a large-scale grid box and to have life cycles governed by their own internal dynamics. Relatively simple preliminary proposals for closure parameters are presented and are shown to lead to a successful simulation of shallow convection, including a time-dependent life cycle.

Exploring the science trade space with the JPL Innovation Foundry A-Team	CONCURRENT ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						innovation foundry; science; concept maturity levels; formulation; innovation		The Jet Propulsion Laboratory Innovation Foundry has established a new approach for exploring, developing, and evaluating early concepts with a group called the Architecture Team. The Architecture Team combines innovative collaborative methods and facilitated sessions with subject matter experts and analysis tools to help mature mission concepts. Science, implementation, and programmatic elements are all considered during an A-Team study. In these studies, Concept Maturity Levels are used to group methods. These levels include idea generation and capture (Concept Maturity Level 1), initial feasibility assessment (Concept Maturity Level 2), and trade space exploration (Concept Maturity Level 3). Methods used for exploring the science objectives, feasibility, and scope will be described including the use of a new technique for understanding the most compelling science, called a Science Return Diagram. In the process of developing the Science Return Diagram, gradients in the science trade space are uncovered along with their implications for implementation and mission architecture. Special attention is paid toward developing complete investigations, establishing a series of logical claims that lead to the natural selection of a measurement approach. Over 20 science-focused A-Team studies have used these techniques to help science teams refine their mission objectives, make implementation decisions, and reveal the mission concept's most compelling science. This article will describe the A-Team process for exploring the mission concept's science trade space and the Science Return Diagram technique.

Automated Classification to Improve the Efficiency of Weeding Library Collections	JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP			English	Article							PUBLIC-LIBRARY; DESELECTION	Previous studies have shown that weeding a library collection benefits patrons and increases circulation rates. However, the time required to review the collection and make weeding decisions presents a formidable obstacle. This study empirically evaluated methods for automatically classifying weeding candidates. A data set containing 80,346 items from a large-scale weeding project running from 2011 to 2014 at Wesleyan University was used to train six machine learning classifiers to predict a weeding decision of either 'Keep' or 'Weed' for each candidate. The study found statistically significant agreement (p = 0.001) between classifier predictions and librarian judgments for all classifier types. The naive Bayes and linear support vector machine classifiers had the highest recall (fraction of items weeded by librarians that were identified by the algorithm), while the k -nearest neighbor classifier had the highest precision (fraction of recommended candidates that librarians had chosen to weed). The variables found to be most relevant were: librarian and faculty votes for retention, item age, and the presence of copies in other libraries.

This work presents a method for optimizing the sampling of ocean fronts with autonomous vehicles at meso-and submesoscales, based on a combination of numerical forecast and autonomous planning. This method uses a 48-h forecast from a real-time high-resolution data-assimilative primitive equation ocean model, feature detection techniques, and a planner that controls the observing platform. The method is tested in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California, during a 9-day experiment focused on sampling subsurface thermohaline-compensated structures using a Seaglider as the ocean observing platform. Based on model estimations, the sampling "gain,'' defined as the magnitude of isopycnal tracer variability sampled, is 50% larger in the feature-chasing case with respect to a non-feature-tracking scenario. The ability of the model to reproduce, in space and time, thermohaline submesoscale features is evaluated by quantitatively comparing the model and glider results. The model reproduces the vertical (similar to 50-200 m thick) and lateral (similar to 5-20 km) scales of subsurface subducting fronts and near-bottom features observed in the glider data. The differences between model and glider data are, in part, attributed to the selected glider optimal interpolation parameters and to uncertainties in the forecasting of the location of the structures. This method can be exported to any place in the ocean where high-resolution data-assimilative model output is available, and it allows for the incorporation of multiple observing platforms.

Atmospheric reconnaissance of the habitable-zone Earth-sized planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							ULTRACOOL DWARF STAR; EXOPLANET; SPECTROSCOPY; MASS	Seven temperate Earth-sized exoplanets readily amenable for atmospheric studies transit the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 (refs (1,2)). Their atmospheric regime is unknown and could range from extended primordial hydrogen-dominated to depleted atmospheres(3-6). Hydrogen in particular is a powerful greenhouse gas that may prevent the habitability of inner planets while enabling the habitability of outer ones(6-8). An atmosphere largely dominated by hydrogen, if cloud-free, should yield prominent spectroscopic signatures in the near-infrared detectable during transits. Observations of the innermost planets have ruled out such signatures(9). However, the outermost planets are more likely to have sustained such a Neptune-like atmosphere(10,11). Here, we report observations for the four planets within or near the system's habitable zone, the circumstellar region where liquid water could exist on a planetary surface(12-14). These planets do not exhibit prominent spectroscopic signatures at near-infrared wavelengths either, which rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f, with significance of 8s, 6s and 4s, respectively. Such an atmosphere is instead not excluded for planet g. As high-altitude clouds and hazes are not expected in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres around planets with such insolation(15,16), these observations further support their terrestrial and potentially habitable nature.

The wavelet transform modulus maxima segmentation method is adapted and tailored to extract Airy-like diffraction disks, which represent bacteria, from DHM time series. In this exploratory analysis, the method shows potential for estimating bacterial tracks in low particle-density time series, based on a preliminary analysis of both living and dead Serratia marcescens, and for rapidly providing a single-bit answer to whether a sample chamber contains living or dead microbes or is empty.

Nature, formation, and distribution of carbonates on Ceres	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SODIUM-SALTS; SURFACE; ASSEMBLAGES; DEPOSITS; BRUCITE	Different carbonates have been detected on Ceres, and their abundance and spatial distribution have been mapped using a visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), the Dawn imaging spectrometer. Carbonates are abundant and ubiquitous across the surface, but variations in the strength and position of infrared spectral absorptions indicate variations in the composition and amount of these minerals. Mg-Ca carbonates are detected all over the surface, but localized areas show Na carbonates, such as natrite (Na2CO3) and hydrated Na carbonates (for example, Na2CO3 center dot H2O). Their geological settings and accessory NH4-bearing phases suggest the upwelling, excavation, and exposure of salts formed from Na-CO3-NH4-Cl brine solutions at multiple locations across the planet. The presence of the hydrated carbonates indicates that their formation/exposure on Ceres' surface is geologically recent and dehydration to the anhydrous form (Na2CO3) is ongoing, implying a still-evolving body.

Variations in the amount of water ice on Ceres' surface suggest a seasonal water cycle	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; DEPOSITS	The dwarf planet Ceres is known to host a considerable amount of water in its interior, and areas of water ice were detected by the Dawn spacecraft on its surface. Moreover, sporadic water and hydroxyl emissions have been observed from space telescopes. We report the detection of water ice in a mid-latitude crater and its unexpected variation with time. The Dawn spectrometer data show a change of water ice signatures over a period of 6 months, which is well modeled as similar to 2-km(2) increase of water ice. The observed increase, coupled with Ceres' orbital parameters, points to an ongoing process that seems correlated with solar flux. The reported variation on Ceres' surface indicates that this body is chemically and physically active at the present time.

Hydrogen Dimers in Giant-planet Infrared Spectra	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						molecular data; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; radiative transfer; techniques: spectroscopic	ROTOTRANSLATIONAL ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; COLLISION-INDUCED ABSORPTION; TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES; MIDINFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; SPACE-TELESCOPE; OUTER PLANETS; SATURN; JUPITER; VOYAGER; PAIRS	Despite being one of the weakest dimers in nature, low-spectral-resolution Voyager/IRIS observations revealed the presence of (H-2)(2) dimers on Jupiter and Saturn in the 1980s. However, the collision-induced H-2-H-2 opacity databases widely used in planetary science have thus far only included free-to-free transitions and have neglected the contributions of dimers. Dimer spectra have both fine-scale structure near the S(0) and S(1) quadrupole lines (354 and 587 cm(-1), respectively), and broad continuum absorption contributions up to +/- 50 cm(-1) from the line centers. We develop a new ab initio model for the free-to-bound, bound-to-free, and bound-to-bound transitions of the hydrogen dimer for a range of temperatures (40-400 K) and para-hydrogen fractions (0.25-1.0). The model is validated against low-temperature laboratory experiments, and used to simulate the spectra of the giant planets. The new collision-induced opacity database permits high-resolution (0.5-1.0 cm(-1)) spectral modeling of dimer spectra near S(0) and S(1) in both Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer observations of Jupiter and Saturn, and in Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) observations of Uranus and Neptune for the first time. Furthermore, the model reproduces the dimer signatures observed in Voyager/IRIS data near S(0) on Jupiter and Saturn, and generally lowers the amount of para-H-2 (and the extent of disequilibrium) required to reproduce IRIS observations.

A Comparative Study of Atmospheric Moisture Recycling Rate between Observations and Models	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							CLIMATOLOGY PROJECT GPCP; PRECIPITATION; CYCLE; VARIABILITY; CMIP5; CIRCULATION; ALGORITHM; DECADES; ITCZ	Precipitation and column water vapor data from 13 CMIP5 models and observational datasets are used to analyze atmospheric moisture recycling rate from 1988 to 2008. The comparisons between observations and model simulations suggest that most CMIP5 models capture two main characteristics of the recycling rate: 1) long-term decreasing trend of the global-average maritime recycling rate (atmospheric recycling rate over ocean within 608S-608N) and 2) dominant spatial patterns of the temporal variations of the recycling rate (i.e., increasing in the intertropical convergence zone and decreasing in subtropical regions). All models, except one, successfully simulate not only the long-term trend but also the interannual variability of column water vapor. The simulations of precipitation are relatively poor, especially over the relatively short time scales, which lead to the discrepancy of the recycling rate between observations and the CMIP5 models. Comparisons of spatial patterns also suggest that the CMIP5 models simulate column water vapor better than precipitation. The comparative studies indicate the scope of improvement in the simulations of precipitation, especially for the relatively short-time-scale variations, to better simulate the recycling rate of atmospheric moisture, an important indicator of climate change.

The rotational elements of the bodies are the right ascension and declination of the rotation axis in the International Celestial Reference Frame and the rotation angle, W, measured easterly along the body's equator. The IAU specifies the location of the body's prime meridian by providing a value for W at epoch J2000. We provide new trigonometric series representations of the rotational elements of Mars and its satellites, Phobos and Deimos. The series for Mars are from a least squares fit to the rotation model used to orient the Martian gravity field. The series for the satellites are from a least squares fit to rotation models developed in accordance with IAU conventions from recent ephemerides.	[Jacobson, R. A.; Konopliv, A. S.; Park, R.

Evaluation of supercapacitors for space applications under thermal vacuum conditions	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Supercapacitor; Ultracapacitor; Double-layer capacitor; Electrochemical capacitor; Thermal vacuum testing; Space power		Commercially available supercapacitor cells from three separate vendors were evaluated for use in a space environment using thermal vacuum (Tvac) testing. Standard commercial cells are not hermetically sealed, but feature crimp or double seam seals between the header and the can, which may not maintain an adequate seal under vacuum. Cells were placed in a small vacuum chamber, and cycled between three separate temperature set points. Charging and discharging of cells was executed following each temperature soak, to confirm there was no significant impact on performance. A final electrical performance check, visual inspection and mass check following testing were also performed, to confirm the integrity of the cells had not been compromised during exposure to thermal cycling under vacuum. All cells tested were found to survive this testing protocol and exhibited no significant impact on electrical performance.

Improving MISR AOD Retrievals With Low-Light-Level Corrections for Veiling Light	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Air pollution; remote sensing; spectroradiometers; stray light	AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MISR; UNIFIED SATELLITE CLIMATOLOGY; MARKOV-CHAIN FORMALISM; MODIS; AERONET; PRODUCTS; CALIBRATION; ALGORITHM; NETWORK	Operational retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data have been shown to have a high bias in pristine oceanic areas. One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22. The best performing set will be implemented operationally in the next V23 MISR AOD product release.

This event will provide researchers with a unique opportunity to study the effects of tidal forces experienced by an asteroid during a close encounter with a terrestrial planet. Binzel et al. predicted that close flybys of terrestrial planets by NEAs would cause resurfacing of their regolith due to seismic shaking. In this work, we present the best pre-encounter near-infrared spectra of Apophis obtained so far. These new data were obtained during the 2013 apparition using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We found that our spectral data is consistent with previous observations by Binzel et al. but with a much higher signal-to-noise ratio. Spectral band parameters were extracted from the spectra and were used to determine the composition of the asteroid. Using a naive Bayes classifier, we computed the likelihood of Apophis being an LL chondrite to be >99% based on mol% of Fa versus Fs. Using the same method, we estimated a probability of 89% for Apophis being an LL chondrite based on ol/(ol+px) and Fs. The results from the dynamical model indicate that the most likely source region for Apophis is the nu(6) resonance in the inner main belt. Data presented in this study (especially Band I depth) could serve as a baseline to verify seismic shaking during the 2029 encounter.

Cloud and radiative heating profiles associated with the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						BSISO; Radiative heating; Cloud water; Precipitation; Asian monsoon; Predictability	NORTHWARD; TRMM; BUDGET	The cloud water content (CW) and radiative heating rate (QR) structures related to northward propagating boreal summer intraseasonal oscillations (BSISOs) are analyzed using data from A-train satellites in conjunction with the ERA-Interim reanalysis. It is found that the northward movement of CW- and QR anomalies are closely synchronized with the northward movement of BSISO precipitation maxima. Commensurate with the northward propagating BSISO precipitation maxima, the CW anomalies exhibit positive ice (liquid) CW maxima in the upper (middle/low) troposphere with a prominent tilting structure in which the low-tropospheric (upper-tropospheric) liquid (ice) CW maximum leads (lags) the BSISO precipitation maximum. The BSISO-related shortwave heating (QSW) heats (cools) the upper (low) troposphere; the longwave heating (QLW) cools (heats) the upper (middle/low) troposphere. The resulting net radiative heating (QRN), being dominated by QLW, cools (heats) the atmosphere most prominently above the 200 hPa level (below the 600 hPa level). Enhanced clouds in the upper and middle troposphere appears to play a critical role in increasing low-level QLW and QRN.

Driven by increasingly complex science questions, space radar missions have grown ever more sophisticated with costs rising often to hundreds of millions of dollars. At the other end of the cost and complexity spectrum, CubeSats have emerged in recent years as a disruptive innovation in the satellite sector and are now considered a means to address targeted science questions in a rapid and affordable manner. CubeSats enable new kinds of constellation-based Earth science observations not previously affordable with traditional spacecraft. Constellations of low-cost sensors provide both global spatial and high temporal coverage. As such, CubeSats are not only viable platforms to address current Earth science goals, but they also open a new realm of possibilities for science advancement and unique applications. Radar instruments have often been regarded as unsuitable for small satellite platforms due to their traditionally large size, weight, and power (SWaP). Burgeoning missions such as Radar in a CubeSat (RainCube) and CubeSat Imaging Radar for Earth Science (CIRES), being developed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory and SRI International, respectively, and funded by NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO), are slated to dispel this notion. The key to the simplification and miniaturization of the radar subsystems in a manner that still offers compelling science and applications is 1) component technological advancement; and 2) an integrated instrument architecture and mission design that exploits the capabilities offered by CubeSat platforms. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art and future developments of CubeSat radar missions for Earth remote sensing and the implications for NASA's current and future Earth Science program. The key enabling technologies for radio frequency (RF), digital, and antennas are surveyed, as well as the evolution of the CubeSat avionics, in the aspects that mostly impact radar development, namely power, volume, and attitude control and knowledge and precision orbit determination (POD). We investigate various radar applications that could benefit from low-cost CubeSat platforms, such as altimetry, sounding, precipitation profiling, scatterometry, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and interferometric SAR (InSAR). We also explore the science motivation and impact of future missions that are based on these technological advancements.

Energy Storage Technologies for Small Satellite Applications	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Batteries; CubeSat; energy storage; hybrid battery; Lithium-ion; supercapacitors	BATTERY	Rapid advances in small satellite (often referred to as CubeSats) technology are providing opportunities for space exploration to a wide range of users (in particular universities) at substantially reduced costs. Many of the capabilities provided by larger satellites and spacecraft (>2000 kg) are now available through small satellite technologies. Ongoing improvements in attitude control, propulsion, advanced communications, and scientific instrumentation continue to enhance their benefits, even within such strict volume and mass constraints. With such advances in CubeSat technologies, the power and energy demands have also increased dramatically, necessitating the need for larger deployable solar arrays, lower power electronics, efficient energy storage systems, and even energy transfer/harvesting systems. In terms of energy storage, more advanced battery chemistries with higher energy densities and higher power capabilities over a wider operating temperature range are also a fundamental need. There already exist today numerous commercially available energy storage options suitable for CubeSat applications, although many missions rely on custom designs. Similar to standard satellite design, the selection of an appropriate energy storage system is driven by mission requirements related to power, energy, and lifetime. This paper will provide a general review of performance capabilities of state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technologies, as well as other advanced energy storage systems for small satellite applications.

A Gaussian Mixture Model for Nulling Pulsars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; pulsars: general		The phenomenon of pulsar nulling-where pulsars occasionally turn off for one or more pulses-provides insight into pulsar-emission mechanisms and the processes by which pulsars turn off when they cross the "death line." However, while ever more pulsars are found that exhibit nulling behavior, the statistical techniques used to measure nulling are biased, with limited utility and precision. In this paper, we introduce an improved algorithm, based on Gaussian mixture models, for measuring pulsar nulling behavior. We demonstrate this algorithm on a number of pulsars observed as part of a larger sample of nulling pulsars, and show that it performs considerably better than existing techniques, yielding better precision and no bias. We further validate our algorithm on simulated data. Our algorithm is widely applicable to a large number of pulsars even if they do not show obvious nulls. Moreover, it can be used to derive nulling probabilities of nulling for individual pulses, which can be used for in-depth studies.	[Kaplan, D. L.; Swiggum, J. K.; Fichtenbauer, T. D.

Widespread distribution of OH/H2O on the lunar surface inferred from spectral data	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							MAGNETIC-ANOMALIES; EMISSION-SPECTRA; REMOTE DETECTION; WATER; MOON; MINERALOGY; REFLECTANCE; TOPOGRAPHY; ROUGHNESS; HYDROXYL	Remote-sensing data from lunar orbiters have revealed spectral features consistent with the presence of OH or H2O on the lunar surface. Analyses of data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper spectrometer onboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft have suggested that OH/H2O is recycled on diurnal timescales and persists only at high latitudes. However, the spatial distribution and temporal variability of the OH/H2O, as well as its source, remain uncertain. Here we incorporate a physics-based thermal correction into analysis of reflectance spectra from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper and find that prominent absorption features consistent with OH/H2O can be present at all latitudes, local times and surface types examined. This suggests the widespread presence of OH/H2O on the lunar surface without significant diurnal migration. We suggest that the spectra are consistent with the production of OH in space-weathered materials by the solar wind implantation of H+ and formation of OH at crystal defect sites, as opposed to H2O sourced from the lunar interior. Regardless of the specific composition or formation mechanism, we conclude that OH/H2O can be present on the Moon under thermal conditions more wide-ranging than previously recognized.

This method is predicated on using microwaves to image changes in the dielectric properties of tissue with changing temperature. Instead of the precomputed linear Born approximation that was used in prior work to speed up the frame-to-frame inversions, here we use the nonlinear distorted Born iterative method (DBIM) to solve the electric volume integral equation (VIE) to image the temperature change. This is made possible by using a recently developed graphic processing unit accelerated conformal finite difference time domain method to solve the forward problem and update the electric field in the monitored region in each DBIM iteration. Compared to our previous work, this approach provides a far superior approximation of the electric field within the VIE, and thus yields a more accurate reconstruction of tissue temperature change. The proposed method is validated using a realistic numerical model of interstitial thermal therapy for a deep-seated brain lesion. With the new DBIM, we reduced the average estimation error of the mean temperature within the region of interest from 2.5 degrees to 1.0 degrees for the noise-free case, and from 2.9 degrees to 1.7 degrees for the 2% background noise case.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						evolution; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules	EMISSION-ABSORPTION OBSERVATIONS; SENSITIVITY HI SURVEY; LINE SURVEY; CLOUDS; DUST; EXCITATION; HYDROXYL; CIRRUS; WARM; SKY	Hydroxyl (OH) is expected to be abundant in diffuse interstellar molecular gas because it forms along with H-2 under similar conditions and forms within a similar extinction range. We have analyzed absorption measurements of OH at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz toward 44 extragalactic continuum sources, together with the J = 1-0 transitions of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, and (CO)-O-18, and the J = 2-1 transition of (CO)-C-12. The excitation temperatures of OH were found to follow a modified lognormal distribution f(T-ex) proportional to 1/root 2 pi sigma exp [-[ln(T-ex) - ln(3.4 K)(2)]/2 sigma(2)], the peak of which is close to the temperature of the Galactic emission background (CMB+ synchrotron). In fact, 90% of the OH has excitation temperatures within 2 K of the Galactic background at the same location, providing a plausible explanation for the apparent difficulty of mapping this abundant molecule in emission. The opacities of OH were found to be small and to peak around 0.01. For gas at intermediate extinctions (A(V) similar to 0.05-2 mag), the detection rate of OH with a detection limit N(OH) similar or equal to 10(12) cm(-2) is approximately independent of A(V). We conclude that OH is abundant in the diffuse molecular gas and OH absorption is a good tracer of "dark molecular gas (DMG)." The measured fraction of DMG depends on the assumed detection threshold of the CO data set. The next generation of highly sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes, such as FAST and SKA, will make feasible the systematic inventory of diffuse molecular gas through decomposing, in velocity, the molecular (e.g., OH and CH) absorption profiles toward background continuum sources with numbers exceeding what is currently available by orders of magnitude.

Report of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements: 2015	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Cardinal directions; Cartographic coordinates; Coordinate systems; Coordinate frames; Longitude; Latitude; Planetographic; Planetocentric; Rotation axes; Rotation periods; Sizes; Shapes; Planets; Satellites; Dwarf planets; Minor planets; Asteroids; Comets	PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; GRAVITY-FIELD; GLOBAL SHAPE; SPIN POLE; SATELLITES; PLANETS; ORIENTATION; PERIOD; SIZE	This report continues the practice where the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements revises recommendations regarding those topics for the planets, satellites, minor planets, and comets approximately every 3 years. The Working Group has now become a "functional working group" of the IAU, and its membership is open to anyone interested in participating. We describe the procedure for submitting questions about the recommendations given here or the application of these recommendations for creating a new or updated coordinate system for a given body. Regarding body orientation, the following bodies have been updated: Mercury, based on MESSENGER results; Mars, along with a refined longitude definition; Phobos; Deimos; (1) Ceres; (52) Europa; (243) Ida; (2867) Steins; Neptune; (134340) Pluto and its satellite Charon; comets 9P/Tempel 1, 19P/Borrelly, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and 103P/Hartley 2, noting that such information is valid only between specific epochs. The special challenges related to mapping 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are also discussed. Approximate expressions for the Earth have been removed in order to avoid confusion, and the low precision series expression for the Moon's orientation has been removed. The previously online only recommended orientation model for (4) Vesta is repeated with an explanation of how it was updated. Regarding body shape, text has been included to explain the expected uses of such information, and the relevance of the cited uncertainty information. The size of the Sun has been updated, and notation added that the size and the ellipsoidal axes for the Earth and Jupiter have been recommended by an IAU Resolution. The distinction of a reference radius for a body (here, the Moon and Titan) is made between cartographic uses, and for orthoprojection and geophysical uses. The recommended radius for Mercury has been updated based on MESSENGER results. The recommended radius for Titan is returned to its previous value. Size information has been updated for 13 other Saturnian satellites and added for Aegaeon. The sizes of Pluto and Charon have been updated. Size information has been updated for (1) Ceres and given for (16) Psyche and (52) Europa. The size of (25143) Itokawa has been corrected. In addition, the discussion of terminology for the poles (hemispheres) of small bodies has been modified and a discussion on cardinal directions added. Although they continue to be used for planets and their satellites, it is assumed that the planetographic and planetocentric coordinate system definitions do not apply to small bodies. However, planetocentric and planetodetic latitudes and longitudes may be used on such bodies, following the right-hand rule. We repeat our previous recommendations that planning and efforts be made to make controlled cartographic products; newly recommend that common formulations should be used for orientation and size; continue to recommend that a community consensus be developed for the orientation models of Jupiter and Saturn; newly recommend that historical summaries of the coordinate systems for given bodies should be developed, and point out that for planets and satellites planetographic systems have generally been historically preferred over planetocentric systems, and that in cases when planetographic coordinates have been widely used in the past, there is no obvious advantage to switching to the use of planetocentric coordinates. The Working Group also requests community input on the question submitting process, posting of updates to the Working Group website, and on whether recommendations should be made regarding exoplanet coordinate systems.

HAT-TR-318-007: A Double-lined M Dwarf Binary with Total Secondary Eclipses Discovered by HATNet and Observed by K2	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; stars: fundamental parameters; stars: individual (HAT-TR-318-007, EPIC 211432946); stars: late-type	LOW-MASS STARS; ABSOLUTE DIMENSIONS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; OPEN CLUSTERS; ALGORITHM; RADIUS; KEPLER; BRIGHT; VELOCITIES; PHOTOMETRY	We report the discovery by the HATNet survey of HAT-TR-318-007, a P=3.34395390 +/- 0.00000020 day period detached double-lined M dwarf binary with total secondary eclipses. We combine radial velocity (RV) measurements from TRES/FLWO 1.5 m and time-series photometry from HATNet, FLWO 1.2 m, BOS 0.8 m, and NASA K2 Campaign 5, to determine the masses and radii of the component stars: M-A = 0.448 +/- 0.011 M-circle dot(N), M-B = 0.2721(-0.0042)(+0.0041) M-circle dot(N), R-A = 0.4548(-0.0036)(+0.0035) R-circle dot(N) and R-B = 0.2913(-0.0024)(+0.0023) R-circle dot(N). We obtained a FIRE/Magellan near-infrared spectrum of the primary star during a total secondary eclipse, and we use this to obtain disentangled spectra of both components. We determine spectral types of STA=M3.71 +/- 0.69 and STB = M5.01 +/- 0.73 and effective temperatures of T-eff,T-A= 3190 +/- 110 K and T-eff,T-B = 3100 +/- 110 K for the primary and secondary star, respectively. We also measure a metallicity of [Fe/H] = + 0.298 +/- 0.080 for the system. We find that the system has a small, but significant, nonzero eccentricity of 0.0136 +/- 0.0026. The K2 light curve shows a coherent variation at a period of 3.41315(-0.00032)(+0.00030) days, which is slightly longer than the orbital period, and which we demonstrate comes from the primary star. We interpret this as the rotation period of the primary. We perform a quantitative comparison between the Dartmouth stellar evolution models and the seven systems, including HAT-TR-318-007, that contain M dwarfs with 0.2 M-circle dot(N) < M < 0.5 M-circle dot(N), have metallicity measurements, and have masses and radii determined to better than 5% precision. Discrepancies between the predicted and observed masses and radii are found for three of the systems.	[Hartman, J. D.; Bakos, G.

Periodic Orbit-Attitude Solutions in the Planar Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							GRADIENT-ORIENTED SYSTEM; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; STABILITY ANALYSIS; RIGID BODIES; MAPPINGS; POINTS	The pitch motion of spacecraft in the planar elliptic restricted three-body system is studied. Previous studies laid the foundation for spacecraft stability analysis with a small perturbation to the zero pitch motion. In this study, a cell-mapping approach that combines analytical and numerical techniques is used to study the global behavior of the full nonlinear spacecraft attitude in which coupling between orbital dynamics and attitude occurs. Spacecraft placed at the Lagrangian points and some of the reference trajectories are considered to study the effect of varying gravity gradient torque to pitch motion in the three-body system. The spacecraft configuration and orbital eccentricity are also taken into account as parameters for the study. Multiple-period periodic solutions and invariant surfaces are presented for different cases.

We discovered 36 extragalactic transients including iPTF17lf, a highly reddened local SN Ia, iPTF17bkj, a new member of the rare class of transitional Ibn/IIn supernovae, and iPTF17be, a candidate luminous blue variable outburst. We do not detect any luminous red novae and place an upper limit on their rate. We show that adding a slow-cadence I band component to upcoming surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility will improve the photometric selection of cool and dusty transients.	[Adams, S.

(2006). They noted that such volatile deposits are temporary and posited ongoing replenishment. We present a model for this replenishment by expanding on the Matson et al. (2012) model of subsurface heat and chemical transport in Enceladus. Our model explains the distributions of both CO2 frost and complexed CO2 clathrate hydrate as seen in the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data. We trace the journey of CO2 from a subsurface ocean. The ocean-water circulation model of Matson et al. (2012) brings water up to near the surface where gas exsolves to form bubbles. Some of the CO2 bubbles are trapped and form pockets of gas in recesses at the bottom of the uppermost ice layer. When fissures break open these pockets, the CO2 gas is vented. Gas pocket venting is episodic compared to the more or less continuous eruptive plumes, emanating from the "tiger stripes", that are supported by plume chambers. Two styles of gas pocket venting are considered: (1) seeps, and (2) blowouts. The presence of CO2 frost patches suggests that the pocket gas slowly seeped through fractured, cold ice and when some of the gas reached the surface it was cold enough to condense (i.e., T similar to 70 to similar to 119 K). If the fissure opening is large, a blowout occurs. The rapid escape of gas and drop in pocket pressure causes water in the pocket to boil and create many small aerosol droplets of seawater. These may be carried along by the erupting gas. Electrically charged droplets can couple to the magnetosphere, and be dragged away from Enceladus. Most of the CO2 blowout gas escapes from Enceladus and the remainder is distributed globally. However, CO2 trapped in a clathrate structure does not escape. It is much heavier and slower moving than the CO2 gas. Its motion is ballistic and has an average range of about 17 km. Thus, it contributes to deposits in the vicinity of the vent. Local heat flow indicates that gas pockets can be located as deep as several tens of meters below the surface. Gas pockets can be reused, and we explore their life cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

New Horizons Sci Team	A search for temporal changes on Pluto and Charon	ICARUS			English	Article							BELT MISSION; HORIZONS; SURFACE; GEOLOGY; PLUMES; TRITON; IMAGER; ICE; CAP	A search for temporal changes on Pluto and Charon was motivated by (1) the discovery of young surfaces in the Pluto system that imply ongoing or recent geologic activity, (2) the detection of active plumes on Triton during the Voyager 2 flyby, and (3) the abundant and detailed information that observing geologic processes in action provides about the processes. A thorough search for temporal changes using New Horizons images was completed. Images that covered the same region were blinked and manually inspected for any differences in appearance. The search included full-disk images such that all illuminated regions of both bodies were investigated and higher resolution images such that parts of the encounter hemispheres were investigated at finer spatial scales. Changes of appearance between different images were observed but in all cases were attributed to variability of the imaging parameters (especially geometry) or artifacts. No differences of appearance that are strongly indicative of a temporal change were found on the surface or in the atmosphere of either Pluto or Charon. Limits on temporal changes as a function of spatial scale and temporal interval during the New Horizons encounter are determined. The longest time interval constraint is one Pluto/Charon rotation period (similar to 6.4 Earth days). Contrast reversal and high-phase bright features that change in appearance with solar phase angle are identified. The change of appearance of these features is most likely due to the change in phase angle rather than a temporal change. Had active plumes analogous to the plumes discovered on Triton been present on the encounter hemispheres of either Pluto or Charon, they would have been detected. The absence of active plumes may be due to temporal variability (i.e., plumes do occur but none were active on the encounter hemispheres during the epoch of the New Horizons encounter) or because plumes do not occur. Several dark streak features that may be deposits from past plumes are identified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Hofgartner, J. D.; Buratti, B. J.; Devins, S.

We used a goniometric photopolarimeter (GPP) of novel design to study thirteen well-sorted particle size fractions of aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The sample suite included particle sizes larger than, approximately equal to, and smaller than the wavelength of the incident monochromatic radiation (lambda = 635 nm). The observed phase angle, alpha, was 0.056 < alpha < 15 degrees. These Al2O3 particulate samples have very high normal reflectance (> similar to 95%). The incident radiation has a very high probability of being multiply scattered before being backscattered toward the incident direction or ultimately absorbed. The five smallest particle sizes exhibited extremely high void space (> similar to 95%). The reflectance phase curves for all particle size fractions show a pronounced non-linear reflectance increase with decreasing phase angle at alpha similar to <3 degrees. Our earlier studies suggest that the cause of this nonlinear reflectance increase is constructive interference of counter-propagating waves in the medium by coherent backscattering (CB), a photonic analog of Anderson localization of electrons in solid state media. The polarization phase curves for particle size fractions with size parameter (particle radius/wavelength) r/lambda < similar to 1, show that the linear polarization rapidly decreases as a increases from 0; it reaches a minimum near alpha = similar to 2 degrees. Longward of similar to 2 degrees, the negative polarization decreases as phase angle increases, becoming positive between 12 degrees and at least 15 degrees, (probably similar to 20 degrees) depending on particle size. For size parameters r/lambda > similar to 1 we detect no polarization. This polarization behavior is distinct from that observed in low albedo solar system objects such as the Moon and asteroids and for absorbing materials in the laboratory. We suggest this behavior arises because photons that are backscattered have a high probability of having interacted with two or more particles, thus giving rise to the CB process. These results may explain the unusual negative polarization behavior observed near small phase angles reported for several decades on highly reflective ASSBs such as the asteroids 44 Nysa, 64 Angelina and the Galilean satellites lo, Europa and Ganymede. Our results suggest these ASSB regoliths scatter electromagnetic radiation as if they were extremely fine grained with void space > similar to 95%, and grain sizes of the order < = lambda. This portends consequences for efforts to deploy landers on high ASSBs such as Europa. These results are also germane to the field of terrestrial geo-engineering, particularly to suggestions that earth's radiation balance can be modified by injecting Al2O3 particulates into the stratosphere thereby offsetting the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The GPP used in this study was modified from our previous design so that the sample is presented with light that is alternatingly polarized perpendicular to and parallel to the scattering plane. There are no analyzers before the detector. This optical arrangement, following the Helmholtz Reciprocity Principle (HRP), produces a physically identical result to the traditional laboratory reflectance polarization measurements in which the incident light is unpolarized and the analyzers are placed before the detector. The results are identical in samples measured by both methods. We believe that ours is the first experimental demonstration of the HRP for polarized light, first proposed by Helmholtz in 1856.

Cassini CAPS Identification of Pickup Ion Compositions at Rhea	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Rhea; exosphere; icy satellites; pickup ions; plasma interactions	CARBON-DIOXIDE ATMOSPHERE; SATURNS MAGNETOSPHERE; VIMS; SATELLITES; EUROPA; PLASMA; DIONE; SPACE; MODEL	Saturn's largest icy moon, Rhea, hosts a tenuous surface-sputtered exosphere composed primarily of molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide. In this Letter, we examine Cassini Plasma Spectrometer velocity space distributions near Rhea and confirm that Cassini detected nongyrotropic fluxes of outflowing CO2+ during both the R1 and R1.5 encounters. Accounting for this nongyrotropy, we show that these possess comparable along-track densities of similar to 2x10(-3) cm(-3). Negatively charged pickup ions, also detected during R1, are surprisingly shown as consistent with mass 26 +/- 3 u which we suggest are carbon-based compounds, such as CN-, C2H-, C-2(-), or HCO-, sputtered from carbonaceous material on the moon's surface. The negative ions are calculated to possess along-track densities of similar to 5x10(-4) cm(-3) and are suggested to derive from exogenic compounds, a finding consistent with the existence of Rhea's dynamic CO2 exosphere and surprisingly low O-2 sputtering yields. These pickup ions provide important context for understanding the exospheric and surface ice composition of Rhea and of other icy moons which exhibit similar characteristics.	[Desai, R.

Areally Extensive Surface Bedrock Exposures on Mars: Many Are Clastic Rocks, Not Lavas	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; bedrock; olivine; resurfacing; sedimentary; eolian	EROSION RATES; MARTIAN HIGHLANDS; TERRA MERIDIANI; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SINUS SABAEUS; CRATER; BASIN; CONSTRAINTS; MINERALOGY; EVOLUTION	Areally extensive exposures of intact olivine/pyroxene-enriched rock, as well as feldspar-enriched rock, are found in isolated locations throughout the Martian highlands. The petrogenetic origin(s) of these rock units are not well understood, but some previous studies favored an effusive volcanic origin partly on the basis of distinctive composition and relatively high thermal inertia. Here we show that the regolith development, crater retention, and morphological characteristics for many of these "bedrock plains" are not consistent with competent lavas and reinterpret the high thermal inertia orbital signatures to represent friable materials that are more easily kept free of comminution products through eolian activity. Candidate origins include pyroclastic rocks, impact-generated materials, or detrital sedimentary rocks. Olivine/pyroxene enrichments in bedrock plains relative to surrounding materials could have potentially formed through deflation and preferential removal of plagioclase.	[Rogers, A.

J	Chiow, SW; Yu, N				Chiow, Sheng-wey; Yu, Nan			Multiloop atom interferometer measurements of chameleon dark energy in microgravity	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Chameleon field is one of the promising candidates of dark energy scalar fields. As in all viable candidate field theories, a screening mechanism is implemented to be consistent with all existing tests of general relativity. The screening effect in the chameleon theory manifests its influence limited only to the thin outer layer of a bulk object, thus producing extra forces orders of magnitude weaker than that of the gravitational force of the bulk. For pointlike particles such as atoms, the depth of screening is larger than the size of the particle, such that the screening mechanism is ineffective and the chameleon force is fully expressed on the atomic test particles. Extra force measurements using atom interferometry are thus much more sensitive than bulk mass based measurements, and indeed have placed the most stringent constraints on the parameters characterizing chameleon field. In this paper, we present a conceptual measurement approach for chameleon force detection using atom interferometry in microgravity, in which multiloop atom interferometers exploit specially designed periodic modulation of chameleon fields. We show that major systematics of the dark energy force measurements, i.e., effects of gravitational forces and their gradients, can be suppressed below all hypothetical chameleon signals in the parameter space of interest.

Design and performance of dual-polarization lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors for millimeter-wave polarimetry	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						instrumentation: detectors; instrumentation: polarimeters; cosmic background radiation	MICROWAVE; NOISE; REDUCTION; ASTRONOMY; ARRAYS	Aims. Lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) are an attractive technology for millimeter-wave observations that require large arrays of extremely low-noise detectors. We designed, fabricated and characterized 64-element (128 LEKID) arrays of horn-coupled, dual-polarization LEKIDs optimized for ground-based CMB polarimetry. Our devices are sensitive to two orthogonal polarizations in a single spectral band centered on 150 GHz with Delta nu/nu = 0.2. The 65 x 65 mm square arrays are designed to be tiled into the focal plane of an optical system. We demonstrate the viability of these dual-polarization LEKIDs with laboratory measurements. Methods. The LEKID modules are tested with an FPGA-based readout system in a sub-kelvin cryostat that uses a two-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. The devices are characterized using a blackbody and a millimeter-wave source. The polarization properties are measured with a cryogenic stepped half-wave plate. We measure the resonator parameters and the detector sensitivity, noise spectrum, dynamic range, and polarization response. Results. The resonators have internal quality factors approaching 1 x 10(6). The detectors have uniform response between orthogonal polarizations and a large dynamic range. The detectors are photon-noise limited above 1 pW of absorbed power. The noise-equivalent temperatures under a 3.4 K blackbody load are < 100 mu K root s. The polarization fractions of detectors sensitive to orthogonal polarizations are > 80%. The entire array is multiplexed on a single readout line, demonstrating a multiplexing factor of 128. The array and readout meet the requirements for 4 arrays to be read out simultaneously for a multiplexing factor of 512. Conclusions. This laboratory study demonstrates the first dual-polarization LEKID array optimized specifically for CMB polarimetry and shows the readiness of the detectors for on-sky observations.

Global spectroscopic survey of cloud thermodynamic phase at high spatial resolution, 2005-2015	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							REFRACTIVE-INDEXES; WATER; TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE; VARIANCE; MODELS; SENSITIVITY; DIFFERENCE; PRODUCTS; FEEDBACK	The distribution of ice, liquid, and mixed phase clouds is important for Earth's planetary radiation budget, impacting cloud optical properties, evolution, and solar reflectivity. Most remote orbital thermodynamic phase measurements observe kilometer scales and are insensitive to mixed phases. This under-constrains important processes with outsize radiative forcing impact, such as spatial partitioning in mixed phase clouds. To date, the fine spatial structure of cloud phase has not been measured at global scales. Imaging spectroscopy of reflected solar energy from 1.4 to 1.8 mu m can address this gap: it directly measures ice and water absorption, a robust indicator of cloud top thermodynamic phase, with spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of meters. We report the first such global high spatial resolution survey based on data from 2005 to 2015 acquired by the Hyperion imaging spectrometer onboard NASA's Earth Observer 1 (EO-1) spacecraft. Seasonal and latitudinal distributions corroborate observations by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). For extratropical cloud systems, just 25% of variance observed at GCM grid scales of 100 km was related to irreducible measurement error, while 75% was explained by spatial correlations possible at finer resolutions.

This unique transport property is not captured in climate models that have insufficient resolution to simulate these submesoscale dynamics. Here, we use an ocean model with an unprecedented resolution that, for the first time, globally resolves submesoscale heat transport. Upper-ocean submesoscale turbulence produces a systematically-upward heat transport that is five times larger than mesoscale heat transport, with wintertime averages up to 100 W/m(2) for mid-latitudes. Compared to a lower-resolution model, submesoscale heat transport warms the sea surface up to 0.3 degrees C and produces an upward annual-mean air-sea heat flux anomaly of 4-10 W/m(2) at mid-latitudes. These results indicate that submesoscale dynamics are critical to the transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth's climate.

In particular, present-day model skill can be used to evaluate their potential performance in future climate simulations. Multi-model averaging methods have been used extensively in climate and hydrological sciences, but they have not been used to constrain projected plant productivity responses to climate change, which is a major uncertainty in Earth system modelling. Here, we use three global observationally orientated estimates of current net primary productivity (NPP) to perform a reliability ensemble averaging (REA) method using 30 global simulations of the 21st century change in NPP based on the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) "business as usual" emissions scenario. We find that the three REA methods support an increase in global NPP by the end of the 21st century (2095-2099) compared to 2001-2005, which is 2-3% stronger than the ensemble ISIMIP mean value of 24.2 PgCy(-1). Using REA also leads to a 45-68% reduction in the global uncertainty of 21st century NPP projection, which strengthens confidence in the resilience of the CO2 fertilization effect to climate change. This reduction in uncertainty is especially clear for boreal ecosystems although it may be an artefact due to the lack of representation of nutrient limitations on NPP in most models. Conversely, the large uncertainty that remains on the sign of the response of NPP in semi-arid regions points to the need for better observations and model development in these regions.

DES Collaboration	Extreme Variability Quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; line: profiles; quasars: general; surveys	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; EMISSION-LINE PROPERTIES; BLACK-HOLE MASS; EDDINGTON RATIO; SEYFERT-1 GALAXIES; ACCRETION DISKS; DATA RELEASE; RADIO-LOUD; SDSS; TELESCOPE	We perform a systematic search for long-term extreme variability quasars (EVQs) in the overlapping Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 3 Year Dark Energy Survey imaging, which provide light curves spanning more than 15 years. We identified similar to 1000 EVQs with a maximum change in g-band magnitude of more than 1 mag over this period, about 10% of all quasars searched. The EVQs have L-bol similar to 10(45)-10(47) erg s(-1) and L/L-Edd similar to 0.01-1. Accounting for selection effects, we estimate an intrinsic EVQ fraction of similar to 30%-50% among all g less than or similar to 22 quasars over a baseline of similar to 15 yr. We performed detailed multi-wavelength, spectral, and variability analyses for the EVQs and compared them to their parent quasar sample. We found that EVQs are distinct from a control sample of quasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity: (1) their UV broad emission lines have larger equivalent widths; (2) their Eddington ratios are systematically lower; and (3) they are more variable on all timescales. The intrinsic difference in quasar properties for EVQs suggests that internal processes associated with accretion are the main driver for the observed extreme long-term variability. However, despite their different properties, EVQs seem to be in the tail of a continuous distribution of quasar properties, rather than standing out as a distinct population. We speculate that EVQs are normal quasars accreting at relatively low rates, where the accretion flow is more likely to experience instabilities that drive the changes in flux by a factor of a few on multi-year timescales.

Very Long Baseline Array Imaging of Type-2 Seyferts with Double-peaked Narrow Emission Lines: Searches for Sub-kpc Dual AGNs and Jet-powered Outflows	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; galaxies: interactions; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert; radio continuum: galaxies	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BINARY QUASARS; RADIO-SOURCES; FUNDAMENTAL PLANE; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; SYSTEMATIC SEARCH; EFFICIENT MERGER; CATALOG	This paper presents Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 13 double-peaked [O III] emission-line type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts 0.06 < z < 0.41 (with a median redshift of z similar to 0.15) identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Such double-peaked emission-line objects may result from jets or outflows from the central engine or from a dual AGN. The VLBA provides an angular resolution of less than or similar to 10 pc at the distance of many of these galaxies, sufficient to resolve the radio emission from extremely close dual AGNs and to contribute to understanding the origin of double-peaked [O III] emission lines. Of the 13 galaxies observed at 3.6 cm (8.4 GHz), we detect six at a 1 sigma s ensitivity level of similar to 0.15 mJy beam(-1), two of which show clear jet structures on scales ranging from a few milliarcseconds to tens of milliarcseconds (corresponding to a few pc to tens of pc at a median redshift of 0.15). We suggest that radio-loud, double-peaked emission-line type-2 AGNs may be indicative of jet produced structures, but a larger sample of double-peaked [O III] AGNs with high angular resolution radio observations will be required to confirm this suggestion.

Continuum Reverberation Mapping of the Accretion Disks in Two Seyfert 1 Galaxies	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; galaxies: individual (MCG+08-11-011, NGC 2617); galaxies: Seyfert	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BROAD-LINE REGION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; QUASI-STELLAR OBJECTS; X-RAY; OPTICAL VARIABILITY; SPECTRAL VARIABILITY; NGC 5548; EMISSION	We present optical continuum lags for two Seyfert 1 galaxies, MCG+08-11-011 and NGC 2617, using monitoring data from a reverberation mapping campaign carried out in 2014. Our light curves span the ugriz filters over four months, with median cadences of 1.0 and 0.6 days for MCG+08-11-011 and NGC 2617, respectively, combined with roughly daily X-ray and near-UV data from Swift for NGC 2617. We find lags consistent with geometrically thin accretion-disk models that predict a lag-wavelength relation of tau proportional to lambda(4/3). However, the observed lags are larger than predictions based on standard thin-disk theory by factors of 3.3 for MCG+08-11-011 and 2.3 for NGC 2617. These differences can be explained if the mass accretion rates are larger than inferred from the optical luminosity by a factor of 4.3 in MCG+08-11-011 and a factor of 1.3 in NGC 2617, although uncertainty in the SMBH masses determines the significance of this result. While the X-ray variability in NGC 2617 precedes the UV/optical variability, the long (2.6 day) lag is problematic for coronal reprocessing models.	[Fausnaugh, M. M.; Kochanek, C. S.; Peterson, B.

We use a forward modeling approach where we model the probability distribution of optical richness for a given mass, P(ln lambda vertical bar M). To model the abundance and the stacked lensing profiles, we use an emulator specifically built to interpolate the halo mass function and the stacked lensing profile for an arbitrary set of halo mass and redshift, which is calibrated based on a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations. We apply our method to 8312 SDSS redMaPPer clusters with 20 <= lambda 100 and 0.10 <= z(lambda) <= 0.33 and show that the lognormal distribution model for P(lambda vertical bar M), with four free parameters, well reproduces the measured abundances and lensing profiles simultaneously. The constraints are characterized by the mean relation, <lambda n lambda >(M) = A + B ln(MM/(pivot)), with A = 3.207(-0.046)(+0.044) and B = 0.993(-0.055)(+0.041) (68% CL), where the pivot mass scale M-pivot = 3 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot, and the scatter sigma ln lambda vertical bar M = sigma(0) + qln(M/M-pivot) with sigma(0) = 0.456(-0.039)(+0.047) and = q -0.169(-0.026)(+0.035). We find that a large scatter in halo masses is required at the lowest-richness bins (20 <= lambda less than or similar to 30) in order to reproduce the measurements. Without such a large scatter, the model prediction for the lensing profiles tends to overestimate the measured amplitudes. This might imply a possible contamination of intrinsically low-richness clusters due to the projection effects. Such a low-mass halo contribution is significantly reduced when applying our method to the sample of 30 <= lambda <= 100.

Passively mode-locked interband cascade optical frequency combs	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ENVELOPE PHASE-CONTROL; LASERS; GENERATION	Since their inception, optical frequency combs have transformed a broad range of technical and scientific disciplines, spanning time keeping to navigation. Recently, dual comb spectroscopy has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional Fourier transform spectroscopy, since it offers higher measurement sensitivity in a fraction of the time. Midwave infrared (mid-IR) frequency combs are especially promising as an effective means for probing the strong fundamental absorption lines of numerous chemical and biological agents. Mid-IR combs have been realized via frequency down-conversion of a near-IR comb, by optical pumping of a micro-resonator, and beyond 7 mu m by four-wave mixing in a quantum cascade laser. In this work, we demonstrate an electrically-driven frequency comb source that spans more than 1 THz of bandwidth centered near 3.6 mu m. This is achieved by passively mode-locking an interband cascade laser (ICL) with gain and saturable absorber sections monolithically integrated on the same chip. The new source will significantly enhance the capabilities of mid-IR multi-heterodyne frequency comb spectroscopy systems.

In a departure from currently operational AIRS retrievals (AIRS V6), cloud scattering and absorption are in the radiative transfer forward model and AIRS single-footprint thermal infrared data are used directly rather than cloud-cleared spectra (which are calculated using nine adjacent AIRS infrared footprints). Coincident MODIS cloud data are used for cloud a priori data. Using single-footprint spectra improves the horizontal resolution of the AIRS retrieval from similar to 45 to similar to 13.5 km at nadir, but as microwave data are not used, the retrieval is not made at altitudes below thick clouds. An outline of the AIRS-OE retrieval procedure and information content analysis is presented. Initial comparisons of AIRS-OE to AIRS V6 results show increased horizontal detail in the water vapor and relative humidity fields in the free troposphere above the clouds. Initial comparisons of temperature, water vapor and relative humidity profiles with coincident radiosondes show good agreement. Future improvements to the retrieval algorithm, and to the forward model in particular, are discussed.

Pitch Angle Scattering of Upgoing Electron Beams in Jupiter's Polar Regions by Whistler Mode Waves	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						pitch angle scattering; Juno; upgoing electron beams; whistler mode; Jupiter; polar cap	MAGNETOSPHERE; DIFFUSION	The Juno spacecraft's Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument has observed field-aligned, unidirectional (upgoing) electron beams throughout most of Jupiter's entire polar cap region. The Waves instrument detected intense broadband whistler mode emissions occurring in the same region. In this paper, we investigate the pitch angle scattering of the upgoing electron beams due to interactions with the whistler mode waves. Profiles of intensity versus pitch angle for electron beams ranging from 2.53 to 7.22 Jovian radii show inconsistencies with the expected adiabatic invariant motion of the electrons. It is believed that the observed whistler mode waves perturb the electron motion and scatter them away from the magnetic field line. The diffusion equation has been solved by using diffusion coefficients which depend on the magnetic intensity of the whistler mode waves.	[Elliott, S. S.; Gurnett, D. A.; Kurth, W.

Diverse Electron and Ion Acceleration Characteristics Observed Over Jupiter's Main Aurora	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; aurora; Juno; energetic particles; magnetosphere		Two new Juno-observed particle features of Jupiter's main aurora demonstrate substantial diversity of processes generating Jupiter's mysterious auroral emissions. It was previously speculated that sometimes-observed potential-driven aurora (up to 400 kV) can turn into broadband stochastic acceleration (dominating at Jupiter) by means of instability. Here direct evidence for such a process is revealed with a mono-energetic electron inverted-V rising in energy to 200 keV, transforming into a region of broadband acceleration with downward energy fluxes tripling to 3,000 mW/m(2), and then transforming back into a mono-energetic structure ramping down from 200 keV. But a second feature of interest observed nearby is unlikely to have operated in the same way. Here a downward accelerated proton inverted-V, with inferred potentials to 300-400kV, occurred simultaneously with downward accelerated broadband electrons with downward energy fluxes as high as any observed (similar to 3,000 mW/m(2)). This latter feature has no known precedent with Earth auroral observations.	[Mauk, B. H.; Haggerty, D. K.; Paranicas, C.; Clark, G.; Kollmann, P.; Rymer, A. M.; Peachey, J.

Because these currents rival ice drift speeds, we examine the potential for the Beaufort Gyre's shift from a system in which the wind drives the ice and the ice drives a passive ocean to one in which the ocean often, in the absence of high winds, drives the ice. The resultant stress exerted on the ocean by the ice and the resultant Ekman pumping are reversed, without any change in average wind stress curl. Through these curl reversals, the ice-ocean stress provides a key feedback in Beaufort Gyre stabilization. This manuscript constitutes one of the first observational studies of ice-ocean stress inclusive of geostrophic ocean currents, by making use of recently available remote sensing data.

We show that the magnitude of short-term global water vapor feedback based on observed interannual variations from 2004 to 2016 is 1.550.23Wm(-2)K(-1), while model-simulated results derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 runs driven by observed sea surface temperature range from 0.99 to 1.75Wm(-2)K(-1), with a multimodel mean of 1.40Wm(-2)K(-1). The long-term water vapor feedbacks derived from the quadrupling of CO2 runs range from 1.47 to 2.03Wm(-2)K(-1), higher than the short-term counterparts. The systematic difference between short-term and long-term water vapor feedbacks illustrates that care should be taken when inferring long-term feedbacks from interannual variabilities. Also, the magnitudes of the short-term and long-term feedbacks are closely correlated (R=0.66) across the models, implying that the observed short-term water vapor feedback could be used to constrain the simulated long-term water vapor feedback. Based on satellite observations, the inferred long-term water vapor feedback is about 1.850.32Wm(-2)K(-1).

J	Leinonen, J; von Lerber, A				Leinonen, Jussi; von Lerber, Annakaisa			Snowflake Melting Simulation Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						snowflakes; melting layer; smoothed particle hydrodynamics; precipitation; microphysics	RADAR OBSERVATIONS; CONTACT-ANGLE; AGGREGATE SNOWFLAKES; ICE PARTICLES; LAYER; PRECIPITATION; ATTENUATION; MODEL; SPH; CLOUDS	Motivated by the need to understand the microphysics and improve the remote sensing of the melting layer of precipitation, we have developed a numerical 3-D model for the melting of single snowflakes. The model uses the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method and is forced by surface tension that controls the flow of meltwater on the ice surface. Heat transfer from the environment to the snowflake is simulated with a Monte Carlo scheme. In model experiments with snowflakes of various sizes and densities, we observed that the meltwater tends to initially gather in concave regions of the snowflake surface. These liquid water regions merge as they grow, and as meltwater is added, they form a shell of liquid around an ice core. This eventually develops into a water drop. The observed features during melting are consistent with experimental findings from earlier research, which suggests that the model is adequate for exploring the physics of snowflake melting. The principal remaining uncertainties arise from the omission of aerodynamic forces from the model. The results suggest that the degree of riming has a significant influence on the melting process: During initial melting, liquid water is apparent on the surface of unrimed or lightly rimed particles, while rime provides a porous structure that can absorb a relatively large amount of meltwater. Riming also strengthens the connections between different parts of the snowflake, making rimed snowflakes less prone to breakup during melting, while unrimed ones break up rather easily. Plain Language Summary Rain often starts as snow higher in the atmosphere, where it is colder. The snowflakes melt as they fall into above-freezing temperatures. The layer of melting snowflakes can, among other things, affect weather patterns, block radio signals, and be a hazard to aircraft. Our study was the first to simulate the melting of snowflakes in 3-D by reproducing the physical processes involved on a computer. The behavior of meltwater on the simulated snowflakes is very similar to that seen in observations of real ones. The simulation can help us better understand the details of the melting process and how the snowflake type affects it, as well as create better models for the interaction of melting snowflakes with radar and telecommunication signals.

Morphological Indicators of a Mascon Beneath Ceres's Largest Crater, Kerwan	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							INTERNAL STRUCTURE; GRAVITY-FIELD; WATER ICE; SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; IMPACT CRATERS; BASINS; TOPOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; SATELLITES	Gravity data of Ceres returned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dawn spacecraft is consistent with a lower density crust of variable thickness overlying a higher density mantle. Crustal thickness variations can affect the long-term, postimpact modification of impact craters on Ceres. Here we show that the unusual morphology of the 280 km diameter crater Kerwan may result from viscous relaxation in an outer layer that thins substantially beneath the crater floor. We propose that such a structure is consistent with either impact-induced uplift of the high-density mantle beneath the crater or from volatile loss during the impact event. In either case, the subsurface structure inferred from the crater morphology is superisostatic, and the mass excess would result in a positive Bouguer anomaly beneath the crater, consistent with the highest-degree gravity data from Dawn. Ceres joins the Moon, Mars, and Mercury in having basin-associated gravity anomalies, although their origin may differ substantially.	[Bland, M.

Earth's organic carbon isotope record extends to the Late Eoarchean-Early Paleoarchean: the age of the oldest known sedimentary rocks. However, complementary inorganic carbon reservoirs are poorly represented in the oldest units, and commonly reported bulk organic carbon isotope measurements do not capture the micro-scale isotopic heterogeneities that are increasingly reported from younger rocks. Here, we investigated the isotopic composition of the oldest paired occurrences of sedimentary carbonate and organic matter, which are preserved as dolomite and kerogen within textural biosignatures of the similar to 3.43 Ga Strelley Pool Formation. We targeted least-altered carbonate phases in situ using microsampling techniques guided by non-destructive elemental mapping. Organic carbon isotope values were measured by spatiallyresolved bulk analyses, and in situ using secondary ion mass spectrometry to target microscale domains of organic material trapped within inorganic carbon matrixes. Total observed fractionation of C-13 ranges from -29 to -45%. Our data are consistent with studies of younger Archean rocks that host biogenic stromatolites and organic-inorganic carbon pairs showing greater fractionation than expected for Rubisco fixation alone. We conclude that organic matter was fixed and/or remobilized by at least one metabolism in addition to the CBB cycle, possibly by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway or methanogenesis-methanotrophy, in a shallow-water marine environment during the Paleoarchean.

We map present-day Antarctic-wide surface velocities using Landsat 7 and 8 imagery spanning 2013-2015 and compare to earlier estimates derived from synthetic aperture radar, revealing heterogeneous changes in ice flow since similar to 2008. The new mapping provides complete coastal and inland coverage of ice velocity north of 82.4 degrees S with a mean error of < 10 m yr(-1), resulting from multiple overlapping image pairs acquired during the daylight period. Using an optimized flux gate, ice discharge from Antarctica is 1929 +/- 40 Gigatons per year (Gt yr(-1)) in 2015, an increase of 36 +/- 15 Gt yr(-1) from the time of the radar mapping. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and Marguerite Bay on the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 88% of this increase. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have been remarkably constant over the period of observation. Including modeled rates of snow accumulation and basal melt, the Antarctic ice sheet lost ice at an average rate of 183 +/- 94 Gt yr(-1) between 2008 and 2015. The modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years is contrasted by high rates of ice sheet mass loss and distinct spatial patters of elevation lowering. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is experiencing high rates of mass loss and displays distinct patterns of elevation lowering that point to a dynamic imbalance. We find modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years, which suggests that the recent pattern of mass loss in Antarctica is part of a longer-term phase of enhanced glacier flow initiated in the decades leading up to the first continent-wide radar mapping of ice flow.

Yet, emissions from drought-induced forest fires are, usually, not included in national-level carbon emission inventories. Here we examine Brazilian Amazon drought impacts on fire incidence and associated forest fire carbon emissions over the period 2003-2015. We show that despite a 76% decline in deforestation rates over the past 13 years, fire incidence increased by 36% during the 2015 drought compared to the preceding 12 years. The 2015 drought had the largest ever ratio of active fire counts to deforestation, with active fires occurring over an area of 799,293 km(2). Gross emissions from forest fires (989 +/- 504 Tg CO2 year(-1)) alone are more than half as great as those from old-growth forest deforestation during drought years. We conclude that carbon emission inventories intended for accounting and developing policies need to take account of substantial forest fire emissions not associated to the deforestation process.

Liquid-vapor rectilinear diameter revisited	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							COEXISTENCE-CURVE; CRITICALITY; BEHAVIOR; SF6	In the modern theory of critical phenomena, the liquid-vapor density diameter in simple fluids is generally expected to deviate from a rectilinear lawapproaching the critical point. However, by performing precise scannerlike optical measurements of the position of the SF6 liquid-vapor meniscus, in an approach much closer to criticality in temperature and density than earlier measurements, no deviation from a rectilinear diameter can be detected. The observedmeniscus position from far (10 K) to extremely close (1 mK) to the critical temperature is analyzed using recent theoretical models to predict the complete scaling consequences of a fluid asymmetry. The temperature dependence of the meniscus position appears consistent with the law of rectilinear diameter. The apparent absence of the critical hook in SF6 therefore seemingly rules out the need for the pressure scaling field contribution in the complete scaling theoretical framework in this SF6 analysis. More generally, this work suggests a way to clarify the experimental ambiguities in the simple fluids for the near-critical singularities in the density diameter.

J	Toon, GC; Blavier, JFL; Sung, K				Toon, Geoffrey C.; Blavier, Jean-Francois L.; Sung, Keeyoon			Atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (OCS) measured remotely by FTIR solar absorption spectrometry	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							LOWER STRATOSPHERE; COLUMN; RETRIEVALS; SPECTRA; AEROSOL; MODEL; SINKS; CYCLE; VARIABILITY; ABUNDANCE	Atmospheric OCS abundances have been retrieved from infrared spectra measured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) MkIV Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer during 24 balloon flights and during nearly 1100 days of ground-based observations since 1985. Our spectral fitting approach uses broad windows to enhance the precision and robustness of the retrievals. Since OCS has a vertical profile similar in shape to that of N2O, and since tropospheric N2O is very stable, we reference the OCS observations to those of N2O, measured simultaneously in the same air mass, to remove the effects of stratospheric transport, allowing a clearer assessment of secular changes in OCS. Balloon measurements reveal less than 5% change in stratospheric OCS amounts over the past 25 years. Ground-based measurements reveal a springtime peak of tropospheric OCS, followed by a rapid early-summer decrease, similar to the behavior of CO2. This results in a peak-to-peak seasonal cycle of 5-6% of the total OCS column at northern mid-latitudes. In the long-term tropospheric OCS record, a 5% decrease is seen from 1990 to 2002, followed by a 5% increase from 2003 to 2012.

Accuracy and precision of polar lower stratospheric temperatures from reanalyses evaluated from A-Train CALIOP and MLS, COSMIC GPS RO, and the equilibrium thermodynamics of supercooled ternary solutions and ice clouds	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							DURATION BALLOON FLIGHTS; WATER-VAPOR MEASUREMENTS; RADIO OCCULTATION DATA; GRAVITY-WAVE ACTIVITY; WINTER ARCTIC VORTEX; OZONE DEPLETION; METEOROLOGICAL ANALYSES; ERA-INTERIM; NITRIC-ACID; HETEROGENEOUS FORMATION	We investigate the accuracy and precision of polar lower stratospheric temperatures (100-10 hPa during 2008-2013) reported in several contemporary reanalysis datasets comprising two versions of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA and MERRA-2), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-I), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR). We also include the Goddard Earth Observing System model version 5.9.1 near-real-time analysis (GEOS-5.9.1). Comparisons of these datasets are made with respect to retrieved temperatures from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) temperatures, and independent absolute temperature references defined by the equilibrium thermodynamics of supercooled ternary solutions (STSs) and ice clouds. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations of polar stratospheric clouds are used to determine the cloud particle types within the Aura MLS geometric field of view. The thermodynamic calculations for STS and the ice frost point use the colocated MLS gas-phase measurements of HNO3 and H2O. The estimated bias and precision for the STS temperature reference, over the 68 to 21 hPa pressure range, are 0.6-1.5 and 0.3-0.6 K, respectively; for the ice temperature reference, they are 0.4 and 0.3 K, respectively. These uncertainties are smaller than those estimated for the retrieved MLS temperatures and also comparable to GPS RO uncertainties (bias < 0.2 K, precision > 0.7 K) in the same pressure range. We examine a case study of the time-varying temperature structure associated with layered ice clouds formed by orographic gravity waves forced by flow over the Palmer Peninsula and compare how the wave amplitudes are reproduced by each reanalysis dataset. We find that the spatial and temporal distribution of temperatures below the ice frost point, and hence the potential to form ice polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in model studies driven by the reanalyses, varies significantly because of the underlying differences in the representation of mountain wave activity. High-accuracy COSMIC temperatures are used as a common reference to intercompare the reanalysis temperatures. Over the 68-21 hPa pressure range, the biases of the reanalyses with respect to COSMIC temperatures for both polar regions fall within the narrow range of -0.6 K to +0.5 K. GEOS-5.9.1, MERRA, MERRA-2, and JRA-55 have predominantly cold biases, whereas ERA-I has a predominantly warm bias. NCEP-CFSR has a warm bias in the Arctic but becomes substantially colder in the Antarctic. Reanalysis temperatures are also compared with the PSC reference temperatures. Over the 68-21 hPa pressure range, the reanalysis temperature biases are in the range -1.6 to -0.3 K with standard deviations similar to 0.6 K for the CALIOP STS reference, and in the range -0.9 to + 0.1 K with standard deviations similar to 0.7 K for the CALIOP ice reference. Comparisons of MLS temperatures with the PSC reference temperatures reveal vertical oscillations in the MLS temperatures and a significant low bias in MLS temperatures of up to 3 K.

New Spectral Model for Constraining Torus Covering Factors from Broadband X-Ray Spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: individual (3C 390.3, NGC 2110, IC 5063, NGC 7582); methods: data analysis; techniques: spectroscopic; X-rays: galaxies	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; CLUMPY-TORUS; DUSTY TORI; XMM-NEWTON; NGC 1068; ABSORPTION; VARIABILITY; EMISSION; QUASARS	The basic unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) invokes an anisotropic obscuring structure, usually referred to as a torus, to explain AGN obscuration as an angle-dependent effect. We present a new grid of X-ray spectral templates based on radiative transfer calculations in neutral gas in an approximately toroidal geometry, appropriate for CCD-resolution X-ray spectra (FWHM >= 130 eV). Fitting the templates to broadband X-ray spectra of AGNs provides constraints on two important geometrical parameters of the gas distribution around the supermassive black hole: the average column density and the covering factor. Compared to the currently available spectral templates, our model is more flexible, and capable of providing constraints on the main torus parameters in a wider range of AGNs. We demonstrate the application of this model using hard X-ray spectra from NuSTAR (3-79 keV) for four AGNs covering a variety of classifications: 3C 390.3, NGC 2110, IC 5063, and NGC 7582. This small set of examples was chosen to illustrate the range of possible torus configurations, from disk-like to sphere-like geometries with column densities below, as well as above, the Compton-thick threshold. This diversity of torus properties challenges the simple assumption of a standard geometrically and optically thick toroidal structure commonly invoked in the basic form of the unified model of AGNs. Finding broad consistency between our constraints and those from infrared modeling, we discuss how the approach from the X-ray band complements similar measurements of AGN structures at other wavelengths.

HD 104860 and HD 192758: Two Debris Disks Newly Imaged in Scattered Light with the Hubble Space Telescope	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: individual (HD 104860, HD 192758); techniques: image processing	CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK; LEGACY SURVEY; DUST; DISCOVERY; STARS; EVOLUTION; COMPANION; SYSTEMS; MODEL; RING	We present the first scattered-light images of two debris disks around the F8 star HD. 104860 and the F0V star HD. 192758, respectively similar to 45 and similar to 67. pc away. We detected these systems in the F110W and F160W filters through our reanalysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NICMOS data with modern starlight-subtraction techniques. Our image of HD. 104860 confirms the morphology previously observed by Herschel in thermal emission with a well-defined ring at a radius of similar to 114. au inclined by similar to 58 degrees. Although the outer edge profile is consistent with dynamical evolution models, the sharp inner edge suggests sculpting by unseen perturbers. Our images of HD. 192758 reveal a disk at radius similar to 95. au inclined by similar to 59 degrees, never resolved so far. These disks have low scattering albedos of 10% and 13%, respectively, inconsistent with water ice grain compositions. They are reminiscent of several other disks with similar inclination and scattering albedos: Fomalhaut, HD. 92945, HD. 202628, and HD. 207129. They are also very distinct from brighter disks in the same inclination bin, which point to different compositions between these two populations. Varying scattering albedo values can be explained by different grain porosities, chemical compositions, or grain size distributions, which may indicate distinct formation mechanisms or dynamical processes at work in these systems. Finally, these faint disks with large infrared excesses may be representative of an underlying population of systems with low albedo values. Searches with more sensitive instruments on HST or on the James Webb Space Telescope and using state-of-the art starlight-subtraction methods may help discover more of such faint systems.

Spectroscopic observations confirm DES16C2nm to be at z = 1.998, and spectroscopically similar to Gaia16apd (a SLSN-I at z = 0.102), with a peak absolute magnitude of U = -22.26 +/- 0.06. The high redshift of DES16C2nm provides a unique opportunity to study the ultraviolet (UV) properties of SLSNe-I. Combining DES16C2nm with 10 similar events from the literature, we show that there exists a homogeneous class of SLSNe-I in the UV (lambda(rest) approximate to 2500 angstrom), with peak luminosities in the (rest-frame) U band, and increasing absorption to shorter wavelengths. There is no evidence that the mean photometric and spectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z < 1) and high redshift (z > 1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at lambda(rest) < 2000 angstrom, possibly caused by the variations in temperature between events. No significant correlations are observed between spectral line velocities and photometric luminosity. Using these data, we estimate that SLSNe-I can be discovered to z = 3.8 by DES. While SLSNe-I are typically identified from their blue observed colors at low redshift (z < 1), we highlight that at z > 2 these events appear optically red, peaking in the observer-frame z-band. Such characteristics are critical to identify these objects with future facilities such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope, which should detect such SLSNe-I to z = 3.5, 3.7, and 6.6, respectively.

The NuSTAR Extragalactic Surveys: X-Ray Spectroscopic Analysis of the Bright Hard-band Selected Sample	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; surveys; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; WIDE-FIELD SURVEY; ALL-SKY SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS; COSMOS FIELD; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; STATISTICAL-METHODS; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; ASTRONOMICAL DATA; SEYFERT-GALAXIES	We discuss the spectral analysis of a sample of 63 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected above a limiting flux of S(8-24 keV) = 7 x 10(-14) erg s(-1)cm(-2) in the multi-tiered NuSTAR extragalactic survey program. The sources span a redshift range z = 0-2.1(median < z > = 0.58). The spectral analysis is performed over the broad 0.5-24. keV energy range, combining NuSTAR with Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data and employing empirical and physically motivated models. This constitutes the largest sample of AGN selected at > 10 keV to be homogeneously spectrally analyzed at these flux levels. We study the distribution of spectral parameters such as photon index, column density (N-H), reflection parameter (R), and 10-40. keV luminosity (L-X). Heavily obscured (log[N-H/cm(-2)] >= 23) and Compton-thick (CT; log [N-H/cm(-2)] >= 24) AGN constitute similar to 25% (15-17 sources) and similar to 2-3% (1-2 sources) of the sample, respectively. The observed N-H distribution agrees fairly well with predictions of cosmic X-ray background population-synthesis models (CXBPSM). We estimate the intrinsic fraction of AGN as a function of N-H, accounting for the bias against obscured AGN in a flux-selected sample. The fraction of CT AGN relative to log[N-H/cm(-2)] = 20-24 AGN is poorly constrained, formally in the range 2-56% (90% upper limit of 66%). We derived a fraction (f(abs)) of obscured AGN (log[N-H/cm(-2)] = 22-24) as a function of L-X in agreement with CXBPSM and previous z < 1 X-ray determinations. Furthermore, f(abs) at z = 0.1-0.5 and log (L-x erg s(-1)) approximate to 43.6-44.3 agrees with observational measurements/trends obtained over larger redshift intervals. We report a significant anti-correlation of R with L-X (confirmed by our companion paper on stacked spectra) with considerable scatter around the median R values.

Sensitivity of airborne radio occultation to tropospheric properties over ocean and land	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							FULL SPECTRUM INVERSION; EARTHS ATMOSPHERE; REFRACTIVITY; RECEIVER; MISSION; SIGNALS	Airborne radio occultation (ARO) measurements collected during a ferry flight at the end of the PREDepression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaign from the Virgin Islands to Colorado are analyzed. The large contrast in atmospheric conditions along the flight path from the warm and moist Caribbean Sea to the much drier and cooler continental conditions provides a unique opportunity to address the sensitivity of ARO measurements to the tropospheric temperature and moisture changes. This long flight at nearly constant altitude (similar to 13 km) provided an optimal configuration for simultaneous high-quality ARO measurements from two high-gain side-looking antennas, as well as one relatively lower gain zenith (top) antenna. The omnidirectional top antenna has the advantage of tracking robustly more occulting satellites in all direction as compared to the limited-azimuth tracking of the side-looking antennas. Two well-adapted radioholographic bending angle retrieval methods, full-spectrum inversion (FSI) and phase matching (PM), were compared with the standard geometric-optics (GO) retrieval method. Comparison of the ARO retrievals from the top antenna with the near-coincident ECMWF reanalysis-interim (ERAI) profiles shows only a small root-mean-square (RMS) refractivity difference of similar to 0.3% in the drier upper troposphere from similar to 5 to similar to 11.5 km over both land and ocean. Both the FSI and PM methods improve the ARO retrievals in the moist lower troposphere and reduce the negative bias found in the GO retrieval due to atmospheric multipath. In the lowest layer of the troposphere, the ARO refractivity derived using FSI shows a negative bias of about -2%. The increase of the refractivity bias occurs below 5 km over the ocean and below 3.5 km over land, corresponding to the approximate altitude of large vertical moisture gradients above the ocean and land surface, respectively. In comparisons to radiosondes, the FSI ARO soundings capture well the height of layers with sharp refractivity gradients but display a negative refractivity bias inside the boundary layer. The unique opportunity to make simultaneous independent recordings of occultation events from multiple antennas establishes that high-precision ARO measurements can be achieved corresponding to an RMS difference better than 0.2% in refractivity (or similar to 0.4 K). The surprisingly good quality of recordings from a very simple zenith antenna increases the feasibility of developing an operational tropospheric sounding system onboard commercial aircraft in the future, which could provide a large number of data for direct assimilation in numerical weather prediction models.

Evidence for a continuous decline in lower stratospheric ozone offsetting ozone layer recovery	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MERGED SAGE II; COLUMN OZONE; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; DATA SET; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; TROPOPAUSE HEIGHT; SOLAR-CYCLE; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE	Ozone forms in the Earth's atmosphere from the photodissociation of molecular oxygen, primarily in the tropical stratosphere. It is then transported to the extratropics by the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), forming a protective "ozone layer" around the globe. Human emissions of halogen-containing ozone-depleting substances (hODSs) led to a decline in stratospheric ozone until they were banned by the Montreal Protocol, and since 1998 ozone in the upper stratosphere is rising again, likely the recovery from halogen-induced losses. Total column measurements of ozone between the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere indicate that the ozone layer has stopped declining across the globe, but no clear increase has been observed at latitudes between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N outside the polar regions (60-90 degrees). Here we report evidence from multiple satellite measurements that ozone in the lower stratosphere between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N has indeed continued to decline since 1998. We find that, even though upper stratospheric ozone is recovering, the continuing downward trend in the lower stratosphere prevails, resulting in a downward trend in stratospheric column ozone between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. We find that total column ozone between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N appears not to have decreased only because of increases in tropospheric column ozone that compensate for the stratospheric decreases. The reasons for the continued reduction of lower stratospheric ozone are not clear; models do not reproduce these trends, and thus the causes now urgently need to be established.

Global models underestimate large decadal declining and rising water storage trends relative to GRACE satellite data	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						global hydrological models; land surface models; GRACE satellites; terrestrial total water storage anomalies; global mean sea level	LAND-SURFACE; SEA-LEVEL; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; NORTHWEST INDIA; MIDDLE-EAST; RESOURCES; IMPACTS; DROUGHT	Assessing reliability of global models is critical because of increasing reliance on these models to address past and projected future climate and human stresses on global water resources. Here, we evaluate model reliability based on a comprehensive comparison of decadal trends (2002-2014) in land water storage from seven global models (WGHM, PCR-GLOBWB, GLDAS NOAH, MOSAIC, VIC, CLM, and CLSM) to trends from three Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite solutions in 186 river basins (similar to 60% of global land area). Medians of modeled basin water storage trends greatly underestimate GRACE-derived large decreasing (<=-0.5 km(3)/y) and increasing (>= 0.5 km(3)/y) trends. Decreasing trends from GRACE are mostly related to human use (irrigation) and climate variations, whereas increasing trends reflect climate variations. For example, in the Amazon, GRACE estimates a large increasing trend of similar to 43 km(3)/y, whereas most models estimate decreasing trends (-71 to 11 km(3)/y). Land water storage trends, summed over all basins, are positive for GRACE (similar to 71-82 km(3)/y) but negative for models (-450 to -12 km(3)/y), contributing opposing trends to global mean sea level change. Impacts of climate forcing on decadal land water storage trends exceed those of modeled human intervention by about a factor of 2. The model-GRACE comparison highlights potential areas of future model development, particularly simulated water storage. The inability of models to capture large decadal water storage trends based on GRACE indicates that model projections of climate and human-induced water storage changes may be underestimated.

The Carnegie Supernova Project I Photometry data release of low-redshift stripped-envelope supernovae	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						supernovae: general	GAMMA-RAY BURST; CORE-COLLAPSE SUPERNOVAE; BOLOMETRIC LIGHT CURVES; IIB SUPERNOVA; OPTICAL PHOTOMETRY; IB/C SUPERNOVA; MASSIVE STARS; FAINT TYPE; PROGENITOR; EVOLUTION	The first phase of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I) was a dedicated supernova follow-up program based at the Las Campanas Observatory that collected science data of young, low-redshift supernovae between 2004 and 2009. Presented in this paper is the CSP-I photometric data release of low-redshift stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae. The data consist of optical (uBgVri) photometry of 34 objects, with a subset of 26 having near-infrared (YJH) photometry. Twenty objects have optical pre-maximum coverage with a subset of 12 beginning at least five days prior to the epoch of B-band maximum brightness. In the near-infrared, 17 objects have pre-maximum observations with a subset of 14 beginning at least five days prior to the epoch of J-band maximum brightness. Analysis of this photometric data release is presented in companion papers focusing on techniques to estimate host-galaxy extinction and the light-curve and progenitor star properties of the sample. The analysis of an accompanying visual-wavelength spectroscopy sample of similar to 150 spectra will be the subject of a future paper.	[Stritzinger, M. D.; Contreras, C.; Holmbo, S.; Hsiao, E.

Despite showing the highest system detection efficiency (SDE) ever reported with SNSPDs, amorphous materials typically lead to lower critical currents, which have impacts on their jitter performance. Combining a very low jitter and a high SDE remains a challenge. Here, we report on highly efficient superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors based on amorphous MoSi, combining system jitters as low as 26 ps and a SDE of 80% at 1550 nm. We also report detailed observations on the jitter behaviour, which hints at intrinsic limitations and leads to practical implications for SNSPD performance. Published by AIP Publishing.

In this study, the authors describe a new type of FML comprised of alternating layers of bulk metallic glass (BMG) and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite. The authors compare the galvanic coupling and mechanical behavior of an Al-based FML and a BMG-CFRP FML. Results show that when paired with CFRPs, BMG exhibits far less galvanic corrosion than aluminum paired with CFRP. In fact, the corrosion between BMG and CFRP is similar in magnitude to the corrosion between aluminum and glass fiber, the two constituent materials of GLARE, the most widely used FML. While interlaminar shear strength and flexural strength are similar for both FML types, the tensile strength and modulus of BMG-based FMLs are greater than those of Al-based FMLs.

Much of the complexity arises from the non-monotonic responses of clouds, precipitation and radiative fluxes to aerosol perturbations under various meteorological conditions. In this study, an aerosol-aware WRF model is used to investigate the microphysical and radiative effects of aerosols in three weather systems during the March 2000 Cloud Intensive Observational Period campaign at the US Southern Great Plains. Three simulated cloud ensembles include a low-pressure deep convective cloud system, a collection of less-precipitating stratus and shallow cumulus, and a cold frontal passage. The WRF simulations are evaluated by several ground-based measurements. The microphysical properties of cloud hydrometeors, such as their mass and number concentrations, generally show monotonic trends as a function of cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. Aerosol radiative effects do not influence the trends of cloud microphysics, except for the stratus and shallow cumulus cases where aerosol semi-direct effects are identified. The precipitation changes by aerosols vary with the cloud types and their evolving stages, with a prominent aerosol invigoration effect and associated enhanced precipitation from the convective sources. The simulated aerosol direct effect suppresses precipitation in all three cases but does not overturn the aerosol indirect effect. Cloud fraction exhibits much smaller sensitivity (typically less than 2%) to aerosol perturbations, and the responses vary with aerosol concentrations and cloud regimes. The surface shortwave radiation shows a monotonic decrease by increasing aerosols, while the magnitude of the decrease depends on the cloud type.

Spore-forming strains isolated from these environments comprised both obligate thermophiles/thermotolerant species (growing at > 55 degrees C; 240 strains) and mesophiles (growing at 15 to 40 degrees C; 12 strains). An overwhelming abundance of Geobacillus (81.3%) and Bacillus (18.3%) species was observed among the tested isolates. 16S rRNA sequence analysis documented the presence of 24 species among these isolates, but the 16S rRNA gene was shown to possess insufficient resolution to reliably discern Geobacillus phylogeny. gyrB-based phylogenetic analyses of nine strains revealed the presence of six known Geobacillus and one novel species. Multilocus sequence typing analyses based on seven different housekeeping genes deduced from whole genome sequencing of nine strains revealed the presence of three novel Geobacillus species. The vegetative cells of 41 Geobacillus strains were exposed to UVC254, and most (34 strains) survived 120 J/m(2), while seven strains survived 300 J/m(2), and cells of only one Geobacillus strain isolated from a compost facility survived 600 J/m(2). Additionally, the UVC254 inactivation kinetics of spores from four Geobacillus strains isolated from three distinct geographical regions were evaluated and compared to that of a spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) clean room Geobacillus strain. The purified spores of the thermophilic SAF strain exhibited resistance to 2000 J/m(2), whereas spores of two environmental Geobacillus strains showed resistance to 1000 J/m(2). This study is the first to investigate UV resistance of environmental, obligately thermophilic Geobacillus strains, and also lays the foundation for advanced understanding of necessary sterilization protocols practiced in food, medical, pharmaceutical, and aerospace industries.

Both catalogs are selected purely using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 bands. The R90 catalog consists of 4,543,530 AGN candidates with 90% reliability, while the C75 catalog consists of 20,907,127 AGN candidates with 75% completeness. These reliability and completeness figures were determined from a detailed analysis of UV- to near-IR spectral energy distributions of similar to 10(5) sources in the 9 deg(2) Bootes field. The AGN selection criteria are based on those of Assef et al. (2013) recalibrated to the AllWISE data release. We provide a detailed discussion of potential artifacts and excise portions of the sky close to the Galactic Center, Galactic Plane, nearby galaxies, and other expected contaminating sources. These catalogs are expected to enable a broad range of science, and we present a few illustrative cases. From the R90 sample, we identify 45 highly variable AGNs lacking radio counterparts in the FIRST survey. One of these sources, WISEA J142846.71+172353.1, is a changing-look quasar at z = 0.104, which has changed from having broad Ha to being a narrow-lined AGN. We characterize our catalogs by comparing them to large, wide-area AGN catalogs in the literature. We identify four ROSAT X-ray sources that are each matched to three WISE-selected AGNs in the R90 sample within 30.. Spectroscopy reveals that one of these systems, 2RXS J150158.6+691029, consists of a triplet of quasars at z = 1.133 +/- 0.004, suggestive of a rich group or forming galaxy cluster.	[Assef, R.

"TOP-SCOPE" is a joint survey program targeting similar to 2000 PGCCs in J = 1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues and similar to 1000 PGCCs in 850 mu m continuum emission. The objective of the "TOP-SCOPE" survey and the joint surveys (SMT 10 m, KVN 21 m, and NRO 45 m) is to statistically study the initial conditions occurring during star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds, across a wide range of environments. The observations, data analysis, and example science cases for these surveys are introduced with an exemplar source, PGCC G26.53+0.17 (G26), which is a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC). The total mass, length, and mean line mass (M/L) of the G26 filament are similar to 6200 M-circle dot, similar to 12 pc, and similar to 500 M-circle dot pc(-1), respectively. Ten massive clumps, including eight starless ones, are found along the filament. The most massive clump as a whole may still be in global collapse, while its denser part seems to be undergoing expansion owing to outflow feedback. The fragmentation in the G26 filament from cloud scale to clump scale is in agreement with gravitational fragmentation of an isothermal, nonmagnetized, and turbulent supported cylinder. A bimodal behavior in dust emissivity spectral index (beta) distribution is found in G26, suggesting grain growth along the filament. The G26 filament may be formed owing to large-scale compression flows evidenced by the temperature and velocity gradients across its natal cloud.

The observations are conducted with IRAC in the 3.6 and 4.5 mu m bands over an area of 7.04 deg(2), reaching 1 sigma depths of 1.29 mu Jy and 0.79 mu Jy in the 3.6 mu m and 4.5 mu m bands, respectively. The photometric catalog contains 380,858 sources with 3.6 and 4.5 mu m band photometry over the full-depth NEP mosaic. Point-source completeness simulations show that the catalog is 80% complete down to 19.7 AB. The accompanying catalog can be used for constraining the physical properties of extragalactic objects, studying the AGN population, measuring the infrared colors of stellar objects, and studying the extragalactic infrared background light.

Coordinated profiling of stratospheric intrusions and transported pollution by the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) and NASA Alpha Jet experiment (AJAX): Observations and comparison to HYSPLIT, RAQMS, and FLEXPART	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Background ozone; Stratospheric intrusion; Long-range transport; NAAQS; Lidar; Exceptional events	BACKGROUND SURFACE OZONE; GROUND-BASED LIDAR; UNITED-STATES; TROPOPAUSE FOLDS; AIRBORNE MEASUREMENTS; EXCEPTIONAL EVENTS; RAILROAD VALLEY; AIR-POLLUTION; SATELLITE; VARIABILITY	Ground-based lidars and ozonesondes belonging to the NASA-supported Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) are used in conjunction with the NASA Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) to investigate the transport of stratospheric ozone and entrained pollution into the lower troposphere above the United States on May 24-25, 2013. TOLNet and AJAX measurements made in California, Nevada, and Alabama are compared to tropospheric ozone retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), to back trajectories from the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, and to analyses from the NOAA/NESDIS Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) and FLEXPART particle dispersion model. The measurements and model analyses show much deeper descent of ozone-rich upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric air above the Desert Southwest than above the Southeast, and comparisons to surface measurements from regulatory monitors reporting to the U.S. EPA Air Quality System (AQS) suggest that there was a much greater surface impact in the Southwest including exceedances of the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 0.075 ppm in both Southern California and Nevada. Our analysis demonstrates the potential benefits to be gained by supplementing the existing surface ozone network with coordinated upper air observations by TOLNet.	[Langford, A. O.; Alvarez, R.

The O-2/N-2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS; REACTIVE CHLORINE; ATMOSPHERIC O-2; CARBON; CLOUD; EMISSIONS; BUDGETS; RELEASE; TRENDS; DECADE	The Southern Ocean plays a critical role in the global climate system by mediating atmosphere-ocean partitioning of heat and carbon dioxide. However, Earth system models are demonstrably deficient in the Southern Ocean, leading to large uncertainties in future air-sea CO2 flux projections under climate warming and incomplete interpretations of natural variability on interannual to geologic time scales. Here, we describe a recent aircraft observational campaign, the O-2/N-2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean (ORCAS) study, which collected measurements over the Southern Ocean during January and February 2016. The primary research objective of the ORCAS campaign was to improve observational constraints on the seasonal exchange of atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen with the Southern Ocean. The campaign also included measurements of anthropogenic and marine biogenic reactive gases; high-resolution, hyperspectral ocean color imaging of the ocean surface; and microphysical data relevant for understanding and modeling cloud processes. In each of these components of the ORCAS project, the campaign has significantly expanded the amount of observational data available for this remote region. Ongoing research based on these observations will contribute to advancing our understanding of this climatically important system across a range of topics including carbon cycling, atmospheric chemistry and transport, and cloud physics. This article presents an overview of the scientific and methodological aspects of the ORCAS project and highlights early findings.

The calculated quantities include the 0 K static total energy curves and electronic band structures as well as density-of-states, the phonon density-of-states, together with the linear thermal expansion coefficients, the entropies, the enthalpies, the heat capacities, the bulk moduli, and the Debye temperature as functions of temperature up to 1200 K. Both the standard Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revised for solids (PBEsol) exchange-correlational functionals were examined and it was found that the PBEsol functional was generally better than the PBE functional in describing both the crystal and electronic properties for the La3-xTe4.

Extraction of amino acids from aerogel for analysis by capillary electrophoresis. Implications for a mission concept to Enceladus' Plume	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						biosignatures; extraterrestrial exploration; In situ analysis; LIF detection	LIFE; ADSORPTION; STARDUST; SAMPLES; SILICA; INSTRUMENTATION; SURFACE; SEARCH; WATER	Ocean worlds like Europa and Enceladus in the outer solar system are prime targets in the search for life beyond Earth. Enceladus is particularly interesting due to the presence of a water plume ejecting from the south polar region. The recent discovery of H-2 in the plume, in addition to the presence of previously observed organic compounds, highlights the possibility of life in this moon. The plume provides materials from the underlying ocean that could be collected simply by flying through it. The presence of the plume means that material from the ocean is available for collection during a flyby, without the need for landing or complex sample handling operations such as scooping or drilling. An attractive approach to preserve the organics in particles collected during flyby encounters would be to utilize silica aerogel, the material used to collect particles at hypervelocity during the Stardust mission. Here we demonstrate amino acids can be extracted from aerogel simply by adding water. This simple liquid extraction method could be implemented during a mission prior to analysis with a liquid-based technique like capillary electrophoresis.

Shifting relative importance of climatic constraints on land surface phenology	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						land surface phenology; climatic constraints; start of season; end of season; minimum temperature; vapour pressure deficit; photoperiod	VEGETATION ACTIVITY; HIGH-RESOLUTION; NORTH-AMERICA; 3 DECADES; TEMPERATE; AUTUMN; TRENDS; SEASON; INDEX; PRODUCTIVITY	Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of seasonal dynamics of vegetated land surfaces from remote sensing, is a key indicator of global change, that both responds to and influences weather and climate. The effects of climatic changes on LSP depend on the relative importance of climatic constraints in specific regions-which are not well understood at global scale. Understanding the climatic constraints that underlie LSP is crucial for explaining climate change effects on global vegetation phenology. We used a combination of modelled and remotely-sensed vegetation activity records to quantify the interplay of three climatic constraints on land surface phenology (namely minimum temperature, moisture availability, and photoperiod), as well as the dynamic nature of these constraints. Our study examined trends and the relative importance of the three constrains at the start and the end of the growing season over eight global environmental zones, for the past three decades. Our analysis revealed widespread shifts in the relative importance of climatic constraints in the temperate and boreal biomes during the 1982-2011 period. These changes in the relative importance of the three climatic constraints, which ranged up to 8% since 1982 levels, varied with latitude and between start and end of the growing season. We found a reduced influence of minimum temperature on start and end of season in all environmental zones considered, with a biome-dependent effect on moisture and photoperiod constraints. For the end of season, we report that the influence of moisture has on average increased for both the temperate and boreal biomes over 8.99 million km(2). A shifting relative importance of climatic constraints on LSP has implications both for understanding changes and for improving how they may be modelled at large scales.

NASA's MODIS and VIIRS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Products: A Long-Term and Consistent Earth System Data Record	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Land surface; land surface temperature; remote sensing; temperature	HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER; THERMAL INFRARED IMAGES; SPLIT-WINDOW ALGORITHM; DAILY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; SEPARATION ALGORITHM; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; COVER CHANGE; SUITE VIIRS; SATELLITE; VALIDATION	Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&E) determine the total amount of upward long-wave infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface, making them key variables in a wide range of studies, including climate variability, land cover/use change, and the energy balance between the land and the atmosphere. LST&E products are currently produced on a routine basis using data from the MODIS instruments on the NASA EOS platforms and by the VIIRS instrument on the Suomi-NPP platform that serves as a bridge between NASA EOS and the nextgeneration JPSS platforms. Two new NASA LST&E products for MODIS (MxD21) and VIIRS (VNP21) will be produced during 2017 using a new approach that addresses discrepancies in accuracy and consistency between the current suite of MODIS and VIIRS LST split-window-based products. The new approach uses a temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, originally developed for the ASTER instrument, to physically retrieve both LST and spectral emissivity consistently for both sensors with high accuracy and well-defined uncertainties. This study demonstrates continuity between the new MYD21 and VNP21 LST products at the <+/- 0.5 K level, with differences that are invariant to environmental conditions and land cover type. Furthermore, MYD21 and VNP21 retrieved emissivities matched closely in magnitude and temporal variation to within 1%-2% over two land validation sites consisting of quartz sands and grassland. Continuity between the new suite of MODIS and VIIRS LST&E products will ensure a consistent and well-characterized long-term LST&E data record for better monitoring and understanding trends in Earth system behavior.

Martin			An Intercomparison between Reanalysis and Dropsonde Observations of the Total Water Vapor Transport in Individual Atmospheric Rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							US WEST-COAST; PRECIPITATION IMPACTS; CALIFORNIA; PACIFIC; SATELLITE; ALGORITHM; MOISTURE; CLIMATE; CALJET	A recent study presented nearly two decades of airborne atmospheric river (AR) observations and concluded that, on average, an individual AR transports similar to 5 x 10(8) kg s(-1) of water vapor. The study here compares those cases to ARs independently identified in reanalyses based on a refined algorithm that can detect less well-structured ARs, with the dual-purpose of validating reanalysis ARs against observations and evaluating dropsonde representativeness relative to reanalyses. The first comparison is based on 21 dropsonde-observed ARs in the northeastern Pacific and those closely matched, but not required to be exactly collocated, in ERA-Interim (MERRA-2), which indicates a mean error of -2% (-8%) in AR width and +3% (-1%) in total integrated water vapor transport (TIVT) and supports the effectiveness of the AR detection algorithm applied to the reanalyses. The second comparison is between the 21 dropsonde ARs and similar to 6000 ARs detected in ERA-Interim (MERRA-2) over the same domain, which indicates a mean difference of 5% (20%) in AR width and 5% (14%) in TIVT and suggests the limited number of dropsonde observations is a highly (reasonably) representative sampling of ARs in the northeastern Pacific. Sensitivities of the comparison to seasonal and geographical variations in AR width/TIVT are also examined. The results provide a case where dedicated observational efforts in specific regions corroborate with global reanalyses in better characterizing the geometry and strength of ARs regionally and globally. The results also illustrate that the reanalysis depiction of ARs can help inform the selection of locations for future observational and modeling efforts.

In this study, the Atmospheric River Skill (ATRISK) algorithm is introduced, which quantifies AR prediction skill in an object-based framework using Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Project global hindcast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. The dependence of AR forecast skill is globally characterized by season, lead time, and distance between observed and forecasted ARs. Mean values of daily AR prediction skill saturate around 7-10 days, and seasonal variations are highest over the Northern Hemispheric ocean basins, where AR prediction skill increases by 15%-20% at a 7-day lead during boreal winter relative to boreal summer. AR hit and false alarm rates are explicitly considered using relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves. This analysis reveals that AR forecast utility increases at 10-day lead over the North Pacific/western U.S. region during positive El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and at 7-and 10-day leads over the North Atlantic/U.K. region during negative Arctic Oscillation (AO) conditions and decreases at a 10-day lead over the North Pacific/western U.S. region during negative Pacific-North America (PNA) teleconnection conditions. Exceptionally large increases in AR forecast utility are found over the North Pacific/western United States at a 10-day lead during El Nino + positive PNA conditions and over the North Atlantic/United Kingdom at a 7-day lead during La Nina + negative PNA conditions. These results represent the first global assessment of AR prediction skill and highlight climate variability conditions that modulate regional AR forecast skill.

Development of in-situ trap characterisation techniques for EMCCDs	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Position Sensitive Detectors (PSD)	SEP 03-08, 2017	Open Univ, Milton Keynes, ENGLAND		Open Univ	Models and simulations; Photon detectors for UV, visible and IR photons (solidstate) (PIN diodes, APDs, Si-PMTs, G-APDs, CCDs, EBCCDs, EMCCDs etc); Radiation damage evaluation methods; Radiation damage to detector materials (solid state)	CHARGE-COUPLED-DEVICES; RADIATION-DAMAGE; TRANSFER INEFFICIENCY; DISPLACEMENT DAMAGE; TRANSFER EFFICIENCY; SILICON; CCD; PERFORMANCE; DEPENDENCE; DETECTORS	The "trap pumping" technique has seen considerable use over recent years as a means to probe the intrinsic properties of silicon defects that can impact charge transfer performance within CCD-based technologies. While the theory behind the technique is reasonably well understood, it has to date only been applied to relatively simple pixel designs where the motion of charge between pixel phases is fairly easy to predict. For some devices, the intrinsic pixel architecture is more complex and can consist of unequal phase sizes and additional implants that deform the electronic potential. Here, we present the implementation of the trap pumping technique for the CCD201-20, a 2-phase Teledyne e2v EMCCD. Clocking schemes are presented that can provide the location of silicon defects to sub-micron resolution. Experimental techniques that allow determination of trap energy levels and emission cross sections are presented. These are then implemented on an irradiated CCD201-20 to determine the energy level and emission cross section for defects thought to be the double acceptor state of the silicon divacancy (VV--) and carbon-phosphorus (CiPs) pairs. An improvement in charge transfer performance through optimised parallel clock delay is demonstrated and found to correlate with the properties of defects found using the trap pumping technique.

Joint NuSTAR and Chandra analysis of the obscured quasar in IC 2497-Hanny's Voorwerp system	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; quasars: general; quasars: individual (IC 2497); X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; RADIATIVELY INEFFICIENT ACCRETION; INFRARED-SURVEY-EXPLORER; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; REFERENCE SURVEY CARS; BLACK-HOLE GROWTH; X-RAY-EMISSION; HANNYS VOORWERP; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; MIDINFRARED SELECTION	We present new Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations of the core of IC 2497, the galaxy associated with Hanny's Voorwerp. The combined fits of the Chandra (0.5-8 keV) and NuSTAR (3-24 keV) X-ray spectra, together with WISE mid-IR photometry, optical longslit spectroscopy and optical narrow-band imaging, suggest that the galaxy hosts a Compton-thick active galactic nucleus (AGN) (N-H similar to 2 x 10(24) cm(-2), current intrinsic luminosity L-bol similar to 2-5 x 10(44) erg s(-1)) whose luminosity dropped by a factor of similar to 50 within the last similar to 100 kyr. This corresponds to a change in Eddington ratio (ER) from lambda(Edd) similar to 0.35 to lambda(Edd) similar to 0.007. We argue that the AGN in IC 2497 should not be classified as a changing-look AGN, but rather we favour the interpretation where the AGN is undergoing a change in accretion state (from radiatively efficient to radiatively inefficient). In this scenario, the observed drop in luminosity and ER corresponds to the final stage of an AGN accretion phase. Our results are consistent with previous studies in the optical, X-ray and radio although the magnitude of the drop is lower than previously suggested. In addition, we discuss a possible analogy between X-ray binaries and an AGN.

Hydrogen escape from Mars enhanced by deep convection in dust storms	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; WATER-VAPOR; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION; ICE; EXOSPHERE; ORIGIN; LAYERS	Present-day water loss from Mars provides insight into Mars's past habitability(1-3). Its main mechanism is thought to be Jeans escape of a steady hydrogen reservoir sourced from odd-oxygen reactions with near-surface water vapour(2,4,5). The observed escape rate, however, is strongly variable and correlates poorly with solar extreme-ultraviolet radiation flux(6-8), which was predicted to modulate escape(9). This variability has recently been attributed to hydrogen sourced from photolysed middle atmospheric water vapour(10), whose vertical and seasonal distribution is only partly characterized and understood(11-13). Here, we report multi-annual observational estimates of water content and dust and water transport to the middle atmosphere from Mars Climate Sounder data. We provide strong evidence that the transport of water vapour and ice to the middle atmosphere by deep convection in Martian dust storms can enhance hydrogen escape. Planet-encircling dust storms can raise the effective hygropause (where water content rapidly decreases to effectively zero) from 50 to 80 km above the areoid (the reference equipotential surface). Smaller dust storms contribute to an annual mode in water content at 40-50 km that may explain seasonal variability in escape. Our results imply that Martian atmospheric chemistry and evolution can be strongly affected by the meteorology of the lower and middle atmosphere of Mars.

AME was first detected in 1996 and recognised as an additional component of emission in 1997. Since then, AME has been observed by a range of experiments and in a variety of environments. AME is spatially correlated with far-IR thermal dust emission but cannot be explained by synchrotron or free-free emission mechanisms, and is far in excess of the emission contributed by thermal dust emission with the power-law opacity consistent with the observed emission at sub-mm wavelengths. Polarization observations have shown that AME is very weakly polarized (less than or similar to 1 %). The most natural explanation for AME is rotational emission from ultra-small dust grains ("spinning dust"), first postulated in 1957. Magnetic dipole radiation from thermal fluctuations in the magnetization of magnetic grain materials may also be contributing to the AME, particularly at higher frequencies (greater than or similar to 50 GHz). AME is also an important foreground for Cosmic Microwave Background analyses. This paper presents a review and the current state-of-play in AME research, which was discussed in an AME workshop held at ESTEC, The Netherlands, June 2016.	[Dickinson, Clive; Barr, A.; Harper, S.

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPERATURE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; INCORPORATING CO2 TRANSPORT; LEAF NITROGEN; CARBON GAIN; CHLAMYDOMONAS-REINHARDTII; MESOPHYLL CONDUCTANCE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ENERGY-CONVERSION; ANTENNA SIZE; GLOBAL FOOD	The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (Glycine max) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (Y11y11), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the "saved" nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.

Fusion of NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) Lidar Time Series over Mountain Forest Landscapes	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						NASA Airborne Snow Observatory; lidar; mountain ecosystems; multi-temporal data; co-registration; low density point clouds; forest vegetation structure; surface hydrology	WATER EQUIVALENT; POINT-SETS; BIOMASS; REGISTRATION; DYNAMICS; DISTURBANCE; ACCURACY; DENSITY	Mountain ecosystems are among the most fragile environments on Earth. The availability of timely updated information on forest 3D structure would improve our understanding of the dynamic and impact of recent disturbance and regeneration events including fire, insect damage, and drought. Airborne lidar is a critical tool for monitoring forest change at high resolution but it has been little used for this purpose due to the scarcity of long-term time-series of measurements over a common region. Here, we investigate the reliability of on-going, multi-year lidar observations from the NASA-JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) to characterize forest 3D structure at a fine spatial scale. In this study, weekly ASO measurements collected at similar to 1 pt/m(2), primarily acquired to quantify snow volume and dynamics, are coherently merged to produce high-resolution point clouds (12 pt/m(2)) that better describe forest structure. The merging methodology addresses the spatial bias in multi-temporal data due to uncertainties in platform trajectory and motion by collecting tie objects from isolated tree crown apexes in the lidar data. The tie objects locations are assigned to the centroid of multi-temporal lidar points to fuse and optimize the location of multiple measurements without the need for ancillary data or GPS control points. We apply the methodology to ASO lidar acquisitions over the Tuolumne River Basin in the Sierra Nevada, California, during the 2014 snow monitoring campaign and provide assessment of the fidelity of the fused point clouds for forest mountain ecosystem studies. The availability of ASO measurements that currently span 2013-2017 enable annual forest monitoring of important vegetated ecosystems that currently face ecological threads of great significance such as the Sierra Nevada (California) and Olympic National Forest (Washington).

Several improvements in the techniques and datasets quality led to more effective, near real time assessment and response, and a greater ability of constraining dynamically changing physical processes. Using examples of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) system, we present a methodology that bridges the gaps between MT-InSAR and the relative stiffness method for tunnel-induced subsidence damage assessment. The results allow quantification of the effect of the building on the settlement profile. As expected the greenfield deformation assessment tends to provide a conservative estimate in the majority of cases (similar to 71% of the analyzed buildings), overestimating tensile strains up to 50%. With this work we show how these two techniques in the field of remote sensing and structural engineering can be synergistically used to complement and replace the traditional ground based analysis by providing an extended coverage and a temporally dense set of data.

Such capability is typically estimated according to group delay variations (seconds/bandwidth/distance) after carrier-modulated data undergoes a dispersive medium. However, traditional group delay methods often ignore non-linear effects by assuming input data stream only occupies narrow bandwidth such that a propagation constant can be linearized centered at the carrier frequency. Such a constraint can be lifted with a proposed baseband equivalent impulse response method by using frequency domain convolution and multiplication. Once the impulse response in frequency domain is secured, its time domain counterpart can be calculated based on inverse Fourier transformation. Such analysis can fully reveal data pulse's broadening and gauge its inter-symbol interference by simply convolving input data with extracted impulse response, not limited to specific frequency range or type of waveguide.

J	Bhattacharya, R; Bordoni, S; Suselj, K; Teixeira, J				Bhattacharya, Ritthik; Bordoni, Simona; Suselj, Kay; Teixeira, Joao			Parameterization Interactions in Global Aquaplanet Simulations	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; EDDY-DIFFUSIVITY/MASS-FLUX; BOUNDARY-LAYER; CUMULUS PARAMETERIZATION; HADLEY CIRCULATION; PART I; CLIMATE; CONVECTION; PRECIPITATION; SENSITIVITY	Global climate simulations rely on parameterizations of physical processes that have scales smaller than the resolved ones. In the atmosphere, these parameterizations represent moist convection, boundary layer turbulence and convection, cloud microphysics, longwave and shortwave radiation, and the interaction with the land and ocean surface. These parameterizations can generate different climates involving a wide range of interactions among parameterizations and between the parameterizations and the resolved dynamics. To gain a simplified understanding of a subset of these interactions, we perform aquaplanet simulations with the global version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model employing a range (in terms of properties) of moist convection and boundary layer (BL) parameterizations. Significant differences are noted in the simulated precipitation amounts, its partitioning between convective and large-scale precipitation, as well as in the radiative impacts. These differences arise from the way the subcloud physics interacts with convection, both directly and through various pathways involving the large-scale dynamics and the boundary layer, convection, and clouds. A detailed analysis of the profiles of the different tendencies (from the different physical processes) for both potential temperature and water vapor is performed. While different combinations of convection and boundary layer parameterizations can lead to different climates, a key conclusion of this study is that similar climates can be simulated with model versions that are different in terms of the partitioning of the tendencies: the vertically distributed energy and water balances in the tropics can be obtained with significantly different profiles of large-scale, convection, and cloud microphysics tendencies.

J	Amouri, A; Morgera, SD; Bencherif, MA; Manthena, R				Amouri, Amar; Morgera, Salvatore D.; Bencherif, Mohamed A.; Manthena, Raju			A Cross-Layer, Anomaly-Based IDS for WSN and MANET	SENSORS			English	Article						intrusion detection; MANET; WSN; decision trees; linear regression; accumulated measure of fluctuation (AMoF); finite sample size	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS; WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; SAMPLE; SIZE; CLASSIFICATION	Intrusion detection system (IDS) design for mobile adhoc networks (MANET) is a crucial component for maintaining the integrity of the network. The need for rapid deployment of IDS capability with minimal data availability for training and testing is an important requirement of such systems, especially for MANETs deployed in highly dynamic scenarios, such as battlefields. This work proposes a two-level detection scheme for detecting malicious nodes in MANETs. The first level deploys dedicated sniffers working in promiscuous mode. Each sniffer utilizes a decision-tree-based classifier that generates quantities which we refer to as correctly classified instances (CCIs) every reporting time. In the second level, the CCIs are sent to an algorithmically run supernode that calculates quantities, which we refer to as the accumulated measure of fluctuation (AMoF) of the received CCIs for each node under test (NUT). A key concept that is used in this work is that the variability of the smaller size population which represents the number of malicious nodes in the network is greater than the variance of the larger size population which represents the number of normal nodes in the network. A linear regression process is then performed in parallel with the calculation of the AMoF for fitting purposes and to set a proper threshold based on the slope of the fitted lines. As a result, the malicious nodes are efficiently and effectively separated from the normal nodes. The proposed scheme is tested for various node velocities and power levels and shows promising detection performance even at low-power levels. The results presented also apply to wireless sensor networks (WSN) and represent a novel IDS scheme for such networks.

We show using data acquired with the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) instrument how a low noise, high resolution, L-band SAR could be used for oil spill response, with specific examples of tracking slick extent, position and weathering; determining zones of relatively thicker or more emulsified oil within a slick; and identifying oil slicks in coastal areas where look-alikes such as calm waters or biogenic slicks can confound the identification of mineral oil spills. From these key points, the essential features of an airborne SAR system for operational oil spill response are described, and further research needed to determine SAR's capabilities and limitations in quantifying slick thickness is discussed.

GaN based avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are particularly suitable for their high photon sensitivity and quantum efficiency in the UV region and for their inherent insensitivity to visible wavelengths. Challenges exist however for practical utilization. With growing interests in such photodetectors, hybrid readout solutions are becoming prevalent with CMOS technology being adopted for its maturity, scalability, and reliability. In this paper, we describe our approach to combine GaN APDs with a CMOS readout circuit, comprising of a linear array of 1 x 8 capacitive transimpedance amplifiers (CTIAs), implemented in a 0.35 mu m high voltage CMOS technology. Further, we present a simple, yet sustainable circuit technique to allow operation of APDs under high reverse biases, up to approximate to 80 V with verified measurement results. The readout offers a conversion gain of 0.43 mu V/e(-), obtaining avalanche gains up to 10(3). Several parameters of the CTIA are discussed followed by a perspective on possible hybridization, exploiting the advantages of a 3D-stacked technology.

An Observing System Simulation Experiment for the Calibration and Validation of the Surface Water Ocean Topography Sea Surface Height Measurement Using In Situ Platforms	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							INVERTED ECHO SOUNDERS; INTERNAL WAVES; NORTH PACIFIC; VARIABILITY; TRANSITION; ALTIMETER; MESOSCALE; SPECTRA; EDDIES	The wavenumber spectrum of sea surface height (SSH) is an important indicator of the dynamics of the ocean interior. While the SSH wavenumber spectrum has been well studied at mesoscale wavelengths and longer, using both in situ oceanographic measurements and satellite altimetry, it remains largely unknown for wavelengths less than; 70 km. The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission aims to resolve the SSH wavenumber spectrum at 15-150-km wavelengths, which is specified as one of the mission requirements. The mission calibration and validation (CalVal) requires the ground truth of a synoptic SSH field to resolve the targeted wavelengths, but no existing observational network is able to fulfill the task. A high-resolution global ocean simulation is used to conduct an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) to identify the suitable oceanographic in situ measurements for SWOT SSH CalVal. After fixing 20 measuring locations (the minimum number for resolving 15-150-km wavelengths) along the SWOT swath, four instrument platforms were tested: pressure-sensor-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIES), underway conductivity-temperature-depth (UCTD) sensors, instrumented moorings, and underwater gliders. In the context of the OSSE, PIES was found to be an unsuitable tool for the target region and for SSH scales 1570 km; the slowness of a single UCTD leads to significant aliasing by high-frequency motions at short wavelengths below; 30 km; an array of station-keeping gliders may meet the requirement; and an array of moorings is the most effective system among the four tested instruments for meeting the mission's requirement. The results shown here warrant a prelaunch field campaign to further test the performance of station-keeping gliders.

J	Chinita, MJ; Matheou, G; Teixeira, J				Chinita, Maria J.; Matheou, Georgios; Teixeira, Joao			A Joint Probability Density-Based Decomposition of Turbulence in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; SHALLOW CUMULUS CONVECTION; MODEL; DRY; PARAMETERIZATION; REPRESENTATION; THERMALS; CLOUDS; MASS	In convective flows, vertical turbulent fluxes, covariances between vertical velocity and scalar thermodynamic variables, include contributions from local mixing and large-scale coherent motions, such as updrafts and downdrafts. The relative contribution of these motions to the covariance is important in turbulence parameterizations. However, the flux partition is challenging, especially in regions without convective cloud. A method to decompose the vertical flux based on the corresponding joint probability density function (JPD) is introduced. The JPD-based method partitions the full JPD into a joint Gaussian part and the complement, which represent the local mixing and the large-scale coherent motions, respectively. The coherent part can be further divided into updraft and downdraft parts based on the sign of vertical velocity. The flow decomposition is independent of water condensate (cloud) and can be applied in cloud-free convection, the subcloud layer, and stratiform cloud regions. The method is applied to large-eddy simulation model data of three boundary layers. The results are compared with traditional cloud and cloud-core decompositions and a decaying scalar conditional sampling method. The JPD-based method includes a single free parameter and sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the parameter values. The results of the JPD-based method are somewhat similar to the cloud-core and conditional sampling methods. However, differences in the relative magnitude of the flux decomposition terms suggest that an objective definition of the flow regions is subtle and diagnosed flow properties like updraft characteristics depend on the sampling method. Moreover, the flux decomposition depends on the thermodynamic variable and convection characteristics.

High-Elevation Evapotranspiration Estimates During Drought: Using Streamflow and NASA Airborne Snow Observatory SWE Observations to Close the Upper Tuolumne River Basin Water Balance	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SIERRA-NEVADA; MEAN PRECIPITATION; ENERGY-BALANCE; CLIMATE; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; CALIFORNIA; KNOWLEDGE; SURFACE; LIDAR	Hydrologic variables such as evapotranspiration (ET) and soil water storage are difficult to observe across spatial scales in complex terrain. Streamflow and lidar-derived snow observations provide information about distributed hydrologic processes such as snowmelt, infiltration, and storage. We use a distributed streamflow data set across eight basins in the upper Tuolumne River region of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) lidar-derived snow data set over 3 years (2013-2015) during a prolonged drought in California, to estimate basin-scale water balance components. We compare snowmelt and cumulative precipitation over periods from the ASO flight to the end of the water year against cumulative streamflow observations. The basin water balance residual term (snow melt plus precipitation minus streamflow) is calculated for each basin and year. Using soil moisture observations and hydrologic model simulations, we show that the residual term represents short-term changes in basin water storage over the snowmelt season, but that over the period from peak snow water equivalent (SWE) to the end of summer, it represents cumulative basin-mean ET. Warm-season ET estimated from this approach is 168 (85-252 at 95% confidence), 162 (0-326) and 191 (48-334) mm averaged across the basins in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. These values are lower than previous full-year and point ET estimates in the Sierra Nevada, potentially reflecting reduced ET during drought, the effects of spatial variability, and the part-year time period. Using streamflow and ASO snow observations, we quantify spatially-distributed hydrologic processes otherwise difficult to observe. Plain Language Summary The amount of evapotranspiration in the Sierra Nevada mountains is important because this water is not available for downstream uses, supports alpine ecosystems, and may change in a future climate. Currently there are few measurements of evapotranspiration in the Sierra Nevada across a diverse landscape. We use a high-resolution snow data set (NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory) with multiple stream gauge observations from Yosemite National Park to estimate evapotranspiration using a water balance approach. Over 2013-2015 during the California drought, we find that evapotranspiration averages 162-191 mm per year, over the time period from peak snowpack in the spring to the end of the summer. Compared with other estimates of evapotranspiration, we find that the estimates are smaller, perhaps due to the diverse spatial terrain sampled by this approach. We also find that the estimates vary only slightly from year to year during the California drought. Our study may help understand how evapotranspiration, and thus available water supply, may change in a warmer future climate.

Snowmelt Timing as a Determinant of Lake Inflow Mixing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						snowmelt; inflow mixing; Lake Tahoe; climate change; mountain lakes; limnology	WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COOLING PONDS; WATER; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE; RESERVOIRS; DYNAMICS; SNOWPACK; CALIFORNIA	Snowmelt is a significant source of carbon, nutrient, and sediment loads to many mountain lakes. The mixing conditions of snowmelt inflows, which are heavily dependent on the interplay between snowmelt and lake thermal regime, dictate the fate of these loads within lakes and their ultimate impact on lake ecosystems. We use five decades of data from Lake Tahoe, a 600 year residence-time lake where snowmelt has little influence on lake temperature, to characterize the snowmelt mixing response to a range of climate conditions. Using stream discharge and lake profile data (1968-2017), we find that the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake prior to the onset of stratification increases as annual snowpack decreases, ranging from about 50% in heavy-snow years to close to 90% in warm, dry years. Accordingly, in 8 recent years (2010-2017) where hourly inflow buoyancy and discharge could be quantified, we find that decreased snowpack similarly increases the proportion of annual snowmelt entering the lake at weak to positive buoyancy. These responses are due to the stronger effect of winter precipitation conditions on streamflow timing and temperature than on lake stratification, and point toward increased nearshore and near-surface mixing of inflows in low-snowpack years. The response of inflow mixing conditions to snowpack is apparent when isolating temperature effects on snowpack. Snowpack levels are decreasing due to warming temperatures during winter precipitation. Thus, our findings suggest that climate change may lead to increased deposition of inflow loads in the ecologically dynamic littoral zone of high-residence time, snowmelt-fed lakes. Plain Language Summary Winter climate conditions can affect both the timing of snowmelt and the timing of spring lake warming. Relative stream-lake temperature is an important control on how inflow plumes mix through lakes, distributing nutrients, carbon, and sediment relevant to lake ecosystems and water quality. This study examines how snow conditions have affected relative stream-lake temperature, and thus inflow mixing conditions, over the past 50 years at Lake Tahoe. Years of lower snowpack are found to favor nearshore and near-surface mixing of snowmelt inflows. Given trends toward reduced snowpack due to a warming climate, this result may indicative of future conditions in large, snowmelt-fed lakes.	[Roberts, D. C.; Forrest, A. L.; Sahoo, G.

J	Yanovsky, I; Dragomiretskiy, K				Yanovsky, Igor; Dragomiretskiy, Konstantin			Variational Destriping in Remote Sensing Imagery: Total Variation with L-1 Fidelity	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); image striping restoration; raster scan; sparse optimization; split Bregman; total variation; variational destriping	STRIPE NOISE; REMOVAL; REDUCTION	This paper introduces a variational method for destriping data acquired by pushbroom-type satellite imaging systems. The model leverages sparsity in signals and is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing. It is based on the basic principles of regularization and data fidelity with certain constraints using modern methods in variational optimization, namely, total variation (TV), fidelity, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The proposed algorithm, TV-, uses sparsity-promoting energy functionals to achieve two important imaging effects. The TV term maintains boundary sharpness of the content in the underlying clean image, while the fidelity allows for the equitable removal of stripes without over- or under-penalization, providing a more accurate model of presumably independent sensors with an unspecified and unrestricted bias distribution. A comparison is made between the TV-model and the proposed TV-L model to exemplify the qualitative efficacy of an striping penalty. The model makes use of novel minimization splittings and proximal mapping operators, successfully yielding more realistic destriped images in very few iterations.

Program options to explore ocean worlds	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Ocean worlds; Astrobiology; Icy moons; Europa; Enceladus; Titan		Including Earth, roughly a dozen water ocean worlds exist in the solar system: the relict worlds Ceres and Mars, vast oceans inside most of the large Jovian and Saturnian icy moons, and Kuiper Belt Objects like Triton, Charon, and Pluto whose geologies are dominated by water and ammonia. Key pieces of the ocean-world science puzzle - which when completed may reveal whether life is widespread in the cosmos, why it exists where it does, and how it originates - are distributed among them. The eventual exploration of all these worlds will yield humanity's total tangible knowledge about life in the universe, essentially forever. Thus, their exploration has existential significance for humanity's self-regard, and indeed perhaps of our place in the natural scheme. The matter of planning how to pursue such a difficult and unprecedented exploration opportunity is therefore historic. The technical challenges are formidable, far harder than at Mars: missions to the Jovian and Saturnian ocean worlds are severely power-limited; trip times can be as much as a half decade and decade, respectively. And the science targets are global-scale oceans beneath kilometers of cryogenic ice. Reaching and exploring them would be a multi-generational undertaking, so again it is essential to plan and prepare. Today, we lack the instrumentation, subsystems, and remote operational-intelligence technologies needed to build and use exploration avatars as good as what we can envision needing. Each ocean world holds a piece of the puzzle, but the three priority targets are Europa at Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan at Saturn. As with the systematic exploration of Mars, exploring these diverse worlds poses a complex technical and programmatic challenge - a strategic challenge - that needs to be designed and managed if each generation is to see its work bear fruit, and if the space science community is to make most effective use of the public money devoted to the quest. Strategic programs benefit from coherence. In only 15 years, the Mars Exploration Program (MEP) has transformed humanity's view of Mars as a once and future habitable place, a world quite possibly holding relict evidence of life. Finding such evidence, we would study it to know if that life shared an origin common with Earth life. However, life in the ocean worlds could not have shared our origin, so exploring them opens another level in our quest to understand life in the universe: not only to places with vast salt-water seas known to contain organics and hydrothermal seafloors active today, but to places where anything alive cannot be related to us. MEP's success - from its presence in the public consciousness to its rewriting of planetary habitability - make it an obvious template and source of lessons learned for a viable ocean worlds exploration program (OWEP). Six attributes of the MEP are analyzed for application to a potential OWEP. From this, five hypothetical programmatic scenarios are compared to the default case, and conclusions drawn. A coherent OWEP should have several parts: first, dedicated continuous investment in enabling technologies; and second, two directed-purpose, medium-class (similar to$1 B) missions per decade that conduct pivotal investigations on a documented roadmap. Science could start in 2035, informing development of decadal flagship missions after Europa Clipper, to the places revealed to hold the most promise. The fastest pace of scientific discoveries would require access to high-performance propulsion infrastructure, e.g., the Space Launch System, Falcon Heavy, and high-power in-space solar electric propulsion, all capable of halving trip time. Not including these boosts, such a program would cost about a half-billion dollars more per year than NASA's existing mission portfolio; the program architecture funded today cannot deliver a strategic OWEP while also sustaining balance among other solar system exploration priorities and opportunities.

A Smart Web-Based Geospatial Data Discovery System with Oceanographic Data as an Example	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						knowledge base; semantic search; user behavior; metadata; search ranking; recommendation; big data	SEMANTIC SEARCH	Discovering and accessing geospatial data presents a significant challenge for the Earth sciences community as massive amounts of data are being produced on a daily basis. In this article, we report a smart web-based geospatial data discovery system that mines and utilizes data relevancy from metadata user behavior. Specifically, (1) the system enables semantic query expansion and suggestion to assist users in finding more relevant data; (2) machine-learned ranking is utilized to provide the optimal search ranking based on a number of identified ranking features that can reflect users' search preferences; (3) a hybrid recommendation module is designed to allow users to discover related data considering metadata attributes and user behavior; (4) an integrated graphic user interface design is developed to quickly and intuitively guide data consumers to the appropriate data resources. As a proof of concept, we focus on a well-defined domain-oceanography and use oceanographic data discovery as an example. Experiments and a search example show that the proposed system can improve the scientific community's data search experience by providing query expansion, suggestion, better search ranking, and data recommendation via a user-friendly interface.

Part II: Results from Three Wavelength Radar-Collocated In Situ Measurements and CloudSat-GPM-TRMM Radar Data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							SINGLE-SCATTERING PROPERTIES; RAIN-PROFILING ALGORITHM; TERMINAL VELOCITIES; MELTING LAYER; PRECIPITATION; SIZE; UNCERTAINTIES; DISDROMETER; SENSITIVITY; PARTICLES	Two methods for deriving relationships between the equivalent radar reflectivity factor Z(e) and the snowfall rate S at three radar wavelengths are described. The first method uses collocations of in situ aircraft (microphysical observations) and overflying aircraft (radar observations) from two field programs to develop Z(e)-S relationships. In the second method, measurements of Z(e) at the top of the melting layer (ML), from radars on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), and CloudSat satellites, are related to the retrieved rainfall rate R at the base of the ML, assuming that the mass flux through the ML is constant. Retrievals of R are likely to be more reliable than S because far fewer assumptions are involved in the retrieval and because supporting ground-based validation data are available. The Z(e)-S relationships developed here for the collocations and the mass-flux technique are compared with those derived from level 2 retrievals from the standard satellite products and with a number of relationships developed and reported by others. It is shown that there are substantial differences among them. The relationships developed here promise improvements in snowfall-rate retrievals from satellite-based radar measurements.

Signatures of Lithospheric Flexure and Elevated Heat Flow in Stereo Topography at Coronae on Venus	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Venus; lithospheric flexure; planetary tectonics; heat flow	SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; TYPE-2 CORONAE; CONSTRAINTS; THICKNESS; CRUSTAL; INSTABILITY; CONVECTION; TECTONICS; GRAVITY; HISTORY	Signatures of lithospheric flexure were previously identified at a dozen or more large coronae on Venus. Thin plate models fit to topographic profiles return elastic parameters, allowing derivation of mechanical thickness and surface heat flows given an assumed yield strength envelope. However, the low resolution of altimetry data from the NASA Magellan mission has hindered studying the vast majority of coronae, particularly those less than a few hundred kilometers in diameter. Here we search for flexural signatures around 99 coronae over approximate to 20% of the surface in Magellan altimetry data and stereo-derived topography that was recently assembled from synthetic aperture radar images. We derive elastic thicknesses of approximate to 2 to 30km (mostly approximate to 5 to 15km) with Cartesian and axisymmetric models at 19 coronae. We discuss the implications of low values that were also noted in earlier gravity studies. Most mechanical thicknesses are estimated as <19km, corresponding to thermal gradients >24Kkm(-1). Implied surface heat flows >95mWm(-2)twice the global average in many thermal evolution modelsimply that coronae are major contributors to the total heat budget or Venus is cooling faster than expected. Binomial statistics show that Type 2 coronae with incomplete fracture annuli are significantly less likely to host flexural signatures than Type 1 coronae with largely complete annuli. Stress calculations predict extensional faulting where nearly all profiles intersect concentric fractures. We failed to identify systematic variations in flexural parameters based on type, geologic setting, or morphologic class. Obtaining quality, high-resolution topography from a planetwide survey is vital to verifying our conclusions. Plain Language Summary Hundreds of complex and diverse features called coronaecircular structures associated with myriad types of volcanic and tectonic activityhave been identified on the surface of Venus. Coronae have been studied for decades, but the mechanism(s) of their formation remain hotly debated. We analyzed the topography at approximate to 20% of the total population using a relatively new topographic data set assembled from overlapping radar images taken from different angles. We compared elevation profiles radiating outward from each corona to models of how a rigid plate (representing the crust, possibly plus the uppermost mantle) deforms in response to a central load. From our best fit models, we derived the local plate thicknesses followed by temperature gradients and surface heat flows that prevailed when these coronae were formed. Uncertainties in our estimates result from ignorance about the strength of rocks in the crust and mantle. We searched for but failed to find systematic differences in plate thickness as functions of the geologic setting or extent of tectonic fractures. In general, we calculated heat flows that are larger than the global average on present-day Earthroughly twice typical values predicted for Venus, which may cool slowly or even heat up absent plate tectonics. Therefore, we conclude that coronae are sites of above average heat flow on Venus and in fact contribute a significant portion of the total heat loss budget.

The Spectral Nature of Titan's Major Geomorphological Units: Constraints on Surface Composition	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Titan geology; geomorphological units; spectral behavior; radiative transfer; Titan composition; saturnian satellites	HUYGENS LANDING SITE; CASSINI RADAR; DUNE FIELDS; LINE LISTS; METHANE; VIMS; REGION; MODEL; SPECTROSCOPY; DESCENT	We investigate Titan's low-latitude and midlatitude surface using spectro-imaging near-infrared data from Cassini/Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. We use a radiative transfer code to first evaluate atmospheric contributions and then extract the haze and the surface albedo values of major geomorphological units identified in Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar data, which exhibit quite similar spectral response to the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer data. We have identified three main categories of albedo values and spectral shapes, indicating significant differences in the composition among the various areas. We compare with linear mixtures of three components (water ice, tholin-like, and a dark material) at different grain sizes. Due to the limited spectral information available, we use a simplified model, with which we find that each albedo category of regions of interest can be approximately fitted with simulations composed essentially by one of the three surface candidates. Our fits of the data are overall successful, except in some cases at 0.94, 2.03, and 2.79m, indicative of the limitations of our simplistic compositional model and the need for additional components to reproduce Titan's complex surface. Our results show a latitudinal dependence of Titan's surface composition, with water ice being the major constituent at latitudes beyond 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S, while Titan's equatorial region appears to be dominated partly by a tholin-like or by a very dark unknown material. The albedo differences and similarities among the various geomorphological units give insights on the geological processes affecting Titan's surface and, by implication, its interior. We discuss our results in terms of origin and evolution theories. Plain Language Summary Titan, Saturn's moon, has been investigated by the Cassini mission for almost 13 years, unveiling an exotic world with many features similar to Earth. One of the mysteries that still has not been resolved even after that many years of exploration is the nature of its surface composition. Titan is a very complex world with multivariable geology and a very thick and hazy atmosphere that shields the surface from remote sensing observations, prohibiting direct evaluation of its composition. In our study we analyze spectro-imaging data from the Cassini visual and infrared spectrometer. We first infer the atmospheric contribution and then extract true surface properties. We study major geomorphological regions on Titan, which include among other mountains, plains, craters, and dunes. We derive their surface albedo values and shapes that reveal the brightness of the surface and compare them with materials that we expect to find on Titan's surface, such as water ice, tholins (atmospheric products), and a very dark unknown component. The results from this analysis show that Titan presents a pattern in its surface composition distribution with its equator being dominated by organic materials from the atmosphere and a very dark unknown material, while higher latitudes contain more water ice.

We examine the importance of the radiative effects of precipitating ice on simulated surface wind stress and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in terms of seasonal variation and in the evolution of central Pacific El Nino (CP-El Nino) events. Using controlled simulations with the CESM1 model, we show that the exclusion of precipitating ice radiative effects generates a persistent excessive upper-level radiative cooling and an increasingly unstable atmosphere over convective regions such as the western Pacific and tropical convergence zones. The invigorated convection leads to persistent anomalous low-level outflows which weaken the easterly trade winds, reducing upper-ocean mixing and leading to a positive SST bias in the model mean state. In CP-El Nino events, this means that outflow from the modeled convection in the central Pacific reduces winds to the east, allowing unrealistic eastward propagation of warm SST anomalies following the peak in CP-El Nino activity. Including the radiative effects of precipitating ice reduces these model biases and improves the simulated life cycle of the CP-El Nino. Improved simulations of present-day tropical seasonal variations and CP-El Nino events would increase the confidence in simulating their future behavior. Plain Language Summary Despite considerable progress, coupled GCMs are still far from accurately representing tropical Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, mainly due to the involvement of complex air-sea interactions and sophisticated atmospheric and oceanic processes. In this study, we have identified the exclusion of atmospheric precipitating large-particle ice (also known as falling snow) radiative effects, as in most global climate models do not represent this effect, as an important factor. Our results suggest that the inclusion of the contribution of the precipitating ice and its radiative effects in models is important to improve the simulation of the Pacific mean state, seasonal cycle, and CP-El Nino.

Opening of glacial Lake Agassiz's eastern outlets by the start of the Younger Dryas cold period	GEOLOGY			English	Article							LAURENTIDE ICE-SHEET; FRESH-WATER; ARCTIC-OCEAN; THUNDER-BAY; MELTWATER; DEGLACIATION; ONTARIO; CHRONOLOGY; DRAINAGE; CLIMATE	The Younger Dryas (12.9 +/- 0.1 to 11.7 +/- 0.1 ka) was a return to cold conditions in the Northern Hemisphere during the last deglaciation. This climatic event was hypothesized to have been caused by a change in glacial Lake Agassiz (north-central North America) overflow from its routing to the Gulf of Mexico to an easterly route to the North Atlantic due to Laurentide ice-sheet retreat from the Lake Superior basin, which caused a reduction in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Alternative models argue that Lake Agassiz triggered the Younger Dryas via northwestward routing to the Arctic Ocean. We present new 10Be surface exposure ages that directly date ice retreat from eastern Lake Agassiz outlets and show that the area was ice free at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The southernmost eastern channels opened at 14.0 +/- 0.4 ka and 13.6 +/- 0.2 ka, but an ice-free route through the Lake Superior basin only opened after 13.5 +/- 0.5 ka. The main eastern channel to the eastern Great Lakes and North Atlantic opened at 13.0 +/- 0.1 ka to 12.7 +/- 0.3 ka. This channel opening was concurrent with decreased runoff to the Gulf of Mexico and increased runoff through the lower Great Lakes to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and North Atlantic. Gulf of St. Lawrence runoff records and isostatic-rebound modeling suggest eastern outlet abandonment at ca. 12.2 ka, with possible northwestward routing of runoff. Our results confirm that Lake Agassiz overflow could have been routed eastward to the North Atlantic at the Younger Dryas onset and caused the canonical abrupt climate change event.

J	Kurowski, MJ; Teixeira, J				Kurowski, Marcin J.; Teixeira, Joao			A Scale-Adaptive Turbulent Kinetic Energy Closure for the Dry Convective Boundary Layer	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article							EDDY-DIFFUSIVITY PARAMETERIZATION; MIXING-LENGTH FORMULATION; MIXED LAYERS; MODEL; ZONE; REPRESENTATION; SIMULATION; TRANSPORT; RESOLUTION; FLUX	Apragmatic scale-adaptive turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) closure is proposed to simulate the dry convective boundary layer for a variety of horizontal grid resolutions: from 50m, typical of large-eddy simulation models that use three-dimensional turbulence parameterizations/closures, up to 100km, typical of climate models that use one-dimensional turbulence and convection parameterizations/closures. Since parameterizations/closures using the TKE approach have been frequently used in these two asymptotic limits, a simple method is proposed to merge them with a mixing-length-scale formulation for intermediate resolutions. This new scale-adaptive mixing length naturally increases with increasing grid length until it saturates as the grid length reaches mesoscale-model resolution. The results obtained using this new approach for dry convective boundary layers are promising. The mean vertical profiles of potential temperature and heat flux remain in good agreement for different resolutions. A continuous transition (in terms of resolution) across the gray zone is illustrated through the partitioning between the model-resolved and the subgrid-scale transports as well as by documenting the transition of the subgrid-scale TKE source/sink terms. In summary, a natural and continuous transition across resolutions (from 50m to 100km) is obtained, for dry convection, using exactly the same atmosphericmodel for all resolutions with a simple scale-adaptive mixing-length formulation.

A highpriority technology area identified in need of development for a future starshade mission is the development and validation of high-fidelity optical models to predict the performance of a full-scale starshade. We present the generalization of an algorithm to formulate the Fresnel diffraction equation as a one-dimensional integral around the edge of an arbitrary binary diffraction screen. Our edge integral provides an efficient method for capturing diffraction over a large range of size scales and is computationally superior to standard two-dimensional codes. We also present a novel method to implement wavefront errors with the edge integral. This paper provides the derivation of the algorithms and their validation with comparisons to known solutions and results from standard Fresnel propagation codes.

Implications for Clathrate Hydrates and Outgassing on Titan	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						clathrate hydrates; ammonia; Titan; calorimetry; Raman spectroscopy; phase diagram	RAMAN; PRESSURE; METHANE; ATMOSPHERE; SPECTRUM; BEHAVIOR; ORIGIN	Titan's icy shell is expected to contain predominantly methane clathrate hydrates, water ice Ih, and possibly ammonia hydrates, beneath a cover of diverse organics formed via atmospheric photochemistry. The dissociation of clathrate hydrates has long been inferred as a potential replenishment mechanism for atmospheric methane; however, pure methane clathrates would be stable all the way to the surface. The melting of ammonia hydrates and subsequent interaction with methane clathrates could favor the dissociation of clathrates at much lower temperatures, due to the strong antifreeze effect of ammonia. To better understand the phase behavior of clathrate hydrates in the presence of ammonia, we have developed phase diagrams for the ternary system water ammonia tetrahydrofuran at 1 bar and in the temperature range 77-280 K via differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy. We have been able to determine how ammonia promotes the start of a partial dissociation of THF clathrates at temperatures far colder than the liquidus. We have also established that this ternary system exhibits a complex chemistry, with multiple phases forming in thermodynamic equilibrium because of a phase separation between a THF-dominated liquid and a H2O-NH3 dominated liquid. In addition to the expected THF clathrates, we report the formation of other mineral phases such as ammonia hydrates, a new THF NH3-rich phase, and potentially mixed THF-NH3 clathrates. Partial dissociation of 40% of the clathrate reservoir would release to Titan's atmosphere methane amounts sufficient to sustain the hydrocarbon cycle for 650 My, which is commensurate with the age of the present atmosphere.

Coupling between marine boundary layer clouds and summer-to-summer sea surface temperature variability over the North Atlantic and Pacific	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Clouds; Marine boundary layer; Climate variability; Sea surface temperature; Climate models	MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS; HEAT-FLUX; FEEDBACK; CLIMATE; SST; MODEL; OCEAN; SYSTEM; WINTER	Climate modes of variability over the Atlantic and Pacific may be amplified by a positive feedback between sea-surface temperature (SST) and marine boundary layer clouds. However, it is well known that climate models poorly simulate this feedback. Does this deficiency contribute to model-to-model differences in the representation of climate modes of variability? Over both the North Atlantic and Pacific, typical summertime interannual to interdecadal SST variability exhibits horseshoe-like patterns of co-located anomalies of shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE), low-level cloud fraction, SST, and estimated inversion strength over the subtropics and midlatitudes that are consistent with a positive cloud feedback. During winter over the midlatitudes, this feedback appears to be diminished. Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 that simulate a weak feedback between subtropical SST and shortwave CRE produce smaller and less realistic amplitudes of summertime SST and CRE variability over the northern oceans compared to models with a stronger feedback. The change in SST amplitude per unit change in CRE amplitude among the models and observations may be understood as the temperature response of the ocean mixed layer to a unit change in radiative flux over the course of a season. These results highlight the importance of boundary layer clouds in interannual to interdecadal atmosphere-ocean variability over the northern oceans during summer. The results also suggest that deficiencies in the simulation of these clouds in coupled climate models contribute to underestimation in their simulation of summer-to-summer SST variability.

The reliability of GEFA at capturing the terrestrial impacts on regional climate is demonstrated here using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model (CESM), with focus on North Africa. The feedback is assessed statistically by applying GEFA to output from a fully coupled control run. To reduce the sampling error caused by short data records, the traditional or full GEFA is refined through stepwise GEFA by dropping unimportant forcings. Two ensembles of dynamical experiments are developed for the Sahel or West African monsoon region against which GEFA-based vegetation feedbacks are evaluated. In these dynamical experiments, regional leaf area index (LAI) is modified either alone or in conjunction with soil moisture, with the latter runs motivated by strong regional soil moisture-LAI coupling. Stepwise GEFA boasts higher consistency between statistically and dynamically assessed atmospheric responses to land surface anomalies than full GEFA, especially with short data records. GEFA-based atmospheric responses are more consistent with the coupled soil moisture-LAI experiments, indicating that GEFA is assessing the combined impacts of coupled vegetation and soil moisture. Both the statistical and dynamical assessments reveal a negative vegetation-rainfall feedback in the Sahel associated with an atmospheric stability mechanism in CESM versus a weaker positive feedback in the West African monsoon region associated with a moisture recycling mechanism in CESM.

Transparency of 2 mu m window of Titan's atmosphere	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							HUYGENS LANDING SITE; ADAPTIVE OPTICS; SURFACE; CLOUDS; CASSINI/VIMS; AEROSOLS; SPECTRUM; METHANE; ALBEDO; IMAGES	Titan's atmosphere is optically thick and hides the surface and the lower layers from the view at almost all wavelengths. However, because gaseous absorptions are spectrally selective, some narrow spectral intervals are relatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these intervals (called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once gas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows depends on the way the far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off. We know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same cut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 mu m. This discrepancy is generally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off description for this specific window. This window is relatively transparent and surface may have specific spectral signatures that could be detected. Thus, a good knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better understand what causes the difference between the 2 mu m window and the other windows. In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in occultation observed with VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard Cassini, around the 2 mu m window. Data shows an absorption feature that participates to the shape of this window. Our atmospheric model fits well the VIMS data at 2 mu m with the same cut-off than for the other windows, provided an additional absorption is introduced in the middle of the window around similar or equal to 2.065 mu m. It explains well the discrepency between the cut-off used at 2 mu m, and we show that a gas with a fairly constant mixing ratio, possibly ethane, may be the cause of this absorption. Finally, we studied the impact of this absorption on the retrieval of the surface reflectivity and found that it is significant.

In this work, we present predictions from a galaxy formation model, GALACTICUS, for the cumulative number counts of Ha-emitting galaxies. We couple GALACTICUS to three different dust attenuation methods and examine the counts using each method. A chi(2) minimisation approach is used to compare the model predictions to observed galaxy counts and calibrate the dust parameters. We find that weak dust attenuation is required for the GALACTICUS counts to be broadly consistent with the observations, though the optimum dust parameters return large values for chi(2), suggesting that further calibration of GALACTICUS is necessary. The model predictions are also consistent with observed estimates for the optical depth and the Ha luminosity function. Finally, we present forecasts for the redshift distributions and number counts for two Euclid-like and one WFIRST-like surveys. For a Euclid-like survey with redshift range of 0.9 <= z <= 1.8 and H alpha + [N II] blended flux limit of 2 x 10(-16) erg s(-1) cm(-2), we predict a number density between 3900 and 4800 galaxies per square degree. For a WFIRST-like survey with redshift range of 1 <= z <= 2 and blended flux limit of 1 x 10(-16) erg s(-1) cm(-2), we predict a number density between 10400 and 15200 galaxies per square degree.

Hubble PanCET: an isothermal day-side atmosphere for the bloated gas-giant HAT-P-32Ab	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: spectroscopic; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual: HAT-P-32Ab; stars: individual: HAT-P-32A	SYSTEMATIC RETRIEVAL ANALYSIS; EXOPLANET HD 189733B; TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM; HOT JUPITERS; SPACE-TELESCOPE; TEMPERATURE INVERSION; MODEL ATMOSPHERES; DWARF ATMOSPHERES; EMISSION-SPECTRUM; THERMAL INVERSION	We present a thermal emission spectrum of the bloated hot Jupiter HAT-P-32Ab from a single eclipse observation made in spatial scan mode with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectrum covers the wavelength regime from 1.123 to 1.644 mu m which is binned into 14 eclipse depths measured to an averaged precision of 104 parts-per million. The spectrum is unaffected by a dilution from the close M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B, which was fully resolved. We complemented our spectrum with literature results and performed a comparative forward and retrieval analysis with the 1D radiative-convective ATMO model. Assuming solar abundance of the planet atmosphere, we find that the measured spectrum can best be explained by the spectrum of a blackbody isothermal atmosphere with T-p = 1995 +/- 17 K, but can equally well be described by a spectrum with modest thermal inversion. The retrieved spectrum suggests emission from VO at the WFC3 wavelengths and no evidence of the 1.4 mu m water feature. The emission models with temperature profiles decreasing with height are rejected at a high confidence. An isothermal or inverted spectrum can imply a clear atmosphere with an absorber, a dusty cloud deck or a combination of both. We find that the planet can have continuum of values for the albedo and recirculation, ranging from high albedo and poor recirculation to low albedo and efficient recirculation. Optical spectroscopy of the planet's day-side or thermal emission phase curves can potentially resolve the current albedo with recirculation degeneracy.	[Nikolov, N.; Sing, D.

We extend our methodology from the first paper in the series by modelling the production and extinction of emission lines throughout a dusty and metal-enriched interstellar and circum-galactic media extracted from the simulation, using a Monte Carlo calculation. To capture the impact of high-energy photons, we include all frequencies from hard X-ray to far-infrared with enough frequency resolution to discern line emission and absorption profiles. The most common lines in our sample in order of their rate of occurrence are Ly alpha, the CIV lambda lambda 1548, 1551 doublet, H alpha, and the Ca II lambda lambda lambda 8498, 8542, 8662 triplet. The best scenario for a direct observation of a metal-free stellar population is a merger between two Population III Galaxies. In mergers between metal-enriched and metal-free stellar populations, some characteristics may be inferred indirectly. Single Population III galaxies are too dim to be observed photometrically at z = 15. Ly alpha emission is discernible by JWST as an increase in J(200w) - J(277w) colour off the intrinsic stellar tracks. Observations of metal-free stars will be difficult, though not impossible, with the next generation of space telescopes.	[Barrow, Kirk S.

With the intent of investigating possible sources of vulnerability in autonomous frameworks, we formalize a procedure malicious players can follow to influence other. In this paper we propose a strategy for steering a UAV towards predetermined targets. The strategy described here relies on the existence of a flight information sharing protocol (i.e. ADS-B) and predictable collision avoidance algorithms. A model predictive controller is applied to the switching system representing a pair of UAVs coupled by the presence of an imminent collision. As showed by means of numerical simulations and robot experiments, the result is a loss of autonomy on the UAV. Our results suggest the need to include the subject of our study in the discussion on safe automated airspace. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This estimation scheme seeks to minimally reduce the necessary bandwidth for communication while maintaining overall stability. A weaker form of the separation principle is proven to hold whereby control could be designed independently but not estimation. However, actuation limitations still provide the possibility for a semi-independent design of estimators. Numerical simulations confirm that the stability depends very heavily on consensus on estimation and ultimately the amount of information available to the system as it evolves.

To model the gas phase, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach is used and a kinetic theory based model is employed for the solid phase. Three-dimensional time-dependent simulations are conducted for the purpose of elucidating the morphological features of the crater and their evolution with time. Parametric variations of the initial conditions are performed to understand the effect of the initial solid volume fraction in the bed, of the coefficient of restitution, of the jet Mach number, of the particle diameter, and of the particle material density. Simulation snapshots of the craters are in qualitative agreement with images from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission and from Earth-based experiments. Analysis of the results shows that solid particle compaction at the crater base and side walls increases with increasing volume fraction of the undisturbed particle bed and reaches solid volume fractions close to 0.65. The coefficient of restitution is shown to have no effect on the large scale dynamics of the crater but affects the small scale features, particularly the shape of elongated bursts of solid particle clouds as well as radially aligned structures on the outer crater walls. A smaller jet Mach number results In a smaller crater characterized by ridge-like structures and walls at an angle of approximately 45 with respect to the undisturbed bed whereas larger Mach number jets create craters with walls approximately perpendicular to the undisturbed bed. A smaller particle size and a lighter particle material density also result in wider and deeper craters. The formation of all morphological structures is explained in detail and is related to the physical phenomena from which they originate. Power law curve fits are also presented for the crater outer diameter as well as for the depth. The mean and rms profiles of the solid volume fraction are computed. and it is found that the peak rms in the solid volume fraction does not occur at the surface but rather in the depth of the crater. In addition, the mean and rms of the particle momentum flux are also computed and discussed. Furthermore, the sources of particle momentum are evaluated, and the viscous drag as well as the gas pressure gradient are observed to be the prominent effects. The results show that the model developed is robust and is able to simulate craters due to a range of external conditions operating over particle beds having different characteristics.

Super-Eddington accretion on to the neutron star NGC7793 P13: Broad-band X-ray spectroscopy and ultraluminous X-ray sources	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: neutron; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual: NGC7793 P13	XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; HOLMBERG IX X-1; NGC 5907 ULX1; BLACK-HOLE; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; NUSTAR J095551+6940.8; SPECTRAL VARIABILITY; SUZAKU OBSERVATIONS; LIKELIHOOD RATIO; IC 342	We present a detailed, broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) pulsar NGC7793 P13, a known super-Eddington source, utilizing data from the XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra observatories. The broad-band XMM-Newton+ NuSTAR spectrum of P13 is qualitatively similar to the rest of the ULX sample with broad-band coverage, suggesting that additional ULXs in the known population may host neutron star accretors. Through time-averaged, phase-resolved and multi-epoch studies, we find that two non-pulsed thermal blackbody components with temperatures similar to 0.5 and 1.5 keV are required to fit the data below 10 keV, in addition to a third continuum component which extends to higher energies and is associated with the pulsed emission from the accretion column. The characteristic radii of the thermal components appear to be comparable, and are too large to be associated with the neutron star itself, so the need for two components likely indicates the accretion flow outside the magnetosphere is complex. We suggest a scenario in which the thick inner disc expected for super-Eddington accretion begins to form, but is terminated by the neutron star's magnetic field soon after its onset, implying a limit of B less than or similar to 6 x 10(12) G for the dipolar component of the central neutron star's magnetic field. Evidence of similar termination of the disc in other sources may offer a further means of identifying additional neutron star ULXs. Finally, we examine the spectrum exhibited by P13 during one of its unusual 'off' states. These data require both a hard power-law component, suggesting residual accretion on to the neutron star, and emission from a thermal plasma, which we argue is likely associated with the P13 system.

Disentangling the complex broad-band X-ray spectrum of IRAS 13197-1627 with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton and Suzaku	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; X-rays: individual: IRAS 13197-1627	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLE SPIN; INNER ACCRETION DISK; K-ALPHA LINE; NGC 1365; REFLECTION SPECTROSCOPY; RELATIVISTIC REFLECTION; EMISSION-LINES; OUTFLOWING GAS; CYGNUS X-1	We present results from a coordinated XMM-Newton+NuSTAR observation of the type 1.8 Seyfert galaxy IRAS 13197-1627. This is a highly complex source, with strong contributions from relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disc, neutral absorption and further reprocessing by more distant material, and ionized absorption from an outflow. We undertake a detailed spectral analysis combining the broad-band coverage provided by XMM-Newton+NuSTAR with amulti-epoch approach incorporating archival observations performed by XMM-Newton and Suzaku. Our focus is on characterizing the reflection from the inner accretion disc, which previous works have suggested may dominate the AGN emission, and constraining the black hole spin. Using lamppost disc reflection models, we find that the results for the inner disc are largely insensitive to assumptions regarding the geometry of the distant reprocessor and the precise form of the illuminating X-ray continuum. However, these results do depend on the treatment of the iron abundance of the distant absorber/ reprocessor. The multi-epoch data favour a scenario in which the AGN is chemically homogeneous, and we find that a rapidly rotating black hole is preferred, with a* >= 0.7, but a slowly rotating black hole is not strongly excluded. In addition to the results for the inner disc, we also find that both the neutral and ionized absorbers vary from epoch to epoch, implying that both have some degree of inhomogeneity in their structure.

A new method for extending solutions to the self-similar relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations for black hole outflows	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; MHD stars: jets; methods: numerical; galaxies: jets	MAGNETICALLY DRIVEN JETS; LINKING ACCRETION FLOW; GAMMA-RAY EMISSION; M87 JET; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; SYNCHROTRON EMISSION; XTE J1118+480; CYGNUS X-1; ASTROPHYSICAL OUTFLOWS; SPECTRAL STATE	The paradigm in which magnetic fields play a crucial role in launching/collimating outflows in many astrophysical objects continues to gain support. However, semi-analytical models including the effect of magnetic fields on the dynamics and morphology of jets are still missing due to the intrinsic difficulties in integrating the equations describing a collimated, relativistic flow in the presence of gravity. Only few solutions have been found so far, due to the highly non-linear character of the equations together with the need to blindly search for singularities. These numerical problems prevented a full exploration of the parameter space. We present a new integration scheme to solve r-self-similar, stationary, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations describing collimated, relativistic outflows crossing smoothly all the singular points (Alfven point and modified slow/fast points). For the first time, we are able to integrate from the disc mid-plane to downstream of the modified fast point. We discuss an ensemble of jet solutions, emphasizing trends and features that can be compared to observables. We present, for the first time with a semi-analytical MHD model, solutions showing counter-rotation of the jet for a substantial fraction of its extent. We find diverse jet configurations with bulk Lorentz factors up to 10 and potential sites for recollimation between 10(3) and 10(7) gravitational radii. Such extended coverage of the intervals of quantities, such as magnetic-to-thermal energy ratios at the base or the heights/widths of the recollimation region, makes our solutions suitable for application to many different systems where jets are launched.

We report 413 astrometric and photometric measurements of 373 stellar pairs. The astrometric measurements will be of use for future orbital determination, and the photometric measurements will be of use in estimating the spectral types of the component stars. For 21 binaries that had not been observed in decades, we are able to confirm that the systems share common proper motion. Candidate new companions were detected in 24 systems; for these we show the discovery images. Follow-up observations should be able to determine if these systems share common proper motion and are gravitationally bound objects. We computed orbits for nine binaries. Of these, the orbits of five systems are improved compared to prior orbits and four systems have their orbits computed for the first time. In addition, 315 stars were unresolved and the full-width half maxima of the images are presented.

No single physical mechanism has successfully explained these observations to date. Here we investigate the ultraviolet variability of KIC 8462852 on a range of timescales using data from the GALEX mission that occurred contemporaneously with the Kepler mission. The wide wavelength baseline between the Kepler and GALEX data provides a unique constraint on the nature of the variability. Using 1600 s of photon-counting data from four GALEX visits spread over 70 days in 2011, we find no coherent NUV variability in the system on 10-100 s or month timescales. Comparing the integrated flux from these 2011 visits to the 2012 NUV flux published in the GALEX-CAUSE Kepler survey, we find a 3% decrease in brightness for KIC 8462852. We find that this level of variability is significant, but not necessarily unusual for stars of similar spectral type in the GALEX data. This decrease coincides with the secular optical fading reported by Montet & Simon. We find that the multi-wavelength variability is somewhat inconsistent with typical interstellar dust absorption, but instead favors a R-V = 5.0 +/- 0.9 reddening law potentially from circumstellar dust.

J	Hensley, BS; Bull, P				Hensley, Brandon S.; Bull, Philip			Mitigating Complex Dust Foregrounds in Future Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Experiments	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; ISM: general; methods: statistical	INTERSTELLAR DUST; INFRARED-EMISSION; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; RADIATION; MODEL; TEMPERATURES; SEPARATION	Polarized Galactic foregrounds are one of the primary sources of systematic error in measurements of the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Experiments are becoming increasingly sensitive to complexities in the foreground frequency spectra that are not captured by standard parametric models, potentially affecting our ability to efficiently separate out these components. Employing a suite of dust models encompassing a variety of physical effects, we simulate observations of a future seven-band CMB experiment to assess the impact of these complexities on parametric component separation. We identify configurations of frequency bands that minimize the "model errors" caused by fitting simple parametric models to more complex "true" foreground spectra, which bias the inferred CMB signal. We find that: (a) fits employing a simple two-parameter modified blackbody (MBB) dust model tend to produce significant bias in the recovered polarized CMB signal in the presence of physically realistic dust foregrounds; (b) generalized MBB models with three additional parameters reduce this bias in most cases, but non-negligible biases can remain, and can be hard to detect; (c) line-of-sight effects, which give rise to frequency decorrelation, and the presence of iron grains are the most problematic complexities in the dust emission for recovering the true CMB signal.

We simulate the gas and dust dynamics in the disk using the LA-COMPASS hydrodynamical code. We generate synthetic images for the dust continuum emission at submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths and simulate ALMA and ngVLA observations. We explore the parameter space of some of the main disk and planet properties that would produce substructures that can be visible with ALMA and the ngVLA. We find that ngVLA observations with an angular resolution of 5 milliarcsec at 3 mm can reveal and characterize gaps and azimuthal asymmetries in disks hosting planets with masses down to approximate to 5 M-circle plus approximate to 1-5 au from a solar-like star in the closest star-forming regions, whereas ALMA can detect gaps down to planetary masses of approximate to 20 M-circle plus at 5 au. Gaps opened by super-Earth planets with masses approximate to 5-10 M-circle plus are detectable by the ngVLA in the case of disks with low viscosity (alpha similar to 10(-5)) and low pressure scale height (h approximate to 0.025 au at 5 au). The ngVLA can measure the proper motion of azimuthal asymmetric structures associated with the disk-planet interaction as well as possible circumplanetary disks on timescales as short as one to a few weeks for planets at 1-5 au from the star.

The design is similar to a parallel plate capacitor in which one plate has "holes" or gaps. The gaps allow the electric field to "leak" through, which can, under certain circumstances, create a stronger electric field than a conventional design. The design was optimized using PEA, and experimental results show that combining the new design with an improved fabrication method that increases the flexibility of the adhesive results in a 6 x increase in the shear stress to disengage the adhesive from the substrate.

Response of Pacific-sector Antarctic ice shelves to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE; ATMOSPHERIC CLIMATE MODEL; CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; WEST ANTARCTICA; PINE ISLAND; SNOW ACCUMULATION; THWAITES GLACIER; TIME-SERIES	Satellite observations over the past two decades have revealed increasing loss of grounded ice in West Antarctica, associated with floating ice shelves that have been thinning. Thinning reduces an ice shelf's ability to restrain grounded-ice discharge, yet our understanding of the climate processes that drive mass changes is limited. Here, we use ice-shelf height data from four satellite altimeter missions (1994-2017) to show a direct link between ice-shelf height variability in the Antarctic Pacific sector and changes in regional atmospheric circulation driven by the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. This link is strongest from the Dotson to Ross ice shelves and weaker elsewhere. During intense El Nino years, height increase by accumulation exceeds the height decrease by basal melting, but net ice-shelf mass declines as basal ice loss exceeds ice gain by lower-density snow. Our results demonstrate a substantial response of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to global and regional climate variability, with rates of change in height and mass on interannual timescales that can be comparable to the longer-term trend, and with mass changes from surface accumulation offsetting a significant fraction of the changes in basal melting. This implies that ice-shelf height and mass variability will increase as interannual atmospheric variability increases in a warming climate.	[Paolo, F. S.; Fricker, H.

However, the river network, as defined by the 1:100,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset-Plus (NHDPlus) dataset, consists of 2.7 million river segments. Through the National Flood Interoperability Experiment, a continental scale streamflow simulation and forecast system was implemented and continuously operated through the summer of 2015. This system leveraged the WRF-Hydro framework, initialized on a 3-km grid, the Routing Application for the Parallel Computation of Discharge river routing model, operating on the NHDPlus, and real-time atmospheric forcing to continuously forecast streamflow. Although this system produced forecasts, this paper presents a study of the three-month nowcast to demonstrate the capacity to seamlessly predict reach scale streamflow at the continental scale. In addition, this paper evaluates the impact of reservoirs, through a case study in Texas. Validation of the uncalibrated model using observed hourly streamflow at 5,701 U.S. Geological Survey gages shows 26% demonstrate PBias|25%|, 11% demonstrate Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)0.25, and 6% demonstrate both PBias|25%| and NSE0.25. When evaluating the impact of reservoirs, the analysis shows when reservoirs are included, NSE0.25 for 56% of the gages downstream while NSE0.25 for 11% when they are not. The results presented here provide a benchmark for the evolving hydrology program within the NWS and supports their efforts to develop a reach scale flood forecasting system for the country.

The (CH4)-C-13 absorption spectrum at 80 K: Assignment and modeling of the lower part of the Tetradecad in the 4970-5470 cm(-1) spectral range	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Methane; (CH4)-C-13; Absorption spectroscopy; Spectra analyses; Effective Hamiltonian; Lower Tetradecad; Variational calculations; HITRAN	VIBRATION-ROTATION RESONANCES; MIRS COMPUTER PACKAGE; EMPIRICAL LINE LISTS; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; TETRAHEDRAL MOLECULES; INFRARED-SPECTRUM; CONTACT TRANSFORMATIONS; ROVIBRATIONAL SPECTRA; INVARIANT PARAMETERS; 2-NU(3) BAND	A C-13-enriched spectrum of methane ((CH4)-C-13) was recorded at Doppler-limited resolution (0.0044 cm(-1)) at 80K covering the entire Tetradecad region in the 4970-6200 cm(-1). In this paper we present the spectral analysis of the lower part of the (CH4)-C-13 Tetradecad in the 4970-5470 cm(-1) region. Starting with a non-empirical effective Hamiltonian derived by high-order Contact Transformations (CT) from the ab initio potential energy surface (PES), the effective Hamiltonian parameters have been determined for this region by extending the previous DAS (Differential Absorption Spectroscopy) spectral analysis for the upper part of the Tetradecad in the 5853-6200 cm(-1) region. In total, 1387 rovibrational transitions were assigned belonging to five cold bands of the Tetradecad up to J(max) = 11. Their positions were fitted with an rms deviation of 1.6 x 10(-3) cm(-1). Measured line intensities for 737 transitions were modeled using the effective dipole transition moments approach with an rms deviation of about 10%. Finally, the observed transitions were incorporated to fit simultaneously the (CH4)-C-13 Hamiltonian parameters for the {Ground state / Dyad / Pentad / Octad Tetradecad} system and the dipole moment parameters for the {Ground state - Tetradecad} system.

The radar's transmitter uses high-power-handling GaAs Schottky diodes to generate between 15-23 dBm over a 10-GHz bandwidth near 183 GHz. By virtue of a high-isolation circular polarization duplexer, the monostatic radar's receiver maintains a noise figure of about 7 dB even while the transmitter is on. With an antenna gain of 40 dB, high-SNR detection of light rain is achieved out to several hundred meters distance. Owing to the strong spectral dependence of the atmospheric absorption over the upper flank of the 183-GHz water absorption line, range-resolved measurements of absolute humidity can be obtained by ratioing the rain echoes over both range and frequency. Absorption measurements obtained are consistent with models of atmospheric millimeter-wave attenuation, and they demonstrate a new method for improving the accuracy of humidity measurements inside of clouds.

As part of this analysis, we develop a new variant of pixel-level decorrelation that is effective at removing intrapixel sensitivity variations for long observations (>10 hr) where the position of the star can vary by a significant fraction of a pixel. Using this algorithm, we measure eclipse depths, phase amplitudes, and phase offsets for both planets at 3.6 and 4.5 mu m. We use a simple toy model to show that WASP-33b's phase offset, albedo, and heat recirculation efficiency are largely similar to those of other hot Jupiters despite its very high irradiation. On the other hand, our fits for HD 149026b prefer a very high albedo. We also compare our results to predictions from general circulation models, and we find that while neither planet matches the models well, the discrepancies for HD 149026b are especially large. We speculate that this may be related to its high bulk metallicity, which could lead to enhanced atmospheric opacities and the formation of reflective cloud layers in localized regions of the atmosphere. We then place these two planets in a broader context by exploring relationships between the temperatures, albedos, heat transport efficiencies, and phase offsets of all planets with published thermal phase curves. We find a striking relationship between phase offset and irradiation temperature: the former drops with increasing temperature until around 3400 K and rises thereafter. Although some aspects of this trend are mirrored in the circulation models, there are notable differences that provide important clues for future modeling efforts.

Combining Spitzer Parallax and Keck II Adaptive Optics Imaging to Measure the Mass of a Solar-like Star Orbited by a Cold Gaseous Planet Discovered by Microlensing	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems; planets and satellites: detection	M-CIRCLE-DOT; SYSTEMS; DISTANCES	To obtain accurate mass measurements for cold planets discovered by microlensing, it is usually necessary to combine light curve modeling with at least two lens mass-distance relations. The physical parameters of the planetary system OGLE-2014-BLG-0124L have been constrained thanks to accurate parallax effect between ground-based and simultaneous space-based Spitzer observations. Here, we resolved the source+lens star from sub-arcsecond blends in H-band using adaptive optics (AO) observations with NIRC2 mounted on Keck II telescope. We identify additional flux, coincident with the source to within 160 mas. We estimate the potential contributions to this blended light (chance-aligned star, additional companion to the lens or to the source) and find that 85% of the NIR flux is due to the lens star at H-L = 16.63. +/- 0.06 and K-L = 16.44 +/- 0.06. We combined the parallax constraint and the AO constraint to derive the physical parameters of the system. The lensing system is composed of a mid-late type G main sequence star of M-L = 0.9 +/- 0.05. M-circle dot located at D-L = 3.5 +/- 0.2. kpc in the Galactic disk. Taking the mass ratio and projected separation from the original study leads to a planet of M-p = 0.65 +/- 0.044. M-Jupiter at 3.48 +/- 0.22. au. Excellent parallax measurements from simultaneous ground-space observations have been obtained on the microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-0124, but it is only when they are combined with similar to 30 minutes of Keck II AO observations that the physical parameters of the host star are well measured.

Typically, a nominal trajectory is designed in a deterministic system. To account for model and execution errors, mission designers heuristically add margins, for example, by reducing the thrust and specific impulse or by computing penalties for specific failures. These conventional methods are time-consuming, done by hand by experts, and lead to conservative margins. This paper introduces a new method to compute nominal trajectories, taking into account disturbances. The method is based on stochastic differential dynamic programming, which has been used in the field of reinforcement learning but not yet in astrodynamics. A modified version of stochastic differential dynamic programming is proposed, where the stochastic dynamical system is modeled as the deterministic dynamical system with random state perturbations, the perturbed trajectories are corrected by linear feedback control policies, and the expected value is computed with the unscented transform method, which enables solving trajectory design problems. Finally, numerical examples are presented, where the solutions of the proposed method are more robust to errors and require fewer penalties than those computed with traditional approaches, when uncertainties are introduced.

Disk Masses from ALMA Continuum Observations	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; protoplanetary disks; stars: formation; stars: low-mass; stars: pre-main sequence Supporting material: machine-readable table	STAR-FORMING REGION; AURIGA MOLECULAR CLOUD; GIANT PLANET FORMATION; YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; SIGMA ORIONIS CLUSTER; DIGITIZED SKY SURVEY; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; BROWN DWARF DISKS; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; TERRESTRIAL PLANETS	We report 885 mu m ALMA continuum flux densities for 24 Taurus members spanning the stellar/substellar boundary with spectral types from M4 to M7.75. Of the 24 systems, 22 are detected at levels ranging from 1.0 to 55.7 mJy. The two nondetections are transition disks, though other transition disks in the sample are detected. Converting ALMA continuum measurements to masses using standard scaling laws and radiative transfer modeling yields dust mass estimates ranging from similar to 0.3 to 20M(circle plus). The dust mass shows a declining trend with central object mass when combined with results from submillimeter surveys of more massive Taurus members. The substellar disks appear as part of a continuous sequence and not a distinct population. Compared to older Upper Sco members with similar masses across the substellar limit, the Taurus disks are brighter and more massive. Both Taurus and Upper Sco populations are consistent with an approximately linear relationship in M-dust to M-star, although derived power-law slopes depend strongly upon choices of stellar evolutionary model and dust temperature relation. The median disk around early-M stars in Taurus contains a comparable amount of mass in small solids as the average amount of heavy elements in Kepler planetary systems on short-period orbits around M-dwarf stars, with an order of magnitude spread in disk dust mass about the median value. Assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100:1, only a small number of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs have a total disk mass amenable to giant planet formation, consistent with the low frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs.

Meter-scale thermal contraction crack polygons on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ICARUS			English	Article						Comets; Nucleus; Geological processes	BEACON VALLEY; GLACIER ICE; MARS; SUBLIMATION; EVOLUTION; SURFACE; PERMAFROST; FEATURES; FATIGUE; SHAPES	We report on the detection and characterization of more than 6300 polygons on the surface of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, using images acquired by the OSIRIS camera onboard Rosetta between August 2014 and March 2015. They are found in consolidated terrains and grouped in localized networks. They are present at all latitudes (from North to South) and longitudes (head, neck, and body), sometimes on pit walls or following lineaments. About 1.5% of the observed surface is covered by polygons. Polygons have an homogeneous size across the nucleus, with 90% of them in the size range 1 - 5 m and a mean size of 3.0 +/- 1.4 m. They show different morphologies, depending on the width and depth of their trough. They are found in networks with 3- or 4-crack intersection nodes. The polygons observed on 67P are consistent with thermal contraction crack polygons formed by the diurnal or seasonal temperature variations in a hard (MPa) and consolidated sintered layer of water ice, located a few centimeters below the surface. Our thermal analysis shows an evolution of thermal contraction crack polygons according to the local thermal environment, with more evolved polygons (i.e. deeper and larger troughs) where the temperature and the diurnal and seasonal temperature range are the highest. Thermal contraction crack polygons are young surface morphologies that probably formed after the injection of 67P in the inner solar system, typically 100,000 years ago, and could be as young as a few orbital periods, following the decreasing of its perihelion distance in 1959 from 2.7 to 1.3 a.u. Meter scale thermal contraction crack polygons should be common features on the nucleus of Jupiter family comets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Low velocity collisions of porous planetesimals in the early solar system	ICARUS			English	Article						Collisional physics; Comets; Origin; Impact processes	COMETARY NUCLEI; CONSTITUTIVE EQUATION; KUIPER-BELT; POROSITY; HYDROCODE; IMPACTS; TARGETS; ICE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; SIMULATIONS	The ESA Rosetta mission has shown that Comet 67P/Churuymov-Gerasimenko is bi-lobed, has a high average porosity of around 70%, does not have internal cavities on size scales larger than 10 m, the lobes could have individual sets of onion shell-like layering, and the nucleus surface contains 100 m-scale cylindrical pits. It is currently debated whether these properties are consistent with high-velocity collisional evolution or if they necessarily are surviving signatures of low-velocity primordial accretion. We use an Eulerian hydrocode to study collisions between highly porous bodies of different sizes, material parameters and relative velocities with emphasis on 5-100 mks to characterize the effects of collisions in terms of deformation, compaction, and heating. We find that accretion of 1 km cometesimals by 3 km nuclei at 13.5 m/s flattens and partially buries the cometesimal with similar to 1% reduction of the bulk porosity. This structure locally becomes more dense but the global effect of compaction is minor, suggesting that low-velocity accretion does not lead to a 'bunch of grapes' structure with large internal cavities but a more homogeneous interior, consistent with Rosetta findings. The mild local compaction associated with accretion is potentially the origin of the observed nucleus layering. In 2D axially symmetric impacts hit and-stick collisions of similarly-sized nuclei are possible at velocities up to 30 m/s where deformation becomes severe. The bulk porosity is reduced significantly, even at 30-50 m/s relative velocity. To avoid hit-and-run collisions the impact angle must be less than 35 degrees-45 degrees from the surface normal at 10 m/s, and even smaller at higher velocities. Impact heating is insignificant. We find that the small cross section of the 67P neck may require a <= 5 m/s impact, unless the cohesion exceeds 10 kPa. We conclude that bi-lobe nucleus formation is possible at velocities typically discussed in hierarchical growth scenarios. Impacts of a 7 m projectile at 100-500 m/s create a rimless cylindrical shaft with vertical walls, up to 50 m wide and 70 m deep. These shafts bear some resemblance with the pits on 67P, particularly if the depth-to-width ratio is reduced by nucleus erosion. Collisions between similarly-sized nuclei above 100 mks lead to complete disintegration, and even small fragments suffer different degrees of compaction. Thus, we strongly doubt that 67P has been subjected to high-velocity collisions by projectiles larger than those that might have formed the pits, or is the fragment of a larger parent body. We suggest that the observed properties of 67P are more consistent with primordial accretion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BBGFL is suitable for broadband simulations because the modal functions are independent of frequencies. The modal expansion in this paper has sixth-order convergence. Usingwavenumber derivatives of the surface current, it is shown that the higher order extraction requires only a single MoM impedance matrix on the left-hand side. For the same number ofmodes, the sixth-order convergence has significant improvement in accuracy over the secondand fourth-order convergence. Scattering in an arbitrary-shape waveguide is modeled by using a surface integral equation formulated with the sixth-order BBGFL. Using BBGFL, the unknowns are only on the surface of the scatterer. Results of simulations are illustrated and the results are in good agreement with those of direct MoM.

NaDos: A real-time, wearable, personal exposure monitor for hazardous organic vapors	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						Real-time detector; Dosimeter; Naphthalene; BTEX; UV LED sensor; Integrated optics; Gas sensor; Optical device	NAPHTHALENE	We have demonstrated an intrinsically safe, near-real-time, personal exposure monitor (PEM) for measuring naphthalene in the breathing zone of the wearer. The NaDos PEM is a fully integrated, battery powered, <1 kg PEM, small enough to be worn by personnel working in hazardous environments. The NaDos PEM was originally developed with high detection specificity for naphthalene vapor because of the wide range of health hazards association with naphthalene inhalation, but it can also measure a wide range of HOVs including benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, anthracene, etc. with a real-time limit of detection less than 10 mu g/m(3). The performance of the instrument has been demonstrated across a range of naphthalene concentrations from 10 mu g/m(3) to over 100 mg/m3. Performance was found to meet or exceed NIOSH recommended acceptance criteria of +/- 25% of the true concentration, >95% of time. To deliver this accuracy in a real-world environment, the monitor accurately removes the effects of both humidity (0-95% RH) and temperature (0 degrees C to >45 degrees C). A major feature is its real-time nature, giving highly specific, high sensitivity, real time data which is a superior predictor of human health outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A correlation study regarding the AE index and ACE solar wind data for Alfvenic intervals using wavelet decomposition and reconstruction	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							COROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS; INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; ACTIVITY HILDCAA EVENTS; ELECTRON ACCELERATION; HIGH-INTENSITY; CORONAL HOLES; LONG-DURATION; STORMS; CHORUS; STREAMS	The purpose of this study is to present a wavelet interactive filtering and reconstruction technique and apply this to the solar wind magnetic field components detected at the L1 Lagrange point similar to 0.01AU upstream of the Earth. These filtered interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data are fed into a model to calculate a time series which we call AE*. This model was adjusted assuming that magnetic reconnection associated with southward-directed IMF B-z is the main mechanism transferring energy into the magnetosphere. The calculated AE* was compared to the observed AE (auroral electrojet) index using cross-correlation analysis. The results show correlations as high as 0.90. Empirical removal of the high-frequency, short-wavelength Alfvenic component in the IMF by wavelet decomposition is shown to dramatically improve the correlation between AE* and the observed AE index. It is envisioned that this AE* can be used as the main input for a model to forecast relativistic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belts, which are delayed by similar to 1 to 2 days from intense AE events.

Tyler; Dozier, Jeff			Variation in Rising Limb of Colorado River Snowmelt Runoff Hydrograph Controlled by Dust Radiative Forcing in Snow	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; BLACK CARBON; TEMPERATURE-INDEX; SPECTRAL ALBEDO; ABLATION ZONE; GRAIN-SIZE; ICE CORE; ENERGY; IMPACTS; MELT	Common practice and conventional wisdom hold that fluctuations in air temperature control interannual variability in snowmelt and subsequent river runoff. However, recent observations in the Upper Colorado River Basin confirm that net solar radiation and by extension radiative forcing by dust deposited on snow cover exerts the primary forcing on snowmelt. We show that the variation in the shape of the rising limb of the annual hydrograph is controlled by variability in dust radiative forcing and surprisingly is independent of variations in winter and spring air temperatures. These observations suggest that hydroclimatic modeling must be improved to account for aerosol forcings of the water cycle. Anthropogenic climate change will likely reduce total snow accumulations and cause snowmelt runoff to occur earlier. However, dust radiative forcing of snowmelt is likely consuming important adaptive capacity that would allow human and natural systems to be more resilient to changing hydroclimatic conditions. Plain Language Summary We address the question, do air temperatures or absorbed solar radiation explain the year-to-year variability of the rate of snowmelt and therefore the shape of the way the streamflow rises in the melt season? Our analysis shows that absorbed solar radiation, which varies with the amount of wind blown dust deposited into the snowpack, causes the streams to rise more quickly in years with more dust, whereas the rate at which the streams rise does not depend on air temperature. Forecasts of snowmelt runoff must account for the variability in dust deposition.	[Painter, Thomas H.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Skiles, S.

J	Wong, S; Behrangi, A				Wong, Sun; Behrangi, Ali			Regime-Dependent Differences in Surface Freshwater Exchange Estimates Over the Ocean	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							AIR-SEA FLUXES; HEAT FLUXES; PRECIPITATION; REANALYSIS; BUDGET; TRMM; TEMPERATURE; ALGORITHM; SPACE; GPCP	Differences in gridded precipitation (P), surface evaporation (E), and the resultant surface freshwater exchange (P - E) among different products over the ocean are diagnosed as functions of moisture advection (Q(advt)) and moisture tendency by dynamical convergence (Q(cnvg)). Compared to the GPCP product, the TRMM3B42 product captures higher frequency of precipitation with larger extreme precipitation rates in regimes of deep convection and more light rain detections in regimes of frequent occurrence of boundary layer clouds. Discrepancies in E depend on moisture flux divergence, with the OAFlux product having the largest E in regimes of divergence. Discrepancies in mean P - E in deep convective regimes are highly influenced by differences in precipitation, with the TRMM3B42 product yielding P - E histograms closer to those inferred from the reanalysis moisture flux convergence. In nonconvergent regimes, observation-based P - E histograms skew toward positive values while the inferred reanalysis histograms are symmetric about the means. Plain Language Summary We quantify the relationship between the surface freshwater exchange and atmospheric water vapor transport and assess under what conditions current gridded products of precipitation and ocean surface evaporation have large differences. This article informs developers of these products where they should put more effort in the future to refine their products and users of these products what atmospheric conditions they would expect large discrepancies. The mean and extreme values as well as the discrepancies in precipitation and surface evaporation estimates are related to how the atmosphere transports water vapor. Since how the atmosphere transports water vapor is also related to large-scale dynamical conditions and cloud systems, the method used in this work further relates the discrepancies to large-scale environmental conditions. This is different from the traditional approach of reporting differences on geographical maps, in which each location may have gone through several scenarios of large-scale conditions in temporal averaging. This work has direct impact on scientists who perform estimations of precipitation and surface evaporation based on instruments on board of satellites. Since surface freshwater exchange is used as a boundary condition to force ocean models, this work reveals atmospheric conditions in which large differences in the boundary conditions exist.

The calculated results were analyzed in terms of the lattice contribution and the electronic contribution, together with a comparison with a collection of experimental thermochemical data. At 0K, the electronic density of states showed the typical feature of a p-type semiconductor-a small amount of unoccupied electronic states exclusively made of the major spin by a range of similar to 0.6 eV above the Fermi energy. It showed that the Mn atom had a ferromagnetic spin moment of similar to 4 mu(B).

This study quantifies the roles of mean and transient flows in transporting heat across almost the entire Antarctic continental slope and shelf using an ocean/sea ice model run at eddy- and tide-resolving (1/48 degrees) horizontal resolution. Heat transfer by transient flows is approximately attributed to eddies and tides via a decomposition into time scales shorter than and longer than 1 day, respectively. It is shown that eddies transfer heat across the continental slope (ocean depths greater than 1,500 m), but tides produce a stronger shoreward heat flux across the shelf break (ocean depths between 500 m and 1,000 m). However, the tidal heat fluxes are approximately compensated by mean flows, leaving the eddy heat flux to balance the net shoreward heat transport. The eddy-driven cross-slope overturning circulation is too weak to account for the eddy heat flux. This suggests that isopycnal eddy stirring is the principal mechanism of shoreward heat transport around Antarctica, though likely modulated by tides and surface forcing.

Atmospheric CO2 Observations Reveal Strong Correlation Between Regional Net Biospheric Carbon Uptake and Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; PROGRAM MULTISCALE SYNTHESIS; VEGETATION LEAF-AREA; WEATHER RESEARCH; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CLIMATE; FLUX; VARIABILITY; BUDGET	Recent studies have shown the promise of remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in informing terrestrial carbon exchange, but analyses have been limited to either plot level (similar to 1 km(2)) or hemispheric/global (similar to 10(8) km(2)) scales due to the lack of a direct measure of carbon exchange at intermediate scales. Here we use a network of atmospheric CO2 observations over North America to explore the value of SIF for informing net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at regional scales. We find that SIF explains space-time NEE patterns at regional (similar to 100 km(2)) scales better than a variety of other vegetation and climate indicators. We further show that incorporating SIF into an atmospheric inversion leads to a spatial redistribution of NEE estimates over North America, with more uptake attributed to agricultural regions and less to needleleaf forests. Our results highlight the synergy of ground-based and spaceborne carbon cycle observations.

In particular, the impact of aerosols on ice crystal effective radius (R-ei), which is a key parameter determining ice clouds' net radiative effect, is highly uncertain due to limited and conflicting observational evidence. Here we investigate the effects of aerosols on R-ei under different meteorological conditions using 9-year satellite observations. We find that the responses of R-ei to aerosol loadings are modulated by water vapor amount in conjunction with several other meteorological parameters. While there is a significant negative correlation between R-ei and aerosol loading in moist conditions, consistent with the "Twomey effect" for liquid clouds, a strong positive correlation between the two occurs in dry conditions. Simulations based on a cloud parcel model suggest that water vapor modulates the relative importance of different ice nucleation modes, leading to the opposite aerosol impacts between moist and dry conditions. When ice clouds are decomposed into those generated from deep convection and formed in situ, the water vapor modulation remains in effect for both ice cloud types, although the sensitivities of R-ei to aerosols differ noticeably between them due to distinct formation mechanisms. The water vapor modulation can largely explain the difference in the responses of R-ei to aerosol loadings in various seasons. A proper representation of the water vapor modulation is essential for an accurate estimate of aerosol-cloud radiative forcing produced by ice clouds.

When a tau neutrino (v(tau)) enters the Earth, it produces t leptons as a result of nuclear charged-current interactions. In some cases, this process results in a t lepton exiting the surface of the Earth, which can subsequently decay in the atmosphere and produce an extensive air shower. These upward-going air showers can be detected via fluorescence, optical Cherenkov, or geomagnetic radio emission. Several experiments have been proposed to detect these signals. We present a comprehensive simulation of the production of t leptons by v(tau)'s propagating through Earth to aid the design of future experiments. These simulations for v(tau)'s and leptons in the energy range from 10(15) eV to 1021 eV treat the full range of incidence angles from Earth-skimming to diametrically traversing. Propagation of v(tau)'s and leptons includes the effects of rock and an ocean or ice layer of various thicknesses. The interaction models include v(tau')s regeneration and account for uncertainties in the Standard Model neutrino cross section and in the photonuclear contribution to the t energy-loss rate.

Despite extensive efforts, however, the quasar ULAS J1120 + 0641 at redshift z = 7.09 has remained the only one known at z > 7 for more than half a decade(1). Here we report observations of the quasar ULAS J134208.10 + 092838.61 (hereafter J1342 + 0928) at redshift z = 7.54. This quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10(13) times the luminosity of the Sun and a black-hole mass of 8 x 10(8) solar masses. The existence of this supermassive black hole when the Universe was only 690 million years old-just five per cent of its current age-reinforces models of early black-hole growth that allow black holes with initial masses of more than about 10(4) solar masses(2,3) or episodic hyper-Eddington accretion(4,5). We see strong evidence of absorption of the spectrum of the quasar redwards of the Lyman alpha emission line (the Gunn-Peterson damping wing), as would be expected if a significant amount (more than 10 per cent) of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium surrounding J1342 + 0928 is neutral. We derive such a significant fraction of neutral hydrogen, although the exact fraction depends on the modelling. However, even in our most conservative analysis we find a fraction of more than 0.33 (0.11) at 68 per cent (95 per cent) probability, indicating that we are probing well within the reionization epoch of the Universe.

Eccentric, nonspinning, inspiral, Gaussian-process merger approximant for the detection and characterization of eccentric binary black hole mergers	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; RADIATION	We present ENIGMA, a time domain, inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model that describes nonspinning binary black holes systems that evolve on moderately eccentric orbits. The inspiral evolution is described using a consistent combination of post-Newtonian theory, self-force and black hole perturbation theory. Assuming eccentric binaries that circularize prior to coalescence, we smoothly match the eccentric inspiral with a stand-alone, quasicircular merger, which is constructed using machine learning algorithms that are trained with quasicircular numerical relativity waveforms. We show that ENIGMA reproduces with excellent accuracy the dynamics of quasicircular compact binaries. We validate ENIGMA using a set of Einstein Toolkit eccentric numerical relativity waveforms, which describe eccentric binary black hole mergers with mass-ratios between 1 <= q = 5.5, and eccentricities e(0) less than or similar to 0.2 ten orbits before merger. We use this model to explore in detail the physics that can be extracted with moderately eccentric, nonspinning binary black hole mergers. In particular, we use ENIGMA to show that the gravitational wave transients GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170814 and GW170608 can be effectively recovered with spinning, quasicircular templates if the eccentricity of these events at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz satisfies e(0) <= {0.175; 0.125; 0.175; 0.175; 0.125}, respectively. We show that if these systems have eccentricities e(0) similar to 0.1 at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz, they can be misclassified as quasicircular binaries due to parameter space degeneracies between eccentricity and spin corrections. Using our catalog of eccentric numerical relativity simulations, we discuss the importance of including higher-order waveform multipoles in gravitational wave searches of eccentric binary black hole mergers.

J	Girona, T; Huber, C; Caudron, C				Girona, Tarsilo; Huber, Christian; Caudron, Corentin			Sensitivity to lunar cycles prior to the 2007 eruption of Ruapehu volcano	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EARTH TIDES; KILAUEA VOLCANO; SOLID EARTH; EARTHQUAKES; SEISMICITY; PATTERNS; HAWAII; MODULATION; HALEMAUMAU; STROMBOLI	A long-standing question in Earth Science is the extent to which seismic and volcanic activity can be regulated by tidal stresses, a repeatable and predictable external excitation induced by the Moon-Sun gravitational force. Fortnightly tides, a similar to 14-day amplitude modulation of the daily tidal stresses that is associated to lunar cycles, have been suggested to affect volcano dynamics. However, previous studies found contradictory results and remain mostly inconclusive. Here we study how fortnightly tides have affected Ruapehu volcano (New Zealand) from 2004 to 2016 by analysing the rolling correlation between lunar cycles and seismic amplitude recorded close to the crater. The long-term (similar to 1-year) correlation is found to increase significantly (up to confidence level of 5-sigma) during the similar to 3 months preceding the 2007 phreatic eruption of Ruapehu, thus revealing that the volcano is sensitive to fortnightly tides when it is prone to explode. We show through a mechanistic model that the real-time monitoring of seismic sensitivity to lunar cycles may help to detect the clogging of active volcanic vents, and thus to better forecast phreatic volcanic eruptions.

High operating temperature nBn detector with monolithically integrated microlens	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							INFRARED PHOTODETECTORS; FABRICATION	We demonstrate an InAsSb nBn detector monolithically integrated with a microlens fabricated on the back side of the detector. The increase in the optical collection area of the detector resulted in a five-fold enhancement of the responsivity to R-p = 5.5 A/W. The responsivity increases further to R-p = 8.5 A/W with an antireflection coating. These 4.5 lm cut-off wavelength antireflection coated detectors with microlenses exhibited a detectivity of D*(lambda) = 2.7 x 10 10 cmHz(0.5)/W at T = 250 K, which can be reached easily with a single-stage thermoelectric cooler or with a passive radiator in the space environment. This represents a 25K increase in the operating temperature of these devices compared to the uncoated detectors without an integrated microlens. Published by AIP Publishing.

Our regular photometric surveillance started in 2015 October, and a sequence of dipping began in 2017 May continuing on through the end of 2017, when the star was no longer visible from Earth. We distinguish four main 1%-2.5% dips, named "Elsie," "Celeste," "Skara Brae," and " Angkor," which persist on timescales from several days to weeks. Our main results so far are as follows: (i) there are no apparent changes of the stellar spectrum or polarization during the dips and (ii) the multiband photometry of the dips shows differential reddening favoring non-gray extinction. Therefore, our data are inconsistent with dip models that invoke optically thick material, but rather they are in-line with predictions for an occulter consisting primarily of ordinary dust, where much of the material must be optically thin with a size scale << 1 mu m, and may also be consistent with models invoking variations intrinsic to the stellar photosphere. Notably, our data do not place constraints on the color of the longer-term "secular" dimming, which may be caused by independent processes, or probe different regimes of a single process.

J	Piner, BG; Edwards, PG				Piner, B. Glenn; Edwards, Philip G.			Multi-epoch VLBA Imaging of 20 New TeV Blazars: Apparent Jet Speeds	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						BL Lacertae objects: general; galaxies: active; galaxies: jets; radio continuum: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; RELATIVISTIC JETS; LAC OBJECTS; BL-LAC; PARSEC; MARKARIAN-501; ACCELERATION; 1ES-1959+650; PKS-2155-304; VARIABILITY	We present 88 multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images (most at an observing frequency of 8 GHz) of 20 TeV blazars, all of the high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) class, that have not been previously studied at multiple epochs on the parsec scale. From these 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components that are all detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the apparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of the components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within 2 sigma) with no motion, and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition, a superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is detected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a 2 sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to analyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have been studied with very long baseline interferometry at multiple epochs. The highest 2 sigma apparent speed lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the parsecscale radio-emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates obtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent speed data for the TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine and a slower outer layer.	[Piner, B.

Our solar system's Titan is a prototypical hazy planet, whose atmosphere may be representative of a large number of planets in our Galaxy. As a step toward characterizing such worlds, we present simulations of exoplanets that resemble Titan but orbit three different stellar hosts: G, K, and M dwarf stars. We use general circulation and photochemistry models to explore the circulation and chemistry of these Titan-like planets under varying stellar spectra, in all cases assuming a Titan-like insolation. Due to the strong absorption of visible light by atmospheric haze, the redder radiation accompanying later stellar types produces more isothermal stratospheres, stronger meridional temperature gradients at mbar pressures, and deeper and stronger zonal winds. In all cases, the planets' atmospheres are strongly superrotating, but meridional circulation cells are weaker aloft under redder starlight. The photochemistry of hydrocarbon and nitrile species varies with stellar spectra, with variations in the FUV/NUV flux ratio playing an important role. Our results tentatively suggest that column haze production rates could be similar under all three hosts, implying that planets around many different stars could have similar characteristics to Titan's atmosphere. Lastly, we present theoretical emission spectra. Overall, our study indicates that, despite important and subtle differences, the circulation and chemistry of Titan-like exoplanets are relatively insensitive to differences in the host star. These findings may be further probed with future space-based facilities, like WFIRST, LUVOIR, HabEx, and OST.

Cluster members were selected for spectroscopic follow-up with Palomar, Gemini, and Keck optical and (in some cases) infrared imaging. Seven cluster redshifts were measured for the first time with this observing campaign, including one of the most distant Planck clusters confirmed to date, at z= 0.782. 0.010, PSZ2 G085.95+25.23. The spectroscopic redshift catalogs of members of each confirmed cluster are included as online tables. We show the galaxy redshift distributions and measure the cluster velocity dispersions. The cluster velocity dispersions obtained in this paper were used in a companion paper to measure the Planck mass bias and to constrain the cluster velocity bias.

A Comparison of Maps and Power Spectra Determined from South Pole Telescope and Planck Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; methods: data analysis		We study the consistency of 150 GHz data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and 143 GHz data from the Planck satellite over the patch of sky covered by the SPT-SZ survey. We first visually compare the maps and find that the residuals appear consistent with noise after accounting for differences in angular resolution and filtering. We then calculate (1) the cross-spectrum between two independent halves of SPT data, (2) the cross-spectrum between two independent halves of Planck data, and (3) the cross-spectrum between SPT and Planck data. We find that the three cross-spectra are well fit (PTE = 0.30) by the null hypothesis in which both experiments have measured the same sky map up to a single free calibration parameter-i.e., we find no evidence for systematic errors in either data set. As a by-product, we improve the precision of the SPT calibration by nearly an order of magnitude, from 2.6% to 0.3% in power. Finally, we compare all three cross-spectra to the full-sky Planck power spectrum and find marginal evidence for differences between the power spectra from the SPT-SZ footprint and the full sky. We model these differences as a power law in spherical harmonic multipole number. The best-fit value of this tilt is consistent among the three cross-spectra in the SPT-SZ footprint, implying that the source of this tilt is a sample variance fluctuation in the SPT-SZ region relative to the full sky. The consistency of cosmological parameters derived from these data sets is discussed in a companion paper.	[Hou, Z.; Benson, B. A.; Bleem, L. E.; Carlstrom, J. E.; Chang, C. L.; Crawford, T.

The measurements and retrievals from the AERONET global network have addressed satellite and model validation needs very well, but there have been challenges in making comparisons to similar parameters from in situ surface and airborne measurements. Additionally, with improved spatial and temporal satellite remote sensing of aerosols, there is a need for higher spatial-resolution ground-based remote-sensing networks. An effort to address these needs resulted in a number of field campaign networks called Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGONs) that were designed to provide a database for in situ and remote-sensing comparison and analysis of local to mesoscale variability in aerosol properties. This paper describes the DRAGON deployments that will continue to contribute to the growing body of research related to meso- and microscale aerosol features and processes.

MLS measurements of stratospheric hydrogen cyanide during the 2015-2016 El Nino event	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							FREE TROPOSPHERIC CO; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; EOS MLS; HCN; TRANSPORT; POLLUTION; FIRES; EMISSIONS	It is known from ground-based measurements made during the 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 El Nino events that atmospheric hydrogen cyanide (HCN) tends to be higher during such years than at other times. The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite has been measuring HCN mixing ratios since launch in 2004; the measurements are ongoing at the time of writing. The winter of 20152016 saw the largest El Nino event since 1997-1998. We present MLS measurements of HCN in the lower stratosphere for the Aura mission to date, comparing the 20152016 El Nino period to the rest of the mission. HCN in 20152016 is higher than at any other time during the mission, but ground-based measurements suggest that it may have been even more elevated in 1997-1998. As the MLS HCN data are essentially unvalidated, we show them alongside data from the MIPAS and ACE-FTS instruments; the three instruments agree reasonably well in the tropical lower stratosphere. Global HCN emissions calculated from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED v4.1) database are much greater during large El Nino events and are greater in 19971998 than in 2015-2016, thereby showing good qualitative agreement with the measurements. Correlation between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, measured HCN, and GFED HCN emissions is less clear if the 2015-2016 event is excluded. In particular, the 2009-2010 winter had fairly strong El Nino conditions and fairly large GFED HCN emissions, but very little effect is observed in the MLS HCN.

New approach to the retrieval of AOD and its uncertainty from MISR observations over dark water	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MISR; DATA-ASSIMILATION; MODIS; PRODUCTS; OCEAN; SENSITIVITY; AERONET; LAND; ALGORITHM	A new method for retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its uncertainty from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) observations over dark water is outlined. MISR's aerosol retrieval algorithm calculates cost functions between observed and pre-simulated radiances for a range of AODs (from 0.0 to 3.0) and a prescribed set of aerosol mixtures. The previous version 22 (V22) operational algorithm considered only the AOD that minimized the cost function for each aerosol mixture and then used a combination of these values to compute the final, "best estimate" AOD and associated uncertainty. The new approach considers the entire range of cost functions associated with each aerosol mixture. The uncertainty of the reported AOD depends on a combination of (a) the absolute values of the cost functions for each aerosol mixture, (b) the widths of the cost function distributions as a function of AOD, and (c) the spread of the cost function distributions among the ensemble of mixtures. A key benefit of the new approach is that, unlike the V22 algorithm, it does not rely on empirical thresholds imposed on the cost function to determine the success or failure of a particular mixture. Furthermore, a new aerosol retrieval confidence index (ARCI) is established that can be used to screen high-AOD retrieval blunders caused by cloud contamination or other factors. Requiring ARCI >= 0.15 as a condition for retrieval success is supported through statistical analysis and outperforms the thresholds used in the V22 algorithm. The described changes to the MISR dark water algorithm will become operational in the new MISR aerosol product (V23), planned for release in 2017.

YORP and Yarkovsky effects in asteroids (1685) Toro, (2100) Ra-Shalom, (3103) Eger, and (161989) Cacus	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: general; radiation mechanisms: thermal; techniques: photometric	THERMAL PHYSICS; OBJECTS	Context. The rotation states of small asteroids are affected by a net torque arising from an anisotropic sunlight reflection and thermal radiation from the asteroids' surfaces. On long timescales, this so-called YORP effect can change asteroid spin directions and their rotation periods. Aims. We analyzed lightcurves of four selected near-Earth asteroids with the aim of detecting secular changes in their rotation rates that are caused by YORP or at least of putting upper limits on such changes. Methods. We use the lightcurve inversion method to model the observed lightcurves and include the change in the rotation rate d omega/dt as a free parameter of optimization. To enlarge the time line of observations and to increase the sensitivity of the method, we collected more than 70 new lightcurves. For asteroids Toro and Cacus, we used thermal infrared data from the WISE spacecraft and estimated their size and thermal inertia by means of a thermophysical model. We also used the currently available optical and radar astrometry of Toro, Ra-Shalom, and Cacus to infer the Yarkovsky effect. Results. We detected a YORP acceleration of d omega/dt = (1.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(-8) rad d(-2) for asteroid Cacus. The current astrometric data set is not sufficient to provide detection of the Yarkovsky effect in this case. For Toro, we have a tentative (2 sigma) detection of YORP from a significant improvement of the lightcurve fit for a nonzero value of d omega/dt = 3.0 x 10(-9) rad d(-2). We note an excellent agreement between the observed secular change of the semimajor axis d omega/dt and the theoretical expectation for densities in the 2-2.5 g cm(-3) range. For asteroid Eger, we confirmed the previously published YORP detection with more data and updated the YORP value to (1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(-8) rad d(-2). We also updated the shape model of asteroid Ra-Shalom and put an upper limit for the change of the rotation rate to vertical bar d omega/dt vertical bar <= 1.5 x 10(-8) rad d(-2). Ra-Shalom has a greater than 3 sigma Yarkovsky detection with a theoretical value consistent with observations assuming its size and/or density is slightly larger than the nominally expected values. Using the convex shape models and spin parameters reconstructed from lightcurves, we computed theoretical YORP values and compared them with those measured. They agree with each other within the expected uncertainties of the model.

Euclid: Superluminous supernovae in the Deep Survey	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						surveys; supernovae: general; cosmology: observations	PAIR-INSTABILITY; IA SUPERNOVAE; LIGHT CURVES; DARK ENERGY; LUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE; K-CORRECTIONS; RATES; TRANSIENTS; EVENTS; GALAXY	Context. In the last decade, astronomers have found a new type of supernova called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) due to their high peak luminosity and long light-curves. These hydrogen-free explosions (SLSNe-I) can be seen to z similar to 4 and therefore, offer the possibility of probing the distant Universe. Aims. We aim to investigate the possibility of detecting SLSNe-I using ESA's Euclid satellite, scheduled for launch in 2020. In particular, we study the Euclid Deep Survey (EDS) which will provide a unique combination of area, depth and cadence over the mission. Methods. We estimated the redshift distribution of Euclid SLSNe-I using the latest information on their rates and spectral energy distribution, as well as known Euclid instrument and survey parameters, including the cadence and depth of the EDS. To estimate the uncertainties, we calculated their distribution with two different set-ups, namely optimistic and pessimistic, adopting different star formation densities and rates. We also applied a standardization method to the peak magnitudes to create a simulated Hubble diagram to explore possible cosmological constraints. Results. We show that Euclid should detect approximately 140 high-quality SLSNe-I to z similar to 3.5 over the first five years of the mission (with an additional 70 if we lower our photometric classification criteria). This sample could revolutionize the study of SLSNe-I at z > 1 and open up their use as probes of star-formation rates, galaxy populations, the interstellar and intergalactic medium. In addition, a sample of such SLSNe-I could improve constraints on a time-dependent dark energy equation-of-state, namely w (a), when combined with local SLSNe-I and the expected SN Ia sample from the Dark Energy Survey. Conclusions. We show that Euclid will observe hundreds of SLSNe-I for free. These luminous transients will be in the Euclid data-stream and we should prepare now to identify them as they offer a new probe of the high-redshift Universe for both astrophysics and cosmology.

We analyze momentum balance in the ion rest frame to form hypotheses regarding the role of neutral momentum in the lower ionosphere during geomagnetic storms. Neutral momentum that appears in the ion rest frame is likely the result of momentum imparted to ionospheric ions by solar wind flow and the resultant magnetospheric dynamics. The resulting ion-neutral collisions lead to the existence of an electric field. Horizontal electron how balances the momentum supplied by this electric field. We suggest a possible role played by the neutral atmosphere in generating field-aligned currents due to local auroral heating. Our physical interpretation suggests that thermospheric neutral dynamics plays a complementary role to the high-latitude field-aligned currents and electric fields resulting from magnetospheric dynamics.

Uniaxial Compressive Strengths of Rocks Drilled at Gale Crater, Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; rock strength; MSL; drill; Gale crater	SANDSTONE; CEMENT	Measuring the physical properties of geological materials is important for understanding geologic history. Yet there has never been an instrument with the purpose of measuring mechanical properties of rocks sent to another planet. The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover employs the Powder Acquisition Drill System (PADS), which provides direct mechanical interaction with Martian outcrops. While the objective of the drill system is not to make scientific measurements, the drill's performance is directly influenced by the mechanical properties of the rocks it drills into. We have developed a methodology that uses the drill to indicate the uniaxial compressive strengths of rocks through comparison with performance of an identically assembled drill system in terrestrial samples of comparable sedimentary class. During this investigation, we utilize engineering data collected on Mars to calculate the percussive energy needed to maintain a prescribed rate of penetration and correlate that to rock strength.

Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes associated with the International Space Station environmental surfaces	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; ERTAPENEM RESISTANCE; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; NORA GENE; STRAINS; METAL; SUSCEPTIBILITY; AMPLIFICATION; CULTIVATION	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue. In an effort to minimize this threat to astronauts, who may be immunocompromised and thus at a greater risk of infection from antimicrobial resistant pathogens, a comprehensive study of the ISS "resistome' was conducted. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and disc diffusion antibiotic resistance assays, 9 biosafety level 2 organisms isolated from the ISS were assessed for their antibiotic resistance. Molecular analysis of AMR genes from 24 surface samples collected from the ISS during 3 different sampling events over a span of a year were analyzed with Ion AmpliSeq (TM) and metagenomics. Disc diffusion assays showed that Enterobacter bugandensis strains were resistant to all 9 antibiotics tested and Staphylococcus haemolyticus being resistant to none. Ion AmpliSeq (TM) revealed that 123 AMR genes were found, with those responsible for beta-lactam and trimethoprim resistance being the most abundant and widespread. Using a variety of methods, the genes involved in antimicrobial resistance have been examined for the first time from the ISS. This information could lead to mitigation strategies to maintain astronaut health during long duration space missions when return to Earth for treatment is not possible.	[Urbaniak, C.; Sielaff, A.

The first-principles calculations covered 178 phases ranging from pure elements, the ordered B2, B32, B2(3), B2(2), hR8, hR7, tI6, C15, and D0(3) binary phases, two ordered MoNbTaW quaternary phases, and the partially disordered and completely disordered bcc phases. By sorting their relative phase stabilities with the Dantzig's simplex minimization algorithm, the possibilities of phase separation for the refractory quaternary and quinary HEAs were thermodynamically found in the temperature range of 500-907 K.

J	Diniega, S; Sangha, S; Browne, B				Diniega, Serina; Sangha, Simran; Browne, Brandon			Using satellite imagery to identify and analyze tumuli on Earth and Mars	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						tumulus; remote sensing; satellite images; Earth; Mars; inflated flows	FLOW-LOBE TUMULI; LAVA FLOWS; KILAUEA VOLCANO; MOUNT-ETNA; INFLATION; EMPLACEMENT; MORPHOLOGY; FIELD; INSIGHTS; FEATURES	Tumuli are small, dome-like features that form when magmatic pressures build within a subsurface lava pathway, causing the overlying crust to bulge upwards. As the appearance of these features has been linked to lava flow structure (e.g., underlying lava flow tubes) and conditions, there is interest in identifying such features in satellite images so they can be used to expand our understanding of lava flows within regions difficult to access (such as on other planets). Here, we define a methodology for identifying (and measuring) tumuli within satellite imagery, and validate it by comparing our results with fieldwork results of terrestrial tumuli reported in the literature and with independent measurements we made within Amboy Field, CA. In addition, we present aggregated results from the application of our methodology to satellite images of six terrestrial fields and seven martian fields (with >2100 tumuli identified, per planet). Comparisons of tumuli morphometrics on Earth and Mars yield similarities in size and overall shape, which were surprising given the many differences in the environmental and planetary conditions within which these features have formed. Given our measurements, we identify constraints for tumulus formation models and drivers that would yield similar shapes and sizes on two different planets. Furthermore, we test a published hypothesis regarding the number of tumuli that form per a square kilometer, and find it unlikely that a diagnostic "tumuli density" value exists.

Assessing the potential for measuring Europa's tidal Love number h(2) using radar sounder and topographic imager data	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Europa; solid body tides; radar altimetry; h(2)	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; SURFACE; ALTIMETRY	The tidal Love number h(2) is a key geophysical measurement for the characterization of Europa's interior, especially of its outer ice shell if a subsurface ocean is present. We performed numerical simulations to assess the potential for estimating h(2) using altimetric measurements with a combination of radar sounding and stereo imaging data. The measurement principle exploits both delay and Doppler information in the radar surface return in combination with topography from a digital terrain model (DTM). The resulting radar range measurements at cross-over locations can be used in combination with radio science Doppler data for an improved trajectory solution and for estimating the h(2) Love number. Our simulation results suggest that the absolute accuracy of h(2) from the joint analysis of REASON (Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface) surface return and EIS (Europa Imaging System) DTM data will be in the range of 0.04-0.17 assuming full radio link coverage. The error is controlled by the SNR budget and DTM quality, both dependent on the surface properties of Europa. We estimate that this would unambiguously confirm (or reject) the global ocean hypothesis and, in combination with a nominal radio-science based measurement of the tidal Love number k(2), constrain the thickness of Europa's outer ice shell to up to +/- 15 km.

Arecibo and Goldstone radar images of near-Earth Asteroid (469896) 2005 WC1	ICARUS			English	Article						Radar observations; Near-Earth asteroids; Asteroid rotation; Asteroid surfaces	ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDES	We report radar observations of near-Earth asteroid (469896) 2005 WC1 that were obtained at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 13 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) on 2005 December 14-15 during the asteroid's approach within 0.020 au The asteroid was a strong radar target. Delay-Doppler images with resolutions as fine as 15 m/pixel were obtained with 2 samples per baud giving a correlated pixel resolution of 7.5 m. The radar images reveal an angular object with 100 m-scale surface facets, radar-dark regions, and an estimated diameter of 400 +/- 50 m. The rotation of the facets in the images gives a rotation period of similar to 2.6 h that is consistent with the estimated period of 2.582 h +/- 0.002 h from optical lightcurves reported by Miles (private communication). 2005 WC1 has a circular polarization ratio of 1.12 +/- 0.05 that is one of the highest values known, suggesting a structurally-complex near-surface at centimeter to decimeter spatial scales. It is the first asteroid known with an extremely high circular polarization ratio, relatively low optical albedo, and high radar albedo. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Goldstone and Arecibo radar observations of (99942) Apophis in 2012-2013	ICARUS			English	Article							EARTH ENCOUNTERS; SPIN-STATE; ASTEROIDS; ALBEDO; MODEL; SHAPE	We report radar observations of Apophis obtained during the 2012-2013 apparition. We observed Apophis on fourteen days at Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) and on five days at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.3 cm) between 2012 December 21 to 2013 March 16. Closest approach occurred on January 9 at a distance of 0.097 au. We obtained relatively weak echo power spectra and delay-Doppler images. The highest range resolution was achieved at Goldstone, 0.125 mu s or similar to 20 m/px. The data suggest that Apophis is an elongated, asymmetric, and possibly bifurcated object. The images place a lower bound on the long axis of 450 m. We used the Pravec et al. (2014) lightcurve-derived shape and spin state model of Apophis to test for short axis mode (SAM) non-principal axis rotation (NPA) and to estimate the asteroid's dimensions. The radar data are consistent with the NPA spin state and they constrain the equivalent diameter to be D = 0.34 +/- 0.04 km (1 sigma bound). This is slightly smaller than the most recent IR observation estimates of 375((-10))((+14)) m and 380-393 m, reported by Muller et al. (2014) and Licandro et al. (2016) respectively. We estimated a radar albedo of 0.25 +/- 0.11 based on Goldstone data, and an optical albedo, pv, of 0.35 +/- 0.10. Licandro et al. (2016) reported pv in the range of 0.24-0.33. The radar astrometry has been updated using a 3-D shape model. The Yarkovsky acceleration has not been detected in the current orbital fit, but if the position error during the 2021 encounter exceeds 8-12 km, this could signal a detection of the Yarkovsky effect.

Enceladus plume density from Cassini spacecraft attitude control data	ICARUS			English	Article						Enceladus; Experimental techniques; Volcanism		The plumes of Enceladus are of interest both as a geophysical phenomenon, and as an astrobiological opportunity for sampling internal material. Here we report measurements of the total mass density (gas plus dust, a combination not reported before except in the engineering literature) deduced from telemetry of Cassini's Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS), as the spacecraft's thrusters or reaction wheels worked to maintain the desired attitude in the presence of drag torques during close flybys. The drag torque shows good agreement with the water vapor density measured by other instruments during the E5 encounter, but indicates a rather higher mass density on other passes (E3, E14), possibly indicating variations in gas composition and/or gas:dust ratio. The spacecraft appears to have intercepted about 0.2 g of material, on flyby E21 in October 2015 indicating a peak mass density of similar to 5.5 x 10(-11) kg m(-3), the highest of all the flybys measured (E3, E5, E7, E9, E14, E21).

Bathymetry and composition of Titan's Ontario Lacus derived from Monte Carlo-based waveform inversion of Cassini RADAR altimetry data	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Radar; Altimetry; Ground penetrating radar; Spaceborne radar; Geophysical measurement techniques; Geophysical signal processing	HYDROCARBON SEAS	Recently, the Cassini RADAR was used to sound hydrocarbon lakes and seas on Saturn's moon Titan. Since the initial discovery of echoes from the seabed of Ligeia Mare, the second largest liquid body on Titan, a dedicated radar processing chain has been developed to retrieve liquid depth and microwave absorptivity information from RADAR altimetry of Titan's lakes and seas. Herein, we apply this processing chain to altimetry data acquired over southern Ontario Lacus during Titan fly-by T49 in December 2008. The new signal processing chain adopts super resolution techniques and dedicated taper functions to reveal the presence of reflection from Ontario's lakebed. Unfortunately, the extracted waveforms from T49 are often distorted due to signal saturation, owing to the extraordinarily strong specular reflections from the smooth lake surface. This distortion is a function of the saturation level and can introduce artifacts, such as signal precursors, which complicate data interpretation. We use a radar altimetry simulator to retrieve information from the saturated bursts and determine the liquid depth and loss tangent of Ontario Lacus. Received waveforms are represented using a two-layer model, where Cassini raw radar data are simulated in order to reproduce the effects of receiver saturation. A Monte Carlo based approach along with a simulated waveform look-up table is used to retrieve parameters that are given as inputs to a parametric model which constrains radio absorption of Ontario Lacus and retrieves information about the dielectric properties of the liquid. We retrieve a maximum depth of 50 m along the radar transect and a best-fit specific attenuation of the liquid equal to 0.2 0.09 dB m(-1) that, when converted into loss tangent, gives tans = 7 +/- 3 x 10(-5). When combined with laboratory measured cryogenic liquid alkane dielectric properties and the variable solubility of nitrogen in ethane-methane mixtures, the best-fit loss tangent is consistent with a ternary mixture of 51% methane, 38% ethane and 11% nitrogen by volume.

Jupiter's auroral-related stratospheric heating and chemistry II: Analysis of IRTF-TEXES spectra measured in December 2014	ICARUS			English	Article							TITANS UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; CASSINI-CIRS; INFRARED SPECTROMETER; POLAR ATMOSPHERE; HAZE FORMATION; VOYAGER-IRIS; TEMPERATURE; SATURN; ABUNDANCES; REGION	We present a retrieval analysis of TEXES (Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (Lacy et al., 2002)) spectra of Jupiter's high latitudes obtained on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility on December 10 and 11th 2014. The vertical temperature profile and vertical profiles of C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 were retrieved at both high-northern and high-southern latitudes and results were compared in 'quiescent' regions and regions known to be affected by Jupiter's aurora in order to highlight how auroral processes modify the thermal structure and hydrocarbon chemistry of the stratosphere. In qualitative agreement with Sinclair et al. (2017a), we find temperatures in auroral regions to be elevated with respect to quiescent regions at two discrete pressures levels at approximately 1 mbar and 0.01 mbar. For example, in comparing retrieved temperatures at 70 degrees N, 60 degrees W (a representative quiescent region) and 70 degrees N, 180 degrees W (centred on the northern auroral oval), temperatures increase by 19.0 +/- 4.2 K at 0.98 mbar, 20.8 +/- 3.9 K at 0.01 mbar but only by 8.3 +/- 4.9 K at the intermediate level of 0.1 mbar. We conclude that elevated temperatures at 0.01 mbar result from heating by joule resistance of the atmosphere and the energy imparted by electron and ion precipitation. However, temperatures at 1 mbar are considered to result either from heating by shortwave radiation of aurorally-produced haze particulates or precipitation of higher energy population of charged particles. Our former conclusion would be consistent with results of auroral-chemistry models, that predict the highest number densities of aurorally-produced haze particles at this pressure level (Wong et al., 2000, 2003). C2H2 and C2H4 exhibit enrichments but C2H6 remains constant within uncertainty when comparing retrieved concentrations in the northern auroral region with quiescent longitudes in the same latitude band. At 1 mbar, C2H2 increases from 278.4 +/- 40.3 ppbv at 70 degrees N, 60 degrees W to 564.4 +/- 72.0 ppbv at 70 degrees N, 180 degrees W and at 0.01 mbar, over the same longitude range at 70 degrees N, C2H4 increases from 0.669 +/- 0.129 ppmv to 6.509 +/- 0.811 ppmv. However, we note that non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) emission may affect the cores of the strongest C2H2 and C2H4 lines on the northern auroral region, which may be a possible source of error in our derived concentrations. We retrieved concentrations of C2H6 at 1 mbar of 9.03 +/- 0.98 ppmv at 70 degrees N, 60 degrees W and 7.66 +/- 0.70 ppmv at 70 degrees N, 180 degrees W. Thus, C2H6's concentration appears constant (within uncertainty) as a function of longitude at 70 degrees N. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Sinclair, J. A.; Orton, G.

Detecting the permafrost carbon feedback: talik formation and increased cold-season respiration as precursors to sink-to-source transitions	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARCTIC TUNDRA; PLANT PRODUCTIVITY; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ORGANIC SOIL; CYCLE; EXCHANGE; DIOXIDE; ALASKA	Thaw and release of permafrost carbon (C) due to climate change is likely to offset increased vegetation C uptake in northern high-latitude (NHL) terrestrial ecosystems. Models project that this permafrost C feedback may act as a slow leak, in which case detection and attribution of the feedback may be difficult. The formation of talik, a subsurface layer of perennially thawed soil, can accelerate permafrost degradation and soil respiration, ultimately shifting the C balance of permafrost-affected ecosystems from long-term C sinks to long-term C sources. It is imperative to understand and characterize mechanistic links between talik, permafrost thaw, and respiration of deep soil C to detect and quantify the permafrost C feedback. Here, we use the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5, a permafrost and biogeochemistry model, in comparison to long-term deep borehole data along North American and Siberian transects, to investigate thaw-driven C sources in NHL (>55 degrees N) from 2000 to 2300. Widespread talik at depth is projected across most of the NHL permafrost region (14 million km(2)) by 2300, 6.2 million km(2) of which is projected to become a long-term C source, emitting 10 PgC by 2100, 50 PgC by 2200, and 120 PgC by 2300, with few signs of slowing. Roughly half of the projected C source region is in predominantly warm sub-Arctic permafrost following talik onset. This region emits only 20 PgC by 2300, but the CLM4.5 estimate may be biased low by not accounting for deep C in yedoma. Accelerated decomposition of deep soil C following talik onset shifts the ecosystem C balance away from surface dominant processes (photosynthesis and litter respiration), but sink-to-source transition dates are delayed by 20-200 years by high ecosystem productivity, such that talik peaks early (similar to 2050s, although borehole data suggest sooner) and C source transition peaks late (similar to 2150-2200). The remaining C source region in cold northern Arctic permafrost, which shifts to a net source early (late 21st century), emits 5 times more C (95 PgC) by 2300, and prior to talik formation due to the high decomposition rates of shallow, young C in organic-rich soils coupled with low productivity. Our results provide important clues signaling imminent talik onset and C source transition, including (1) late coldseason (January-February) soil warming at depth (similar to 2 m), (2) increasing cold-season emissions (November-April), and (3) enhanced respiration of deep, old C in warm permafrost and young, shallow C in organic-rich cold permafrost soils. Our results suggest a mosaic of processes that govern carbon source-to-sink transitions at high latitudes and emphasize the urgency of monitoring soil thermal profiles, organic C age and content, cold-season CO2 emissions, and atmospheric (CO2)-C-14 as key indicators of the permafrost C feedback.

An extreme magneto-ionic environment associated with the fast radio burst source FRB 121102	NATURE			English	Article							SAGITTARIUS-A-ASTERISK; FARADAY-ROTATION; GAMMA-RAY; SUPERNOVA REMNANT; CRAB-NEBULA; HOST GALAXY; BLACK-HOLE; X-RAY; FIELDS; POLARIZATION	Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration, extragalactic radio flashes of unknown physical origin(1-3). The only known repeating fast radio burst source(4-6)-FRB 121102-has been localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy(7-9) at redshift 0.193 and is spatially coincident with a compact, persistent radio source(7,10). The origin of the bursts, the nature of the persistent source and the properties of the local environment are still unclear. Here we report observations of FRB 121102 that show almost 100 per cent linearly polarized emission at a very high and variable Faraday rotation measure in the source frame (varying from + 1.46 x 10(5) radians per square metre to + 1.33 x 10(5) radians per square metre at epochs separated by seven months) and narrow (below 30 microseconds) temporal structure. The large and variable rotation measure demonstrates that FRB 121102 is in an extreme and dynamic magneto-ionic environment, and the short durations of the bursts suggest a neutron star origin. Such large rotation measures have hitherto been observed(11,12) only in the vicinities of massive black holes (larger than about 10,000 solar masses). Indeed, the properties of the persistent radio source are compatible with those of a low-luminosity, accreting massive black hole(10). The bursts may therefore come from a neutron star in such an environment or could be explained by other models, such as a highly magnetized wind nebula(13) or supernova remnant(14) surrounding a young neutron star.

Impact of convection and resistivity on angular momentum transport in dwarf novae	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; convection; magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); turbulence; stars: dwarf novae	ACCRETION DISC OUTBURSTS; MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY; NONLINEAR EVOLUTION; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; V344 LYRAE; SIMULATIONS; TURBULENCE; VISCOSITY; ALPHA; IONIZATION	The eruptive cycles of dwarf novae are thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. This model has long been known to imply enhanced angular momentum transport in the accretion disk during outburst. This is measured by the stress to pressure ratio alpha, with alpha approximate to 0.1 required in outburst compared to alpha approximate to 0.01 in quiescence. Such an enhancement in alpha has recently been observed in simulations of turbulent transport driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) when convection is present, without requiring a net magnetic flux. We independently recover this result by carrying out PLUTO magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of vertically stratified, radiative, shearing boxes with the thermodynamics and opacities appropriate to dwarf novae. The results are robust against the choice of vertical boundary conditions. The thermal equilibrium solutions found by the simulations trace the well-known S-curve in the density-temperature plane that constitutes the core of the disk thermal-viscous instability model. We confirm that the high values of alpha approximate to 0.1 occur near the tip of the hot branch of the S-curve, where convection is active. However, we also present thermally stable simulations at lower temperatures that have standard values of alpha approximate to 0 : 03 despite the presence of vigorous convection. We find no simple relationship between alpha and the strength of the convection, as measured by the ratio of convective to radiative flux. The cold branch is only very weakly ionized so, in the second part of this work, we studied the impact of non-ideal MHD effects on transport. Ohmic dissipation is the dominant effect in the conditions of quiescent dwarf novae. We include resistivity in the simulations and find that the MRI-driven transport is quenched (alpha approximate to 0) below the critical density at which the magnetic Reynolds number R-m <= 10(4). This is problematic because the X-ray emission observed in quiescent systems requires ongoing accretion onto the white dwarf. We verify that these X-rays cannot self-sustain MRI-driven turbulence by photo-ionizing the disk and discuss possible solutions to the issue of accretion in quiescence.

He-3-rich Solar Energetic Particles in Helical Jets on the Sun	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						acceleration of particles; Sun: flares; Sun: particle emission; waves	X-RAY JETS; ULTRAHEAVY IONS; ELECTRON EVENTS; STEREO MISSION; SOURCE REGIONS; ALFVEN WAVES; HEAVY-IONS; FLARES; ACCELERATION; PLASMA	Particle acceleration in stellar flares is ubiquitous in the universe; however, our Sun is the only astrophysical object where energetic particles and their source flares can both be observed. The acceleration mechanism in solar flares, tremendously enhancing (up to a factor of 10,000) rare elements like He-3 and ultra-heavy nuclei, has been puzzling for almost 50 years. Here we present some of the most intense He-3- and Fe-rich solar energetic particle events ever reported. The events were accompanied by nonrelativistic electron events and type-III radio bursts. The corresponding high-resolution, extreme-ultraviolet imaging observations have revealed for the first time a helical structure in the source flare with a jet-like shape. The helical jets originated in relatively small, compact active regions, located at the coronal-hole boundary. A mini-filament at the base of the jet appears to trigger these events. The events were observed with the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories on the backside of the Sun, during the period of increased solar activity in 2014. The helical jets may be a distinct feature of these intense events that is related to the production of high He-3 and Fe enrichments.

Chemical Abundance Analysis of Three alpha-poor, Metal-poor Stars in the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Horologium I	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: abundances; galaxies: dwarf; stars: abundances; stars: chemically peculiar	LABORATORY TRANSITION-PROBABILITIES; R-PROCESS-RICH; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; SPHEROIDAL GALAXY; OSCILLATOR-STRENGTHS; GALACTIC HALO; ECHELLE SPECTROGRAPH; DARK-MATTER; 1ST STARS; SUN	We present chemical abundance measurements of three stars in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Horologium I, a Milky Way satellite discovered by the Dark Energy Survey. Using high-resolution spectroscopic observations, we measure the metallicity of the three stars, as well as abundance ratios of several alpha-elements, iron-peak elements, and neutron-capture elements. The abundance pattern is relatively consistent among all three stars, which have a low average metallicity of [Fe/H]similar to -2.6 and are not alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe] similar to 0.0). This result is unexpected when compared to other low-metallicity stars in the Galactic halo and other ultrafaint dwarfs and suggests the possibility of a different mechanism for the enrichment of Hor I compared to other satellites. We discuss possible scenarios that could lead to this observed nucleosynthetic signature, including extended star formation, enrichment by a Population III supernova, and or an association with the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Predominantly at redshifts 2-3, they include the most luminous known galaxies in the universe. Their high luminosities likely come from accretion onto highly obscured supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We have conducted a pilot survey to measure the SMBH masses of five z similar to 2 Hot DOGs via broad Ha emission lines, using Keck/MOSFIRE and Gemini/FLAMINGOS-2. We detect broad H alpha emission in all five Hot DOGs. We find substantial corresponding SMBH masses for these Hot DOGs (similar to 10(9) M-circle dot), and their derived Eddington ratios are close to unity. These z similar to 2 Hot DOGs are the most luminous active galactic nuclei for their BH masses, suggesting that they are accreting at the maximum rates for their BHs. A similar property is found for known z similar to 6 quasars. Our results are consistent with scenarios in which Hot DOGs represent a transitional, high-accretion phase between obscured and unobscured quasars. Hot DOGs may mark a special evolutionary stage before the red quasar and optical quasar phases, and they may be present at other cosmic epochs.

Here, we present solar phase curves of the two largest of Pluto's small moons, Nix and Hydra, observed by the New Horizons LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager and Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera, which reveal the scattering properties of their icy surfaces in visible light. Construction of these solar phase curves enables comparisons between the photometric properties of Pluto's small moons and those of other icy satellites in the outer solar system. Nix and Hydra have higher visible albedos than those of other resonant Kuiper Belt objects and irregular satellites of the giant planets, but not as high as small satellites of Saturn interior to Titan. Both Nix and Hydra appear to scatter visible light preferentially in the forward direction, unlike most icy satellites in the outer solar system, which are typically backscattering.

Early Observations of the Type Ia Supernova iPTF 16abc: A Case of Interaction with Nearby, Unbound Material and/or Strong Ejecta Mixing	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational; supernovae: general; supernovae: individual (iPTF 16abc; SN 2011fe); surveys	WHITE-DWARF MODELS; WIDE-FIELD CAMERA; LIGHT CURVES; SKY SURVEY; RISE-TIME; SPECTROGRAPH; CONSTRAINTS; PROGENITORS; TELESCOPE; EXPLOSION	Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique probe of their progenitor systems and explosion physics. Here we report the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) discovery of an extraordinarily young SN Ia, iPTF 16abc. By fitting a power law to our early light curve, we infer that first light for the SN, that is, when the SN could have first been detected by our survey, occurred only 0.15 +/-(0.15)(0.07) days before our first detection. In the similar to 24 hr after discovery, iPTF 16abc rose by similar to 2mag, featuring a near-linear rise in flux for. greater than or similar to 3 days. Early spectra show strong C II absorption, which disappears after similar to 7 days. Unlike the extensively observed Type Ia SN 2011fe, the (B - V)(0) colors of iPTF 16abc are blue and nearly constant in the days after explosion. We show that our early observations of iPTF 16abc cannot be explained by either SN shock breakout and the associated, subsequent cooling or the SN ejecta colliding with a stellar companion. Instead, we argue that the early characteristics of iPTF 16abc, including (i) the rapid, near-linear rise, (ii) the nonevolving blue colors, and (iii) the strong C II absorption, are the result of either ejecta interaction with nearby, unbound material or vigorous mixing of radioactive Ni-56 in the SN ejecta, or a combination of the two. In the next few years, dozens of very young normal SNe Ia will be discovered, and observations similar to those presented here will constrain the white dwarf explosion mechanism.	[Miller, A.

Laboratory simulations of the photoreactivity of the haze aerosol analogs provide insight into the photochemical evolution of Titan's atmosphere at and below the haze layers. Here we use experimental simulations to investigate the evolution of the laboratory analogs of these organic aerosols under ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) photons, which make it through the haze layers during their sedimentation process. We present experimental results for the aging of Titan's aerosol analogs obtained from two dominant nitrogen-containing organics, HC3N and HCN, under simulated Titan atmospheric conditions (photons and temperature). We report that volatile nitriles condensed on haze particles could be incorporated through photochemistry and provide one such sink mechanism for nitrile compounds. We provide laboratory evidence that the organic aerosols could photochemically evolve during their sedimentation through Titan's atmosphere.

COSMOGRAIL: the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses XVI. Time delays for the quadruply imaged quasar DES J0408-5354 with high-cadence photometric monitoring	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						methods: data analysis; gravitational lensing: strong; cosmological parameters	HUBBLE CONSTANT; HE 0435-1223; PRECISION; DECONVOLUTION; DISCOVERY; MODELS; SAMPLE; SIGHT; H-0	We present time-delay measurements for the new quadruple imaged quasar DES J0408-5354, the first quadruple imaged quasar found in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Our result is made possible by implementing a new observational strategy using almost daily observations with the MPIA 2.2 m telescope at La Silla observatory and deep exposures reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. This data quality allows us to catch small photometric variations (a few mmag rms) of the quasar, acting on temporal scales much shorter than microlensing, and hence making the time delay measurement very robust against microlensing. In only seven months we very accurately measured one of the time delays in DES J0408-5354: Delta t(AB) = -112.1 +/- 2.1 days (1.8%) using only the MPIA 2.2 m data. In combination with data taken with the 1.2 m Euler Swiss telescope, we also measured two delays involving the D component of the system Delta t(AD) = -155.5 +/- 12.8 days (8.2%) and Delta t(BD) = -42.4 +/- 17.6 days (41%), where all the error bars include systematics. Turning these time delays into cosmological constraints will require deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging or ground-based adaptive optics (AO), and information on the velocity field of the lensing galaxy.

In this study, we analyze a subset of in situ CH4 aircraft observations made over Alaska during the growing seasons of 2012-2014 as part of the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE). Net surface CH4 fluxes are estimated using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model which quantitatively links surface emissions from Alaska and the western Yukon with observations of enhanced CH4 in the mixed layer. We estimate that between May and September, net CH4 emissions from the region of interest were 2.2 +/- 0.5 Tg, 1.9 +/- 0.4 Tg, and 2.3 +/- 0.6 Tg of CH4 for 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. If emissions are only attributed to two biogenic eco-regions within our domain, then tundra regions were the predominant source, accounting for over half of the overall budget despite only representing 18% of the total surface area. Bo-real regions, which cover a large part of the study region, accounted for the remainder of the emissions. Simple multiple linear regression analysis revealed that, overall, CH4 fluxes were largely driven by soil temperature and elevation. In regions specifically dominated by wetlands, soil temperature and moisture at 10 cm depth were important explanatory variables while in regions that were not wetlands, soil temperature and moisture at 40 cm depth were more important, suggesting deeper methanogenesis in drier soils. Although similar environmental drivers have been found in the past to control CH4 emissions at local scales, this study shows that they can be used to generate a statistical model to estimate the regional-scale net CH4 budget.

RoboTAP: Target priorities for robotic microlensing observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; methods: observational; methods: statistical	EARTH-MASS PLANETS; GALACTIC PLANETS; TELESCOPE; SYSTEM; EVENT; STAR; MULTIPLICITY; SENSITIVITY; ALGORITHM; FREQUENCY	Context. The ability to automatically select scientifically-important transient events from an alert stream of many such events, and to conduct follow-up observations in response, will become increasingly important in astronomy. With wide-angle time domain surveys pushing to fainter limiting magnitudes, the capability to follow-up on transient alerts far exceeds our follow-up telescope resources, and effective target prioritization becomes essential. The RoboNet-II microlensing program is a pathfinder project, which has developed an automated target selection process (RoboTAP) for gravitational microlensing events, which are observed in real time using the Las Cumbres Observatory telescope network. Aims. Follow-up telescopes typically have a much smaller field of view compared to surveys, therefore the most promising microlensing events must be automatically selected at any given time from an annual sample exceeding 2000 events. The main challenge is to select between events with a high planet detection sensitivity, with the aim of detecting many planets and characterizing planetary anomalies. Methods. Our target selection algorithm is a hybrid system based on estimates of the planet detection zones around a microlens. It follows automatic anomaly alerts and respects the expected survey coverage of specific events. Results. We introduce the RoboTAP algorithm, whose purpose is to select and prioritize microlensing events with high sensitivity to planetary companions. In this work, we determine the planet sensitivity of the RoboNet follow-up program and provide a working example of how a broker can be designed for a real-life transient science program conducting follow-up observations in response to alerts; we explore the issues that will confront similar programs being developed for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other time domain surveys.

XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra dominated by two temperature (warm, hot) Comptonization processes	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						X-rays: individuals: Ark 120; galaxies: active; radiation mechanisms: general; accretion, accretion disks; quasars: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; LINE REGION SIZES; BLACK-HOLE; ACCRETION DISK; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; MULTIWAVELENGTH CAMPAIGN; REFLECTED SPECTRA; EMISSION-LINES; CENTRAL MASSES; EVENT HORIZON	Context. The physical characteristics of the material closest to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are primarily studied through X-ray observations. However, the origins of the main X-ray components such as the soft X-ray excess, the FeK alpha line complex, and the hard X-ray excess are still hotly debated. This is particularly problematic for active galactic nuclei (AGN) showing a significant intrinsic absorption, either warm or neutral, which can severely distort the observed continuum. Therefore, AGN with no (or very weak) intrinsic absorption along the line of sight, so-called "bare AGN", are the best targets to directly probe matter very close to the SMBH. Aims. We perform an X-ray spectral analysis of the brightest and cleanest bare AGN known so far, Ark 120, in order to determine the process(es) at work in the vicinity of the SMBH. Methods. We present spectral analyses of data from an extensive campaign observing Ark 120 in X-rays with XMM-Newton (4 x 120 ks, 2014 March 18-24), and NuSTAR (65.5 ks, 2014 March 22). Results. During this very deep X-ray campaign, the source was caught in a high-flux state similar to the earlier 2003 XMM-Newton observation, and about twice as bright as the lower-flux observation in 2013. The spectral analysis confirms the "softer when brighter" behavior of Ark 120. The four XMM-Newton/pn spectra are characterized by the presence of a prominent soft X-ray excess and a significant FeK alpha complex. The continuum is very similar above about 3 keV, while significant variability is present for the soft X-ray excess. We find that relativistic reflection from a constant-density, flat accretion disk cannot simultaneously produce the soft excess, broad FeK alpha complex, and hard X-ray excess. Instead, Comptonization reproduces the broadband (0.3-79 keV) continuum well, together with a contribution from a mildly relativistic disk reflection spectrum. Conclusions. During this 2014 observational campaign, the soft X-ray spectrum of Ark 120 below similar to 0.5 keV was found to be dominated by Comptonization of seed photons from the disk by a warm (kT(e) similar to 0 : 5 keV), optically-thick corona (tau similar to 9). Above this energy, the X-ray spectrum becomes dominated by Comptonization from electrons in a hot optically thin corona, while the broad FeK alpha line and the mild Compton hump result from reflection off the disk at several tens of gravitational radii.

Towards intelligent geospatial data discovery: a machine learning framework for search ranking	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH			English	Article						Learning to rank; semantic search; user behavior; search engine; big data; metadata; data relevancy; data portal	SEMANTIC SEARCH; SYSTEMS; WEB	Current search engines in most geospatial data portals tend to induce users to focus on one single-data characteristic dimension (e.g. popularity and release date). This approach largely fails to take account of users' multidimensional preferences for geospatial data, and hence may likely result in a less than optimal user experience in discovering the most applicable dataset. This study reports a machine learning framework to address the ranking challenge, the fundamental obstacle in geospatial data discovery, by (1) identifying a number of ranking features of geospatial data to represent users' multidimensional preferences by considering semantics, user behavior, spatial similarity, and static dataset metadata attributes; (2) applying a machine learning method to automatically learn a ranking function; and (3) proposing a system architecture to combine existing search-oriented open source software, semantic knowledge base, ranking feature extraction, and machine learning algorithm. Results show that the machine learning approach outperforms other methods, in terms of both precision at K and normalized discounted cumulative gain. As an early attempt of utilizing machine learning to improve the search ranking in the geospatial domain, we expect this work to set an example for further research and open the door towards intelligent geospatial data discovery.

This reality drives several key design decisions: (1) when to invoke (re) scheduling, (2) what to do when the scheduler is running, and (3) how to use the schedule to execute scheduled activities. We define these design decisions theoretically in the context of the embedded scheduler and practically in the context of the design of an embedded scheduler for a planetary rover. We use the concept of a commit window to enable execution to use the previously generated schedule while (re) scheduling. We define the concepts of fixed cadence, event driven, and hybrid scheduling to control invocation of (re) scheduling. We define the concept of flexible execution to enable execution of the generated schedule to be adaptive within the response cycle of the scheduler. We present empirical results from both synthetic and planetary rover scheduling and execution model data that documents the effectiveness of these techniques at enabling the scheduler to take advantage of execution opportunities to complete activities earlier.

Images obtained by the Cassini spacecraft's synthetic aperture radar reveal morphologies, roughness, textural patterns and other properties consistent with fan analogues on Earth also viewed by synthetic aperture radar. The observed fan characteristics on Titan reveal some regions of high relative relief and others with gentle slopes over hundreds of kilometres, exposing topographic variations and influences on fan formation. There is evidence for a range of particle sizes across proximal to distal fan regions, from c.2 cm or more to fine-grained, which can provide details on sedimentary processes. Some features are best described as alluvial fans, which implies their proximity to high-relief source areas, while others are more likely to be fluvial fans, drawing from larger catchment areas and frequently characterized by more prolonged runoff events. The presence of fans corroborates the vast liquid storage capacity of the atmosphere and the resultant episodic behaviour. Fans join the growing list of landforms on Titan derived from atmospheric and fluvial processes similar to those on Earth, strengthening comparisons between these two planetary bodies.

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Bagnold Dunes Campaign, Phase I: Overview and introduction to the special issue	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						sand dunes; bed forms; Mars; sand grains; sand chemistry; volatiles	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; GALE CRATER; MERIDIANI-PLANUM; STRATIGRAPHY; EXPLORATION; CALIBRATION; MINERALOGY; SYSTEM; ROCKS; FIELD	The Bagnold dunes in Gale Crater, Mars, are the first active aeolian dune field explored in situ on another planet. The Curiosity rover visited the Bagnold dune field to understand modern winds, aeolian processes, rates, and structures; to determine dune material composition, provenance, and the extent and type of compositional sorting; and to collect knowledge that informs the interpretation of past aeolian processes that are preserved in the Martian sedimentary rock record. The Curiosity rover conducted a coordinated campaign of activities lasting 4months, interspersed with other rover activities, and employing all of the rover's science instruments and several engineering capabilities. Described in 13 manuscripts and summarized here, the major findings of the Bagnold Dunes Campaign, Phase I, include the following: the characterization of and explanation for a distinctive, meter-scale size of sinuous aeolian bedform formed in the high kinetic viscosity regime of Mars' thin atmosphere; articulation and evaluation of a grain splash model that successfully explains the occurrence of saltation even at wind speeds below the fluid threshold; determination of the dune sands' basaltic mineralogy and crystal chemistry in comparison with other soils and sedimentary rocks; and characterization of chemically distinctive volatile reservoirs in sand-sized versus dust-sized fractions of Mars soil, including two volatile-bearing types of amorphous phases. Plain Language Summary Over the course of several months, the Curiosity rover explored the Bagnold dune field in Gale crater, Mars. This was the first time a robotic space mission had visited active, migrating sand dunes on the surface of another planet. In overall dune shape, sand grain size, and dune in migration in the direction of the strongest winds, Curiosity found that dunes on Mars were similar in many ways to those on Earth. But there were also discoveries of key differences that indicate how wind-related processes work. A distinctive type of ripple observed at the Bagnold dunessinuous and larger than typical for Earthmay form from conditions specific to Mars' very thin atmosphere. Also, modeling results show that a few grains making short hops cause a large cascade of grain hops -- and thus dune migration -- even at very low wind speeds, a characteristic unique to Mars' low gravity. Unlike what is typical for Earth, the Martian sand grains have different compositions depending on size. Also, the sand dunes are free of the relatively ubiquitous Mars dust, probably due to ongoing wind activity blowing the dust away in suspension. By comparing the chemistries of the dust-free dune sands with more typical sandy-dusty soils, Curiosity discovered elevated sulfur, chlorine, and water in the soils that was easily released by heating. Thus, exploration of the Bagnold dunes revealed many important processes shaping the modern Mars landscape and the chemistry of materials on the Mars surface.

The behavior of the osculating eccentricity is examined, in which eccentricity decreases to a minimum before quickly increasing toward escape (e = 1). We find that the argument of periapsis replaces true anomaly as the fast time variable, and the spacecraft escapes near an osculating true anomaly of 90 degrees. This behavior was observed by the authors while designing thrusting maneuvers for the Dawn spacecraft. In this paper the dynamical theory governing these observations is discussed and explored with numerical simulations.

SEMI-ANALYTIC PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF LOW-THRUST MISSIONS	ASTRODYNAMICS 2017, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 20-24, 2017	Stevenson, WA	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				Using generalized logarithmic spirals to approximate low-thrust trajectories, a new strategy for the design of low-thrust gravity-assist transfers has been developed. Each transfer leg is defined by a semi-analytic model, and its solution is equivalent to a hybrid Lambert's problem. The method is suitable for approximating both flyby and rendezvous transfer legs. A branch and prune algorithm is used to generate a collection of initial guesses for further optimization. The analytic nature of the low-thrust model simplifies the pruning step, since dynamical and operational constraints (like maximum thrust or total Delta v) can be imposed easily. The solutions obtained with the global search algorithm can be post-processed, filtered, and ranked according to various criteria. This is where the versatility of the method resides, because changing the selection criteria does not require a new search. Selected candidates are then optimized further, in order to generate actual low-thrust orbits. Two mission design examples are presented: an asteroid deflection mission using a kinetic impactor, and a rendezvous mission to Jupiter. These examples are used to analyze the convergence of the optimization stage, in particular how far from the optimal solution the initial guesses are.

But, low-thrust transfers between stable periodic orbits are challenging in this regime. Transfer design between such orbits cannot leverage the unstable manifold structures typically employed. Thus, a methodology for constructing these transfers, based on collocation, is demonstrated. Initial guesses comprised of coast arcs along periodic orbits as well as intermediate trajectory arcs from other periodic orbits are converged into feasible transfers and then refined using continuation and optimization strategies. This process applies to various spacecraft configurations and results are validated in a higher-fidelity model. Practical examples demonstrate collocation as a robust approach for computing low-thrust transfers.

Launch is scheduled for next year, with a 20-day launch period beginning on 31 July 2018. PSP will be on a ballistic trajectory, requiring seven Venus flybys to progressively lower the perihelion over the seven-year mission. This near-solar environment can be particularly challenging from a spacecraft design as well as a navigation perspective.

Two approaches are applied and tested for the design of trajectories aimed at Near-Earth asteroids. Maneuvers with two lunar gravity assists are considered and analyzed. Indirect optimization of the heliocentric leg is combined to an approximate analytical treatment of the geocentric phase for short escape maneuvers. The results of pre-computed maps of escape C3 are used for the design of longer sun-perturbed escape sequences. Features are compared and suggestions about a combined use of the approaches are presented. The techniques are efficiently applied to the design of a mission to a near-Earth asteroid.

The software tool is based on a collocation algorithm where a trajectory discretization is fitted and adjusted until the underlying dynamics equations of motion are satisfied. The resulting large scale non-linear programming problem may either be optimized with IPOPT or KNITRO. The user specifies path constraints, boundary constraints, and objectives. We describe the collocation algorithm as well as mesh refinement strategies, and apply the software tool to solve various example problems.

This transformation, coupled with the F and G functions, explicitly defines the velocity vectors for a pair of position vectors. Using this property, a discretization strategy is formulated where continuous or impulsive thrusting arcs are represented by set of impulses, implicitly realized by maintaining spatial continuity. Time discontinuity is propagated forward and removed at the last grid point either via explicit constraints or a Lambert arc. The trajectory is transformed into a NLP which is solved using existing solvers. Algorithm performance is studied and compared to JPL's Mission Analysis Low-Thrust Optimizer(MALTO).

The 1:2:4 orbital resonance among these moons allows for trajectories that periodically fly by the three bodies, and under idealized assumptions repeat indefinitely. An initial search method is implemented to determine if the location of the moons in a specific geometry can give way to a possible cycler. Lambert's problem is then solved to determine the legs connecting consecutive encounters, allowing a maneuver at periapsis of the encounter if necessary. Families of solutions are classified by synodic period, and conversion to high fidelity model is outlined.

The concept applies to any problem in orbital dynamics. Moreover, it can be extended to any three-dimensional system of differential equations of second order. In order to assess the topological stability of a given integration a special metric is introduced, which can be used to estimate the numerical errors robustly. The method is particularly well suited for dealing with strongly perturbed and chaotic systems. The construction is based on the constraint imposed by the Hopf map that supports the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. Generic concepts of stability are translated to KS space.

The method is generic for various classes of problems including non-autonomous systems and different types of periodic solutions. The cell-mapping method also does not require previously known solutions as inputs, which is typical of continuation approaches, and no symmetric constraints are imposed. This method is especially applicable to a systematic periodic orbit search over a region of interest at one-period of integration. As additional strengths of the method, multiple-period solutions and bifurcation studies can be easily performed. In this study, the initial orbit search is applied to obtain an understanding of the orbit trade space at Europa and Enceladus.

However, one week before PRM execution, a main engine propulsion system anomaly prompted an indefmite PRM delay and immediate updates to the Juno reference trajectory. This paper outlines stop-gap trajectory design activities immediately following PRM delay and longer-term trajectory redesign considerations including various possible PRM epochs, orbit period, longitude grid characteristics, and eclipse avoidance strategies that culminated in the decision to cancel PRM and adopt a new 53-day reference trajectory.

Since the Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) maneuver, Juno has completed six orbits around Jupiter. The mission plan at the time of JOI was for Juno to perform two 53.5-day capture orbits before executing a Period Reduction Maneuver (PRM) to place the spacecraft into its intended 14-day science orbit. This maneuver was canceled due to a concern with the propulsion system. As a result, the Juno spacecraft will remain in its longer orbit period for rest of its mission. This paper discusses the Navigation Team's experience: the orbit determination strategy and how it changed due to the cancellation of the PRM, challenges fitting the data during perijove, and how we reconstructed the trajectory during Juno's first year in orbit.

Primarily to avoid moons potentially harboring conditions for life and with propellant very low, the intentional plunge into the atmosphere was set in motion years ago. We take this opportunity to give an overview of the optical navigation and its roles throughout the mission. The paper describes the navigation process and the evolution of optical navigation over the past thirteen years. The last equatorial phase of the Cassini mission was particularly challenging for the OD team as the Saturn system was not being estimated anymore, and it had been a few years since the last icy moon flybys. Science pictures of Enceladus one month prior to the Enceladus encounters confirmed the moon's position to be in good agreement with the Saturn system dynamical modeling used. This reduced Enceladus's absolute uncertainty by a factor of three, less than 1 km, and gave confidence the navigation team could achieve acceptable flybys and meet science objectives.

INITIAL JUPITER ORBIT INSERTION AND PERIOD REDUCTION MANEUVER PLANS FOR JUNO	ASTRODYNAMICS 2017, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 20-24, 2017	Stevenson, WA	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				This paper describes the initial plans for the New Frontiers Juno mission at Jupiter. It includes the considerable contingency planning for mission recovery if the Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) burn to place Juno into a large capture orbit were interrupted or terminated on a burn timer setting, and the options for the mission if the Period Reduction Maneuver (PRM) burn to achieve the fmal orbit period were terminated early. The analyses were based on the assumption that 14-day orbits were the desired operational orbit period.

ASTRODYNAMICS 2017, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 20-24, 2017	Stevenson, WA	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				The CloudSat mission recently completed eleven years of on-orbit operations, providing unique radar profiles of the vertical structure of clouds. CloudSat is a member of the A-Train, an international constellation of Earth-science satellites at 705 km altitude with an ascending node at 1:30 PM local time. Five years into the mission, the CloudSat spacecraft survived a near-death experience when its battery developed a current-limiting impedance restriction. Dramatic changes were made to the operations of the spacecraft, allowing the mission to continue providing unique weather- and climate-related data on clouds. While several more years of operations are possible, a number of challenges still exist. We discuss the science, the history, and options for the future of CloudSat.

THE DESIGN OF THE REFERENCE ORBIT FOR NISAR, THE NASA-ISRO SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR MISSION	ASTRODYNAMICS 2017, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 20-24, 2017	Stevenson, WA	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				The NISAR mission plans to use a 12-day-repeating sun-synchronous orbit for repeat-pass interferometry at multiple time scales using SAR data. For the interferometry to work the radar measurements must be made from within a critical baseline, which happens if all of the orbits are maintained to be within a fixed tube around a reference orbit. This paper describes the choice of dynamical models used in defining such a reference orbit, the perturbative effects of dynamics not considered in the repeat orbit, and the process of designing the orbit to repeat. We also describe our method for sharing the repeat orbit among multiple mission participants who use different models and software.

This is often a poor assumption in realistic measurement scenarios where the data can be received from multiple sources at differing times. This paper develops the necessary algorithm adjustments needed for the Kalman filter to readily process measurement data that arrive at varying times and with non-stationary noise. The algorithm is applied to a relevant problem of orbit determination using one-way uplink radiometric tracking of a spacecraft (in the present case a Mars orbiter).

The surface is represented implicitly, allowing for fast distance computations to high-resolution shape models. The motion of the spacecraft is propagated relative to the rotating target body. A distributed normal force and torque is generated by spring-damper units attached to vertices that cover the spacecraft shell. A single friction force is applied at an effective application point and drives the sliding velocity of that point to zero. An expression for the sticking force that maintains zero sliding velocity is derived. Using a regularization technique, the transition between slip and stick is smoothed. Rolling resistance reduces the spacecraft angular velocity, while maintaining the slip state of the application point. The model is extensively tested on a flat plane, with particular attention given to the applied numerical tolerances. Sample simulations on a rotating sphere and the signed distance field of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko illustrate relevant applications of the model.

First, semi-analytic solutions for transfers with free time and angle characterize the evolution of the shape and orientation of the orbit. Next, optimal control theory supplies the thrust vector with variable specific impulse while satisfying flight time and transfer angle constraints. Transfers with the additional constraint of constant specific impulse then provide a more realistic thruster model for preliminary trade studies. These approximations deliver a hundredfold improvement in run time at the expense of a few percent error in mass.

In the first method, the (linear) Clohessy-Wilthsire equations are used as an initial design tool, followed by conversion to a two-body model. Discrepancies between the linear and nonlinear solutions are minimized in the conversion process. The second method utilizes invariant manifold theory, by perturbing a reference trajectory in different directions along the center eigenvectors. Both methods require 5N parameters to fully define a constellation. In a relative, rotating frame of the reference path, the spacecraft appear as periodic ellipses of varying sizes. Deployment, reconfiguration using propulsive maneuvers, and station keeping costs for an example mission scenario are addressed.

In this study, the hyperbolic invariant set, or the invariant three-sphere of solutions, is studied using the asymptotic approaches of the stable manifold to the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits contained within the invariant three-sphere. A new bisection method is used to compute trajectories that follow the invariant three-sphere and study these trajectories in more detail.

Understanding the dynamical environment between various cislunar orbits is therefore useful. The current study is focused on finding efficient transfer trajectory options between a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) and a Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) in the Earth Moon system. A general methodology is introduced to design these transfers in a systematic way, including the use of solar perturbations and lunar flybys. Representative solutions are presented and compared in terms of delta-v and flight time, including a transfer requiring 56 m/s only.

This paper derives an approximation of the position estimate accuracy that can be achieved with this technique based on the assumption of multiple, simultaneous line-of-sight measurements. This achievable accuracy is computed for locations across the solar system, which can be used to estimate cruise navigation performance as a function of spacecraft trajectory. It is shown that an on-board optical navigation system can achieve kinematic position estimate accuracies of better than 100 km throughout the inner solar system with a high-performance camera and from many hundred to several thousand kilometers with a low-end camera. Beyond the main-asteroid belt, the feasibility of this approach suffers due to lack of targets. A case-study implementation of this approach for the upcoming InSight mission to Mars is also presented.

Such trajectories which also involve at least one flyby of Venus are computed here for the first time. The so-called triple cyclers are constructed to exhibit low excess speed on Earth-Mars and Mars-Earth transit legs, and thereby reduce the cost of hyperbolic rendezvous. Thousands of previously undocumented two synodic period Earth-Mars-Venus triple cyclers are discovered. Many solutions are identified with average transit leg excess speed below 5 km/sec, independent of encounter epoch. The energy characteristics are lower than previously documented cyclers not involving Venus, but the repeat periods are generally longer.

LOW-THRUST TRAJECTORY MAPS (BACON PLOTS) TO SUPPORT A HUMAN MARS SURFACE EXPEDITION	ASTRODYNAMICS 2017, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 20-24, 2017	Stevenson, WA	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				Planning the logistics of multiple launches to support a Mars surface expedition requires good trajectory design tools. Traditional ballistic transfers are well characterized by performance maps known as porkchop plots. However, the transportation of cargo can benefit from the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion, both in terms of mass delivered and the flexibility of flight durations and dates. This paper describes the design and use of bacon plots (the low-thrust analog to porkchop plots) and their application to the architectural design of a human Mars surface expedition.

OVERVIEW OF THE MISSION DESIGN REFERENCE TRAJECTORY FOR NASA'S ASTEROID REDIRECT ROBOTIC MISSION	ASTRODYNAMICS 2017, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 20-24, 2017	Stevenson, WA	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) recently cancelled Asteroid Redirect Mission was proposed to rendezvous with and characterize a 100 m plus class near-Earth asteroid and provide the capability to capture and retrieve a boulder off of the surface of the asteroid and bring the asteroidal material back to cislunar space.(1) Leveraging the best of NASA's science, technology, and human exploration efforts, this mission was originally conceived to support observation campaigns, advanced solar electric propulsion, and NASA's Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket and Orion crew vehicle. The asteroid characterization and capture portion of ARM was referred to as the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) and was focused on the robotic capture and then redirection of an asteroidal boulder mass from the reference target, asteroid 2008 EV5, into an orbit near the Moon, referred to as a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit where astronauts would visit and study it. The purpose of this paper is to document the final reference trajectory of ARRM and the challenges and unique methods employed in the trajectory design of the mission.

In this paper, we discuss the uses and insights provided by a relatively new mission design tool, the bacon plot, for Earth to Mars trajectories. The bacon plot is analogous to ballistic pork chop plots but for low-thrust missions and helps to visualize many parameters important to low-thrust missions such as delivered payload, maximum and minimum heliocentric distance, propellant requirements, launch window size, and required times of flight. A design scenario for a Mars SEP orbiter is presented to illustrate how mission designers use bacon plots. We also present a new tool that allows for the fast and easy estimation of a SEP spacecraft's optimal power, thrust, trajectory, and required propellant, through the use of a bacon plot estimator that can be run in seconds instead of hours.

In this setting, the agent must maximize discounted cumulative reward while constraining the probability of entering unsafe states, defined using a safety function being within some tolerance. The safety values of all states are not known a priori, and we probabilistically model them via a Gaussian Process (GP) prior. As such, properly behaving in such an environment requires balancing a three-way trade-off of exploring the safety function, exploring the reward function, and exploiting acquired knowledge to maximize reward. We propose a novel approach to balance this trade-off. Specifically, our approach explores unvisited states selectively; that is, it prioritizes the exploration of a state if visiting that state significantly improves the knowledge on the achievable cumulative reward. Our approach relies on a novel information gain criterion based on Gaussian Process representations of the reward and safety functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of experiments, including a simulation using the real Martian terrain data.

Remote sensing is now providing a near-global record of floodplain inundation and can be a viable strategy for large-scale monitoring of flood inundation. However, uncertainties in these observations and the need for forecasting requires their fusion with hydrodynamic models. Data assimilation algorithms can merge observations with models, providing optimal estimates of flood characteristics by taking into account the errors in both models and observations. The objective of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of data assimilation in river hydrodynamic and flood modeling and present some examples from a specific case study. Finally, some of the challenges and opportunities are discussed in the context of assessing flood hazard over large scales (such as continental and global).

As a software system grows, the need to capture its design, often through models, becomes important in order to boost communication and collaboration. In this paper, we report on a study that assesses the open source community's adoption of modeling as a way to capture design and enable collaboration among development teams. The study includes a search of open source repositories to identify modeling artifacts, a survey, a questionnaire, and a set of interviews with open source contributors. Our findings show that there is a low number of modeling artifacts that are included in open source project repositories. However, the survey, the questionnaire, and the interviews suggest that capturing design in models is much more common than what can be inferred by searching the repositories alone. These models are created through collaborations, but often are not shared in the open source repositories. This is due to many factors including the lack of incentives to share modeling artifacts beyond the immediate circle of collaborators and limited collaboration support in modeling tools.

Joseph W.; Neilsen, Tim			SunRISE Status: Concept Development Update	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The authors present an update on the Sun Radio Interferometer Space Experiment (SunRISE) mission concept. SunRISE is space-based sparse array, composed of formation flying SmallSats designed to localize the radio emission associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun. Radio emission from CMEs is a direct tracer of the particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere and potential magnetic connections from the lower solar corona to the larger heliosphere. Furthermore, CME radio emission is quite strong such that only a relatively small number of antennas is required, and a small mission would make a fundamental advancement. Indeed, the state-of-the-art for tracking CME radio emission is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES) in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping. The paper presents the most recent updates on this mission concept, starting with an overview of the science requirements. It then focuses on the SunRISE concept of operations, which consists of six SmallSats placed in a geostationary graveyard orbit for 6 months to achieve the aforementioned science goals. Each of the mission phases are discussed in detail. Finally, the paper dives into SunRISE's science data processing process, including simulation results, demonstrating how the data will produce sufficient to achieve the science goals.

Radio Science experiments have elucidated the thermal history of the Moon from high resolution gravitational field measurements, unveiled the interiors of Titan, Enceladus, Mercury, Phobos, Vesta and Ceres providing key evidence for identifying subsurface oceans on icy moons; sounded Titan, Saturn, and Pluto's atmospheres, and refined models for the atmospheres, surfaces, and interior structure of Mars and Venus. A Juno experiment is in progress measuring the gravitational field of Jupiter to reveal its interior structures, as did a similar recent Cassini experiment with Saturn. Experiments at Mercury, the Jovian system, and other targets, are in development or planning phases. Over the next 30 years, significant advances in radio and laser link-science technologies, including nearly one order of magnitude improvement achievable in range-rate and range accuracy, could enable many new scientific breakthroughs. Future exploration concepts in many cases focus on applications of small spacecraft and can include spacecraft constellations for studies of atmospheric dynamics, interior structures, and surface properties. A set of science-enabling radio link technologies specific to small spacecraft instrumentation on future solar system missions are under study and development.

The NASA Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program Mission Analysis Team gathered information on past and recent RPS mission concept studies by various organizations in the United States to support the Next-Generation RTG Study in crystalizing an understanding of mission "pull" that is crucial to define requirements for a potential next generation of RTGs. This paper describes the top-down processes and findings that helped establish a reasonable set of draft requirements for a potential Next-Generation RTG, which are documented in the Next-Generation RTG Study final report. To perform the required mission analyses, and to combine data and present the results in a unique way, an extensive relational database was developed. The database includes detailed data for 63 targets, six generic potential destinations (comet, Trojan, Centaur, etc.), 142 spacecraft concepts (65 launched and 77 studied), and 249 missions associated with these spacecraft concepts. In total, 77 RPS-powered spacecraft and associated mission concept studies were gathered, evaluated and assessed for the Next-Generation RTG Study. A number of spacecraft are associated with a number of mission concept types/subtypes at different destinations; thus, in this report, a mission is defined as a unique vector of spacecraft, mission concept type (e.g., lander) /subtype (e.g., rover), and target. For example, Cassini conducted flybys of Enceladus and 2685 Masursky, and orbited Saturn, which is considered three missions under this definition. Furthermore, there are two categories of spacecraft concepts: launched missions (e.g., Cassini, Mars Science Laboratory [MSL]) and concepts studied for possible future missions.

This paper presents a novel concept for building a radio telescope on the far-side of the Moon. The main idea is to shape a suitable existing lunar crater (1 - 50km in diameter) on the far-side of the Moon into a spherical reflecting dish. The proposed Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT) would be able to observe the universe in the 5 - 100m wavelength band (i.e., 3 - 60MHz radio frequency band). The key innovations of this concept are: (1) LCRT will be the largest filled-aperture radio telescope in the Solar System. (2) LCRT could potentially make tremendous scientific discoveries in fields of cosmology and extrasolar planets by observing the universe in the 5 - 100m lambda band (i.e., 3 - 60MHz v band) that has been hitherto poorly explored. (3) It would require only a few robots from Earth and autonomously modify an existing lunar crater to build the LCRT; thereby significantly reducing launch weight and cost compared to all previous lunar-surface telescope mission concepts. (4) Furthermore, the Earth-based robots are not consumed during construction of LCRT. Therefore, they could create a network of LCRTs to (i) observe different regions of the universe, and (ii) enable lunar Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astronomy. We envisage that this concept would unlock the potential for ground-breaking scientific discoveries in radio astronomy.

SPRITE: A Saturn Probe New Frontiers Mission	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			GIANT PLANETS; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; CLOUD STRUCTURE; EQUATORIAL JET; SOLAR-SYSTEM; JUPITER; ATMOSPHERE; WINDS; ABUNDANCE	If not for Saturn, Jupiter might have swept up the terrestrial planets, leaving our Sun's habitable zone barren. This startling hypothesis is based on modeling many exoplanet systems: orbital resonance with Saturn conceivably stopped Jupiter's inward migration, preserving humanity's future home. In situ measurements of the abundance pattern of Saturn's noble gases and other elements, and its isotope ratios, will reveal when and where it formed in relation to Jupiter. They are not remotely observable since noble gases have no measurable spectral signature and other elements are only well-mixed beneath the clouds. Neither Cassini nor Juno have answered these outstanding fundamental questions. Saturn's upper clouds also hide its chemistry, deep winds, and fundamental properties like temperature and pressure that govern vertical motion and circulation. In situ measurements by a probe will be a guidepost that tie the cloud-top view from remote sensing to the properties and processes below. We will measure the abundance of key disequilibrium (CO, PH3 and C2H6) and condensable (NH3) species; cloud layer properties (particle density as a function of altitude) at 1%-scale-height resolution; and dynamic properties (P, T, vertical motion, and wind speed) to at least 10 bar (similar to 200 km deeper than the 1 bar level). These data, coupled with our near-simultaneous remote images and prior observations, are essential for validating the community's planetary cloud models and global climate simulations under different boundary conditions. SPRITE data will also provide context for our interpretation of time-varying observations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. SPRITE is implemented with a three-element flight system comprised of a flyby Carrier Relay Spacecraft (CRSC) and an entry Probe consisting of an Aeroshell with engineering sensors and Descent Vehicle with science payload. There are four instruments: three on the Probe and one on the CRSC. The Probe's Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer and Tunable Laser Spectrometer directly measure noble gas and other elemental abundances, and isotopic ratios. This instrument suite has heritage from the SAM suite on MSL. The Probe's Atmospheric Structure Instrument measures vertical pressure, temperature, and acceleration profiles using the same approach as the Galileo Probe. A simple laser-backscatter nephelometer based on terrestrial instruments measures particle number density of tropospheric clouds. The Ultrastable Oscillators in the telecom subsystem enable retrieval of Saturn's deep winds. The CRSC hosts a Multi-Channel Imager to document the specific dynamic environment at the Probe site and to place the in situ measurements in context with prior remote imaging by Cassini and HST. All science analysis techniques needed were demonstrated on MSL, Cassini, HST, and other missions. Data quality of projected instrument performance is 2-5 times better than the measurement requirements; the instruments collect 1.5-2 times more samples than are required. The 120-minute descent also includes 33% unallocated time margin. SPRITE will provide definitive answers to all of these important scientific questions and represents the capstone of the Galileo, Cassini and Juno missions to the Giant Planets.

S	Bayer, T			IEEE	Bayer, Todd			Is MBSE Helping? Measuring Value on Europa Clipper	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				JPL's Integrated Model Centric Engineering Initiative (IMCE) has led the infusion of MBSE at JPL. In 2009 I authored for IMCE a set of challenges that confronted systems engineering at JPL, based on examination of issues and lessons from several recent projects (the "Five System Engineering Challenges"). In 2012 I augmented this work to describe specific areas where it appeared MBSE could help address these challenges. Around the same time, the Europa Clipper Mission became the first project at JPL to attempt, in close collaboration with IMCE, a widespread adoption of MBSE. This adoption has been highly successful so far. Europa Clipper completed Phase A (Formulation) with a successful System Requirements Review / Mission Definition Review, and is nearing the end of Phase B, with a successful Flight System Preliminary Design Review in October 2017. This is an opportune time to take stock of the progress and the work yet to go. This paper proposes a practical method for measuring value added through use of MBSE, applies this method to the Europa Clipper Project, and suggests how it might be applied to other projects and organizations.

The 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey, Vision and Voyages In states: "Because of this ocean's potential suitability for life, Europa is one of the most important targets in all of planetary science." Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the proposed Europa Clipper mission. This exploration is intimately tied to understanding the three "ingredients" for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy. The Europa Clipper mission will investigate these ingredients by comprehensively exploring Europa's ice shell and liquid ocean interface, surface geology and surface composition to glean insight into the inner workings of this fascinating moon. In addition, a lander mission is seen as a possible future step, but current data about the Jovian radiation environment and about potential landing zones that are both scientifically interesting and safe for landing is insufficient. Therefore, an additional goal of the mission is to characterize the radiation environment near Europa and locate and investigate scientifically compelling sites for hazards to inform a potential future landed mission. The Europa Clipper mission will send a Flight System, consisting of a Spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific Instruments, to execute a large number of Europa flybys while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge of this mission is that the Flight System must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh near Europa. The innovative design of this multiple-flyby tour is an enabling feature of the Europa Clipper mission: by minimizing the time spent in the radiation environment, the spacecraft complexity and cost has been significantly reduced compared to previous mission concepts. Europa Clipper is planned to launch no earlier than 2022 on a NASA-supplied launch vehicle from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA. The mission is formulated and implemented by a combined Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. In January 2017, the Europa Clipper mission passed its System Requirements Review / Mission Definition Review (SRR/MDR), and NASA approved the mission for entry into Phase B (the Preliminary Design phase) in February. The "Clipper" name was officially sanctioned by NASA. The Flight System Preliminary Design Review (PDR) took place in October 2017 and will be followed by Subsystem PDRs and will culminate with Project PDR in August 2018. Mass and power allocations have been made; a new tour trajectory has been designed and adopted, the sizing of key design elements has been determined (propulsion tanks, solar array, etc), and a down-selection to one launch vehicle by NASA is anticipated sometime this year. A decision to down-select to the NASA Space Launch System (SLS) would enable launch onto a direct-to-Jupiter trajectory, allowing significant system simplifications. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Clipper Mission since January 2017, including maturation of the Flight System design, mission trajectories, requirements, and system analyses.

We addressed this need by developing the key technologies necessary to develop a next generation compact avionics package. The key technologies that we developed significantly reduce the size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) of the avionics package. These technologies will also allow extreme-environment missions to last longer in their environment by reducing the power and energy requirement to keep the avionics warm.

A Low-Thrust-Enabled SmallSat Heliophysics Mission to Sun-Earth L5	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			POINT; SOLAR	We present an approach to enable SmallSat mission concepts to the Sun-Earth (SE) L5 Lagrange point in support of advancing our understanding of solar processes and weather monitoring capabilities by addressing one of the primary challenges of such a mission: traveling to this distant region with limited propulsive capability. Heliophysicists have long been interested in missions to SE L5, which trails behind the Earth in its orbit, due to the capability for viewing solar and interplanetary phenomena. Consequently, a spacecraft orbiting in the vicinity of SE L5 would observe the Sun before it rotates into Earth nadir and provide early warning of solar activity. Although SmallSats have emerged as an effective and low-cost platform for space-based science and exploration, operational and mission constraints create significant challenges during the trajectory design process. For instance, the miniaturization of electrospray and ion thrusters render low-thrust propulsion systems an enabling technology for upcoming small satellite missions. However, such systems supply only a low acceleration over limited time intervals. Furthermore, the deployment conditions associated with a SmallSat are typically determined by the primary mission and may evolve frequently throughout the lifecycle of the mission. These regular updates may result in deviations from an individual reference trajectory that are too large for a low-thrust propulsion system to overcome, thereby necessitating a complete trajectory redesign. Together, these operational and mission constraints severely impact the geometry and availability of feasible trajectories that deliver a low-thrust-enabled SmallSat from an uncertain deployment state to the vicinity of SE L5. In fact, these challenges necessitate a rapid and well-informed procedure that leverages dynamical systems techniques for trajectory design. We summarize and demonstrate such an approach within this paper.

This measurement of the Doppler shift improves the knowledge of Jupiter's gravitational field. As a radio science instrument, Juno's gravity science instrument utilizes a ground component at the Deep Space Network's DSS-25 antenna, equipped with simultaneous dual X-and Ka-band transmitters and receivers, and a spacecraft component, which includes X-and Ka-band transponders to relay the transmitted signal back to Earth. Originally planned to be in 14-day orbits around Jupiter, a risk identified in the propulsion system led to the decision to stay in the 53-day orbit period. Rapid turnaround of observation planning led to successful near-term perijove passes. Although maintaining a 53-day orbit period provides a scientific benefit to the gravity science investigation, the longer orbit period further increases the large dynamic range in Doppler shift and pointing angles induced by the geometry of each perijove. Between entering orbit at Jupiter on July 5, 2016 and September 2017, the Juno spacecraft has executed eight closest approach periods every 53 days where science data was collected. The first five perijove passes were conducted in different telecom configurations, each presenting unique challenges in data collection and processing. Perijoves PJ-01, PJ-02, PJ-03, and PJ-06 utilized the high-gain antenna and various configurations of the X-and Ka-bands. Perijoves PJ-04 and PJ-05 utilized the medium-gain antenna at X-band only while the spacecraft was off-Earth point. Additional perijoves are planned every 53-days, with an additional five by March 2018. Lessons learned from operating and collecting data at each perijove are documented and will be utilized in future perijoves. Analysis of the first two gravity science perijoves has improved the precision of Jupiter's gravity field by a factor of five, providing crucial constraints on the interior structure of Jupiter.

S	Chandra, A; Thangavelautham, J; Babuscia, A			IEEE	Chandra, Aman; Thangavelautham, Jekanthan; Babuscia, Alessandra			Modular Inflatable Space Structures	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				There is a growing need to develop a human focused exploration program and support infrastructure, including relay sites in deep space. One of the first targets will be cislunar space station, which is a strategic gateway towards permanent settlement of the Moon and Mars. A station in deep space will require structures with large surfaces, very high volume to mass ratio and high-packing efficiency. The transportation of bulky payloads to beyond low-earth orbits pose formidable cost and logistical challenges. This requires a paradigm shift in research towards methods to build and assemble low-mass, large and complex structures in space instead of transporting them from Earth and deploying them on-site. On-site additive construction and assembly methods hold promise, but they face a major challenge of still having to transport large and heavy robotic equipment required to perform complex construction. This paper presents an alternate and more feasible pathway in developing small structural units that can be quickly shaped and assembled with limited external support. Inflatable structures hold that promise as they are low-mass, can be quickly reshaped, inflated and rigidized into desired modular units that are assembled into large, complex structures. Our present work extends the inflatables concept to study modular, inflatable blocks assembled into pre-determined geometries. The inflatable building blocks would be assembled into communication relays, science instrument antennas, structures to hold solar panels and large reflectors. Our efforts aim to identify common desired structural design traits in these modular units to enable them to be multi-functional building blocks that can be assembled into more complex functional blocks. Our design methodology focuses on simplicity of deployment mechanisms and high-scalability over varying sizes. Finally, this paper will provide preliminary feasibility of the modular inflatable building block concept and analyze the applications of this technology towards assembly of large structures in deep space.

S	Chesley, SR; Veres, P			IEEE	Chesley, Steven R.; Veres, Peter			Linking Asteroid Detections from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				We have conducted a detailed simulation of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in order to understand the system's ability to link detections of asteroids within and across nights in order to populate a catalog of asteroid orbits. We show that LSST, using its baseline survey cadence, should be able to successfully link and catalog asteroids. In our simulation of a single monthly observing cycle, LSST produced 66 million candidate detections of main belt asteroids (MBAs) and near-Earth objects (NEOs), of which 77% were spurious detections related to detector noise or image processing. Using the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS, Denneau et al. 2013, PASP 125, p. 357), we were able to assemble single-night "tracklets" with negligible losses, but a purity of only 43%. The next stage of linking led to three-night orbits with data sets no more than 12 days in length, and it is at this stage that the false detections are readily removed from the data stream. Main-belt linkages were essentially complete and 99.8% pure. Similarly, only 0.02% of linked detections involving NEOs were spurious. On the other hand, NEO linking was 93.6% complete, indicating that 6.4% of potentially findable NEOs were not successfully linked. We believe that this rate can be improved with careful tuning of the MOPS linking algorithms. The NEO catalog was affected by main-belt confusion so that mis-linked MBAs appeared as NEOs, and many correctly linked MBAs were consistent with NEO orbits. We show that these cases arise primarily from MBAs detected at lower solar elongations and we postulate that this is an artifact of a one month simulation that will be readily resolved by surveying over many months.
