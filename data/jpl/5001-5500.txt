Using the mock catalogue to study the error covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, we compare the full covariance with the 'jackknife' (JK) covariance, the method often used in the literature that estimates the covariance from the resamples of the data itself. We show that there exists the variation of JK covariance over realizations of mock lensing measurements, while the average JK covariance over mocks can give a reasonably accurate estimation of the true covariance up to separations comparable with the size of JK subregion. The scatter in JK covariances is found to be similar to 10 per cent after we subtract the lensing measurement around random points. However, the JK method tends to underestimate the covariance at the larger separations, more increasingly for a survey with a higher number density of source galaxies. We apply our method to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and show that the 48 mock SDSS catalogues nicely reproduce the signals and the JK covariance measured from the real data. We then argue that the use of the accurate covariance, compared to the JK covariance, allows us to use the lensing signals at large scales beyond a size of the JK subregion, which contains cleaner cosmological information in the linear regime.

In this paper, we present submillimetre images of the thermal emission from debris discs that formed the SCUBA-2 Observations of Nearby Stars (SONS) survey, one of seven legacy surveys undertaken on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope between 2012 and 2015. The overall results of the survey are presented in the form of 850 mu m (and 450 mu m, where possible) images and fluxes for the observed fields. Excess thermal emission, over that expected from the stellar photosphere, is detected around 49 stars out of the 100 observed fields. The discs are characterized in terms of their flux density, size (radial distribution of the dust) and derived dust properties from their spectral energy distributions. The results show discs over a range of sizes, typically 1-10 times the diameter of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt in our Solar system. The mass of a disc, for particles up to a few millimetres in size, is uniquely obtainable with submillimetre observations and this quantity is presented as a function of the host stars' age, showing a tentative decline in mass with age. Having doubled the number of imaged discs at submillimetre wavelengths from ground-based, single-dish telescope observations, one of the key legacy products from the SONS survey is to provide a comprehensive target list to observe at high angular resolution using submillimetre/millimetre interferometers (e.g. Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Smithsonian Millimeter Array).

Part II: Sensitivity and parameterization	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						MODIS; SST; ENSO; Sampling errors; Sensitivity; Sampling error parameterization	INSTABILITY WAVE; TIME-SERIES; RESOLUTION; OCEAN; FIELDS; ENSO	In the recent work of Liu and Minnett (2016), we estimated the sampling errors in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sea-Surface Temperatures (SSTs) due to clouds and other causes, and characterized the global error dependence on the variability of clouds and SST. Here we report sampling error sensitivity to the choice of reference field and the error variation when data from a different year are used. We also developed an empirical model to parameterize sampling errors. Our sensitivity tests show that the sampling error quantification method developed is robust and can reveal the consequences of missing infrared SST observations primarily due to clouds. Since the previously found pronounced negative sampling errors along the Tropical Instability Waves are largely dependent on the SST gradients, here these regional sampling errors are quantified using data from an El Nino year, confirming that the weakened meridional SST gradient due to El Nino can reduce the negative sampling errors. Furthermore, the climatology-derived sampling errors are found to be a primary component that can be utilized to estimate and parameterize the sampling errors, especially for the spatial sampling errors. For the temporal sampling errors, good estimates are obtained especially in the high latitudes and stratocumulus regions, by incorporating an empirical model proposed in this study and the previously found sampling error dependence.

A better understanding of the seasonal transition of high latitude landscapes between frozen and thawed states is therefore critical for predicting carbon cycle feedbacks in a warming climate. However, observations of freeze/ thaw state are not at sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to observe fast (similar to days-weeks) transitions in highly heterogeneous regions. Here, we present new evidence that reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals captured by the SMAP radar receiver have the potential to quantify changes in high-latitude soil freeze/thaw state at kilometer-scale resolution. Boreal wetland observations indicate a similar to 10 dB seasonal difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in agreement with simulations from a simple reflectivity model. Our analysis indicates that ground-reflected GNSS signals as a form of L-band bistatic radar could be a robust observable to quantify soil freeze/thaw state at process-relevant scales. We describe the caveats and potential limitations of this approach, and highlight areas for continuing research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

A surface-based Ku-, X- and C-band microwave scatterometer system is used near coincident with in-situ thermophysical snow measurements. A frequency-dependent penetration depth model is utilized to simulate diverse variations in Ku-, X- and C-band penetration during fluctuating snow thermophysical and atmospheric conditions. These results helped improve the interpretation of observed changes in Ku-, X- and C-band backscatter. Overall, dielectric loss associated with presence of brine throughout the snow volume, is observed to be the governing factor affecting microwave penetration. Our results indicate significant differences in observed microwave backscatter and derived co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios, for all three frequencies during the transition from cold late winter phase to warm pre-early melt onset phase. C-band demonstrates the greatest increase in backscatter and co-pol ratios, followed by X- and Ku-bands. The dual-frequency ratio combinations clearly demonstrate their ability to separate sensitivities in frequencies by characterizing changes in bacicscatter during the 7-day transition. Our results indicate strong direct influence of downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation on snow brine volume and dielectric properties, which drives changes to Ku-, X- and C-band microwave bacicscatter and its associated co-polarized ratio and dual-frequency ratios. Our results demonstrate the ability of an observational multi-frequency active microwave approach to illustrate frequency- ,polarization-and incidence angle-dependent changes in microwave backscatter from snow covers on first-year ice, at varying atmospheric and snow thermophysical conditions.

Aqueous geochemistry in icy world interiors: Equilibrium fluid, rock, and gas compositions, and fate of antifreezes and radionuclides	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Icy worlds; Antifreezes; Radionuclides; Ammonium minerals; Potassium; Chondrites	MOLAL THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; MASS-BALANCE CONSTRAINTS; HYDRATED SALT MINERALS; KUIPER-BELT OBJECTS; EQUATION-OF-STATE; HIGH-PRESSURES; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; THERMAL EVOLUTION; LOW-TEMPERATURES; ORGANIC-MATTER	The geophysical evolution of many icy moons and dwarf planets seems to have provided opportunities for interaction between liquid water and rock (silicate and organic solids). Here, we explore two ways by which water-rock interaction can feed back on geophysical evolution: the production or consumption of antifreeze compounds, which affect the persistence and abundance of cold liquid; and the potential leaching into the fluid of lithophile radionuclides, affecting the distribution of a long-term heat source. We compile, validate, and use a numerical model, implemented with the PHREEQC code, of the interaction of chondritic rock with pure water and with C, N, S-bearing cometary fluid, thought to be the materials initially accreted by icy worlds, and describe the resulting equilibrium fluid and rock assemblages at temperatures, pressures, and water-to-rock ratios of 0-200 degrees C, 1-1000 bar, and 0.1-10 by mass, respectively. Our findings suggest that water-rock interaction can strongly alter the nature and amount of antifreezes, resulting in solutions rich in reduced nitrogen and carbon, and sometimes dissolved H-2, with additional sodium, calcium, chlorine, and/or oxidized carbon. Such fluids can remain partially liquid down to 176 K if NH3 is present. The prominence of Cl in solution seems to hinge on its primordial supply in ices, which is unconstrained by the meteoritical record. Equilibrium assemblages, rich in serpentine and saponite clays, retain thorium and uranium radionuclides unless U-Cl or U-HCO3 complexing, which was not modeled, significantly enhances U solubility. However, the radionuclide K-40 can be leached at high water: rock ratio and/or low temperature at which K is exchanged with ammonium in minerals. We recommend the inclusion of these effects in future models of the geophysical evolution of ocean-bearing icy worlds. Our simulation products match observations of chloride salts on Europa and Enceladus; CI chondrites mineralogies; the observation of serpentines, NH4-phyllosilicates, and carbonates on Ceres' surface; and of Na and NH4-carbonate and chloride in Ceres' bright spots. They also match results from previous modeling studies with similar assumptions, and systematically expand these results to heretofore unexplored physico-chemical conditions. This work involved the compilation and careful validation of a comprehensive PHREEQC database, which combines the advantages of the default databases phreeqc. dat (carefully vetted data, molar volumes) and llnl. dat (large diversity of species), and should be of broad use to anyone seeking to model aqueous geochemistry at pressures that differ from 1 bar with PHREEQC.

Distance determination method of dust particles using Rosetta OSIRIS NAC and WAC data	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Meteoroids Conference	JUN 06-10, 2016	ESTEC, NETHERLANDS	IAU Commiss F1 Meteors, Meteorites, & Interplanetary Dust	ESTEC	Parallax; Stereo observations; Comets; 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; Rosetta; Dust		The ESA Rosetta spacecraft has been tracking its target, the Jupiter-family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in close vicinity for over two years. It hosts the OSIRIS instruments: the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System composed of two cameras, see e.g. Keller et al. (2007). In some imaging sequences dedicated to observe dust particles in the comet's coma, the two cameras took images at the same time. The aim of this work is to use these simultaneous double camera observations to calculate the dust particles' distance to the spacecraft. As the two cameras are mounted on the spacecraft with an offset of 70 cm, the distance of particles observed by both cameras can be determined by a shift of the particles' apparent trails on the images. This paper presents first results of the ongoing work, introducing the distance determination method for the OSIRIS instrument and the analysis of an example particle. We note that this method works for particles in the range of about 500-6000 m from the spacecraft.

PCA-based radiative transfer: Improvements to aerosol scheme, vertical layering and spectral binning	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							TRANSFER MODEL; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SCATTERING; ABSORPTION	The Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based fast radiative transfer method has been shown to have at least an order of magnitude increase in computational speed while maintaining an overall accuracy of 0.01% (compared to line-by-line calculations) over narrow and broad spectral bands. In this paper, we describe several improvements made to the method and provide a discussion of the method's performance over a diverse set of atmospheric profiles and land surface types. We also test the model over uniform pressure level profiles. The method is now capable of providing atmospheric spectra with residuals under 0.1%, calculated with respect to the continuum, throughout the shortwave region between 0.3-3 mu m at high resolution, which is substantial improvement over errors reported in earlier work. Future directions for applications and further optimization are examined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Long-lived volcanism within Argyie basin, Mars	ICARUS			English	Article							ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER; VALLES MARINERIS; GIANT POLYGONS; MUD VOLCANO; UTOPIA PLANITIA; MICROBIAL LIFE; UKINREK MAARS; EARTH; ICE; ORIGIN	The Argyre basin, one of the largest impact structures on Mars with a diameter >1200 km, formed in the Early Noachian similar to 3.93 Ga. The basin has collected volatiles and other material through time, and experienced partial infilling with water evident from stratigraphic sequences, crater statistics, topography, and geomorphology. Although volcanism has not been previously associated with the Argyre basin, our study of the northwest portion of the basin floor has revealed landforms suggesting volcanic and tectonic activity occurred including Argyre Mons, a 50 km wide volcanic-structure formed 3 Ga. Giant polygons with a similar surface age are also identified on terrain adjacent to the base of Argyre Mons, indicating the structure may have formed in a water-rich environment. In addition to Argyre Mons, cones, vents, mounds, dikes, and cavi or hollows, many of which are associated with extensional tectonics, are observed in the region. Multiple features appear to disrupt icy (and largely uncratered) terrain indicating a relatively young, Late Amazonian, formation age for at least some of the volcanic and tectonic features. The discovery of Argyre Mons, along with additional endogenic modification of the basin floor, suggests that the region has experienced episodes of volcanism over a protracted period of time. This has implications for habitability as the basin floor has been a region of elevated heat flow coupled with liquid water, water ice, and accumulation of sediments of diverse provenance with ranging geochemistry, along with magma-water interactions.

Photoionization of the radical with various UV lights and,electron sources produces the benzhydryl cation, which was identified by IR and UV-vis spectroscopy. In solid argon, the formation of the benzhydryl cation is irreversible, whereas in amorphous water-Ice the electron transfer is reversible, and irradiation into the major absorption band at 443 nm of the cation leads back to the radical by electron attachment. Applications of ionization of organic matter trapped in water-ice to icy environments in astrophysics and planetary sciences, including Earth, are discussed.

Two of the satellite-derived inventories are estimated by using the DECSO (Daily Emission derived Constrained by Satellite Observations) algorithm, which is based on an extended Kalman filter applied to observations from OMI or from GOME-2. The other two are derived with the EnKF algorithm, which is based on an ensemble Kalman filter applied to observations of multiple species using either the chemical transport model CHASER and MIROC-chem. The temporal behaviour and spatial distribution of the inventories are compared on a national and regional scale. A distinction is also made between urban and rural areas. The intercomparison of all inventories shows good agreement in total NOx emissions over mainland China, especially for trends, with an average bias of about 20% for yearly emissions. All the inventories show the typical emission reduction of 10% during the Chinese New Year and a peak in December. Satellite-derived approaches using OMI show a summer peak due to strong emissions from soil and biomass burning in this season. Biases in NOx emissions and uncertainties in temporal variability increase quickly when the spatial scale decreases. The analyses of the differences show the importance of using observations from multiple instruments and a high spatial resolution model for the satellite-derived inventories, while for bottom-up inventories, accurate emission factors and activity information are required. The advantage of the satellite-derived approach is that the emissions are soon available after observation, while the strength of the bottom-up inventories is that they include detailed information of emissions for each source category.

On production of gamma rays and relativistic runaway electron avalanches from Martian dust storms	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; dust storm; gamma ray; electrification; energetic radiation; relativistic runaway electron avalanche	DEVILS; DISCHARGES; BREAKDOWN	Production of runaway electron avalanches and gamma rays originating inside Martian dust storms are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. In the absence of in situ measurements, we use theoretical predictions of electric fields inside dust storms. Electrons are produced through the relativistic runaway electron avalanches process, and energetic photons are results of the bremsstrahlung scattering of the electrons with the air. Characteristic lengths of the runaway electron avalanche for different electric fields and the energy spectrum of electrons are derived and compared to their terrestrial counterparts. It is found that it is possible for Martian dust storms to develop energetic electron avalanches and produce large fluxes of gamma ray photons similar to terrestrial gamma ray flashes from Earth's thunderstorms. The phenomenon could be called Martian gamma ray flash, and due to the very thin atmosphere on Mars, it can be observed by both ground-based instruments or satellites orbiting the planet.

We have developed a signal detection technique, called the Targeted Projection Operator (TPO), to monitor surface deformation with Global Positioning System (GPS) data. We have applied the TPO to GPS data collected at Akutan Volcano from June 2005 to March 2017 and detected four inflation events that occurred in 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2016 with inflation rates of about 8-22mm/yr above the background trend at a near-source site AV13. Numerical modeling suggests that the events should be driven by closely located sources or a single source in a shallow magma chamber at a depth of about 4km. The inflation events suggest that magma has episodically accumulated in a shallow magma chamber.

We adjust the drag coefficient to match the observationally based Q(m). With the inclusion of Q(sg), the maximum melt rate (Q(m)(max)) is 2 times larger in summer and 1/3 larger annually than in winter. Q(m)(max) increases above linear with TF and below linear with Q(sg). We estimate that Q(m)(max) increased by 24% (+8.1m/yr) beneath PGIS from the 1990s to the 2000s from a 0.21 degrees C warming in ocean temperature and a doubling in Q(sg), hence contributing to its thinning. If the PGIS is removed, we estimate that the modeled melt rate near the grounding line will increase 13-16 times.

Hot flow anomaly observed at Jupiter's bow shock	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Hot flow anomaly; Jupiter; Bow shock; Juno	DIAMAGNETIC CAVITIES UPSTREAM; SOLAR-WIND; DAWN FLANK; MAGNETOSPHERE; MAGNETOPAUSE; SPACECRAFT	A Hot Flow Anomaly (HFA) is created when an interplanetary current sheet interacts with a planetary bow shock. Previous studies have reported observing HFAs at Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Saturn. During Juno's approach to Jupiter, a number of its instruments operated in the solar wind. Prior to crossing into Jupiter's magnetosphere, Juno observed an HFA at Jupiter for the first time. This Jovian HFA shares most of the characteristics of HFAs seen at other planets. The notable exception is that the Jovian HFA is significantly larger than any HFA seen before. With an apparent size greater than 2x10(6)km the Jovian HFA is orders of magnitude larger than those seen at the other planets. By comparing the size of the HFAs at the other planets with the Jovian HFA, we conclude that HFAs size scales with the size of planetary bow shocks that the interplanetary current sheet interacts with.

Heralded Single Photons Based on Spectral Multiplexing and Feed-Forward Control	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							EFFICIENT; DEMAND	We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to a heralded single-photon source based on spectral multiplexing (SMUX) and feed-forward-based spectral manipulation of photons created by means of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a periodically poled LiNbO3 crystal. As a proof of principle, we show that our three-mode SMUX increases the heralded single-photon rate compared to that of the individual modes without compromising the quality of the emitted single photons. We project that by adding further modes, our approach can lead to a deterministic single-photon source.	[Puigibert, M. Grimau; Aguilar, G.

To date, advanced line shapes, like the speed-dependent Voigt and Rautian profiles, have not been tested above room temperature with broadband spectrometers. We investigate pure water vapor spectra from 296 to 1305 K acquired with a dual-frequency comb spectrometer spanning from 6800 to 7200 cm(-1) at a point spacing of 0.0033 cm(-1) and absolute frequency accuracy of < 3.3 x 10(-6) cm(-1). Using a multispectral fitting analysis, we show that only the speed-dependent Voigt accurately models this temperature range with a single power-law temperature-scaling exponent for the broadening coefficients. Only the data from the analysis using this profile fall within theoretical predictions, suggesting that this mechanism captures the dominant narrowing physics for these high-temperature conditions.

Probe-based diagnostics and a laser induced fluorescence system are employed to measure the properties of both the turbulence and the background plasma parameters as they vary spatially in the cathode plume. It is shown that for the three discharge currents investigated, 100 A, 130 A, and 160 A, the spatial growth of the total energy density of the IAT in the near field of the cathode plume is exponential and agrees quantitatively with the predicted growth rates from the quasilinear formulation. However, in the downstream region of the cathode plume, the growth of IAT energy saturates at a level that is commensurate with the Sagdeev limit. The experimental validation of the quasilinear model for IAT growth and its limitations are discussed in the context of numerical efforts to describe self-consistently the plasma processes in the hollow cathode plume.

The phenomenal growth of the human footprint has significantly modified hydrological processes in various ways (e.g. irrigation, artificial dams, and water diversion) and at various scales (from a watershed to the globe). During the early 1990s, awareness of the potential for increased water scarcity led to the first detailed global water resource assessments. Shortly thereafter, in order to analyse the human perturbation on terrestrial water resources, the first generation of large-scale hydrological models (LHMs) was produced. However, at this early stage few models considered the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes and human activities, including water use and reservoir regulation, and even fewer models distinguished water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Since the early 2000s, a growing number of LHMs have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle, yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging. In this paper we provide a synthesis of progress in the development and application of human impact modelling in LHMs. We highlight a number of key challenges and discuss possible improvements in order to better represent the human-water interface in hydrological models.

Here we show that Bacillus subtilis can kill and prey on Bacillus megaterium. We find that Bacillus subtilis rapidly inhibits Bacillus megaterium growth by delivering the tRNase toxin WapA. Furthermore, utilizing the methionine analogue L-azidohomoalanine as a nutrient reporter, we provide evidence of nutrient extraction from Bacillus megaterium by Bacillus subtilis. Toxin delivery and nutrient extraction occur in a contact-dependent manner, and both activities are abolished in the absence of the phosphodiestrase YmdB, shown previously to mediate intercellular nanotube formation. Furthermore, we detect the localization of WapA molecules to nanotubes. Thus, we propose that Bacillus subtilis utilizes the same nanotube apparatus in a bidirectional manner, delivering toxin and acquiring beneficial cargo, thereby maximally exploiting potential niche resources.

Controlling resonance energy transfer in nanostructure emitters by positioning near a mirror	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS; UNIFIED THEORY; FLUORESCENCE; EXCITATION; LIGHT; MICROCAVITY; DONORS; RULER; FRET	The ability to control light-matter interactions in quantum objects opens up many avenues for new applications. We look at this issue within a fully quantized framework using a fundamental theory to describe mirror-assisted resonance energy transfer (RET) in nanostructures. The process of RET communicates electronic excitation between suitably disposed donor and acceptor particles in close proximity, activated by the initial excitation of the donor. Here, we demonstrate that the energy transfer rate can be significantly controlled by careful positioning of the RET emitters near a mirror. The results deliver equations that elicit new insights into the associated modification of virtual photon behavior, based on the quantum nature of light. In particular, our results indicate that energy transfer efficiency in nanostructures can be explicitly expedited or suppressed by a suitably positioned neighboring mirror, depending on the relative spacing and the dimensionality of the nanostructure. Interestingly, the resonance energy transfer between emitters is observed to "switch off" abruptly under suitable conditions of the RET system. This allows one to quantitatively control RET systems in a new way. Published by AIP Publishing.

Click chemistry stereolithography for soft robots that self-heal	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FABRICATION; POLYMER	Although soft robotics promises a new generation of robust, versatile machines capable of complex functions and seamless integration with biology, the fabrication of such soft, three dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures remains a significant challenge. Stereolithography (SLA) is an additive manufacturing technique that can rapidly fabricate the complex device architectures required for the next generation of these systems. Current SLA materials and processes are prohibitively expensive, display little elastic deformation at room temperature, or exhibit Young's moduli exceeding most natural tissues, all of which limit use in soft robotics. Herein, we report a low-cost build window substrate that enables the rapid fabrication of high resolution (similar to 50 mu m) silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) based elastomeric devices using an open source SLA printer. Our thiol-ene click chemistry permits photo-polymerization using low energy (H-e < 20 mJ cm(-2)) optical wavelengths (405 nm < lambda < 1 mm) available on many low-cost SLA machines. This chemistry is easily tuned to achieve storage moduli, 6 < E < 283 kPa at engineering strains, gamma = 0.02; similarly, a large range of ultimate strains, 0.5 < gamma(ult) < 4 is achievable through appropriate selection of the two primary chemical constituents (mercaptosiloxane, M.S., and vinylsiloxane, V.S.). Using this chemo-mechanical system, we directly fabricated compliant machines, including an antagonistic pair of fluidic elastomer actuators (a primary component in most soft robots). During printing, we retained unreacted pockets of M.S. and V.S. that permit autonomic self-healing, via sunlight, upon puncture of the elastomeric membranes of the soft actuators.	[Wallin, T.

Given its importance for testing planet formation and evolution theories, and for assessing the prospects for habitability among Earth-size exoplanets orbiting the most common type of star in the Galaxy, we present a comprehensive assessment of the age of this system. We collate empirical age constraints based on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, average density, lithium absorption, surface gravity features, metallicity, kinematics, rotation, and magnetic activity; and conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a transitional thin/thick disk star with an age of 7.6 +/- 2.2 Gyr. The star's color-magnitude position indicates that it is slightly metal-rich, which is consistent with the previously reported near-infrared spectroscopic metallicity; and it has a radius (R = 0.121 +/- 0.003R(circle dot)) that is larger by 8%-14% than the predictions of solar-metallicity evolutionary models. We discuss some implications of the old age of this system with regard to the stability and habitability of its planets.

The event has a fairly long timescale (similar to 63 days) and thus the light curve deviates significantly from the lensing model that is based on the rectilinear lens-source relative motion. This enables us to measure the microlensing parallax through the annual parallax effect. The microlensing parallax parameters constrained by the ground-based data are confirmed by the Spitzer observations through the satellite parallax method. By additionally measuring the angular Einstein radius from the analysis of the resolved caustic crossing, the physical parameters of the lens are determined. It is found that the binary lens is composed of two dwarf stars with masses M-1= 0.606 +/- 0.028M(circle dot) and M-2= 0.125 +/- 0.006 M-circle dot in the Galactic disk. Assuming that the source star is at the same distance as the bulge red clump stars, we find the lens is at a distance D-L = 2.44 +/- 0.10 kpc. We also provide a summary and short discussion of all of the published microlensing events in which the annual parallax effect is confirmed by other independent observations.

Our results provide a detailed bathymetric map of the fjord complex around the island of Skjoldungen in Skjoldungen Fjord and the outer part of Timmiarmiut Fjord and show far greater depths compared to the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean. The hydrography collected shows different properties in the fjords with the bottom water masses below 240m in Timmiarmiut Fjord being 1-2 degrees C warmer than in the two fjords around Skjoldungen, but data also illustrate the influence of sills on the exchange of deeper water masses within fjords. Moreover, evidence of subglacial discharge in Timmiarmiut Fjord, which is consistent with satellite observations of ice melange set into motion, adds to our increasing understanding of the distribution of subglacial meltwater.

Implications of the ammonia distribution on Jupiter from 1 to 100 bars as measured by the Juno microwave radiometer	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MEAN ZONAL FLOW; GIANT PLANETS; MOIST CONVECTION; GALILEO PROBE; DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION; CLOUD BANDS; ATMOSPHERE; CASSINI; MODEL; DYNAMICS	The latitude-altitude map of ammonia mixing ratio shows an ammonia-rich zone at 0-5 degrees N, with mixing ratios of 320-340 ppm, extending from 40-60 bars up to the ammonia cloud base at 0.7 bars. Ammonia-poor air occupies a belt from 5-20 degrees N. We argue that downdrafts as well as updrafts are needed in the 0-5 degrees N zone to balance the upward ammonia flux. Outside the 0-20 degrees N region, the belt-zone signature is weaker. At latitudes out to +/- 40 degrees, there is an ammonia-rich layer from cloud base down to 2 bars that we argue is caused by falling precipitation. Below, there is an ammonia-poor layer with a minimum at 6 bars. Unanswered questions include how the ammonia-poor layer is maintained, why the belt-zone structure is barely evident in the ammonia distribution outside 0-20 degrees N, and how the internal heat is transported through the ammonia-poor layer to the ammonia cloud base. Plain Language Summary Jupiter is a fluid planet. It has no solid continents to stabilize the weather. Scientists have wondered what the weather is like below the clouds because it might explain why storms last for decades or hundreds of years on Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft is the first chance we have had to take a look beneath the clouds, and this is the first analysis of the Juno data. The surprise is that, deep down, Jupiter's weather looks a lot like Earth's, with ammonia gas taking the place of water vapor. There is a band of high humidity at the equator and bands of low humidity on either side of the equator, like Earth's tropical and subtropical bands. What is different is that the bands go much deeper than anyone expected and this is all taking place on a planet without an ocean or a solid surface.

The pressure field at the top of these storms, which depends on the vertically integrated effect of the warm core and the near surface low, is found to violate the gradient wind balance-termed here as a state of nonbalance. Using a toy model, it is shown that slight changes in the relative location and relative widths of the warm core drastically increase the isobaric curvature at the upper level pressure maps leading to nonbalance. While idealized storms return to balance within several days, simulations of real-world tropical cyclones retain a considerable degree of nonbalance throughout the model integration. Comparing mean and maximum values of different storms shows that peak nonbalance correlates with either peak intensity or intensification, implying the possible importance of nonbalance at upper levels for the near surface winds. Plain Language Summary The assumption of a simple force balance (gradient wind balance) has served in idealized models for tropical cyclones in the past century. This assumption decouples the dynamics of the tropical cyclone's upper levels (15 km) from its surface winds. By examining the upper level of tropical cyclones in state of the art computer model, is it shown here that in certain scenarios the gradient wind balance has no physical validity at the top of tropical cyclones. This study motivates detailed upper level observations as well as new idealized theories.

The OCO-2 oxygen A-band response to liquid marine cloud properties from CALIPSO and MODIS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						cloud retrieval; oxygen A-band; clouds; OCO-2; MODIS; CALIPSO	GASES OBSERVING SATELLITE; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; LIDAR MEASUREMENTS; EFFECTIVE RADIUS; TOP HEIGHT; PRESSURE; SCATTERING; RADIATION	Spectra of reflected sunlight in the oxygen A-band contain information about cloud properties such as cloud top pressure, optical depth, and pressure thickness. Here we show, for the first time, that high-spectral-resolution A-band Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) spectra respond largely as simulated to the optical properties of water clouds over ocean during November 2015 (N=184,318) using input cloud properties from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). In A-band continuum channels the standard deviation of simulated minus observed radiance is 37%. Selecting horizontally homogeneous clouds to mitigate three-dimensional cloud effects and collocation error with the other satellites, the standard deviation of the residuals is reduced to 18%. Using a look-up table developed from simulations, OCO-2's estimated cloud top pressure for low clouds (P-top>680hPa) has a standard deviation of 61hPa relative to CALIPSO retrievals, and bias is dependent on assumed cloud pressure thickness, with our smallest value being -5hPa. Versus MODIS optical depth, the standard deviation is 9.0 and the bias is -2.0, although these shrink for clouds of styled-content style-type=mathematics 30. These values include collocation error between the different satellites, meaning that they place an upper bound on the OCO-2 retrieval uncertainty. The theoretical precision limit from OCO-2's instrumental uncertainty is shown to be +/- 2.4hPa in above-cloud path and +/- 0.2% in optical depth for a two-channel retrieval. Options for retrieving cloud optical depth, cloud top pressure, and pressure thickness are discussed in the context of a formal OCO-2 cloud property retrieval.

Snowmelt onset hinders bromine monoxide heterogeneous recycling in the Arctic	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						reactive halogens; snow; sea ice; snowmelt; bromine monoxide	OPTICAL-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; SYNTHETIC-APERTURE-RADAR; TROPOSPHERIC BRO COLUMNS; LAYER OZONE DEPLETION; BOUNDARY-LAYER; SURFACE OZONE; MAX-DOAS; ICE; AIR; CHEMISTRY	Reactive bromine radicals (bromine atoms, Br, and bromine monoxide, BrO) deplete ozone and alter tropospheric oxidation chemistry during the Arctic springtime (February-June). As spring transitions to summer (May-June) and snow begins to melt, reactive bromine events cease and BrO becomes low in summer. In this study, we explore the relationship between the end of the reactive bromine season and snowmelt timing. BrO was measured by Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer at Utqiagvik (Barrow), AK, from 2012 to 2016 and on drifting buoys deployed in Arctic sea ice from 2011 to 2016, a total of 13 site and year combinations. The BrO seasonal end date (SED) was objectively determined and was compared to surface-air-temperature-derived melt onset date (MOD). The SED was highly correlated with the MOD (N=13, R-2=0.983, RMS=1.9days), and BrO is only observed at subfreezing temperatures. In subsets of these sites and years where ancillary data were available, we observed that snowpack depth reduced and rain precipitation occurred within a few days of the SED. These data are consistent with snowpack melting hindering BrO recycling, which is necessary to maintain enhanced BrO concentrations. With a projected warmer Arctic, a shift to earlier snowmelt seasons could alter the timing and role of halogen chemical reactions in the Arctic with impacts on ozone depletion and mercury deposition. Plain Language Summary Reactive bromine events in the Arctic are common in spring and deplete ozone and cause mercury deposition. These events are affected by snow and ice, which are changing in the Arctic; therefore, we need to understand how environmental conditions affect reactive bromine chemistry. We find that the reactive bromine season ends when snowpack begins to melt. Through these full seasonal observations, we find that reactive bromine events occur to warmer temperatures than previously reported, with 0 degrees C being the observed threshold above which reactive bromine is absent. We also find that snow appears necessary for reactive bromine chemistry and rain stops this chemistry. Earlier snowmelt in a warmer Arctic would end the reactive bromine season earlier, decreasing late springtime ozone depletion and mercury deposition.

Juno observations of large-scale compressions of Jupiter's dawnside magnetopause	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							INTERACTION OFMAGNETIC RECONNECTION; KELVIN-HELMHOLTZ VORTICES; BOW SHOCK; MAGNETIC RECONNECTION; JOVIAN MAGNETOPAUSE; SOLAR-WIND; MAGNETOMETER OBSERVATIONS; MAGNETOSPHERE; MAGNETOTAIL; MODES	We investigate the structure of Jupiter's dawnside magnetopause using observations obtained by particle and fields instrumentation on the Juno spacecraft. Characterization of Jupiter's magnetopause is critical for the understanding of mass and energy transport between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. We find an extended magnetopause boundary layer (MPBL) during a magnetopause crossing on 14 July 2016. This thick MPBL, in combination with a large magnetic field component normal to the magnetopause boundary, suggests that strong magnetospheric compression enhances mass transport across the magnetopause via magnetic reconnection. We further identify similar to 2 h increases in the total magnetospheric pressure adjacent to the magnetopause on 14 July 2016 and 1 August 2016. These large-scale structures provide evidence of focused energy transport into the magnetosphere via magnetohydrodynamic structures.

Although the HSS did not lead to any significant geomagnetic storm activity, the ionosphere over Arecibo became hotter and expanded significantly in altitude as compared to a non-HSS interval. The O+/H+ transition height hT increased by similar to 200 km in the daytime and by similar to 100 km at night. At the hT, the peak ionospheric electron and ion temperatures increased by similar to 200-500 K during day and by similar to 50-70 K at night. While the O+ ion concentration exhibited an overall enhancement, deep penetration of the H+ ions below h(T) are observed during the day. The noontime peak electron density was similar to 4 times higher during the HSS event compared to the non-HSS interval. We present three possible mechanisms to explain this topside ionospheric heating.

Response of Jupiter's auroras to conditions in the interplanetary medium as measured by the Hubble Space Telescope and Juno	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SOLAR-WIND; HISAKI SATELLITE; JANUARY 2014; X-RAY; MAGNETOSPHERE; MAGNETOPAUSE; MODELS; INNER	We present the first comparison of Jupiter's auroral morphology with an extended, continuous, and complete set of near-Jupiter interplanetary data, revealing the response of Jupiter's auroras to the interplanetary conditions. We show that for similar to 1 - 3 days following compression region onset, the planet's main emission brightened. A duskside poleward region also brightened during compressions, as well as during shallow rarefaction conditions at the start of the program. The power emitted from the noon active region did not exhibit dependence on any interplanetary parameter, though the morphology typically differed between rarefactions and compressions. The auroras equatorward of the main emission brightened over similar to 10 days following an interval of increased volcanic activity on Io. These results show that the dependence of Jupiter's magnetosphere and auroras on the interplanetary conditions are more diverse than previously thought. Plain Language Summary Jupiter's auroras (northern lights) are the brightest in the solar system, over a hundred times brighter than the Earth's. Auroras on Earth are driven by the solar wind, a million mile-per-hour stream of charged particles flowing away from the Sun, hitting the Earth's magnetic field, and stirring it around, but it is not known whether the solar wind causes any significant auroras on Jupiter. The main reason for this uncertainty is a lack of observations of the planet's auroras obtained while spacecraft have been near Jupiter and able to supply a full and continuous set of measurements of the solar wind and its accompanying magnetic field. In early mid-2016 Juno approached Jupiter, providing such an interplanetary data set, and we obtained over a month's worth of observations of Jupiter's auroras using the Hubble Space Telescope. We saw several solar wind storms, each causing auroral fireworks on Jupiter. We captured the most powerful auroras observed by Hubble to date, brightened main oval emissions, and flashing high-latitude patches of auroras during the solar wind storms. These results indicate that Jupiter's auroral response to the solar wind is more diverse than we previously have thought.	[Nichols, J. D.; Bunce, E. J.; Cowley, S. W. H.; Stallard, T.

Juno-UVS approach observations of Jupiter's auroras	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							JOVIAN AURORA; SOLAR-WIND; MAGNETOSPHERE; VARIABILITY; EMISSIONS; ENERGY	Juno ultraviolet spectrograph (UVS) observations of Jupiter's aurora obtained during approach are presented. Prior to the bow shock crossing on 24 June 2016, the Juno approach provided a rare opportunity to correlate local solar wind conditions with Jovian auroral emissions. Some of Jupiter's auroral emissions are expected to be controlled or modified by local solar wind conditions. Here we compare synoptic Juno-UVS observations of Jupiter's auroral emissions, acquired during 3-29 June 2016, with in situ solar wind observations, and related Jupiter observations from Earth. Four large auroral brightening events are evident in the synoptic data, in which the total emitted auroral power increases by a factor of 3-4 for a few hours. Only one of these brightening events correlates well with large transient increases in solar wind ram pressure. The brightening events which are not associated with the solar wind generally have a risetime of similar to 2 h and a decay time of similar to 5 h. Plain Language Summary Juno ultraviolet spectrograph (UVS) observations of Jupiter's aurora obtained during approach are presented. Jupiter's auroras are thought to be controlled in part by the solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outward from the Sun. The Juno approach was a rare opportunity to compare solar wind conditions near Jupiter with the Jovian ultraviolet aurora, using observations made during June 2016. Although Jupiter's aurora is always present, four brightening events were seen in the data, in which the total auroral power increased to several times the typical level for a few hours. Only one of these brightening events appears well connected with solar wind activity. The brightening events which are not associated with the solar wind all increase in brightness in about 2 h and then dim back down again in about another 5 h.	[Gladstone, G. R.; Versteeg, M.

Process-based algorithms have been widely used to estimate global terrestrial ET, yet each ET individual algorithm has exhibited large uncertainties. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method was introduced to improve global terrestrial ET estimation by integrating three process-based ET algorithms: MOD16, PT-JPL and SEMI-PM. At 200 FLUXNET flux tower sites, we evaluated the performance of the SVM method and others, including the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method and the general regression neural networks (GRNNs) method together with three process-based ET algorithms. We found that the SVM method was superior to all other methods we evaluated. The validation results showed that compared with the individual algorithms, the SVM method driven by tower-specific (Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA) meteorological data reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) by approximately 0.20 (0.15) mm/day for most forest sites and 0.30 (0.20) mm/day for most crop and grass sites and improved the squared correlation coefficient (R-2) by approximately 0.10 (0.08) (95% confidence) for most flux tower sites. The water balance of basins and the global terrestrial ET calculation analysis also demonstrated that the regional and global estimates of the SVM-merged ET were reliable. The SVM method provides a powerful tool for improving global ET estimation to characterize the long-term spatiotemporal variations of the global terrestrial water budget.

Magnetically Induced Disk Winds and Transport in the HL Tau Disk	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; magnetic fields; magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); protoplanetary disks; stars:individual (HL Tauri); turbulence	3-DIMENSIONAL MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATIONS; BASE-LINE CAMPAIGN; MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY; PROTOPLANETARY DISCS; LAYERED ACCRETION; GRAIN ALIGNMENT; EVOLUTION; EMISSION; FIELD; MASS	The mechanism of angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding the distributions of gas and dust in the disks. The unprecedented ALMA observations taken toward HL Tau at high spatial resolution and subsequent radiative transfer modeling reveal that a high degree of dust settling is currently achieved in the outer part of the HL Tau disk. Previous observations, however, suggest a high disk accretion rate onto the central star. This configuration is not necessarily intuitive in the framework of the conventional viscous disk model, since efficient accretion generally requires a high level of turbulence, which can suppress dust settling considerably. We develop a simplified, semi-analytical disk model to examine under what condition these two properties can be realized in a single model. Recent, non-ideal MHD simulations are utilized to realistically model the angular momentum transport both radially via MHD turbulence and vertically via magnetically induced disk winds. We find that the HL Tau disk configuration can be reproduced well when disk winds are properly taken into account. While the resulting disk properties are likely consistent with other observational results, such an ideal situation can be established only if the plasma beta at the disk midplane is beta(0) similar or equal to 2. x 10(4) under the assumption of steady accretion. Equivalently, the vertical magnetic flux at 100 au is about 0.2 mG. More detailed modeling is needed to fully identify the origin of the disk accretion and quantitatively examine plausible mechanisms behind the observed gap structures in the HL Tau disk.

Although twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous(5-7), across many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in the twenty-first century(3,7-9). Recovery time-how long an ecosystem requires to revert to its pre-drought functional state-is a critical metric of drought impact. Yet the factors influencing drought recovery and its spatiotemporal patterns at the global scale are largely unknown. Here we analyse three independent datasets of gross primary productivity and show that, across diverse ecosystems, drought recovery times are strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics, with biodiversity and CO2 fertilization as secondary factors. Our analysis also provides two key insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of drought recovery time: first, that recovery is longest in the tropics and high northern latitudes (both vulnerable areas of Earth's climate system(10)) and second, that drought impacts(11) (assessed using the area of ecosystems actively recovering and time to recovery) have increased over the twentieth century. If droughts become more frequent, as expected, the time between droughts may become shorter than drought recovery time, leading to permanently damaged ecosystems and widespread degradation of the land carbon sink.

P.; Nam, Sae Woo			Fano fluctuations in superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							TRANSITION-EDGE SENSORS; TUNNEL-JUNCTIONS; QUASI-PARTICLE; EFFICIENCY; STRIPS	Because of their universal nature, Fano fluctuations are expected to influence the response of superconductingnanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). We predict that photon counting rate (PCR) as a function of bias current (I-B) in SNSPDs is described by an integral over a transverse coordinate-dependent complementary error function. Fano fluctuations in the amount of energy deposited into the electronic system contribute to the finite width of this error function Delta IB. The local response of an SNSPD can also affect this width: the location of the initial photon absorption site across the width of the wire can impact the probability of vortex-antivortex unbinding and vortex entry from the edges. In narrow-nanowire SNSPDs, the local responses are uniform, and Fano fluctuations dominate Delta IB. We demonstrate good agreement between theory and experiments for a series of bath temperatures and photon energies in narrow-wire WSi SNSPDs. In a wide-nanowire device, the strong local dependence will introduce a finite width to the PCR curve, but with sharp cusps. We show how Fano fluctuations can smooth these features to produce theoretical curves that bettermatch experimental data. We also show that the time-resolved hotspot relaxation curves predicted by Fano fluctuations match the previously measured Lorentzian shapes (except for their tails) over the entire range of bias currents investigated experimentally.

Here, we use multiple independent satellite datasets to show that rainforest transpiration enables an increase of shallow convection that moistens and destabilizes the atmosphere during the initial stages of the dry-to-wet season transition. This shallow convection moisture pump (SCMP) preconditions the atmosphere at the regional scale for a rapid increase in rain-bearing deep convection, which in turn drives moisture convergence and wet season onset 2-3 mo before the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Aerosols produced by late dry season biomass burning may alter the efficiency of the SCMP. Our results highlight the mechanisms by which interactions among land surface processes, atmospheric convection, and biomass burning may alter the timing of wet season onset and provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how deforestation extends the dry season and enhances regional vulnerability to drought.

Groundwater rejuvenation in parts of India influenced by water-policy change implementation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DEPLETION	and also the largest groundwater user, has been of great concern in recent years. However, in contrary to the well documented Indian groundwater depletion due to rapid and unmanaged groundwater withdrawal, here for the first time, we report regional-scale groundwater storage (GWS) replenishment through long-term (1996-2014, using more than 19000 observation locations) in situ and decadal (2003-2014) satellite-based groundwater storage measurements in western and southern parts of India. In parts of western and southern India, in situ GWS (GWS(obs)) has been decreasing at the rate of -5.81 +/- 0.38 km(3)/year (in 1996-2001) and -0.92 +/- 0.12 km(3)/year (in 1996-2002), and reversed to replenish at the rate of 2.04 +/- 0.20 km(3)/year (in 2002-2014) and 0.76 +/- 0.08 km(3)/year (in 2003-2014), respectively. Here, using statistical analyses and simulation results of groundwater management policy change effect on groundwater storage in western and southern India, we show that paradigm shift in Indian groundwater withdrawal and management policies for sustainable water utilization appear to have started replenishing the aquifers in western and southern parts of India.

Seasonal and spatial changes in trace gases over megacities from Aura TES observations: two case studies	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; MEXICO-CITY EMISSIONS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; AIR-QUALITY; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS; PARTICULATE MATTER; METHANOL; AMMONIA; OZONE	The Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) is collecting closely spaced observations over 19 megacities. The objective is to obtain measurements that will lead to better understanding of the processes affecting air quality in and around these cities, and to better estimates of the seasonal and interannual variability. We explore the TES measurements of ozone, ammonia, methanol and formic acid collected around the Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) and in the vicinity of Lagos (Nigeria). The TES data exhibit seasonal signals that are correlated with Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) CO and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD), with in situ measurements in the MCMA and with Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem model output in the Lagos area. TES was able to detect an extreme pollution event in the MCMA on 9 April 2013, which is also evident in the in situ data. TES data also show that biomass burning has a greater impact south of the city than in the caldera where Mexico City is located. TES measured enhanced values of the four species over the Gulf of Guinea south of Lagos. Since it observes many cities from the same platform with the same instrument and applies the same retrieval algorithms, TES data provide a very useful tool for easily comparing air quality measures of two or more cities. We compare the data from the MCMA and Lagos, and show that, while the MCMA has occasional extreme pollution events, Lagos consistently has higher levels of these trace gases.

We describe an approach that leverages coincident NASA A-train and the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data to quantify the relationships in the subtropical MBL derived at the native pixel and grid resolution. A new method for observing four subtropical oceanic regions that capture transitions from stratocumulus to trade cumulus is demonstrated, where stratocumulus and cumulus regimes are determined from infrared-based thermodynamic phase. Visible radiances are normally distributed within stratocumulus and are increasingly skewed away from the coast, where trade cumulus dominates. Increases in MBL depth, wind speed, and effective radius (r(e)), and reductions in 700-1000 hPa moist static energy differences and 700 and 850 hPa vertical velocity correspond with increases in visible radiance skewness. We posit that a more robust representation of the cloudy MBL is obtained using visible radiance rather than retrievals of optical thickness that are limited to a smaller subset of cumulus. The method using the combined A-train and MERRA data set has demonstrated that an increase in r(e) within shallow cumulus is strongly related to higher MBL wind speeds that further correspond to increased precipitation occurrence according to CloudSat, previously demonstrated with surface observations. Hence, the combined data sets have the potential of adding global context to process-level understanding of the MBL.

J	Millan, LF; Manney, GL				Millan, Luis F.; Manney, Gloria L.			An assessment of ozone mini-hole representation in reanalyses over the Northern Hemisphere	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC POLAR VORTEX; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; PHOTOCHEMISTRY PARAMETERIZATION; MONITORING INSTRUMENT; WAVE BREAKING; TRANSPORT; LIMB; CLIMATOLOGY; LATITUDES	An ozone mini-hole is a synoptic-scale region with strongly decreased total column ozone resulting from dynamical processes. Using total column measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and ozone profile measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder, we evaluate the accuracy of mini-hole representation in five reanalyses. This study provides a metric of the reanalyses' ability to capture dynamically driven ozone variability. The reanalyses and the measurements show similar seasonal variability and geographical distributions of mini-holes; however, all of the reanalyses underestimate the number of mini-holes and their area, and in many reanalyses their location displays an eastward bias. The reanalyses' underestimation of mini-hole number ranges from about 34 to about 83 %. The mini-hole vertical representation in the reanalyses agrees well with that in the MLS measurements and, furthermore, is consistent with previously reported mechanisms for mini-hole formation. The skill of the reanalyses is not closely tied to the ozone fields assimilated, suggesting that the dynamics of the reanalysis models are more important than the assimilated ozone fields to reproducing ozone mini-holes.

Horizontal and vertical structure of reactive bromine events probed by bromine monoxide MAX-DOAS	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							OZONE DEPLETION EVENTS; ARCTIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; TROPOSPHERIC BRO COLUMNS; SEA-SALT AEROSOL; FROST FLOWERS; HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; MODELING CHEMISTRY; HALOGEN ACTIVATION; MOLECULAR BROMINE	Heterogeneous photochemistry converts bromide (Br) to reactive bromine species (Br atoms and bromine monoxide, BrO) that dominate Arctic springtime chemistry. This phenomenon has many impacts such as boundary-layer ozone depletion, mercury oxidation and deposition, and modification of the fate of hydrocarbon species. To study environmental controls on reactive bromine events, the BRomine, Ozone, and Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) was carried out from early March to mid-April 2012 near Barrow (Utqiagvik), Alaska. We measured horizontal and vertical gradients in BrO with multiple-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instrumentation at three sites, two mobile and one fixed. During the campaign, a large crack in the sea ice (an open lead) formed pushing one instrument package similar to 250 km downwind from Barrow (Utqiagvik). Convection associated with the open lead converted the BrO vertical structure from a surface-based event to a lofted event downwind of the lead influence. The column abundance of BrO downwind of the refreezing lead was comparable to upwind amounts, indicating direct reactions on frost flowers or open seawater was not a major reactive bromine source. When these three sites were separated by similar to 30 km length scales of unbroken sea ice, the BrO amount and vertical distributions were highly correlated for most of the time, indicating the horizontal length scales of BrO events were typically larger than similar to 30 km in the absence of sea ice features. Although BrO amount and vertical distribution were similar between sites most of the time, rapid changes in BrO with edges significantly smaller than this similar to 30 km length scale episodically transported between the sites, indicating BrO events were large but with sharp edge contrasts. BrO was often found in shallow layers that recycled reactive bromine via heterogeneous reactions on snowpack. Episodically, these surface-based events propagated aloft when aerosol extinction was higher (> 0.1 km(-1)) however, the presence of aerosol particles aloft was not sufficient to produce BrO aloft. Highly depleted ozone (< 1 nmol mol(-1) ) repartitioned reactive bromine away from BrO and drove BrO events aloft in cases. This work demonstrates the interplay between atmospheric mixing and heterogeneous chemistry that affects the vertical structure and horizontal extent of reactive bromine events.

If upper layers are cooler than lower layers, molecular gases will produce absorption features in the planetary thermal spectrum(4,5). Conversely, if there is a stratosphere-where temperature increases with altitude-these molecular features will be observed in emission(6-8). It has been suggested that stratospheres could form in highly irradiated exoplanets(9,10), but the extent to which this occurs is unresolved both theoretically(11,12) and observationally(3,13-15). A previous claim for the presence of a stratosphere(14) remains open to question, owing to the challenges posed by the highly variable host star and the low spectral resolution of the measurements(3). Here we report a near-infrared thermal spectrum for the ultrahot gas giant WASP-121b, which has an equilibrium temperature of approximately 2,500 kelvin. Water is resolved in emission, providing a detection of an exoplanet stratosphere at 5 sigma confidence. These observations imply that a substantial fraction of incident stellar radiation is retained at high altitudes in the atmosphere, possibly by absorbing chemical species such as gaseous vanadium oxide and titanium oxide.

However, the exact pathways and role of topography in Southern Ocean upwelling remain largely unknown. Here we show detailed upwelling pathways in three dimensions, using hydrographic observations and particle tracking in high-resolution models. The analysis reveals that the northern-sourced deep waters enter the Antarctic Circumpolar Current via southward flow along the boundaries of the three ocean basins, before spiraling southeastward and upward through the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Upwelling is greatly enhanced at five major topographic features, associated with vigorous mesoscale eddy activity. Deep water reaches the upper ocean predominantly south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with a spatially nonuniform distribution. The timescale for half of the deep water to upwell from 30 degrees S to the mixed layer is similar to 60-90 years.

Interplanetary coronal mass ejection observed at STEREO-A, Mars, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Saturn, and New Horizons en route to Pluto: Comparison of its Forbush decreases at 1.4, 3.1, and 9.9 AU	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						interplanetary coronal mass ejection; Forbush decrease; Mars; comet 67P; Saturn; New Horizons	SOLAR-WIND; INTERACTION REGIONS; MAGNETIC CLOUDS; 3-DIMENSIONAL PROPAGATION; VOYAGER-2 OBSERVATIONS; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; INSTRUMENT; PLASMA; RADIATION; MISSION	We discuss observations of the journey throughout the Solar System of a large interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) that was ejected at the Sun on 14 October 2014. The ICME hit Mars on 17 October, as observed by the Mars Express, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN), Mars Odyssey, and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) missions, 44h before the encounter of the planet with the Siding-Spring comet, for which the space weather context is provided. It reached comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which was perfectly aligned with the Sun and Mars at 3.1 AU, as observed by Rosetta on 22 October. The ICME was also detected by STEREO-A on 16 October at 1 AU, and by Cassini in the solar wind around Saturn on the 12 November at 9.9AU. Fortuitously, the New Horizons spacecraft was also aligned with the direction of the ICME at 31.6 AU. We investigate whether this ICME has a nonambiguous signature at New Horizons. A potential detection of this ICME by Voyager 2 at 110-111 AU is also discussed. The multispacecraft observations allow the derivation of certain properties of the ICME, such as its large angular extension of at least 116 degrees, its speed as a function of distance, and its magnetic field structure at four locations from 1 to 10 AU. Observations of the speed data allow two different solar wind propagation models to be validated. Finally, we compare the Forbush decreases (transient decreases followed by gradual recoveries in the galactic cosmic ray intensity) due to the passage of this ICME at Mars, comet 67P, and Saturn.

Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas simulation with optimized ocean, sea ice, and thermodynamic ice shelf model parameters	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Amundsen Sea; Bellingshausen Sea; winter water; thermocline; glacial melt water; Pine Island Glacier	CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; PINE ISLAND GLACIER; WEST ANTARCTIC PENINSULA; BASAL MELT RATES; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; CIRCULATION; MELTWATER; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; TRANSPORT	Recent studies suggest that the thickness of Winter Water (WW), that is, water with potential temperature below approximate to-1 degrees C located below Antarctic Surface Water and above Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) is critical in determining the ice shelf melt rate, especially for the Pine Island Glacier (PIG). Existing model studies, however, misrepresent WW thickness and properties in the Amundsen Sea (AS). Here, we adjust a small number of model parameters in a regional Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model in order to reproduce properties and thickness of WW and CDW close to observations, with significant improvement for WW compared to previous studies. The cost, which is defined as weighted model-data difference squared, is reduced by 23%. Although a previous modeling study points out that the local surface heat loss upstream from Pine Island Polynya could be the reason for the observed 2012 PIG melt decline and WW thickening, they did not show WW freshening, which was observed at the same time. Model sensitivity experiments for surface heat loss, PIG melt rate, and precipitation fail to replicate WW freshening concurrent with PIG melt decline, implying that these processes cannot fully explain the observed PIG melt decrease.

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mast cameras and Descent imager: Investigation and instrument descriptions	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; MISSION	The Mars Science Laboratory Mast camera and Descent Imager investigations were designed, built, and operated by Malin Space Science Systems of San Diego, CA. They share common electronics and focal plane designs but have different optics. There are two Mastcams of dissimilar focal length. The Mastcam-34 has an f/8, 34 mm focal length lens, and the M-100 an f/10, 100 mm focal length lens. The M-34 field of view is about 20 degrees x 15 degrees with an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 218 mu rad; the M-100 field of view (FOV) is 6.8 degrees x 5.1 degrees with an IFOV of 74 mu rad. The M-34 can focus from 0.5 m to infinity, and the M- 100 from similar to 1.6 m to infinity. All three cameras can acquire color images through a Bayer color filter array, and the Mastcams can also acquire images through seven science filters. Images are <= 1600 pixels wide by 1200 pixels tall. The Mastcams, mounted on the similar to 2 m tall Remote Sensing Mast, have a 360 degrees azimuth and similar to 180 degrees elevation field of regard. Mars Descent Imager is fixed-mounted to the bottom left front side of the rover at similar to 66 cm above the surface. Its fixed focus lens is in focus from similar to 2 m to infinity, but out of focus at 66 cm. The f/3 lens has a FOV of similar to 70 degrees by 52 degrees across and along the direction of motion, with an IFOV of 0.76 mrad. All cameras can acquire video at 4 frames/second for full frames or 720p HD at 6 fps. Images can be processed using lossy Joint Photographic Experts Group and predictive lossless compression. Plain Language Summary Paper describes the Mast cameras and Descent Imager on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. Cameras take 2 megapixel color images that can be compressed in both JPEG lossy and predictive lossless format. One of the two Mastcams has a 34 mm lens, equivalent to a consumer camera 35 mm lens, and the other has a 100 mm lens, similar to consumer camera telephoto lens. The descent imager has a very wide angle lens (similar to 90 degrees)and takes wide angle pictures. The Mast cameras are mounted on an azimuth elevation mast so they can scan around the rover and into the sky. The Descent camera always points down. The Mast cameras have different filters to allow for scientific color imaging as well as standard color imaging as performed by consumer cameras.

We use the FMRS to simulate radiances for the TWICE's 14 millimeter- and submillimeter- wavelength channels for a tropical atmospheric state produced by a Weather Research and Forecasting model simulation. We also perform simultaneous retrievals of cloud ice particle size, ice water content (IWC), water vapor content (H2O), and temperature from the simulated TWICE radiances using the FMRS. We show that the TWICE instrument is capable of retrieving ice particle size in the range of similar to 50-1000 mu m in mass mean effective diameter with approximately 50% uncertainty. The uncertainties of other retrievals from TWICE are about 1 K for temperature, 50% for IWC, and 20% for H2O.

Zinc and germanium in the sedimentary rocks of Gale Crater on Mars indicate hydrothermal enrichment followed by diagenetic fractionation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Zn enrichment on Mars; Ge enrichment on Mars; MSL APXS results; fluid-mobile elements on Mars; Mars sedimentary geochemistry	X-RAY SPECTROMETER; NORTHWEST AFRICA 7034; SULFIDE MINERALIZATION; FLUORIDE COMPLEXES; MARTIAN REGOLITH; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; CURIOSITY ROVER; GE SINK; GEOCHEMISTRY; CHEMISTRY	Zinc and germanium enrichments have been discovered in sedimentary rocks in Gale Crater, Mars, by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer on the rover Curiosity. Concentrations of Zn (910840ppm) and Ge (6558ppm) are tens to hundreds of times greater than in Martian meteorites and estimates for average silicate Mars. Enrichments occur in diverse rocks including minimally to extensively altered basaltic and alkalic sedimentary rocks. The magnitude of the enrichments indicates hydrothermal fluids, but Curiosity has not discovered unambiguous hydrothermal mineral assemblages. We propose that Zn- and Ge-rich hydrothermal deposits in the source region were dispersed in siliciclastic sediments during transport into the crater. Subsequent diagenetic mobilization and fractionation of Zn and Ge is evident in a Zn-rich sandstone (Windjana; Zn similar to 4000ppm, Ge similar to 85ppm) and associated Cl-rich vein (Stephen; Zn similar to 8000ppm, Ge similar to 60ppm), in Ge-rich veins (Garden City; Zn similar to 2200ppm, Ge similar to 650ppm), and in silica-rich alteration haloes leached of Zn (30-200ppm). In moderately to highly altered silica-rich rocks, Ge remained immobile relative to leached elements (Fe, Mn, Mg, and Ca), consistent with fluid interaction at pH << 7. In contrast, crosscutting Ge-rich veins at Garden City suggest aqueous mobilization as Ge-F complexes at pH<2.5. Multiple jarosite detections by the CheMin X-ray diffractometer and variable Zn concentrations indicate diagenesis of lower Mount Sharp bedrock under acidic conditions. The enrichment and fractionation of Zn and Ge constrains fluid events affecting Gale sediments and can aid in unraveling fluid histories as Curiosity's traverse continues.

J	Baer, J; Chesley, SR				Baer, James; Chesley, Steven R.			Simultaneous Mass Determination for Gravitationally Coupled Asteroids	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrometry; celestial mechanics; ephemerides	1 CERES	The conventional least-squares asteroid mass determination algorithm allows us to solve for the mass of a large subject asteroid that is perturbing the trajectory of a smaller test asteroid. However, this algorithm is necessarily a first approximation, ignoring the possibility that the subject asteroid may itself be perturbed by the test asteroid, or that the encounter's precise geometry may be entangled with encounters involving other asteroids. After reviewing the conventional algorithm, we use it to calculate the masses of 30 main-belt asteroids. Compared to our previous results, we find new mass estimates for eight asteroids (11 Parthenope, 27 Euterpe, 51 Neimausa, 76 Freia, 121 Hermione, 324 Bamberga, 476 Hedwig, and 532 Herculina) and significantly more precise estimates for six others (2 Pallas, 3 Juno, 4 Vesta, 9 Metis, 16 Psyche, and 88 Thisbe). However, we also find that the conventional algorithm yields questionable results in several gravitationally coupled cases. To address such cases, we describe a new algorithm that allows the epoch state vectors of the subject asteroids to be included as solve-for parameters, allowing for the simultaneous solution of the masses and epoch state vectors of multiple subject and test asteroids. We then apply this algorithm to the same 30 main-belt asteroids and conclude that mass determinations resulting from current and future high-precision astrometric sources (such as Gaia) should conduct a thorough search for possible gravitational couplings and account for their effects.

The complexity of Orion: an ALMA view II. gGg '-ethylene glycol and acetic acid	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; ISM: molecules; radio lines: ISM	STAR-FORMING REGIONS; HOT MOLECULAR CORES; WAVE SPECTRUM; MILLIMETER; KL; CHEMISTRY	We report the first detection and high angular resolution (1.8 '' x 1.1 '') imaging of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and gGg'-ethylene glycol (gGg'(CH2OH)(2)) toward the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion-KL) nebula. The observations were carried out at similar to 1.3 mm with ALMA during Cycle 2. A notable result is that the spatial distribution of the acetic acid and ethylene glycol emission di ff ers from that of the other O-bearing molecules within Orion-KL. While the typical emission of O-bearing species harbors a morphology associated with a V-shape linking the hot core region to the compact ridge (with an extension toward the BN object), the emission of acetic acid and ethylene glycol mainly peaks at about 2 '' southwest from the hot core region (near sources I and n). We find that the measured CH3COOH:aGg' (CH2OH)(2) and CH3COOH:gGg' (CH2OH)(2) ratios di ff er from those measured toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 by more than one order of magnitude. Our best hypothesis to explain these findings is that CH3COOH, aGg' (CH2OH)(2), and gGg' (CH2OH)(2) are formed on the icy surface of grains and are then released into the gas-phase via co-desorption with water, by way of a bullet of matter ejected during the explosive event that occurred in the heart of the nebula about 500 - 700 yr ago.

We wish to improve our understanding of the Orion central star formation region (Orion-KL) and disentangle its complexity. Aims. We collected data with ALMA during cycle 2 in 16 GHz of total bandwidth spread between 215.1 and 252.0 GHz with a typical sensitivity of 5 mJy/beam (2.3 mJy /beam from 233.4 to 234.4 GHz) and a typical beam size of 1".7 x 1".0 (average position angle of 89 degrees). We produced a continuum map and studied the emission lines in nine remarkable infrared spots in the region including the hot core and the compact ridge, plus the recently discovered ethylene glycol peak. Methods. We present the data, and report the detection of several species not previously seen in Orion, including n-and i-propyl cyanide (C3H7CN), and the tentative detection of a number of other species including glycolaldehyde (CH2(OH)CHO). The first detections of gGg' ethylene glycol (gGg' (CH2OH)(2)) and of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in Orion are presented in a companion paper. We also report the possible detection of several vibrationally excited states of cyanoacetylene (HC3N), and of its C-13 isotopologues. We were not able to detect the (OO)-O-16-O-18 line predicted by our detection of O-2 with Herschel, due to blending with a nearby line of vibrationally excited ethyl cyanide. We do not confirm the tentative detection of hexatriynyl (C6H) and cyanohexatriyne (HC7N) reported previously, or of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission. Results. We report a complex velocity structure only partially revealed before. Components as extreme as -7 and +19 km s(-1) are detected inside the hot region. Thanks to different opacities of various velocity components, in some cases we can position these components along the line of sight. We propose that the systematically redshifted and blueshifted wings of several species observed in the northern part of the region are linked to the explosion that occurred similar to 500 yr ago. The compact ridge, noticeably farther south displays extremely narrow lines (similar to 1 km s(-1)) revealing a quiescent region that has not been affected by this explosion. This probably indicates that the compact ridge is either over 10 000 au in front of or behind the rest of the region. Conclusions. Many lines remain unidentified, and only a detailed modeling of all known species, including vibrational states of isotopologues combined with the detailed spatial analysis offered by ALMA enriched with zero-spacing data, will allow new species to be detected.

Calibrating the Planck cluster mass scale with CLASH	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations; cosmological parameters; dark matter	LOCAL GALAXY CLUSTERS; II. X-RAY; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; LENSING ANALYSIS; DARK-MATTER; WEAK; SYSTEMATICS; EVOLUTION; PROJECT; LOCUSS	We determine the mass scale of Planck galaxy clusters using gravitational lensing mass measurements from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We have compared the lensing masses to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) mass proxy for 21 clusters in common, employing a Bayesian analysis to simultaneously fit an idealized CLASH selection function and the distribution between the measured observables and true cluster mass. We used a tiered analysis strategy to explicitly demonstrate the importance of priors on weak lensing mass accuracy. In the case of an assumed constant bias, b(SZ), between true cluster mass, M-500, and the Planck mass proxy, M-PL, our analysis constrains 1 - b(SZ) = 0.73 +/- 0.10 when moderate priors on weak lensing accuracy are used, including a zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation of 8% to account for possible bias in lensing mass estimations. Our analysis explicitly accounts for possible selection bias effects in this calibration sourced by the CLASH selection function. Our constraint on the cluster mass scale is consistent with recent results from the Weighing the Giants program and the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project. It is also consistent, at 1.34 sigma, with the value needed to reconcile the Planck SZ cluster counts with Planck's base Lambda CDM model fit to the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies.

This paper demonstrates the capability of radar-interferometric phase-height time series at X-band (wavelength = 3 cm) to monitor changes in vertical structure and AGB, with sub-hectare and monthly spatial and temporal resolution, respectively. The phase-height observation is described, with a focus on how it is related to vegetation-density, radar-power vertical profiles, and mean canopy heights, which are, in turn, related to AGB. The study site covers 18 x 60 km in the Tapajos National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Phase-heights over Tapajos were measured by DLR's TanDEM-X radar interferometer 32 times in a 3.2 year period from 2011-2014. Fieldwork was done on 78 secondary and primary forest plots. In the absence of disturbance, rates of change of phase-height for the 78 plots were estimated by fitting the phase-heights to time with a linear model. Phase-height time series for the disturbed plots were fit to the logistic function to track jumps in phase-height. The epochs of clearing for the disturbed plots were identified with approximate to 1-month accuracy. The size of the phase-height change due to disturbance was estimated with approximate to 2-m accuracy. The monthly time resolution will facilitate REDD+ monitoring. Phase-height rates of change were shown to correlate with LiDAR RH90 height rates taken over a subset of the TanDEM-X data's time span (2012-2013). The average rate of change of phase-height across all 78 plots was 0.5 m-yr(-1) with a standard deviation of 0.6 m-yr(-1). For 42 secondary forest plots, the average rate of change of phase-height was 0.8 m-yr(-1) with a standard deviation of 0.6 m-yr(-1). For 36 primary forest plots, the average phase-height rate was 0.1 m-yr(-1) with a standard deviation of 0.5 m-yr(-1). A method for converting phase-height rates to AGB-rates of change was developed using previously measured phase-heights and field-estimated AGB. For all 78 plots, the average AGB-rate was 1.7 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) with a standard deviation of 4.0 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1). The secondary-plot average AGB-rate was 2.1 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1), with a standard deviation of 2.4 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1). For primary plots, the AGB average rate was 1.1 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) with a standard deviation of 5.2 Mg-ha(-1)-yr(-1). Given the standard deviations and the number of plots in each category, rates in secondary forests and all forests were significantly different from zero; rates in primary forests were consistent with zero. AGB-rates were compared to change models for Tapajos and to LiDAR-based change measurements in other tropical forests. Strategies for improving AGB dynamical monitoring with X-band interferometry are discussed.

The Europa Charging Environment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article						Atmosphere modeling; ionosphere; jupiter; magnetosphere; plasma density; plasma properties	IO PLASMA TORUS; ATMOSPHERE; JUPITER; MAGNETOSPHERE	The baseline design of the planned Europa Mission includes large solar arrays, which may experience surface charging. The spacecraft would encounter Europa similar to 40 times with some passes within similar to 25 km. This paper will describe the plasma environment expected near Europa during these encounters. Emphasis will be on the torus near Europa and on Europa's ionosphere. Whereas the spacecraft would encounter a cold, corotating torus plasma with a velocity of similar to 120 km/s near Europa, it may encounter Europa's ionosphere at a velocity as low as 5 km/s as Europa's orbital velocity is only similar to 14 km/s relative to Jupiter. The challenge is to estimate the rapid potential variations associated with these two disparate environments. This paper will present a review of models of the plasma torus and the ionosphere and their interactions with each other. Ultimately, the models will be used to estimate the effects of the varying plasmas near Europa on the planned Europa Mission's baseline spacecraft design and on its instruments with the intent of hardening that design to surface charging and to help with the interpretation of the effects of the charging environment on its instruments.

The GRACE-DSI captures major global drought events during the past decade and shows overall favorable spatiotemporal agreement with other commonly used drought metrics, including the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The assets of the GRACE-DSI are 1) that it is based solely on satellite gravimetric observations and thus provides globally consistent drought monitoring, particularly where sparse ground observations (especially precipitation) constrain the use of traditional model-basedmonitoring methods; 2) that it has a large footprint (- 350 km), so it is suitable for assessing regional-and global-scale drought; and 3) that it is sensitive to the overall terrestrial water storage component of the hydrologic cycle and therefore complements existing drought monitoring datasets by providing information about groundwater storage changes, which affect soil moisture recharge and drought recovery. In Australia, it is demonstrated that combining GRACE-DSI with other satellite environmental datasets improves the characterization of the 2000s "Millennium Drought'' at shallow surface and subsurface soil layers. Contrasting vegetation greenness response to surface and underground water supply changes between western and eastern Australia is found, which might indicate that these regions have different relative plant rooting depths.

Effect of Label Noise on the Machine-Learned Classification of Earthquake Damage	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						machine learning; classification; crowdsourcing; earthquake damage; damage detection; GEOBIA; mislabeled training data	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; GROUND REFERENCE DATA; HAITI EARTHQUAKE; RANDOM FORESTS; IMAGE; SATELLITE; ACCURACY	Automated classification of earthquake damage in remotely-sensed imagery using machine learning techniques depends on training data, or data examples that are labeled correctly by a human expert as containing damage or not. Mislabeled training data are a major source of classifier error due to the use of imprecise digital labeling tools and crowdsourced volunteers who are not adequately trained on or invested in the task. The spatial nature of remote sensing classification leads to the consistent mislabeling of classes that occur in close proximity to rubble, which is a major byproduct of earthquake damage in urban areas. In this study, we look at how mislabeled training data, or label noise, impact the quality of rubble classifiers operating on high-resolution remotely-sensed images. We first study how label noise dependent on geospatial proximity, or geospatial label noise, compares to standard random noise. Our study shows that classifiers that are robust to random noise are more susceptible to geospatial label noise. We then compare the effects of label noise on both pixel- and object-based remote sensing classification paradigms. While object-based classifiers are known to outperform their pixel-based counterparts, this study demonstrates that they are more susceptible to geospatial label noise. We also introduce a new labeling tool to enhance precision and image coverage. This work has important implications for the Sendai framework as autonomous damage classification will ensure rapid disaster assessment and contribute to the minimization of disaster risk.

The mid-tropospheric CO2 differences between dry and wet years are related to circulation and CO2 surface fluxes. During drought conditions, vertical pressure velocity from NCEP2 suggests that there is more rising air over most regions, which can help bring high surface concentrations of CO2 to the mid-troposphere. In addition to the circulation, there is more CO2 emitted from the biosphere to the atmosphere during droughts in some regions, which can contribute to higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. Results obtained from this study demonstrate the significant impact of droughts on atmospheric CO2 and therefore on a feedback cycle contributing to greenhouse gas warming. It can also help us better understand atmospheric CO2, which plays a critical role in our climate system.

Synergistic Use of Remote Sensing and Modeling to Assess an Anomalously High Chlorophyll-a Event during Summer 2015 in the South Central Red Sea	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Red Sea; chlorophyll-a; MODIS; OC-CCI; eddy; dust	SEASONAL VARIABILITY; ANTICYCLONIC EDDY; MODIS-AQUA; OCEAN; PHYTOPLANKTON; CIRCULATION; WIND; SEAWIFS; DUST; DYNAMICS	An anomalously high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) event (>2 mg/m(3)) during June 2015 in the South Central Red Sea (17.5 degrees to 22 degrees N, 37 degrees to 42 degrees E) was observed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. This differs from the low Chl-a values (<0.5 mg/m(3)) usually encountered over the same region during summertime. To assess this anomaly and possible causes, we used a wide range of oceanographical and meteorological datasets, including Chl-a concentrations, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), mixed layer depth (MLD), ocean current velocity and aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from different sensors and models. Findings confirmed this anomalous behavior in the spatial domain using Hovmoller data analysis techniques, while a time series analysis addressed monthly and daily variability. Our analysis suggests that a combination of factors controlling nutrient supply contributed to the anomalous phytoplankton growth. These factors include horizontal transfer of upwelling water through eddy circulation and possible mineral fertilization from atmospheric dust deposition. Coral reefs might have provided extra nutrient supply, yet this is out of the scope of our analysis. We thought that dust deposition from a coastal dust jet event in late June, coinciding with the phytoplankton blooms in the area under investigation, might have also contributed as shown by our AOD findings. However, a lag cross correlation showed a two-month lag between strong dust outbreak and the high Chl-a anomaly. The high Chl-a concentration at the edge of the eddy emphasizes the importance of horizontal advection in fertilizing oligotrophic (nutrient poor) Red Sea waters.

Molecular hydrogen (H-2) production is observed by quadrupole mass spectrometry to be competitive with (in the case of H2O) and dominate over (in the case of the organic substrates) C6H6 desorption. While very preliminary, these results suggest that chemical change (in the form of dehydrogenation) induced by the interaction of organic-rich icy solids with ionizing particle radiation may significantly contribute to hydrogen recycling in cold dense environments.

Empirical nebular elemental abundances, compared with theoretical predictions via nucleosynthesis models of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, indicate that the progenitor is a solar-metallicity, 2.25-3.0 M-circle dot initial-mass star. We derive the best-fit distance of 0.46 kpc by fitting the stellar luminosity (as a function of the distance and effective temperature of the central star) with the adopted post-AGB evolutionary tracks. Our excitation energy diagram analysis indicates high-excitation temperatures in the photodissociation region (PDR) beyond the ionized part of the nebula, suggesting extra heating by shock interactions between the slow AGB wind and the fast PN wind. Through iterative fitting using the Cloudy code with empirically derived constraints, we find the best-fit dusty photoionization model of the object that would inclusively reproduce all of the adopted panchromatic observational data. The estimated total gas mass (0.41 M-circle dot) corresponds to the mass ejected during the last AGB thermal pulse event predicted for a 2.5 M-circle dot initial-mass star. A significant fraction of the total mass (about 70%) is found to exist in the PDR, demonstrating the critical importance of the PDR in PNe that are generally recognized as the hallmark of ionized/H+ regions.

Although important, these data are available for few volcanoes because they have traditionally been difficult to obtain and are usually measured on gas samples collected from fumaroles. We present new field measurements of bulk plume composition and stable isotopes (delta(CCO2)-C-13 and delta(OH2O+)-O-18 CO2) carried out at three northern Chilean volcanoes using MultiGAS and isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy. Carbon and oxygen in magmatic gas plumes of Lastarria and Isluga volcanoes have delta C-13 in CO2 of + 0.76% to + 0.77% (VPDB), similar to slab carbonate; and delta O-18 in the H2O + CO2 system ranging from + 12.2% to + 20.7% (VSMOW), suggesting significant contributions from altered slab pore water and carbonate. The hydrothermal plume at Tacora has lower delta(CCO2)-C-13 of -3.2% and delta(OH2O)-O-18+ CO2 of + 7.0%, reflecting various scrubbing, kinetic fractionation, and contamination processes. We show the isotopic characterization of volcanic gases in the field to be a practical complement to traditional sampling methods, with the potential to remove sampling bias that is a risk when only a few samples from accessible fumaroles are used to characterize a given volcano's volatile output. Our results indicate that there is a previously unrecognized, relatively heavy isotopic signature to bulk volcanic gas plumes in the Central Andes, which can be attributed to a strong influence from components of the subducting slab, but may also reflect some local crustal contamination. The techniques we describe open new avenues for quantifying the roles that subduction zones and arc volcanoes play in the global carbon cycle.	[Schipper, C.

Linking Oceanic Tsunamis and Geodetic Gravity Changes of Large Earthquakes	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Tsunami observations; large earthquakes; satellite gravity	TOHOKU-OKI EARTHQUAKE; SUMATRA-ANDAMAN EARTHQUAKE; COSEISMIC SLIP; DEFORMATION; GRACE; DISPLACEMENT; RELAXATION; MEGATHRUST; AFTERSLIP; MODEL	Large earthquakes at subduction zones usually generate tsunamis and coseismic gravity changes. These two independent oceanic and geodetic signatures of earthquakes can be observed individually by modern geophysical observational networks. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment twin satellites can detect gravity changes induced by large earthquakes, while altimetry satellites and Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis buoys can observe resultant tsunamis. In this study, we introduce a method to connect the oceanic tsunami measurements with the geodetic gravity observations, and apply it to the 2004 Sumatra Mw 9.2 earthquake, the 2010 Maule Mw 8.8 earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku Mw 9.0 earthquake. Our results indicate consistent agreement between these two independent measurements. Since seafloor displacement is still the largest puzzle in assessing tsunami hazards and its formation mechanism, our study demonstrates a new approach to utilizing these two kinds of measurements for better understanding of large earthquakes and tsunamis.

Low frequency 1/f noise on QWIPs, nBn, and superlattice focal plane array	INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Quantum Structure Infrared Photodetector (QSIP)	JUN, 2016	Tel Aviv, ISRAEL			Infrared detector; QWIP; nBn; CBIRD focal plane array; l/f noise		Noise Equivalent Difference Temperature (NE Delta T) is a standard performance metric for most infrared focal plane array (FPA) systems. The frequency bandwidth and range associated with NE Delta T is normally at high frequency and it does not describe the long time noise behavior or the very low frequency noise of the FPA. Very low frequency noise measurement requires data capture that takes longer time duration and sampling interval. This study investigates low frequency noise in QWIP, nBn and LWIR n-type Complementary Barrier Infrared Detector (CBIRD) FPAs. The corner frequencies are extracted from the power spectral density (PSD) as function of frequency. The peak wavelength, quantum efficiency of QWIP detector are 6.2 mu m and 2%, respectively. QWIP FPA has a mean NE Delta T similar to 25 mK at an operating temperature of 65 K and an integration time of 16 ms. The mean QWIP PSD plot shows a corner frequency of <0.5 mHz. The nBn FPA with 41.mu m cut off and quantum efficiency of 67 % has NE Delta T similar to 15.6 mK at an integration time 7.52 ms and an operating temperature of 120 K. The nBn has corner frequency of >50 mHz. Lastly the n-type CBIRD FPA with a 50% cutoff at 8.8 mu m and quantum efficiency of similar to 50 % has an NE Delta T similar to 18.6 mK at an integration time of 1.86 ms and operating temperature 120 K. The super lattice FPA has a corner frequency similar to 10 mHz. The investigation of the tail on the NE Delta T histogram reveals that its origin is not accounted for entirely by the high noise current, but also it needs the inclusion of lower responsivity for some pixels.

Type-II superlattice hole effective masses	INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Quantum Structure Infrared Photodetector (QSIP)	JUN, 2016	Tel Aviv, ISRAEL			Infrared detector; Type-II superlattice; Long-wavelength infrared; Band structure; Hole effective mass	INFRARED DETECTORS; CARRIER LIFETIMES	A long wavelength infrared (LWIR) type-II superlattice (T2SL) is typically characterized by a very large valence-band-edge curvature effective mass, which is often assumed to lead to poor hole mobility. A detailed examination of the LWIR T2SL heavy-hole 1 (hhl) band structure reveals that a hole with non-zero in-plane momentum (k(parallel to) not equal 0) can move with a much larger group velocity component along the growth direction than one at the band edge (k(parallel to) = 0), and that the hhl miniband width can exhibit a very strong dependence on the in-plane wavevector k(parallel to). To distill the band structure effects relevant to hole transport into a simple quantity, we describe a formulation for computing the thermally averaged conductivity effective mass. We show that the LWIR T2SL hole conductivity effective masses along the growth direction can be orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding band-edge curvature effective masses. We compare the conductivities effective masses of InAs/GaSb T2SL and InAs/InAsSb T2SL grown pseudomorphically on GaSb substrate, as well as the metamorphic bulk InAsSb and InAs/InAsSb T2SL.

Our spectrum, covering the Y, J and H bands, combined with previous TaRgetting bENchmark-objects with Doppler Spectroscopy (TRENDS) photometry measurements, allows us to place further constraints on this companion. We suggest two possible scenarios; either this object is an old, low-mass, cool H atmosphere white dwarf with T-eff similar to 3800 K or a high-mass white dwarf with T-eff > 6000 K, potentially with an associated cool (T-eff similar to 700 K) brown dwarf or debris disc resulting in an infrared excess in the L' band. We also provide an additional astrometry point for 2014 June 12 and use the modelled companion mass combined with the radial velocity and direct imaging data to place constraints on the orbital parameters for this companion.

This work builds on the state estimation framework developed in the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean consortium by seeking a reconstruction of the global sea ice-ocean system that is simultaneously consistent with (1) a suite of in situ and remotely-sensed ocean and ice data and (2) the physics encoded in the numerical model. This dual consistency is successfully achieved here by adjusting only the model's initial hydrographic state and its atmospheric boundary conditions such that misfits between the model and data are minimized in a least-squares sense. We show that synthesizing both ocean and sea ice concentration data is required for the model to adequately reproduce the observed details of the sea ice annual cycle in both hemispheres. Surprisingly, only modest adjustments to our first-guess atmospheric state and ocean initial conditions are necessary to achieve model-data consistency, suggesting that atmospheric reanalysis products remain a leading source of errors for sea ice-ocean model hindcasts and reanalyses. The synthesis of sea ice data is found to ameliorate misfits in the high latitude ocean, especially with respect to upper ocean stratification, temperature, and salinity. Constraining the model to sea ice concentration modestly reduces ICESat-derived Arctic ice thickness errors by improving the temporal and spatial evolution of seasonal ice. Further increases in the accuracy of global sea ice thickness in the model likely require the direct synthesis of sea ice thickness data.

Objectives include assessing the global heat closure, the consistency of temporal variability, comparison with other flux products, and documenting errors against in situ flux measurements at a number of OceanSITES moorings. The ensemble of 16 ORA-IP flux estimates has a global positive bias over 1993-2009 of 4.2 +/- 1.1 W m(-2). Residual heat gain (i. e., surface flux + assimilation increments) is reduced to a small positive imbalance (typically, + 1-2 W m(-2)). This compensation between surface fluxes and assimilation increments is concentrated in the upper 100 m. Implied steady meridional heat transports also improve by including assimilation sources, except near the equator. The ensemble spread in surface heat fluxes is dominated by turbulent fluxes (>40 W m(-2) over the western boundary currents). The mean seasonal cycle is highly consistent, with variability between products mostly <10 W m-2. The interannual variability has consistent signal-to-noise ratio (similar to 2) throughout the equatorial Pacific, reflecting ENSO variability. Comparisons at tropical buoy sites (10 degrees S-15 degrees N) over 2007-2009 showed too little ocean heat gain (i. e., flux into the ocean) in ORA-IP (up to 1/3 smaller than buoy measurements) primarily due to latent heat flux errors in ORA-IP. Comparisons with the Stratus buoy (20 degrees S, 85 degrees W) over a longer period, 2001-2009, also show the ORA-IP ensemble has 16 W m(-2) smaller net heat gain, nearly all of which is due to too much latent cooling caused by differences in surface winds imposed in ORA-IP.

An assessment of upper ocean salinity content from the Ocean Reanalyses Inter-comparison Project (ORA-IP)	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Ocean reanalyses; Salinity content; Intercomparison	NORTHERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; DATA ASSIMILATION; SURFACE SALINITY; TROPICAL PACIFIC; COUPLED MODEL; BARRIER LAYER; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; TEMPERATURE; ANOMALIES	Many institutions worldwide have developed ocean reanalyses systems (ORAs) utilizing a variety of ocean models and assimilation techniques. However, the quality of salinity reanalyses arising from the various ORAs has not yet been comprehensively assessed. In this study, we assess the upper ocean salinity content (depth-averaged over 0-700 m) from 14 ORAs and 3 objective ocean analysis systems (OOAs) as part of the Ocean Reanalyses Intercomparison Project. Our results show that the best agreement between estimates of salinity from different ORAs is obtained in the tropical Pacific, likely due to relatively abundant atmospheric and oceanic observations in this region. The largest disagreement in salinity reanalyses is in the Southern Ocean along the Antarctic circumpolar current as a consequence of the sparseness of both atmospheric and oceanic observations in this region. The West Pacific warm pool is the largest region where the signal to noise ratio of reanalysed salinity anomalies is > 1. Therefore, the current salinity reanalyses in the tropical Pacific Ocean may be more reliable than those in the Southern Ocean and regions along the western boundary currents. Moreover, we found that the assimilation of salinity in ocean regions with relatively strong ocean fronts is still a common problem as seen in most ORAs. The impact of the Argo data on the salinity reanalyses is visible, especially within the upper 500 m, where the interannual variability is large. The increasing trend in global-averaged salinity anomalies can only be found within the top 0-300 m layer, but with quite large diversity among different ORAs. Beneath the 300 m depth, the global-averaged salinity anomalies from most ORAs switch their trends from a slightly growing trend before 2002 to a decreasing trend after 2002. The rapid switch in the trend is most likely an artefact of the dramatic change in the observing system due to the implementation of Argo.

Dippers and dusty disc edges: new diagnostics and comparison to model predictions	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion; accretion discs; stars: variables: T Tauri; Herbig Ae/Be	SCORPIUS OB ASSOCIATION; LOW-MASS STARS; T-TAURI STARS; YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; HERBIG AE/BE STARS; 3D MHD SIMULATIONS; MAGNETIZED STARS; BROWN DWARFS; NGC 2264	We revisit the nature of large dips in flux from extinction by dusty circumstellar material that is observed by Kepler for many young stars in the Upper Sco and rho Oph star formation regions. These young, low-mass 'dipper' stars are known to have low accretion rates and primarily host moderately evolved dusty circumstellar discs. Young low-mass stars often exhibit rotating starspots that cause quasi-periodic photometric variations. We found no evidence for periods associated with the dips that are different from the starspot rotation period in spectrograms constructed from the light curves. The material causing the dips in most of these light curves must be approximately corotating with the star. We find that disc temperatures computed at the disc corotation radius are cool enough that dust should not sublime. Crude estimates for stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates are consistent with magnetospheric truncation near the corotation radius. Magnetospheric truncation models can explain why the dips are associated with material near corotation and how dusty material is lifted out of the mid-plane to obscure the star that would account for the large fraction of young low-mass stars that are dippers. We propose that variations in disc orientation angle, stellar magnetic field dipole tilt axis and disc accretion rate are underlying parameters accounting for differences in the dipper light curves.

The Gamma(X)- L/L-Edd relation	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; quasars: general; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLE MASS; RAY SPECTRAL INDEX; X-RAY; EDDINGTON RATIO; RADIATION PRESSURE; RATE INDICATOR; ACCRETION; EMISSION; BROAD	We study the relation between accretion rate (in terms of L/L-Edd) and shape of the hard X-ray spectral energy distribution (namely the photon index Gamma(x)) for a large sample of 228 hard X-ray-selected, low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs), drawn from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). This includes 30 AGNs for which black hole mass (and therefore L/L-Edd) is measured directly through masers, spatially resolved gas or stellar dynamics, or reverberation mapping. The high-quality and broad energy coverage of the data provided through BASS allow us to examine several alternative determinations of both Gamma(x) and L/L-Edd. For the BASS sample as a whole, we find a statistically significant, albeit very weak correlation between Gamma(x) and L/L-Edd. The best-fitting relations we find, Gamma(x) similar or equal to 0.15 log L/L-Edd + const., are considerably shallower than those reported in previous studies. Moreover, we find n0 corresponding correlations among the subsets of AGN with different M-BH determination methodology. In particular, we find no robust evidence for a correlation when considering only those AGN with direct or single-epoch MBH estimates. This latter finding is in contrast to several previous studies which focused on z > 0.5 broad-line AGN. We discuss this tension and conclude that it can be partially accounted for if one adopts a simplified, power-law X-ray spectral model, combined with L/L-Edd\ estimates that are based on the continuum emission and on single-epoch broad-line spectroscopy in the optical regime. We finally highlight the limitations on using Gamma(x) as a probe of supermassive black hole evolution in deep extragalactic X-ray surveys.

A New Limit on CMB Circular Polarization from SPIDER	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation	HALF-WAVE PLATE; MICROWAVE BACKGROUND ASTRONOMY; SUBMILLIMETER INSTRUMENTS	We present a new upper limit on cosmic microwave background (CMB) circular polarization from the 2015 flight of SPIDER, a balloon-borne telescope designed to search for B-mode linear polarization from cosmic inflation. Although the level of circular polarization in the CMB is predicted to be very small, experimental limits provide a valuable test of the underlying models. By exploiting the nonzero circular-to-linear polarization coupling of the half-wave plate polarization modulators, data from SPIDER's 2015 Antarctic flight provide a constraint on Stokes V at 95 and 150 GHz in the range 33 < l < 307. No other limits exist over this full range of angular scales, and SPIDER improves on the previous limit by several orders of magnitude, providing 95% C.L. constraints on l (l + 1)C-l(VV) /(2 pi) ranging from 141 to 255 mu K-2 at 150 GHz for a thermal CMB spectrum. As linear CMB polarization experiments become increasingly sensitive, the techniques described in this paper can be applied to obtain even stronger constraints on circular polarization.	[Nagy, J.

We find that the fit to the debiased LPC population yields a cumulative size-frequency distribution (SFD) power-law slope (beta) of -1.0 +/- 0.1, while the debiased Jupiter-family comet (JFC) SFD has a steeper slope with beta = -2.3 +/- 0.2. The JFCs in our debiased sample yielded a mean nucleus size of 1.3 km in diameter, while the LPCs' mean size is roughly twice as large, 2.1 km, yielding mean size ratios (< D-LPC > / < D-JFC >) that differ by a factor of 1.6. Over the course of the 8 months of the survey, our results indicate that the number of LPCs passing within 1.5 au are a factor of several higher than previous estimates, while JFCs are within the previous range of estimates of a few thousand down to sizes near 1.3 km in diameter. Finally, we also observe evidence for structure in the orbital distribution of LPCs, with an overdensity of comets clustered near 110 degrees. inclination and perihelion near 2.9 au that is not attributable to observational bias.

Here we show that the radiative effects of precipitating ice (falling snow) contribute substantially to this discrepancy. Many models exclude these radiative effects, so they underestimate both shortwave albedo and downward longwave radiation. Using two simulations with the climate model CESM1, we show that including falling-snow radiative effects improves the simulations relative to cloud properties from CloudSat-CALIPSO, radiation from CERES-EBAF and sea-ice concentration from passive microwave sensors. From 50-70 degrees S, the simulated sea-ice-area bias is reduced by 2.12 x 10(6) km(2) (55%) in winter and by 1.17 x 10(6) km(2) (39%) in summer, mainly because increased wintertime longwave heating restricts sea-ice growth and so reduces summer albedo. Improved Antarctic sea-ice simulations will increase confidence in projected Antarctic sea level contributions and changes in global warming driven by long-term changes in Southern Ocean feedbacks.

The velocity dispersions were calculated using redshifts determined from spectra that were obtained at the Gemini observatory with the GMOS multi-object spectrograph. We correct our estimates for effects due to finite aperture, Eddington bias, and correlated scatter between velocity dispersion and the Planck mass proxy. The result for the mass bias parameter, (1 - b), depends on the value of the galaxy velocity bias, b(v), adopted from simulations: (1 - b) = (0.51 +/- 0.09)b(v)(3). Using a velocity bias of bv = 1.08 from Munari et al., we obtain (1 - b) = 0.64 +/- 0.11, i.e., an error of 17% on the mass bias measurement with 17 clusters. This mass bias value is consistent with most previous weak-lensing determinations. It lies within 1s of the value that is needed to reconcile the Planck cluster counts with the Planck primary cosmic microwave background constraints. We emphasize that uncertainty in the velocity bias severely hampers the precision of the measurements of the mass bias using velocity dispersions. On the other hand, when we fix the Planck mass bias using the constraints from Penna-Lima et al., based on weak-lensing measurements, we obtain a positive velocity bias of b(v) greater than or similar to 0.9 at 3 sigma.

Satellite Observations of Regional Drought Severity in the Continental United States Using GRACE-Based Terrestrial Water Storage Changes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							VEGETATION; LAND; DEPLETION; ANOMALIES	Drought monitoring is important for characterizing the timing, extent, and severity of drought for effective mitigation and water management. Presented here is a novel satellite-based drought severity index (DSI) for regional monitoring derived using time-variable terrestrial water storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). The GRACE-DSI enables drought feature comparison across regions and periods, it is unaffected by uncertainties associated with soil water balance models and meteorological forcing data, and it incorporates water storage changes from human impacts including groundwater withdrawals that modify land surface processes and impact water management. Here, the underlying algorithm is described, and the GRACE-DSI performance in the continental United States during 2002-14 is evaluated. It is found that the GRACE-DSI captures documented regional drought events and shows favorable spatial and temporal agreement with the monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). The GRACE-DSI also correlates well with a satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicating sensitivity to plant-available water supply changes affecting vegetation growth. Because the GRACE-DSI captures changes in total terrestrial water storage, it complements more traditional drought monitoring tools such as the PDSI by providing information about deeper water storage changes that affect soil moisture recharge and drought recovery. The GRACE-DSI shows potential for globally consistent and effective drought monitoring, particularly where sparse ground observations (especially precipitation) limit the use of traditional drought monitoring methods.

An experimental investigation on the notch toughness of Cu-Zr-based bulk metallic glasses with in-situ crystallization	JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS			English	Article						Bulk amorphous alloys; Crystallization; Toughness; Wear; Electron backscattered diffraction	FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; WEAR-RESISTANCE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPOSITE-MATERIALS; AMORPHOUS-ALLOYS; PLASTICITY; BEHAVIOR	The notch toughness of wear-resistant Cu43Zr43Al7Be7 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with in-situ crystallization is investigated. Using different cooling rates during copper mold casting and a post-cast anneal, the amount of crystallization is controlled and varied. The notch toughness correlates most closely with the composition of the remaining amorphous matrix, as measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). As the matrix composition shifts further away from the designed high-glass forming composition, the toughness decreases. The sample with a matrix composition that closely matches Cu43Zr43Al7Be7 is shown to be the toughest, with a notch toughness of 54 MPa-m(1/2). X-ray diffraction (XRD), EDS and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were used to identify the metastable crystalline phase as Cu3Zr5Al2(+Be) with a cubic Fm (3) over barm structure. Furthermore, the crystalline phases are shown to be harder than the glassy matrix, and therefore likely contribute to the high wear-resistance of the studied BMG. Under standard XRD operating parameters, as used in the literature, all of the samples examined in this study appear to be fully amorphous, yet many are shown to contain a significant number of crystalline regions. In order to identify in-situ crystallization using XRD with Cu K alpha radiation, extremely long dwell times and high X-ray fluxes are required. This demonstrates the importance of reporting XRD operating parameters when trying to evaluate the amorphous nature of BMGs.

Deep Imaging Search for Planets Forming in the TW Hya Protoplanetary Disk with the Keck/NIRC2 Vortex Coronagraph	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: individual (TW Hya); stars: pre-main sequence	SCATTERED-LIGHT; HYDRAE; DUST; CAVITY; MASS; GAP; PARALLAXES; AU	Distinct gap features in the nearest protoplanetary disk, TW Hya (distance of 59.5 +/- 0.9 pc), may be signposts of ongoing planet formation. We performed long-exposure thermal infrared coronagraphic imaging observations to search for accreting planets especially within dust gaps previously detected in scattered light and submm-wave thermal emission. Three nights of observations with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in L' (3.4-4.1 mu m) did not reveal any statistically significant point sources. We thereby set strict upper limits on the masses of non-accreting planets. In the four most prominent disk gaps at 24, 41, 47, and 88 au, we obtain upper mass limits of 1.6-2.3, 1.1-1.6, 1.1-1.5, and 1.0-1.2 Jupiter masses (M-J) assuming an age range of 7-10 Myr for TW Hya. These limits correspond to the contrast at 95\% completeness (true positive fraction of 0.95) with a 1\% chance of a false positive within 1 '' of the star. We also approximate an upper limit on the product of planet mass and planetary accretion rate of MpM less than or similar to 10(-8) M-J(2)/yr implying that any putative similar to 0.1M(J) planet, which could be responsible for opening the 24 au gap, is presently accreting at rates insufficient to build up a Jupiter mass within TW Hya's pre-main sequence lifetime.

Seasonal erosion and restoration of the dust cover on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as observed by OSIRIS onboard Rosetta	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/ Churyumov; Gerasimenko	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; WATER ICE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; IMHOTEP REGION; NUCLEUS; VIRTIS; JETS; SUBLIMATION; MORPHOLOGY; TRANSPORT	Context. Dust deposits or dust cover are a prevalent morphology in the northern hemi-nucleus of comet 67P /Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). The evolution of the dust deposits was captured by the OSIRIS camera system onboard the Rosetta spacecraft having escorted the comet for over two years. The observations shed light on the fundamental role of cometary activity in shaping and transforming the surface morphology. Aims. We aim to present OSIRIS observations of surface changes over the dust deposits before and after perihelion. The distribution of changes and a timeline of their occurrence are provided. We perform a data analysis to quantify the surface changes and investigate their correlation to water activity from the dust deposits. We further discuss how the results of our investigation are related to other findings from the Rosetta mission. Methods. Surface changes were detected via systematic comparison of images, and quantified using shape-from-shading technique. Thermal models were applied to estimate the erosion of water ice in response to the increasing insolation over the areas where surface changes occurred. Modeling results were used for the interpretation of the observed surface changes. Results. Surface changes discussed here were concentrated at mid-latitudes, between about 20 degrees N and 40 degrees N, marking a global transition from the dust-covered to rugged terrains. The changes were distributed in open areas exposed to ample solar illumination and likely subject to enhanced surface erosion before perihelion. The occurrence of changes followed the southward migration of the sub-solar point across the latitudes of their distribution. The erosion at locations of most changes was at least about 0 : 5 m, but most likely did not exceed several meters. The erosive features before perihelion had given way to a fresh, smooth cover of dust deposits after perihelion, suggesting that the dust deposits had been globally restored by at least about 1 m with ejecta from the intensely illuminated southern hemi-nucleus around perihelion, when the north was inactive during polar night. Conclusions. The erosion and restoration of the northern dust deposits are morphological expressions of seasonality on 67P. Based on observations and thermal modeling results, it is inferred that the dust deposits contained a few percent of water ice in mass on average. Local inhomogeneity in water abundance at spatial scales below tens of meters is likely. We suspect that dust ejected from the deposits may not have escaped the comet in bulk. That is, at least half of the ejected mass was afloat in the inner-coma or /and redeposited over other areas of the nucleus.

Their infrared luminosities span (2-15) x 10(13) L-circle dot, making them among the most luminous objects in the universe at z similar to 2. In all cases, the infrared emission is consistent with arising at least for the. most part from AGN activity. The AGN fractional luminosities are higher than those in either submillimeter galaxies. or AGNs selected via other mid-infrared criteria. Adopting the G, M-20, and A morphological parameters, together with traditional classification boundaries, infers that three-quarters of the sample are mergers. Our sample does not, however, show any correlation between the considered morphological parameters and either infrared luminosity or AGN fractional luminosity. Moreover, the asymmetries and effective radii of our sample are distributed identically to those of massive galaxies at z similar to 2. We conclude that our sample is not preferentially associated with mergers, though a significant merger fraction is still plausible. Instead, we propose that our sample includes. examples of the massive galaxy population at z similar to 2 that harbor a briefly luminous, "flickering" AGN. and in which the G and M-20 values have been perturbed. due to either the AGN. and/or the earliest formation stages of a bulge in an inside-out manner. Furthermore, we find that the mass assembly of the central black holes in our sample leads the mass assembly of any bulge component. Finally, we speculate that our sample represents. a small fraction of the immediate antecedents of compact star-forming galaxies at z similar to 2.

We present the results of an analysis of Milky Way (MW) and Virgo core GCs based on 5. optical-near-infrared colors and 10. synthetic stellar population models. For the MW GCs, the models tend to agree on photometric ages and metallicities, with values similar to those obtained with previous studies. When used with Virgo core GCs, for which photometry is provided by the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS), the same models generically return younger ages. This is a consequence of the systematic differences observed between the locus occupied by Virgo core GCs and models in panchromatic color space. Only extreme fine-tuning of the adjustable parameters available to us can make the majority of the best-fit ages old. Although we cannot exclude that the formation history of the Virgo core may lead to more conspicuous populations of relatively young GCs than in other environments, we emphasize that the intrinsic properties of the Virgo GCs are likely to differ systematically from those assumed in the models. Thus, the large wavelength coverage and photometric quality of modern GC samples, such as those used here, is not by itself sufficient to better constrain the GC formation histories. Models matching the environment-dependent characteristics of GCs in multi-dimensional color space are needed to improve the situation.

III. Survey of Luminous Quasars at 4.7 <= z <= 5.4	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						cosmology: observations; quasars: emission lines; quasars: general; quasars: supermassive black holes; surveys	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; HIGH-REDSHIFT QUASARS; BLACK-HOLE MASSES; SURVEY COMMISSIONING DATA; Z-GREATER-THAN-5.7 QUASARS; ADDITIONAL QUASARS; EARLY UNIVERSE; Z-SIMILAR-TO-6 QUASARS; CQUEAN CAMERA; DISCOVERY	We present the first results of our survey for high-redshift quasars at 5 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 5.7. The search for quasars in this redshift range has been known to be challenging due to the limitations of the filter sets used in previous studies. We conducted a quasar survey for two specific redshift ranges, 4.60 <= z <= 5.40 and 5.50 <= z <= 6.05, using multi-wavelength data that include observations made with custom-designed filters, is and iz. Using these filters and a new selection technique, we were able to reduce the fraction of interlopers. Through optical spectroscopy, we confirmed six quasars at 4.7 <= z <= 5.4 with -27.4 < M-1450 < -26.4 that recently were discovered independently by another group. We estimated black hole masses and Eddington ratios of four of these quasars from optical and near-infrared spectra, and found that these quasars are undergoing nearly Eddington-limited accretion that is consistent with the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in luminous quasars at z similar to 5.

The 3.5 +/- 0.1 ppm rise in global annual mean carbon dioxide from 2015 to 2016 was the largest annual increase observed in the 58-year measurement record. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface surpassed 400 ppm (402.9 +/- 0.1 ppm) for the first time in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800000 years. One of the strongest El Nino events since at least 1950 dissipated in spring, and a weak La Nina evolved later in the year. Owing at least in part to the combination of El Nino conditions early in the year and a long-term upward trend, Earth's surface observed record warmth for a third consecutive year, albeit by a much slimmer margin than by which that record was set in 2015. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature was record high according to all datasets analyzed, while the lower stratospheric temperature was record low according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Mexico and India, reported record high annual temperatures while many others observed near-record highs. A week-long heat wave at the end of April over the northern and eastern Indian peninsula, with temperatures surpassing 44 degrees C, contributed to a water crisis for 330 million people and to 300 fatalities. In the Arctic the 2016 land surface temperature was 2.0 degrees C above the 1981-2010 average, breaking the previous record of 2007, 2011, and 2015 by 0.8 degrees C, representing a 3.5 degrees C increase since the record began in 1900. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 24 March, the sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, tying with 2015 at 7.2% below the 1981-2010 average. The September 2016 Arctic sea ice minimum extent tied with 2007 for the second lowest value on record, 33% lower than the 1981-2010 average. Arctic sea ice cover remains relatively young and thin, making it vulnerable to continued extensive melt. The mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has the capacity to contribute similar to 7 m to sea level rise, reached a record low value. The onset of its surface melt was the second earliest, after 2012, in the 37-year satellite record. Sea surface temperature was record high at the global scale, surpassing the previous record of 2015 by about 0.01 degrees C. The global sea surface temperature trend for the 21st century-to-date of +0.162 degrees C decade(-1) is much higher than the longer term 1950-2016 trend of +0.100 degrees C decade(-1). Global annual mean sea level also reached a new record high, marking the sixth consecutive year of increase. Global annual ocean heat content saw a slight drop compared to the record high in 2015. Alpine glacier retreat continued around the globe, and preliminary data indicate that 2016 is the 37th consecutive year of negative annual mass balance. Across the Northern Hemisphere, snow cover for each month from February to June was among its four least extensive in the 47-year satellite record. Continuing a pattern below the surface, record high temperatures at 20-m depth were measured at all permafrost observatories on the North Slope of Alaska and at the Canadian observatory on northernmost Ellesmere Island. In the Antarctic, record low monthly surface pressures were broken at many stations, with the southern annular mode setting record high index values in March and June. Monthly high surface pressure records for August and November were set at several stations. During this period, record low daily and monthly sea ice extents were observed, with the November mean sea ice extent more than 5 standard deviations below the 1981-2010 average. These record low sea ice values contrast sharply with the record high values observed during 2012-14. Over the region, springtime Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion was less severe relative to the 1991-2006 average, but ozone levels were still low compared to pre-1990 levels. Closer to the equator, 93 named tropical storms were observed during 2016, above the 1981-2010 average of 82, but fewer than the 101 storms recorded in 2015. Three basins-the North Atlantic, and eastern and western North Pacific-experienced above-normal activity in 2016. The Australian basin recorded its least active season since the beginning of the satellite era in 1970. Overall, four tropical cyclones reached the Saffir-Simpson category 5 intensity level. The strong El Nino at the beginning of the year that transitioned to a weak La Nina contributed to enhanced precipitation variability around the world. Wet conditions were observed throughout the year across southern South America, causing repeated heavy flooding in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Wetter-than-usual conditions were also observed for eastern Europe and central Asia, alleviating the drought conditions of 2014 and 2015 in southern Russia. In the United States, California had its first wetter-than-average year since 2012, after being plagued by drought for several years. Even so, the area covered by drought in 2016 at the global scale was among the largest in the post-1950 record. For each month, at least 12% of land surfaces experienced severe drought conditions or worse, the longest such stretch in the record. In northeastern Brazil, drought conditions were observed for the fifth consecutive year, making this the longest drought on record in the region. Dry conditions were also observed in western Bolivia and Peru; it was Bolivia's worst drought in the past 25 years. In May, with abnormally warm and dry conditions already prevailing over western Canada for about a year, the human-induced Fort McMurray wildfire burned nearly 590000 hectares and became the costliest disaster in Canadian history, with $3 billion (U.S. dollars) in insured losses.

In this work, as part of the Ocean Reanalysis Intercomparison Project, the global and regional steric sea level changes are estimated and compared from an ensemble of 16 ocean reanalyses and 4 objective analyses. These estimates are initially compared with a satellite-derived (altimetry minus gravimetry) dataset for a short period (2003-2010). The ensemble mean exhibits a significant high correlation at both global and regional scale, and the ensemble of ocean reanalyses outperforms that of objective analyses, in particular in the Southern Ocean. The reanalysis ensemble mean thus represents a valuable tool for further analyses, although large uncertainties remain for the inter-annual trends. Within the extended intercomparison period that spans the altimetry era (1993-2010), we find that the ensemble of reanalyses and objective analyses are in good agreement, and both detect a trend of the global steric sea level of 1.0 and 1.1 +/- 0.05 mm/year, respectively. However, the spread among the products of the halosteric component trend exceeds the mean trend itself, questioning the reliability of its estimate. This is related to the scarcity of salinity observations before the Argo era. Furthermore, the impact of deep ocean layers is non-negligible on the steric sea level variability (22 and 12 % for the layers below 700 and 1500 m of depth, respectively), although the small deep ocean trends are not significant with respect to the products spread.

Compared with the reference MLDs calculated from individual profiles, MLDs calculated from monthly mean and gridded profiles show negative biases of 10-20 m in early spring related to the re-stratification process of relatively deep mixed layers. Vertical resolution of profiles also influences the MLD estimation. MLDs are underestimated by approximately 5-7 (14-16) m with the vertical resolution of 25 (50) m when the criterion of potential density exceeding the 10-m value by 0.03 kg m(-3) is used for the MLD estimation. Using the larger criterion (0.125 kg m(-3)) generally reduces the underestimations. In addition, positive biases greater than 100 m are found in wintertime subpolar regions when MLD criteria based on temperature are used. Biases of the reanalyses are due to both model errors and errors related to differences between the assimilation methods. The result shows that these errors are partially cancelled out through the ensemble averaging. Moreover, the bias in the ensemble mean field of the reanalyses is smaller than in the observation-only analyses. This is largely attributed to comparably higher resolutions of the reanalyses. The robust reproduction of both the seasonal cycle and interannual variability by the ensemble mean of the reanalyses indicates a great potential of the ensemble mean MLD field for investigating and monitoring upper ocean processes.

The first leading EOF mode represents the interannual MLD anomalies centered in the eastern part of the central mode water formation region in phase opposition with those in the eastern subtropics and the central Alaskan Gyre. This first EOF mode is highly correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation index on both the interannual and decadal time scales. The second leading EOF mode represents the MLD variability in the subtropical mode water (STMW) formation region and has a good correlation with the wintertime West Pacific (WP) index with time lag of 3 years, suggesting the importance of the oceanic dynamical response to the change in the surface wind field associated with the meridional shifts of the Aleutian Low. The above MLD variabilities are in basic agreement with previous observational and modeling findings. Moreover the reanalysis ensemble provides uncertainty estimates. The interannual MLD anomalies in the first and second EOF modes are consistently represented by the individual reanalyses and the amplitudes of the variabilities generally exceed the ensemble spread of the reanalyses. Besides, the resulting MLD variability indices, spanning the 1948-2012 period, should be helpful for characterizing the North Pacific climate variability. In particular, a 6-year oscillation including the WP teleconnection pattern in the atmosphere and the oceanic MLD variability in the STMW formation region is first detected.

Ocean heat content variability and change in an ensemble of ocean reanalyses	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Heat content; Temperature; Variability; Climate change; Global warming; Energy budget; Ocean reanalyses; Ocean state estimation; Ocean models; Inter comparison; Ocean; Observations; Data assimilation	MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; GLOBAL OCEAN; DATA ASSIMILATION; IN-SITU; TEMPERATURE; ATLANTIC; SYSTEM; FIELDS; HIATUS; PACIFIC	Accurate knowledge of the location and magnitude of ocean heat content (OHC) variability and change is essential for understanding the processes that govern decadal variations in surface temperature, quantifying changes in the planetary energy budget, and developing constraints on the transient climate response to external forcings. We present an overview of the temporal and spatial characteristics of OHC variability and change as represented by an ensemble of dynamical and statistical ocean reanalyses (ORAs). Spatial maps of the 0-300 m layer show large regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans where the interannual variability of the ensemble mean exceeds ensemble spread, indicating that OHC variations are well-constrained by the available observations over the period 1993-2009. At deeper levels, the ORAs are less well-constrained by observations with the largest differences across the ensemble mostly associated with areas of high eddy kinetic energy, such as the Southern Ocean and boundary current regions. Spatial patterns of OHC change for the period 1997-2009 show good agreement in the upper 300 m and are characterized by a strong dipole pattern in the Pacific Ocean. There is less agreement in the patterns of change at deeper levels, potentially linked to differences in the representation of ocean dynamics, such as water mass formation processes. However, the Atlantic and Southern Oceans are regions in which many ORAs show widespread warming below 700 m over the period 1997-2009. Annual time series of global and hemispheric OHC change for 0-700 m show the largest spread for the data sparse Southern Hemisphere and a number of ORAs seem to be subject to large initialization 'shock' over the first few years. In agreement with previous studies, a number of ORAs exhibit enhanced ocean heat uptake below 300 and 700 m during the mid-1990s or early 2000s. The ORA ensemble mean (+/- 1 standard deviation) of rolling 5-year trends in full-depth OHC shows a relatively steady heat uptake of approximately 0.9 +/- 0.8 W m(-2) (expressed relative to Earth's surface area) between 1995 and 2002, which reduces to about 0.2 +/- 0.6 W m(-2) between 2004 and 2006, in qualitative agreement with recent analysis of Earth's energy imbalance. There is a marked reduction in the ensemble spread of OHC trends below 300 m as the Argo profiling float observations become available in the early 2000s. In general, we suggest that ORAs should be treated with caution when employed to understand past ocean warming trends-especially when considering the deeper ocean where there is little in the way of observational constraints. The current work emphasizes the need to better observe the deep ocean, both for providing observational constraints for future ocean state estimation efforts and also to develop improved models and data assimilation methods.

Mineralogy of an ancient lacustrine mudstone succession from the Murray formation, Gale crater, Mars	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; Gale crater; X-ray diffraction; diagenesis; acid-sulfate alteration	SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; MERIDIANI-PLANUM; YELLOWKNIFE BAY; CLAY-MINERALS; SALINE LAKE; DISSOLUTION; ACID; DIAGENESIS	The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover has been traversing strata at the base of Aeolis Mons (informally known as Mount Sharp) since September 2014. The Murray formation makes up the lowest exposed strata of the Mount Sharp group and is composed primarily of finely laminated lacustrine mudstone intercalated with rare crossbedded sandstone that is prodeltaic or fluvial in origin. We report on the first three drilled samples from the Murray formation, measured in the Pahrump Hills section. Rietveld refinements and FULLPAT full pattern fitting analyses of X-ray diffraction patterns measured by the MSL CheMin instrument provide mineral abundances, refined unit-cell parameters for major phases giving crystal chemistry, and abundances of X-ray amorphous materials. Our results from the samples measured at the Pahrump Hills and previously published results on the Buckskin sample measured from the Marias Pass section stratigraphically above Pahrump Hills show stratigraphic variations in the mineralogy; phyllosilicates, hematite, jarosite, and pyroxene are most abundant at the base of the Pahrump Hills, and crystalline and amorphous silica and magnetite become prevalent higher in the succession. Some trace element abundances measured by APXS also show stratigraphic trends; Zn and Ni are highly enriched with respect to average Mars crust at the base of the Pahrump Hills (by 7.7 and 3.7 times, respectively), and gradually decrease in abundance in stratigraphically higher regions near Marias Pass, where they are depleted with respect to average Mars crust (by more than an order of magnitude in some targets). The Mn stratigraphic trend is analogous to Zn and Ni, however, Mn abundances are close to those of average Mars crust at the base of Pahrump Hills, rather than being enriched, and Mn becomes increasingly depleted moving upsection. Minerals at the base of the Pahrump Hills, in particular jarosite and hematite, as well as enrichments in Zn, Ni, and Mn, are products of acid-sulfate alteration on Earth. We hypothesize that multiple influxes of mildly to moderately acidic pore fluids resulted in diagenesis of the Murray formation and the observed mineralogical and geochemical variations. The preservation of some minerals that are highly susceptible to dissolution at low pH (e.g., mafic minerals and fluorapatite) suggests that acidic events were not long-lived and that fluids may not have been extremely acidic (pH > 2). Alternatively, the observed mineralogical variations within the succession may be explained by deposition in lake waters with variable Eh and/or pH, where the lowermost sediments were deposited in an oxidizing, perhaps acidic lake setting, and sediments deposited in the upper Pahrump Hills and Marias Pass were deposited lake waters with lower Eh and higher pH.

Martian low-temperature alteration materials in shock-melt pockets in Tissint: Constraints on their preservation in shergottite meteorites	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Martian meteorites; Alteration; Shock; Water; Chlorine; Hydrogen Isotopes	GENERATED HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; BASALTIC COMPOSITION; CRYSTALLIZATION; PRESSURE; MANTLE; INCLUSIONS; SUBSOLIDUS; VOLATILES; PETROLOGY; MINERALS	We apply an array of in situ analytical techniques, including electron and Raman microscopy, electron and ion probe microanalysis, and laser ablation mass spectrometry to the Tissint martian meteorite in order to find and elucidate a geochemical signature characteristic of low-temperature alteration at or near the martian surface. Tissint contains abundant shock-produced quench-crystallized melt pockets containing water in concentrations ranging from 73 to 1730 ppm; water content is positively correlated with Cl content. The isotopic composition of hydrogen in the shock-produced glass ranges from delta D = 2559 to 4422%. Water is derived from two distinct hydrogen reservoirs: the martian near-surface (> 500%) and the martian mantle (-100%). In one shock melt pocket comprising texturally homogeneous vesiculated glass, the concentration of H in the shock melt decreases while simultaneously becoming enriched in D, attributable to the preferential loss of H over D to the vesicle while the pocket was still molten. While igneous sulfides are pyrrhotite in composition (Fe0.88-0.90S), the iron to sulfur ratios of spherules in shock melt pockets are elevated, up to Fe1.70S, which we attribute to shock-oxidation of igneous pyrrhotite and the formation of hematite at high temperature. The D- and Cl-enrichment, and higher oxidation of the pockets (as indicated by hematite) support a scenario in which alteration products formed within fractures or void spaces within the rock; the signature of these alteration products is preserved within shock melt (now glass) which formed upon collapse of these fractures and voids during impact shock. Thermal modeling of Tissint shock melt pockets using the HEAT program demonstrates that the shock melt pockets with the greatest potential to preserve a signature of aqueous alteration are small, isolated from other regions of shock melt, vesicle-free, and glassy.

Evidence for surface water ice in the lunar polar regions using reflectance measurements from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter and temperature measurements from the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment	ICARUS			English	Article							VOLATILES; SUBLIMATION; MISSION; MERCURY; MOON	We find that the reflectance of the lunar surface within 5 degrees of latitude of the South Pole increases rapidly with decreasing temperature, near similar to 110 K, behavior consistent with the presence of surface water ice. The North polar region does not show this behavior, nor do South polar surfaces at latitudes more than 5 degrees from the pole. This South pole reflectance anomaly persists when analysis is limited to surfaces with slopes less than 10 degrees to eliminate false detection due to the brightening effect of mass wasting, and also when the very bright south polar crater Shackleton is excluded from the analysis. We also find that south polar regions of permanent shadow that have been reported to be generally brighter at 1064 nm do not show anomalous reflectance when their annual maximum surface temperatures are too high to preserve water ice. This distinction is not observed at the North Pole. The reflectance excursion on surfaces with maximum temperatures below 110 K is superimposed on a general trend of increasing reflectance with decreasing maximum temperature that is present throughout the polar regions in the north and south; we attribute this trend to a temperature or illumination-dependent space weathering effect (e.g. Hemingway et al., 2015). We also find a sudden increase in reflectance with decreasing temperature superimposed on the general trend at 200 K and possibly at 300 K. This may indicate the presence of other volatiles such as sulfur or organics. We identified and mapped surfaces with reflectances so high as to be unlikely to be part of an ice-free population. In this south we find a similar distribution found by Hayne et al. (2015) based on UV properties. In the north a cluster of pixels near that pole may represent a limited frost exposure.

Jupiter's auroral-related stratospheric heating and chemistry I: Analysis of Voyager-IRIS and Cassini-CIRS spectra	ICARUS			English	Article							SATURNS STRATOSPHERE; UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; HAZE FORMATION; INFRARED SPECTROMETER; MERIDIONAL VARIATIONS; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; POLAR ATMOSPHERE; HOT-SPOT; EMISSION; TEMPERATURE	Auroral processes are evident in Jupiter's polar atmosphere over a large range in wavelength (X-ray to radio). In particular, previous observations in the mid-infrared (5-15 pm) have shown enhanced emission from CH4, C2H2 and C2H4 and further stratospheric hydrocarbon species in spatial regions coincident with auroral processes observed at other wavelengths. These regions, described as auroral-related hotspots, observed at approximately 160 degrees W to 200 degrees W (System III) at high-northern latitudes and 330 degrees W to 80 degrees W at high-southern latitudes, indicate that auroral processes modify the thermal structure and composition of the neutral atmosphere. However, previous studies have struggled to differentiate whether the aforementioned enhanced emission is a result of either temperature changes and/or changes in the concentration of the emitting species. We attempt to address this degeneracy in this work by performing a retrieval analysis of Voyager 1-IRIS spectra (acquired in 1979) and Cassini-CIRS spectra (acquired in 2000/2001) of Jupiter. Retrievals of the vertical temperature profile in Cassini-CIRS spectra covering the auroral-related hotspots indicate the presence of two discrete vertical regions of heating at the 1-mbar level and at pressures of 10-mu bar and lower. For example, in Cassini-CIRS 2.5 cm(-1) 'MIRMAP' spectra at 70 degrees N (planetographic) 180 degrees W (centred on the auroral oval), we find temperatures at the 1-mbar level and 10-mu bar levels are enhanced by 15.3 +/- 5.2 K and 29.6 +/- 15.0 K respectively, in comparison to results at 70 degrees N, 60 degrees W in the same dataset. High temperatures at 10-mu bar and lower pressures were considered indicative of joule heating, ion and/or electron precipitation, ion-drag and energy released form exothermic ion-chemistry. However, we conclude that the heating at the 1-mbar level is the result of either a layer of aurorally-produced haze particles, which are heated by incident sunlight and/or adiabatic heating by downwelling within the auroral hot-spot region. The former mechanism would be consistent with the vertical profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and haze particles predicted in auroral-chemistry models (Wong et al., 2000; 2003). Retrievals of C2H2 and C2H6 were also performed and indicate C2H2 is enriched but C2H6 is depleted in auroral regions relative to quiescent regions. For example, using CIRS Delta(v) over tilde = 2.5 cm(-1) spectra, we determined that C2H2 at 0.98 mbar increases by 175.3 +/- 893 ppbv while C2H6 at 4.7 mbar decreases by 0.86 +/- 0.59 ppmv in comparing results at 70 degrees N, 180 degrees W and 70 degrees N, 60 degrees W. These results represent a mean of values retrieved from different initial assumptions and thus we believe they are robust. We believe these contrasts in C2H2 and C2H6 between auroral and quiescent regions can be explained by a coupling of auroral-driven chemistry and horizontal advection. Ion-neutral and electron recombination chemistry in the auroral region enriches all C-2 hydrocarbons but in particular, the unsaturated C2H2 and C2H4 hydrocarbons. Once advected outside of the auroral region, the unsaturated C-2 hydrocarbons are converted into C2H6 by neutral photochemistry thereby enriching C2H6 in quiescent regions, which gives the impression it is depleted inside the auroral region.

IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Flash flood guidance (FFG); flood warning; rainstorms; satellite precipitation; South China	MICROWAVE; RAINFALL; SCALES; TMPA	In the summer of 2016, severe storms caused serious casualties and destruction of facilities and properties over South China. Near-real-time (NRT) satellite precipitation products are attractive to rainstorm monitoring and flood warning guidance owing to its combination of timeliness, high spatiotemporal resolution, and broad coverage. We evaluate the performance of four NRT satellite products, i.e., Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, 3B42RT, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) NRT, and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Late run using a high-quality merged product in the rainy June over South China. In addition, a method based on an empirical flash flood guidance and the Flash Flood Potential Index is proposed to examine the applicability of satellite products in guiding flood warning. The IMERG Late run and GSMaP NRT perform the closest-to-ground observations. 3B42RT detects the most flood warning events due to its notable overestimation of actual precipitation. We recommend that the IMERG Late run is the best NRT satellite product in capturing flood hazard events according to the Pareto Efficiency of jointly optimizing higher hit ratio and lower false alarms.

Jeffrey			High Temperature Electronic and Thermal Transport Properties of EuGa2-x In (x) Sb-2	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						EuGa2Sb2; thermoelectric; zintl phase; semiconductor	LOCALIZATION FUNCTION; REPRESENTATION; CHEMISTRY	The Zintl phase EuGa2Sb2 was synthesized via ball milling followed by hot pressing. The crystal structure of EuGa2Sb2 is comprised of a 3-D network of polyanionic [Ga2Sb2](2-) tunnels filled with Eu cations that provide charge balance (Eu2+[Ga2Sb2](2-)). Here we report the temperature-dependent resistivity, Hall Effect, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity for EuGa2-x In (x) Sb-2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1) from 300 K to 775 K. Experimental results demonstrate that the material is a p-type semiconductor. However, a small band gap (similar to 0.1 eV) prevents EuGa2Sb2 from having high zT at higher temperatures. Isoelectronic substitution of In on the Ga site leads to point defect scattering of holes and phonons, thus reducing thermal conductivity and resulting in a slight improvement in zT.

Analysis of decade-long time series of GPS-based polar motion estimates at 15-min temporal resolution	JOURNAL OF GEODESY			English	Article						Earth's polar motion; Global Positioning System (GPS); Intra-daily; Ocean tides; Nutation	EARTH ROTATION; OCEANIC EXCITATION; TIDAL VARIATIONS; ATMOSPHERE; VLBI; PARAMETERS; NUTATIONS; PRECESSION; WOBBLE; SYSTEM	We present results from the generation of 10-year-long continuous time series of the Earth's polar motion at 15-min temporal resolution using Global Positioning System ground data. From our results, we infer an overall noise level in our high-rate polar motion time series of 60 (RMS). However, a spectral decomposition of our estimates indicates a noise floor of 4 at periods shorter than 2 days, which enables recovery of diurnal and semidiurnal tidally induced polar motion. We deliberately place no constraints on retrograde diurnal polar motion despite its inherent ambiguity with long-period nutation. With this approach, we are able to resolve damped manifestations of the effects of the diurnal ocean tides on retrograde polar motion. As such, our approach is at least capable of discriminating between a historical background nutation model that excludes the effects of the diurnal ocean tides and modern models that include those effects. To assess the quality of our polar motion solution outside of the retrograde diurnal frequency band, we focus on its capability to recover tidally driven and non-tidal variations manifesting at the ultra-rapid (intra-daily) and rapid (characterized by periods ranging from 2 to 20 days) periods. We find that our best estimates of diurnal and semidiurnal tidally induced polar motion result from an approach that adopts, at the observation level, a reasonable background model of these effects. We also demonstrate that our high-rate polar motion estimates yield similar results to daily-resolved polar motion estimates, and therefore do not compromise the ability to resolve polar motion at periods of 2-20 days.

These first in-situ measurements provide an important data set for assessing the radiation-associated health risks for future manned missions to Mars. Mainly, the radiation field on the Martian surface stems from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and secondary particles created by the GCRs' interactions with the Martian atmosphere and soil. RAD is capable of measuring differential particle fluxes for lower-energy ions and isotopes of hydrogen and helium (up to hundreds of MeV/nuc). Additionally, RAD also measures integral particle fluxes for higher energies of these ions. Besides providing insight on the current Martian radiation environment, these fluxes also present an essential input for particle transport codes that are used to model the radiation to be encountered during future manned missions to Mars. Comparing simulation results with actual ground-truth measurements helps to validate these transport codes and identify potential areas of improvements in the underlying physics of these codes. At the First Mars Radiation Modeling Workshop (June 2016 in Boulder, CO), different groups of modelers were asked to calculate the Martian surface radiation environment for the time of November 15, 2015 to January 15, 2016. These model results can then be compared with in-situ measurements of MSL/RAD conducted during the same time frame. In this publication, we focus on presenting the charged particle fluxes measured by RAD between November 15, 2015 and January 15, 2016, providing the necessary data set for the comparison to model outputs from the modeling workshop. We also compare the fluxes to initial GCR intensities, as well as to RAD measurements from an earlier time period (August 2012 to January 2013). Furthermore, we describe how changes and updates in RAD on board processing and the on ground analysis tools effect and improve the flux calculations. An in-depth comparison of modeling results from the workshop and RAD fluxes of this publication is presented elsewhere in this issue (Matthia et al., 2017).

Measurements of the neutral particle spectra on Mars by MSL/RAD from 2015-11-15 to 2016-01-15	LIFE SCIENCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						MSL; Martian radiation environment; Galactic cosmic rays; Neutron detection; Inversion technique	RADIATION ASSESSMENT DETECTOR; SURFACE; ODYSSEY; RAD	The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD), onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity, has been measuring the energetic charged and neutral particles and the radiation dose rate on the surface of Mars since the landing of the rover in August 2012. In contrast to charged particles, neutral particles (neutrons and.-rays) are measured indirectly: the energy deposition spectra produced by neutral particles are complex convolutions of the incident particle spectra with the detector response functions. An inversion technique has been developed and applied to jointly unfold the deposited energy spectra measured in two scintillators of different types (CsI for high. detection efficiency, and plastic for neutrons) to obtain the neutron and gamma-ray spectra. This result is important for determining the biological impact of the Martian surface radiation contributed by neutrons, which interact with materials differently from the charged particles. These first in-situ measurements on Mars provide (1) an important reference for assessing the radiation-associated health risks for future manned missions to the red planet and (2) an experimental input for validating the particle transport codes used to model the radiation environments within spacecraft or on the surface of planets. Here we present neutral particle spectra as well as the corresponding dose and dose equivalent rates derived from RAD measurement during a period (November 15, 2015 to January 15, 2016) for which the surface particle spectra have been simulated via different transport models.

Partitioning the relative contributions of organic matter and mineral sediment to accretion rates in carbonate platform mangrove soils	MARINE GEOLOGY			English	Article						Mangroves; Coastal wetlands; Accretion; Sedimentation; Soils; Pb-210	SEA-LEVEL RISE; FLORIDA COASTAL EVERGLADES; GULF-OF-MEXICO; VERTICAL ACCRETION; MARSH; ELEVATION; FORESTS; WETLAND; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT	In coming decades, the global rate of sea-level rise (SLR) is projected to accelerate beyond rates observed over the past several millennia when mangrove wetlands have expanded in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. There is substantial uncertainty about how distinct mangrove ecotypes inhabiting a wide range of geomorphic settings will respond to SLR acceleration, including the thresholds at which they will submerge permanently. In this study, the relative contributions of soil organic and inorganic matter (SOM and SIM) to Pb-210-derived accretion rates were examined at 23 mangrove sites in southwest Florida, USA and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. These sites are situated atop carbonate platforms where there is wide variation in the availability of SIM (generally marine marl). To account for this variability, research sites were classified by SIM presence based on the SOM content (%) estimated using loss-on-ignition: organic sites (SOM > 70%), intermediate sites (SOM = 40-70%) and mineral sites (SOM < 40%). SOM accumulation rates were largely the same in the three soil classes during the past century (p < 0.05); however, SIM accumulation rates in the intermediate and mineral sites were approximately 5 and 20 times greater, respectively, than rates in the organic sites. Despite this substantial difference in total mass accumulation rates, accretion rates were not statistically different between soil classes (p < 0.05). Our analysis revealed that the rate of SOM accumulation is the best predictor of accretion rates, while the rate of SIM accumulation primarily predicts soil dry bulk density. These findings indicate that SOM and SIM do not contribute additively to soil volume. This is contrary to findings from North American coastal wetlands broadly, suggesting a unique characteristic of carbonate platform mangrove soils that lack a regular, substantive supply of terrigenous SIM. Overall, accretion rates in the FL sites and a Yucatan site on the Caribbean Sea are maintaining pace with regional rates of SLR over the past 100-year and 50-year timespans, whereas the sites in Celestun Lagoon, MX (located on the Gulf of Mexico) exhibit an accretion deficit. Estimates of regional SLR rates range from 4.6 to 12.2 mm yr-1 by the year 2060. Based on accretion rates observed in the past century, some of these sites may be able to keep pace with the lower SLR estimate, but there is no evidence that any of these sites can match the higher rate.

CLASH observed 25 massive galaxy cluster cores with the Hubble Space Telescope in 16 filters spanning 0.2-1.7 mu m. Photometry in such crowded fields is challenging. Compared to our previously released catalogues, we make several improvements to the photometry, including smaller apertures, intracluster light subtraction, point spread function matching and empirically measured uncertainties. We further improve the Bayesian photometric redshift estimates by adding a redder elliptical template and by inflating the photometric uncertainties of the brightest galaxies. The resulting photometric redshift accuracies are dz/(1+z) similar to 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 per cent for galaxies with I-band F814W AB magnitudes < 18, 20 and 23, respectively. These results are consistent with our expectations. They improve on our previously reported accuracies by a factor of 4 at the bright end and a factor of 2 at the faint end. Our new catalogue includes 1257 spectroscopic redshifts, including 382 confirmed cluster members. We also provide stellar mass estimates. Finally, we include lensing magnification estimates of background galaxies based on our public lens models. Our new catalogue of all 25 CLASH clusters is available via Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. The analysis techniques developed here will be useful in other surveys of crowded fields, including the Frontier Fields and surveys carried out with Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerated Universe Astrophysical Survey and James Webb Space Telescope.

Photometric redshifts and clustering of emission line galaxies selected jointly by DES and eBOSS	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						surveys; cosmology: observations	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; DATA RELEASE; STELLAR MASS; SDSS; SPECTRA; DEEP; DEPENDENCE; VARIANCE; ERRORS; MODEL	We present the results of the first observations of the emission line galaxies (ELG) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. From the total 9000 targets, 4600 have been selected from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). In this subsample, the total success rate for redshifts between 0.6 and 1.2 is 71 and 68 per cent for a bright and a faint samples, respectively, including redshifts measured from a single strong emission line. The mean redshift is 0.80 for the bright and 0.87 for the faint sample, while the percentage of unknown redshifts is 15 and 13 per cent, respectively. In both cases, the star contamination is lower than 2 per cent. We evaluate how well the ELG redshifts are measured using the target selection photometry and validating with the spectroscopic redshifts measured by eBOSS. We explore different techniques to reduce the photometric redshift outliers fraction with a comparison between the template fitting, the neural networks and the random forest methods. Finally, we study the clustering properties of the DES SVA1 ELG samples. We select only the most secure spectroscopic redshift in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.2, leading to a mean redshift for the bright and faint sample of 0.85 and 0.90, respectively. We measure the projected angular correlation function and obtain a galaxy bias averaging on scales from 1 to 10 Mpc h(-1) of 1.58 +/- 0.10 for the bright sample and 1.65 +/- 0.12 for the faint sample. These values are representative of a galaxy population with M-B - log(h) < -20.5, in agreement with what we measure by fitting galaxy templates to the photometric data.	[Jouvel, S.; Abdalla, F.

Previous observations have detected overdensities of companion submillimetre-selected sources around 10 Hot DOGs and 30 WISE/radio AGNs, with overdensities of similar to 2-3 and similar to 5-6, respectively. We find that the space densities in both samples to be overdense compared to normal star-forming galaxies and submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) in the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS). Both samples of companion sources have consistent mid-infrared (mid-IR) colours and mid-IR to submm ratios as SMGs. The brighter population around WISE/radio AGNs could be responsible for the higher overdensity reported. We also find that the star formation rate densities are higher than the field, but consistent with clusters of dusty galaxies. WISE-selected AGNs appear to be good signposts for protoclusters at high redshift on arcmin scales. The results reported here provide an upper limit to the strength of angular clustering using the two-point correlation function. Monte Carlo simulations show no angular correlation, which could indicate protoclusters on scales larger than the SCUBA-2 1.5-arcmin scale maps.

DES Collaboration	Weak-lensing mass calibration of redMaPPer galaxy clusters in Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations	PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; HALO-MASS; X-RAY; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; SHEAR; MODEL; VARIANCE; GIANTS; BIAS; SPT	We use weak-lensing shear measurements to determine the mean mass of optically selected galaxy clusters in Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data. In a blinded analysis, we split the sample of more than 8000 redMaPPer clusters into 15 subsets, spanning ranges in the richness parameter 5 <= lambda <= 180 and redshift 0.2 <= z <= 0.8, and fit the averaged mass density contrast profiles with a model that accounts for seven distinct sources of systematic uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors; cluster-member contamination; miscentring; deviations from the NFW halo profile; halo triaxiality and line-of-sight projections. We combine the inferred cluster masses to estimate the joint scaling relation between mass, richness and redshift, M(lambda, z). M-0 lambda(F) (1 + z)(G). We find M-0 equivalent to M-200m vertical bar lambda = 30, z = 0.5 = [2.35 +/- 0.22 (stat) +/- 0.12 (sys)] x 10(14) M circle dot, with F = 1.12 +/- 0.20 (stat) +/- 0.06 (sys) and G = 0.18 +/- 0.75 (stat) +/- 0.24 (sys). The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is in excellent agreement with the weak-lensing calibration of redMaPPer clusters in SDSS by Simet et al. and with the Saro et al. calibration based on abundance matching of SPT-detected clusters. Our results extend the redshift range over which the mass-richness relation of redMaPPer clusters has been calibrated with weak lensing from z <= 0.3 to z <= 0.8. Calibration uncertainties of shear measurements and photometric redshift estimates dominate our systematic error budget and require substantial improvements for forthcoming studies.

The samples will be individually encapsulated and sealed in sample tubes. Each sample, and therefore each sample tube, must be kept clean of viable organisms with a terrestrial origin, which may adhere to the rover on their own and/or on other abiological particles. It is shown that contamination of the tubes by such terrestrial remnant particles as small as 0.15 mu m on the rover will be prevented using the Fluid Mechanical Particle Barrier (FMPB), a cylindrical enclosure within which each tube will be housed. The FMPB takes advantage of fluid viscosity to slow down the speed of the flow through a main thin annular orifice at the bottom of the device. An analytical solution of the fluid and particle dynamics in the FMPB has been developed and validated using 2-D and 3-D CFD simulations. Water tunnel tests have also been conducted that demonstrate the effectiveness of the FMPB to slow down the fluid through the orifice. It is found that for the flow speeds expected at the various phases of the mission, penetration of the smallest particles is not expected to exceed 10% of the orifice height. No penetration of particles >5 mu m is expected inside the orifice. Large margins on the already low contamination probability of the tubes are allowed by the presence of a large-volume cavity immediately downstream of the long annular orifice. The cavity further slows down the expanding flow and, in turn, minimizes particle penetration even at the most extreme conditions expected on Mars, For example at wind speeds of 75 m/s, characteristic of the largest and rarest dust devils that can form on Mars, 0.15-mu m particles are not expected to exceed a height larger than 3% of the cavity.

Prevalence of sucretolerant bacteria in common soils and their isolation and characterization	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Bacteria; Extremophiles; Halotolerance; Hypersaline; Soil; Sucretolerance; Sugar	NONSALINE FOREST SOIL; HIGH-SUGAR PRODUCTS; WATER ACTIVITY; FLORAL NECTAR; SP NOV.; OSMOTOLERANT YEASTS; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; GEN. NOV.; DIVERSITY; MARS	Sucretolerant microbes grow in the presence of sugar concentrations high enough to substantially lower water activities. Natural habitats high in sugars are mainly limited to dried fruit, floral nectar, honey, sugarcane, and associated soils. Organisms that tolerate extremes of solute concentration, high enough to lower water activities, might not be expected in common oligoosmotic soils. We report on the isolation of sucretolerant bacteria from common soils using media supplemented with 50% sucrose (a (w) 0.91) and their physiological characterization and identification by 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. Fifteen of these sucretolerant isolates from common soils were related to four Bacillus spp. A Lysinibacillus and a Microbacterium (actinomycete) also were collected. All grew at 50% sucrose and 13 grew at 60% sucrose. Most probable number counts were used to determine the abundance of sucretolerant microbes in several common soil types, including agricultural, managed turf, and native prairie. Microbial abundance (with fungicides) was about 10(5) and 10(3) cells g(-1) soil in media containing 50 or 70% sucrose, respectively. The abundances of sucretolerant bacteria in common soils mirror those of halotolerant bacteria that grow at 10 and 20% NaCl. However, there is not a correlation between halotolerance and sucretolerance in our isolates, nor can predictions be made based on taxonomy. Specific solute effects may be at work, rather than biological responses to a single physicochemical parameter such as a (w). The occurrence of spore-forming sucretolerant bacteria in common soils has relevance to forward planetary protection and astrobiology. Extraterrestrial habitable regions are defined in part by tolerance to high solute concentrations and osmotolerant soil microbes may contaminate spacecraft.

J	Balint, TS; Freeman, A				Balint, Tibor S.; Freeman, Anthony			Designing the design at JPL'S innovation foundary	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article								NASA is a dynamic and living organization. Looking at it through the optics of cybernetics, we can describe it as an autopoietic system. It has to sustain itself, and compete successfully to be viable. Its organizational elements have to interact with the broader environment by maintaining and improving its processes that generate the means for future sustainability. It also needs to bring up follow-on generations who are not simply aligning with the status quo, but also improve the system's viability. For government-run programs, organizational, programmatic and project management practices are often rigidly linear. They can be characterized as observed first-order cybernetic systems, where the paradigm is bound by well-established requirements. At the implementation level this does not readily accommodate flexibility and change. To address this, broadening the system's worldview is needed from the strategic level. This corresponds to an observing second-order cybernetic system, where strategic leadership can overwrite the rules of a first-order system. Changing the worldview of an organization can be complex and face much resistance. Still, with the appropriate strategic-level support, it can be achieved by introducing novel languages, new perspectives, and adding new disciplines to existing ones. In effect, this helps to broaden the organizational paradigm, and subsequently influence its mission, impact the culture, and open up its core processes. These changes can be effectively introduced through design conversations in the early formulation stages, when new ideas are conceived. Within NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, early-stage concept developments are performed at a specially formulated environment, called the Innovation Foundry. Within this office, a continuous effort is being made on designing the design processes, which helps to broaden the variety of the option trades. It is achieved by an added focus on conversations and the inclusion of non-engineering disciplines, such as industrial and graphic design, human centered design, and even art. Communicating the information more effectively through conversations and symbolic means benefits from the skills of human centered designers and artists. In this paper we will discuss how design is being designed at JPL's Innovation Foundry, by focusing on novel languages, storytelling, conversations, boundary objects in support of improved communications both externally to stakeholders and sponsors, and internally within the design teams. We will also highlight how these new design driven approaches provide a strategic strength for the organization when competing for funding in a resource constrained environment.

High velocity penetrators used a potential means for attaining core sample C) for airless solar system objects	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Penetrator Sample return; Subsurface sample; Asteroids	MISSION; RETURN	Sample return missions offer a greater science yield when compared to missions that only employ in situ or remote sensing observations. Such missions have high AV requirements, and the return yields to date have been typically only of a few grams for robotic missions. Planetary penetrators offer an alternative that significantly reduce a mission's AV, increase sample yields, and allow for the collection of subsurface materials. The following details the design, development, and testing of penetrator/sampler technology capable of surviving supersonic impact velocities that would enable the collection of a solid core of geologic materials, without the need for any drilling equipment thereby reducing the overall mass and propellant budget. It is shown through both modeling and field testing that penetrators at speeds between 300 and 600 m/s ( Mach 1-2) can penetrate into the ground to depths of 1-2 m with overall structural integrity maintained. The first flight tests demonstrated the potential for survivability at these speeds. The second flight series demonstrated core sample collection with partial ejection of the sample return canister. The 3rd flight series demonstrated self -ejection of the sample return system fully intact and with the core retaining the full stratigraphy of the rock bed. The recovered sample also shows the survivability of macro -organic structures. Possible mechanisms for the recovery of the ejected core sample are also discussed.	[Winglee, R.

Mapping wheat nitrogen uptake from RapidEye vegetation indices	PRECISION AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Wheat remote sensing; RapidEye; Normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE); Nitrogen content; Nitrogen-use efficiency	CANOPY CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT; LEAF-AREA INDEX; PHOTOCHEMICAL REFLECTANCE INDEX; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; GREEN LAI; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; REMOTE ESTIMATION; SPOT-VEGETATION; PLANT STRESS; BROAD-BAND	Mapping wheat nitrogen (N) uptake at 5 m spatial resolution could provide growers with new insights regarding nitrogen-use efficiency at the field scale. This study explored the use of spectral information from high resolution (5 x 5 m) RapidEye satellite data at peak leaf area index (LAI) to estimate end-of-season cumulative N uptake of wheat (Triticum spp.) in a heterogeneous, rainfed system. The primary objectives were to evaluate the usefulness of simple, widely used vegetation indices (VIs) from RapidEye as a tool to map crop N uptake over three growing seasons, farms and growing conditions, and to examine the usefulness of remotely sensed N uptake maps for precision agriculture applications. Data on harvested wheat N was collected at twelve plots over three seasons at four farms in the Palouse region of Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington. Seventeen commonly used spectral VIs were computed for images collected during 'peak greenness' (maximum LAI) to determine which VIs would be most appropriate for estimating wheat N uptake at harvest. The normalized difference red-edge index was the top performing VI, explaining 81 % of the variance in wheat N uptake with a regression slope of 1.06 and RMSE of 15.94 kg/ha. Model performance was strong across all farms over all three seasons regardless of crop variety, allowing the creation of high accuracy wheat N uptake maps. In conclusion, for this particular agro-ecosystem, mid-season VIs that incorporate the use of the NIR and red-edge bands are generally better predictors of end-of-season crop N uptake than VIs that do not include these bands, thereby further enabling their use in precision agriculture applications.

An Estimation of the Levels of Stabilized Criegee Intermediates in the UK Urban and Rural Atmosphere Using the Steady-State Approximation and the Potential Effects of These Intermediates on Tropospheric Oxidation Cycles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL KINETICS			English	Article							CONFORMER-DEPENDENT REACTIVITY; DIRECT KINETIC MEASUREMENTS; ORGANIC AEROSOL FORMATION; GAS-PHASE OZONOLYSIS; CH2OO REACTIONS; GLOBAL-MODEL; OZONE; SO2; ACID; H2O	Levels of the stabilized Criegee Intermediate (sCI), produced via the ozonolysis of unsaturated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were estimated at two London urban sites (Marylebone Road and Eltham) and one rural site (Harwell) in the UK over the period of 1998-2012. The steady-state approximation was applied to data obtained from the NETCEN (National Environmental Technology Centre) database, and the levels of annual average sCI were estimated to be in the range of 30-3000 molecules cm(-3) for UK sites. A consistent diurnal cycle of sCI concentration is estimated for the UK sites with increasing levels during daylight hours, peaking just after midday. The seasonal pattern of sCI shows higher levels in spring with peaks around May due to the higher levels of O-3. The ozone weekend effect resulted in higher sCI in UK urban areas during weekend. The sCI data were modeled using the information provided by the Air Quality Improvement Research Program (AQIRP) and found that the modeled production was five- to six-fold higher than our estimated data, and therefore the estimated sCI concentrations in this study are thought to be lower estimates only. Compared with nighttime, 1.3- to 1.8-fold higher sCI exists under daytime conditions. Using the levels of sCI estimated at Marylebone Road, globally the oxidation rates of NO2 + sCI (22.4 Gg/yr) and SO2 + sCI (37.6 Gg/yr) in urban areas can increase their effect in the troposphere and potentially further alter the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. Further investigations of modeled sCI show that CH3CHOO (64%) and CH2OO (13%) are dominant among all contributing sCI at the UK sites.	[Khan, M.

MSL Sci Team	Multiple stages of aqueous alteration along fractures in mudstone and sandstone strata in Gale Crater, Mars	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; mineralogy; geochemistry; Curiosity rover; aqueous alteration	DISSOLUTION; PH; INSTRUMENT; SOLUBILITY; MINERALOGY; SOILS; ROCKS	The Mars rover Curiosity in Gale crater conducted the first-ever direct chemical and mineralogical comparisons of samples that have clear parent (unaltered) and daughter (altered) relationships. The mineralogy and chemistry of samples within and adjacent to alteration halos in a sandstone formation were established by the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument and the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), respectively. The Stimson formation sandstones unconformably overlie the Murray mudstone formation and represent the youngest stratigraphic unit explored by Curiosity to date. Aqueous alteration of the parent sandstone resulted in a loss of half of the original crystalline mineral phases and a three-fold increase in X-ray amorphous material. Aqueous fluids extensively leached Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn and other elements from the parent material, decreased the pyroxene to feldspar ratio by a factor of two, introduced Ca and mixed-cation sulfates, and both passively and actively enriched the silica content. Leaching of Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn and enrichment of Si and S are also observed in alteration halos in the underlying mudstone. These observations are consistent with infiltration of subsurface fluids, initially acidic and then alkaline, propagating along fractures crosscutting the Stimson sandstone and Murray mudstone. The geochemistry and mineralogy suggest a complicated diagenetic history with multiple stages of aqueous alteration under a variety of environmental conditions (e.g. both low and moderate pH). The formation of these alteration halos post-dates lithification of the sandstones and mudstones and represents one of the youngest hydrogeologic events presently known to have occurred in Gale crater.

Aerosols optical properties in Titan's detached haze layer before the equinox	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Atmosphere; Aerosols	JOVIAN PLANETS; ATMOSPHERE; SPECTROPHOTOMETRY; MESOSPHERE; METHANE; ORIGIN; SATURN; MODEL; SIZE; GCM	UV observations with Cassini ISS Narrow Angle Camera of Titan's detached haze is an excellent tool to probe its aerosols content without being affected by the gas or the multiple scattering. Unfortunately, its low extent in altitude requires a high resolution calibration and limits the number of images available in the Cassini dataset. However, we show that it is possible to extract on each profile the local maximum of intensity of this layer and confirm its stability at 500 +/- 8 km during the 2005-2007 period for all latitudes lower than 45 degrees N. Using the fractal aggregate scattering model of Tomasko et al. (2008) and a single scattering radiative transfer model, it is possible to derive the optical properties required to explain the observations made at different phase angles. Our results indicates that the aerosols have at least ten monomers of 60 nm radius, while the typical tangential column number density is about 2 . 10(10) agg m(-2). Moreover, we demonstrate that these properties are constant within the error bars in the southern hemisphere of Titan over the observed time period. In the northern hemisphere, the size of the aerosols tends to decrease relatively to the southern hemisphere and is associated with a higher tangential opacity. However, the lower number of observations available in this region due to the orbital constraints is a limiting factor in the accuracy of these results. Assuming a fixed homogeneous content we notice that the tangential opacity can fluctuate up to a factor 3 among the observations at the equator. These variations could be linked with short scale temporal and/or longitudinal events changing the local density of the layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thermal properties and an improved shape model for near-Earth asteroid (162421) 2000 ET70	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; surfaces; Asteroids; rotation; Infrared observations; Radar observations; Spectroscopy	PHYSICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; 1 CERES; PHOTOMETRY; MAGNITUDE; SYSTEM; SPEX	We present thermal properties and an improved shape model for potentially hazardous asteroid (162421) 2000 ET70. In addition to the radar data from 2000 ET70's apparition in 2012, our model incorporates optical lightcurves and infrared spectra that were not included in the analysis of Naidu et al. (2013, Icarus 226, 323-335). We confirm the general "clenched fist" appearance of the Naidu et al. model, but compared to their model, our best-fit model is about 10% longer along its long principal axis, nearly identical along the intermediate axis, and about 25% shorter along the short axis. We find the asteroid's dimensions to be 2.9 km x 2.2 km x 1.5 km (with relative uncertainties of about 10%, 15%, and 25%, respectively). With the available data, 2000 ET70's period and pole position are degenerate with each other. The radar and lightcurve data together constrain the pole direction to fall along an arc that is about twenty-three degrees long and eight degrees wide. Infrared spectra from the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) provide an additional constraint on the pole. Thermophysical modeling, using our SHERMAN software, shows that only a subset of the pole directions, about twelve degrees of that arc, are compatible with the infrared data. Using all of the available data, we find that 2000 ET70 has a sidereal rotation period of 8.944 h (+/- 0.009 h) and a north pole direction of ecliptic coordinates (52 degrees,-60 degrees) +/- 6 degrees. The infrared data, acquired over several dates, require that the thermal properties (albedo, thermal inertia, surface roughness) must change across the asteroid's surface. By incorporating the detailed shape model and spin state into our thermal modeling, the multiple ground-based observations at different viewing geometries have allowed us to constrain the levels of the variations in the surface properties of this asteroid.

Simulating a BBH coalescence by solving Einstein's equations numerically is computationally expensive, requiring days to months of computing resources for a single set of parameter values. Since theoretical predictions of the GWs are often needed for many different source parameters, a fast and accurate model is essential. We present the first surrogate model for GWs from the coalescence of BBHs including all seven dimensions of the intrinsic noneccentric parameter space. The surrogate model, which we call NRSur7dq2, is built from the results of 744 numerical relativity simulations. NRSur7dq2 covers spin magnitudes up to 0.8 and mass ratios up to 2, includes all l <= 4 modes, begins about 20 orbits before merger, and can be evaluated in similar to 50 ms. We find the largest NRSur7dq2 errors to be comparable to the largest errors in the numerical relativity simulations, and more than an order of magnitude smaller than the errors of other waveform models. Our model, and more broadly the methods developed here, will enable studies that were not previously possible when using highly accurate waveforms, such as parameter inference and tests of general relativity with GW observations.

Here we test the reported uncertainties of version 7 OCO-2 XCO2 measurements by examining variations of the XCO2 measurements and their calculated uncertainties within small regions (similar to 100 km x 10.5 km) in which natural CO2 variability is expected to be small relative to variations imparted by noise or interferences. Over 39 000 of these "small neighborhoods" comprised of approximately 190 observations per neighborhood are used for this analysis. We find that a typical ocean measurement has a precision and accuracy of 0.35 and 0.24 ppm respectively for calculated precisions larger than similar to 0.25 ppm. These values are approximately consistent with the calculated errors of 0.33 and 0.14 ppm for the noise and interference error, assuming that the accuracy is bounded by the calculated interference error. The actual precision for ocean data becomes worse as the signal-to-noise increases or the calculated precision decreases below 0.25 ppm for reasons that are not well understood. A typical land measurement, both nadir and glint, is found to have a precision and accuracy of approximately 0.75 and 0.65 ppm respectively as compared to the calculated precision and accuracy of approximately 0.36 and 0.2 ppm. The differences in accuracy between ocean and land suggests that the accuracy of XCO2 data is likely related to interferences such as aerosols or surface albedo as they vary less over ocean than land. The accuracy as derived here is also likely a lower bound as it does not account for possible systematic biases between the regions used in this analysis.

The 90 degrees orbit inclination and 4163 km periapsis altitude provide the first opportunity to explore Jupiter's polar magnetosphere. A radio and plasma wave instrument on Juno called Waves provided a new view of Jupiter's auroral radio emissions from near 10 kHz to similar to 30 MHz. This frequency range covers the classically named decametric, hectometric, and broadband kilometric radio emissions, and Juno observations showed much of this entire spectrum to consist of V-shaped emissions in frequency-time space with intensified vertices located very close to the electron cyclotron frequency. The proximity of the radio emissions to the cyclotron frequency along with loss cone features in the energetic electron distribution strongly suggests that Juno passed very close to, if not through, one or more of the cyclotron maser instability sources thought to be responsible for Jupiter's auroral radio emissions.

Plasma measurements in the Jovian polar region with Juno/JADE	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PARALLEL ELECTRIC-FIELDS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; MIDDLE MAGNETOSPHERE; ALIGNED CURRENTS; FLUXES; IO; JUPITER; AURORA; ENVIRONMENT; PARTICLES	Jupiter's main auroral oval provides a window into the complex magnetospheric dynamics of the Jovian system. The Juno spacecraft entered orbit about Jupiter on 5 July 2016 and carries on board the Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) that can directly sample the auroral plasma structures. Here we identify five distinct regimes in the JADE data based on composition/energy boundaries and magnetic field mappings, which exhibit considerable symmetry between the northern and southern passes. These intervals correspond to periods when Juno was connected to the Io torus, inner plasma sheet, middle plasma sheet, outer plasma sheet, and the polar region. When connected to the torus and inner plasma sheet, the heavy ions are consistent with a corotating pickup population. For Juno's first perijove, we do not find evidence for a broad auroral acceleration region at Jupiter's main auroral oval for energies below 100 keV.	[Szalay, J.

Electron beams and loss cones in the auroral regions of Jupiter	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MAGNETOSPHERE	We report on the first observations of 100 eV to 100 keV electrons over the auroral regions of Jupiter by the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) on board the Juno mission. The focus is on the regions that were magnetically connected to the main auroral oval. Amongst the most remarkable features, JADE observed electron beams, mostly upward going but also some downward going in the south, at latitudes from similar to 69 degrees to 72 degrees and similar to -66 degrees to -70 degrees corresponding to M shells ("M" for magnetic) from similar to 18 to 54 and similar to 28 to 61, respectively. The beams were replaced by upward loss cones at lower latitudes. There was no evidence of strongly accelerated downward electrons analogous to the auroral "inverted Vs" at Earth. Rather, the presence of upward loss cones suggests a diffuse aurora process. The energy spectra resemble tails of distributions or power laws (suggestive of a stochastic acceleration process) but can also have some clear enhancements or even peaks generally between 1 and 10 keV. Electron intensities change on timescales of a second or less at times implying that auroral structures can be of the order of a few tens of kilometers.	[Allegrini, F.; Bolton, S.; Ebert, R.

Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt expansion and thermal wave activity ahead of Juno's arrival	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							5-MICRON HOT-SPOTS; SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; TIME-DEPENDENCE; ATMOSPHERE; CASSINI; TEMPERATURES; CLOUDS; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS	The dark colors of Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB, 7-17 degrees N) appeared to expand northward into the neighboring zone in 2015, consistent with a 3-5 year cycle. Inversions of thermal-IR imaging from the Very Large Telescope revealed a moderate warming and reduction of aerosol opacity at the cloud tops at 17-20 degrees N, suggesting subsidence and drying in the expanded sector. Two new thermal waves were identified during this period: (i) an upper tropospheric thermal wave (wave number 16-17, amplitude 2.5 K at 170 mbar) in the mid-NEB that was anticorrelated with haze reflectivity; and (ii) a stratospheric wave (wave number 13-14, amplitude 7.3 K at 5 mbar) at 20-30 degrees N. Both were quasi-stationary, confined to regions of eastward zonal flow, and are morphologically similar to waves observed during previous expansion events. Plain Language Summary A campaign of Earth-based support imaging for NASA's Juno mission identified several interesting atmospheric phenomena at work in Jupiter's northern hemisphere. The prominent dark brown belt north of the equator expanded northward, potentially spawning wave activity throughout the troposphere and stratosphere. Unlike previous cyclic events on Jupiter (these expansions occur once every 3-5 years), the 2015/2016 expansion stalled and did not reach completion, but the waves were evident throughout 2016 ahead of Juno's arrival in orbit around Jupiter. Such Earth-based supporting observations help set the environmental context for Juno's close-up observations of the giant planet.	[Fletcher, L.

Here we study the quasi-cyclic behavior of the similar to 40 km(2) Lake Tininnilik in west Greenland and its impact on ice flow and crustal deformation. Data reveal rapid drainage of 1.83 +/- 0.17 km(3) of water in less than 7 days in 2010, leading to a speedup of the damming glacier, and an instantaneous modeled elastic bedrock uplift of 18.6 +/- 0.1 mm confirmed by an independent lakeside GPS record. Since ice-dammed lakes are common on Greenland, our results highlight the importance of including other sources of surface loading in addition to ice mass change, when assessing glacial isostatic adjustment or elastic rebound using geodetic data. Moreover, the results illustrates a linkage between subglacial discharge and ice surface velocity, important for assessing ice flux, and thus mass balance, in a future warming climate.

Evaluating hourly rainfall characteristics over the US Great Plains in dynamically downscaled climate model simulations using NASA-Unified WRF	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CONVECTIVE PARAMETERIZATION; INTENSE PRECIPITATION; RESOLUTION; ENSEMBLE; MICROPHYSICS; STATISTICS; TRENDS	Accurate simulation of extreme precipitation events remains a challenge in climate models. This study utilizes hourly precipitation data from ground stations and satellite instruments to evaluate rainfall characteristics simulated by the NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) regional climate model at horizontal resolutions of 4, 12, and 24 km over the Great Plains of the United States. We also examined the sensitivity of the simulated precipitation to different spectral nudging approaches and the cumulus parameterizations. The rainfall characteristics in the observations and simulations were defined as an hourly diurnal cycle of precipitation and a joint probability distribution function (JPDF) between duration and peak intensity of precipitation events over the Great Plains in summer. We calculated a JPDF for each data set and the overlapping area between observed and simulated JPDFs to measure the similarity between the two JPDFs. Comparison of the diurnal precipitation cycles between observations and simulations does not reveal the added value of high-resolution simulations. However, the performance of NU-WRF simulations measured by the JPDF metric strongly depends on horizontal resolution. The simulation with the highest resolution of 4 km shows the best agreement with the observations in simulating duration and intensity of wet spells. Spectral nudging does not affect the JPDF significantly. The effect of cumulus parameterizations on the JPDFs is considerable but smaller than that of horizontal resolution. The simulations with lower resolutions of 12 and 24 km show reasonable agreement but only with the high-resolution observational data that are aggregated into coarse resolution and spatially averaged.

Interestingly, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) multiscale modeling framework (MMF), whose warm-rain formation process is more realistic than other global models, has the opposite problem: the rain formation process in PNNL-MMF is less efficient than the real world. To better understand the microphysical processes in warm cloud, this study documents the model biases in PNNL-MMF and evaluates warm cloud properties, subgrid variability, and microphysics, using A-Train satellite observations to identify sources of model biases in PNNL-MMF. Like other models PNNL-MMF underpredicts the warm cloud fraction with compensating large optical depths. Associated with these compensating errors in cloudiness are compensating errors in the precipitation process. For a given liquid water path, clouds in the PNNL-MMF are less likely to produce rain than are real-world clouds. However, when the model does produce rain it is able to produce stronger precipitation than reality. As a result PNNL-MMF produces about the correct mean rain rate with an incorrect distribution of rates. The subgrid variability in PNNL-MMF is also tested, and results are fairly consistent with observations, suggesting that the possible sources of model biases are likely to be due to errors in its microphysics or dynamics rather than errors in the subgrid-scale variability produced by the embedded cloud resolving model.

We show that global continuous maps of XCO2 (corresponding to level 3 of the satellite data) at daily or coarser temporal resolution can be inferred from these data with a Kalman filter built on a model of persistence. Our application of this approach on 2 years of OCO-2 retrievals indicates that the filter provides better information than a climatology of XCO2 at both daily and monthly scales. Provided that the assigned observation uncertainty statistics are tuned in each grid cell of the XCO2 maps from an objective method (based on consistency diagnostics), the errors predicted by the filter at daily and monthly scales represent the true error statistics reasonably well, except for a bias in the high latitudes of the winter hemisphere and a lack of resolution (i.e., a too small discrimination skill) of the predicted error standard deviations. Due to the sparse satellite sampling, the broad-scale patterns of XCO2 described by the filter seem to lag behind the real signals by a few weeks. Finally, the filter offers interesting insights into the quality of the retrievals, both in terms of random and systematic errors.

We present a new 12-year record of geostrophic currents at monthly resolution in the ice-covered and ice-free Arctic Ocean derived from satellite radar altimetry and characterise their seasonal to decadal variability from 2003 to 2014, a period of rapid environmental change in the Arctic. Geostrophic currents around the Arctic basin increased in the late 2000s, with the largest increases observed in summer. Currents in the southeastern Beaufort Gyre accelerated in late 2007 with higher current speeds sustained until 2011, after which they decreased to speeds representative of the period 2003-2006. The strength of the north-westward current in the southwest Beaufort Gyre more than doubled between 2003 and 2014. This pattern of changing currents is linked to shifting of the gyre circulation to the northwest during the time period. The Beaufort Gyre circulation and Fram Strait current are strongest in winter, modulated by the seasonal strength of the atmospheric circulation. We find high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) congruent with features of the seafloor bathymetry that are greater in winter than summer, and estimates of EKE and eddy diffusivity in the Beaufort Sea are consistent with those predicted from theoretical considerations. The variability of Arctic Ocean geostrophic circulation highlights the interplay between seasonally variable atmospheric forcing and ice conditions, on a backdrop of long-term changes to the Arctic sea ice-ocean system. Studies point to various mechanisms influencing the observed increase in Arctic Ocean surface stress, and hence geostrophic currents, in the 2000s - e.g. decreased ice concentration/thickness, changing atmospheric forcing, changing ice pack morphology; however, more work is needed to refine the representation of atmosphere-ice-ocean coupling in models before we can fully attribute causality to these increases.

We use the total columns and profiles from seven FTIR sites in the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) to validate the satellite data products. The overall FTIR and CrIS total columns have a positive correlation of r = 0.77 (N = 218) with very little bias (a slope of 1.02). Binning the comparisons by total column amounts, for concentrations larger than 1.0 x 10(16) molecules cm(-2), i.e. ranging from moderate to polluted conditions, the relative difference is on average similar to 0-5% with a standard deviation of 25-50 %, which is comparable to the estimated retrieval uncertainties in both CrIS and the FTIR. For the smallest total column range (< 1.0x x 10(16) molecules cm(-2)) where there are a large number of observations at or near the CrIS noise level (detection limit) the absolute differences between CrIS and the FTIR total columns show a slight positive column bias. The CrIS and FTIR profile comparison differences are mostly within the range of the single-level retrieved profile values from estimated retrieval uncertainties, showing average differences in the range of similar to 20 to 40 %. The CrIS retrievals typically show good vertical sensitivity down into the boundary layer which typically peaks at similar to 850 hPa (similar to 1.5 km). At this level the median absolute difference is 0.87 (std = +/- 0.08) ppb, corresponding to a median relative difference of 39%(std = +/- 2 %). Most of the absolute and relative profile comparison differences are in the range of the estimated retrieval uncertainties. At the surface, where CrIS typically has lower sensitivity, it tends to overestimate in low-concentration conditions and underestimate in higher atmospheric concentration conditions.

Temperature-Dependence of the Rates of Reaction of Trifluoroacetic Acid with Criegee Intermediates	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						atmospheric chemistry; Criegee biradical; kinetics; reactive intermediates; trifluoroacetic acid; zwitterions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; OH RADICALS; KINETICS; OZONOLYSIS; ISOPRENE	The rate coefficients for gas-phase reaction of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with two Criegee intermediates, formaldehyde oxide and acetone oxide, decrease with increasing temperature in the range 240-340 K. The rate coefficients k(CH2OO + CF3COOH) = (3.4 +/- 0.3) X 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) and k((CH3)(2)COO + CF3COOH) = (6.1 +/- 0.2) X 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1) at 294 K exceed estimates for collision-limited values, suggesting rate enhancement by capture mechanisms because of the large permanent dipole moments of the two reactants. The observed temperature dependence is attributed to competitive stabilization of a pre-reactive complex. Fits to a model incorporating this complex formation give k [cm(3) s(-1)] = (3.8 +/- 2.6) X 10(-18) T-2 exp((1620 +/- 180)/T) + 2.5 X 10(-10) and k [cm(3) s(-1)] = (4.9 +/- 4.1) X 10(-18) T-2 exp((1620 +/- 230)/T) + 5.2 X 10(-10) for the CH2OO + CF3COOH and (CH3)(2)COO + CF3COOH reactions, respectively. The consequences are explored for removal of TFA from the atmosphere by reaction with biogenic Criegee intermediates.	[Chhantyal-Pun, Rabi; McGillen, Max R.; Khan, M.

The veracity of this approach is demonstrated with a laboratory scaled system whereby we reconstruct a white light binary point source separated by 2.5 times the diffraction limit. With an inherently unknown varying random point spread function, the measured speckle images require a restoration framework that combine support vector machine based lucky imaging and non-negative matrix factorization based multiframe blind deconvolution. To further validate the approach, we model the experimental system to explore sub-diffraction-limited performance, and an object comprised of multiple point sources.

Angular Momentum Evolution of Young Stars in the nearby Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; open clusters and associations: individual (Sco-Cen); starspots; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: rotation	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; T-TAURI STARS; LOW-MASS STARS; ROTATION PERIODS; STELLAR ROTATION; BROWN DWARFS; FORMATION HISTORY; ECLIPSING BINARY; CLUSTER; SOLAR	We report the results of a study of archival SuperWASP light curves for stars in Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), the nearest OB association. We use SuperWASP time-series photometry to extract rotation periods for 189 candidate members of the Sco-Cen complex and verify that 162 of those are members of the classic Sco-Cen subgroups of Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC). This study provides the first measurements of rotation periods explicitly for large samples of pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) stars spanning the UCL and LCC subgroups. Our final sample of 157 well-characterized pre-MS stars spans ages of similar to 10-20 Myr, spectral types of similar to F3-M0, and masses of M similar or equal to 0.3- 1.5 M-circle dot(N) For this sample, we find a distribution of stellar rotation periods with a median of P-rot similar or equal to 2.4 days, an overall range of 0.2 < P-rot < 8 days, and a fairly well-defined mass-dependent upper envelope of rotation periods. This distribution of periods is consistent with recently developed stellar angular momentum evolution models. These data are significant because they represent an undersampled age range and the number of measurable rotation periods is large compared to recent studies of other regions. We also search for new examples of eclipsing disk or ring systems analogous to 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (J1407), but find none. Our survey yielded five eclipsing binaries, but only one appears to be physically associated with the Sco-Cen complex. V2394 Oph is a heavily reddened (A(V) similar or equal to 5 mag) massive contact binary in the LDN 1689 cloud whose Gaia astrometry is clearly consistent with kinematic membership with the Ophiuchus star-forming region.

In particular, we examine data from a filter spectrometer, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar Partnership (NPP) orbiter, and an airborne grating spectrometer, the Jet Population Laboratory's (JPL) hyperspectral Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) sensor. We solve the destriping problem using a variational regularization method by giving weights spatially to preserve the other features of the image during the destriping process. The target functional penalizes "the neighborhood of stripes" (strictly, directionally uniform features) while promoting data fidelity, and the functional is minimized by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with an explicit finite-difference scheme. We show the accuracy of our method from a benchmark data set which represents the sea surface temperature off the coast of Oregon, USA. Technical details, such as how to impose continuity across data gaps using inpainting, are also described.

The light curve of the object peaked at an absolute mag M-g = -17.2. The maximum bolometric luminosity (from optical and UV) was L-p similar or equal to (1.0 +/- 0.15) x 10(43) erg s(-1), an order of magnitude fainter than any other optical TDE discovered so far. The luminosity in the first 60 days is consistent with an exponential decay, with L proportional to e(-(t-t0)/T), where t(0) = 57631.0 (MJD) and tau similar or equal to 15 days. The X-ray shows a marginal detection at L-X = 2.4(-1.1)(1.9) x 10(39) erg s(-1) (Swift X-ray Telescope). No radio counterpart was detected down to 3s, providing upper limits for monochromatic radio luminosities of nu L-nu < 2.3 x 10(36) erg s(-1) and nLn < 1.7 x 10(37) erg s(-1) (Very Large Array, 6.1 and 22 GHz). The blackbody temperature, obtained from combined Swift UV and optical photometry, shows a constant value of 19,000 K. The transient spectrum at peak is characterized by broad He II and Ha emission lines, with FWHMs of about 14,000 km s(-1) and 10,000 km s(-1), respectively. He. I lines are also detected at lambda lambda 5875 and 6678. The spectrum of the host is dominated by strong Balmer absorption lines, which are consistent with a post-starburst (E+A) galaxy with an age of similar to 650 Myr and solar metallicity. The characteristics of iPTF16fnl make it an outlier on both luminosity and decay timescales, as compared to other optically selected TDEs. The discovery of such a faint optical event suggests a higher rate of tidal disruptions, as low-luminosity events may have gone unnoticed in previous searches.	[Blagorodnova, N.; Kulkarni, S.

X-Ray Bolometric Corrections for Compton-thick Active Galactic Nuclei	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; HOST-GALAXY PROPERTIES; XMM-COSMOS SURVEY; CIRCINUS GALAXY; NUSTAR OBSERVATIONS; INFRARED-EMISSION; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; ACCRETION DISKS; TORUS MODELS	We present X-ray bolometric correction factors, k(Bol) (= LBol/LX), for Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with the aim of testing AGN torus models, probing orientation effects, and estimating the bolometric output of the most obscured AGNs. We adopt bolometric luminosities, L-Bol, from literature infrared (IR) torus modeling and compile published intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities, L-X, from X-ray torus modeling of NuSTAR data. Our sample consists of 10 local CT AGNs, where both of these estimates are available. We test for systematic differences in k(Bol) values produced when using two widely used IR torus models and two widely used X-ray torus models, finding consistency within the uncertainties. We find that the mean k(Bol) of our sample in the range of L-Bol approximate to 10(42) -10(45) erg s-1 is log(10)k(Bol) = 1.44 +/- 0.12 with an intrinsic scatter of similar to 0.2 dex, and that our derived k(Bol) values are consistent with previously established relationships between k(Bol) and L-Bol and k(Bol) and Eddington ratio (lambda Edd). We investigate if k(Bol) is dependent on NH by comparing our results on CT AGNs to published results on less-obscured AGNs, finding no significant dependence. Since many of our sample are megamaser AGNs, known to be viewed edge-on, and furthermore under the assumptions of AGN unification whereby unobscured AGNs are viewed face-on, our result implies that the X-ray emitting corona is not strongly anisotropic. Finally, we present k(Bol) values for CT AGNs identified in X-ray surveys as a function of their observed L-X, where an estimate of their intrinsic L-X is not available, and redshift, useful for estimating the bolometric output of the most obscured AGNs across cosmic time.

Forecasting the Impact of Stellar Activity on Transiting Exoplanet Spectra	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: analytical; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: detection; stars: activity; starspots	HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; SUPER-EARTH GJ1214B; LOW-MASS STAR; GJ 1214B; TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM; HOT-JUPITER; HD 189733B; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; M DWARFS; SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD	Exoplanet host star activity, in the form of unocculted starspots or faculae, alters the observed transmission and emission spectra of the exoplanet. This effect can be exacerbated when combining data from different epochs if the stellar photosphere varies between observations due to activity. Here, we present a method to characterize and correct for relative changes due to stellar activity by exploiting multi-epoch (>= 2 visits/transits) observations to place them in a consistent reference frame. Using measurements from portions of the planet's orbit where negligible planet transmission or emission can be assumed, we determine changes to the stellar spectral amplitude. With the analytical methods described here, we predict the impact of stellar variability on transit observations. Supplementing these forecasts with Kepler-measured stellar variabilities for F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarfs, and predicted transit precisions by the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) NIRISS, NIRCam, and MIRI, we conclude that stellar activity does not impact infrared transiting exoplanet observations of most presently known or predicted TESS targets by current or near-future platforms, such as JWST, as activity-induced spectral changes are below the measurement precision.

It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally, astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized. Methods: This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species-and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared. Results: Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. Conclusion: Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments.

In step-and-stare operation mode, AirMSPI acquires radiance and polarization data in bands centered at 355, 380, 445, 470*, 555, 660*, 865*, and 935 nm (*denotes polarimetric bands). The imaged area covers about 10 km by 11 km and is typically observed from nine viewing angles between +/-66 degrees off nadir. For a simultaneous retrieval of aerosol properties and surface reflection using AirMSPI, an efficient and flexible retrieval algorithm has been developed. It imposes multiple types of physical constraints on spectral and spatial variations of aerosol properties as well as spectral and temporal variations of surface reflection. Retrieval uncertainty is formulated by accounting for both instrumental errors and physical constraints. A hybrid Markov-chain/adding-doubling radiative transfer (RT) model is developed to combine the computational strengths of these two methods in modeling polarized RT in vertically inhomogeneous and homogeneous media, respectively. Our retrieval approach is tested using 27 AirMSPI data sets with low to moderately high aerosol loadings, acquired during four NASA field campaigns plus one AirMSPI preengineering test flight. The retrieval results including aerosol optical depth, single-scattering albedo, aerosol size and refractive index are compared with Aerosol Robotic Network reference data. We identify the best angular combinations for 2, 3, 5, and 7 angle observations from the retrieval quality assessment of various angular combinations. We also explore the benefits of polarimetric and multiangular measurements and target revisits in constraining aerosol property and surface reflection retrieval.

Sebastian; Eldering, Annmarie; Crisp, David			Observational evidence of 3-D cloud effects in OCO-2 CO2 retrievals	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; MODIS	The standard deviations of the distributions of Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) measurements of CO2 (i. e., XCO2) increase in size in the presence of clouds. XCO2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance and cloud fields, and OCO-2 A-band radiances, are analyzed in order to determine if this behavior is best described as a radiance-level retrieval artifact or by 3-D radiative transfer effects. Observations in clear-sky and fair weather cumulus scenes are analyzed. Scatter diagrams of XCO2 versus MODIS (and OCO-2) radiances are presented, and averages are calculated for each scene for several radiance bins. The averages vary little in clear skies but decrease markedly for cloudy scenes as radiances increase. These decreases are consistent with an interpretative framework provided by 3-D SHDOM radiative transfer calculations. Two 3-D metrics,.XCO2 and Have, are calculated and applied..XCO2 is the difference in XCO2 for the smallest and largest radiance bins. Have is a measure of the heterogeneity of the cloud radiance field. Lines of XCO2 and MODIS radiance for four target mode scenes have different slopes for clear and cloudy scenes, contrary to the radiance-level retrieval artifact interpretation. In contrast, the graph of.XCO2 and MODIS Have for the various scenes has a linear correlation coefficient of 0.92, consistent with the 3-D interpretation. Since the OCO-2 measurement requirement is 1 ppmv, the cloudy scene XCO2 standard deviations between 1.2 and 2.6 ppmv indicate that 3-D cloud effects add an important component to the XCO2 error budget. Plain Language Summary The measurement goal of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) satellite is to measure CO2 to better to 1% accuracy on a regional scale. OCO-2 CO2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite radiance and cloud fields for a half-dozen individual scenes are analyzed to demonstrate that three-dimensional cloud effects contribute to variations in CO2 at local (e. g. 20 km x 20 km) spatial scales. Two three-dimensional indicators (.XCO2 and Have) are calculated and applied. The correlation of.XCO2 and Have (0.92) demonstrates that three-dimensional cloud effects increasingly add to the variations of OCO-2 CO2 measurements as the cloud field becomes increasingly more complicated.

Emissions and topographic effects on column CO2 (X-CO2) variations, with a focus on the Southern California Megacity	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; CARBON; AIR; TRACKING	Within the California South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB), X-CO2 varies significantly due to atmospheric dynamics and the nonuniform distribution of sources. X-CO2 measurements within the basin have seasonal variation compared to the " background" due primarily to dynamics, or the origins of air masses coming into the basin. We observe basin- background differences that are in close agreement for three observing systems: Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) 2.3 +/- 1.2 ppm, Orbiting Carbon Observatory- 2 (OCO-2) 2.4 +/- 1.5 ppm, and Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite 2.4 +/- 1.6 ppm(errors are 1 sigma). We further observe persistent significant differences (+/- 0.9 ppm) in X-CO2 between two TCCON sites located only 9 km apart within the SoCAB. We estimate that 20% (+/-1 sigma confidence interval (CI): 0%, 58%) of the variance is explained by a difference in elevation using a full physics and emissions model and 36% (+/- 1 sigma CI: 10%, 101%) using a simple, fixed mixed layer model. This effect arises in the presence of a sharp gradient in any species (here we focus on (CO2)) between the mixed layer (ML) and free troposphere. Column differences between nearby locations arise when the change in elevation is greater than the change in ML height. This affects the fraction of atmosphere that is in the ML above each site. We show that such topographic effects produce significant variation in X-CO2 across the SoCAB as well. Plain Language Summary Cities persistently have elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels as compared to surrounding regions. Within a city CO2 levels can also vary significantly at different locations for reasons such as more CO2 being emitted in some parts than others. Elevated column CO2 levels in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) are in agreement for three observation systems (two satellite and one ground- based) systems and vary with regional wind patterns throughout the year. In Pasadena, California, within the SoCAB, a significant fraction (about 25%) of variation in the column-averaged CO2 can be explained by differences in surface altitude. This is important to understand so that all variations in column CO2 within an urban region are not mistakenly interpreted as being from CO2 surface fluxes.

Despite generally lower hourly intensities, precipitation totals along the U.S. West Coast (USWC) are comparable to those in southeast U.S. (SEUS). Storm durations, more so than hourly intensities, strongly modulate precipitation- total variability over the USWC, where the correlation coefficients between storm durations and storm totals range from 0.7 to 0.9. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) contribute 30-50% of annual precipitation on the USWC and make such large contributions to extreme storms that 60-100% of the most extreme storms, i.e., storms with precipitation- total return intervals longer than 2 years, are associated with ARs. These extreme storm totals are more strongly tied to storm durations than to storm hourly or average intensities, emphasizing the importance of AR persistence to extreme storms on the USWC.

Juno/JEDI observations of 0.01 to > 10 MeV energetic ions in the Jovian auroral regions: Anticipating a source for polar X-ray emission	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							JUNO SPACECRAFT; MAGNETOSPHERE; JUPITER; ATMOSPHERE; ELECTRONS; OXYGEN	After a successful orbit insertion, the Juno spacecraft completed its first 53.5 day orbit and entered a very low altitude perijove with the full scientific payload operational for the first time on 27 August 2016. The Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument measured ions and electrons over the auroral regions and through closest approach, with ions measured from similar to 0.01 to > 10 MeV, depending on species. This report focuses on the composition of the energetic ions observed during the first perijove of the Juno mission. Of particular interest are the ions that precipitate from the magnetosphere onto the polar atmosphere and ions that are accelerated locally by Jupiter's powerful auroral processes. We report preliminary findings on the spatial variations, species, including energy and pitch angle distributions throughout the prime science region during the first orbit of the Juno mission. The prime motivation for this work was to examine the heavy ions that are thought to be responsible for the observed polar X-rays. Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) did observe precipitating heavy ions with energies > 10 MeV, but for this perijove the intensities were far below those needed to account for previously observed polar X-ray emissions. During this survey we also found an unusual signal of ions between oxygen and sulfur. We include here a report on what appears to be a transitory observation of magnesium, or possibly sodium, at MeV energies through closest approach.	[Haggerty, D. K.; Mauk, B. H.; Paranicas, C.

Direction-finding measurements of Jovian low-frequency radio components by Juno near Perijove 1	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PLASMA-WAVE OBSERVATIONS; KILOMETRIC RADIATION; JUPITERS MAGNETOSPHERE; CURRENT SHEET; EMISSIONS; POLARIZATION; TORUS; MODEL; ENVIRONMENT; VOYAGER	With the aid of the radio and plasma wave (Waves) instrument on board the Juno spacecraft, the first scientific close encounter to Jupiter (Perijove 1) of Juno led to an opportunity to perform direction-finding measurements of the intense Jovian broadband kilometric (bKOM) radiation at 10 to 142 kHz, two escaping continuum radiation (ECR) events at 9 to 22 kHz, and two narrowband kilometric (nKOM) radiation events at 45-112 kHz. We conclude that the northern bKOM radio sources are localized on M-shell = 50-60 field lines where M-shell is similar to L-shell for nondipolar fields. The beam cone half-angle varies from 40 degrees to 55 degrees. By intersecting the wave k vector with the Jovian centrifugal equator, two ECR sources are located inside and outside of 11-12 R-J, and two nKOM sources are found between 11 and 20 R-J. These source frequencies and locations can be used for plasma diagnostics in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.

Pitted terrains on (1) Ceres and implications for shallow subsurface volatile distribution	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; CRATER; VESTA; WATER; ICE; MARS; ASTEROIDS; FEATURES; ORIGIN	Prior to the arrival of the Dawn spacecraft at Ceres, the dwarf planet was anticipated to be ice-rich. Searches for morphological features related to ice have been ongoing during Dawn's mission at Ceres. Here we report the identification of pitted terrains associated with fresh Cerean impact craters. The Cerean pitted terrains exhibit strong morphological similarities to pitted materials previously identified on Mars (where ice is implicated in pit development) and Vesta (where the presence of ice is debated). We employ numerical models to investigate the formation of pitted materials on Ceres and discuss the relative importance of water ice and other volatiles in pit development there. We conclude that water ice likely plays an important role in pit development on Ceres. Similar pitted terrains may be common in the asteroid belt and may be of interest to future missions motivated by both astrobiology and in situ resource utilization.	[Sizemore, H.

Strong altitudinal control on the response of local glaciers to Holocene climate change in southwest Greenland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Greenland; Glacier fluctuations; Holocene; Paleoclimate	RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL; ICE-SHEET; LATEST PLEISTOCENE; BAFFIN-ISLAND; SOUTHERN GREENLAND; WESTERN NORWAY; ARCTIC CANADA; MASS-LOSS; FLUCTUATIONS; LAKE	Accelerating ice loss during recent years has made the Greenland Ice Sheet one of the largest single contributors to global sea level rise, accounting for 0.5 of the total 3.2 mm yr(-1). This loss is predicted to continue and will most likely increase in the future as a consequence of global warming. However, the sensitivity of glaciers and ice caps (GICs) in Greenland to prolonged warm periods is less well constrained and geological records documenting the long-term glacial history are needed to put recent observations into a broader perspective. Here we report the results from three proglacial lakes where fluctuations in local glaciers located at different altitudes in Kobbefjord, southwest Greenland have been recorded. Our results show that the lakes received meltwater from the initial deglaciation of the area similar to 9.2 cal. ka BP until similar to 8.7-7.9 cal. 1<a BP when the meltwater input ceased as the glaciers most likely disappeared. Regrowth of glaciers began again at similar to 5.5 cal. ka BP at similar to 1370 m a.s.l., similar to 3.6 cal. 1<a at similar to 1170 m a.s.l., and similar to 1.6 cal. ka BP at similar to 1000 m a.s.l., clearly reflecting strong altitudinal control of the GIC response to Neoglacial cooling. Our results highlight that GICs in Kobbefjord, southwest Greenland are primarily influenced by changes in summer air temperatures and winter precipitation and that they are facing a rapid decay that most likely will result in their disappearance within the next centuries as a consequence of global warming. If current 21st Century retreat rates continue, the GICs in the study area will be completely gone in similar to 30-90 years, with the smallest GICs disappearing first. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Winds measured by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover's Bagnold Dunes Campaign and comparison with numerical modeling using MarsWRF	ICARUS			English	Article							PLANETARY BOUNDARY-LAYER; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; GALE CRATER; VERTICAL DIFFUSION; METEOROLOGY; RESOLUTION	A high density of REMS wind measurements were collected in three science investigations during MSL's Bagnold Dunes Campaign, which took place over similar to 80 sols around southern winter solstice (Ls similar to 90 degrees) and constituted the first in situ analysis of the environmental conditions, morphology, structure, and composition of an active dune field on Mars. The Wind Characterization Investigation was designed to fully characterize the near-surface wind field just outside the dunes and confirmed the primarily upslope/downslope flow expected from theory and modeling of the circulation on the slopes of Aeolis Mons in this season. The basic pattern of winds is 'upslope' (from the northwest, heading up Aeolis Mons) during the daytime (similar to 09:00-17:00 or 18:00) and 'downslope' (from the southeast, heading down Aeolis Mons) at night (similar to 20:00 to some time before 08:00). Between these times the wind rotates largely clockwise, giving generally westerly winds mid-morning and easterly winds in the early evening. The timings of these direction changes are relatively consistent from sol to sol; however, the wind direction and speed at any given time shows considerable intersol variability. This pattern and timing is similar to predictions from the MarsWRF numerical model, run at a resolution of similar to 490 m in this region, although the model predicts the upslope winds to have a stronger component from the E than the W, misses a wind speed peak at similar to 09:00, and under-predicts the strength of daytime wind speeds by similar to 2-4 m/s. The Namib Dune Lee Investigation reveals 'blocking' of northerly winds by the dune, leaving primarily a westerly component to the daytime winds, and also shows a broadening of the 1 Hz wind speed distribution likely associated with lee turbulence. The Namib Dune Side Investigation measured primarily daytime winds at the side of the same dune, in support of aeolian change detection experiments designed to put limits on the saltation threshold, and also appears to show the influence of the dune body on the local flow, though less clearly than in the lee. Using a vertical grid with lower resolution near the surface reduces the relative strength of nighttime winds predicted by MarsWRF and produces a peak in wind speed at similar to 09:00, improving the match to the observed diurnal variation of wind speed, albeit with an offset in magnitude. The annual wind field predicted using this grid also provides a far better match to observations of aeolian dune morphology and motion in the Bagnold Dunes. However, the lower overall wind speeds than observed and disagreement with the observed wind direction at similar to 09:00 suggest that the problem has not been solved and that alternative boundary layer mixing schemes should be explored which may result in more mixing of momentum down to the near-surface from higher layers. These results demonstrate a strong need for in situ wind data to constrain the setup and assumptions used in numerical models, so that they may be used with more confidence to predict the circulation at other times and locations on Mars.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Sromovsky, LA; Baines, KH; Fry, PM; Carlson, RW				Sromovsky, L. A.; Baines, K. H.; Fry, P. M.; Carlson, R. W.			A possibly universal red chromophore for modeling color variations on Jupiter	ICARUS			English	Article							INFRARED-ABSORPTION SPECTRA; JOVIAN ATMOSPHERE; AMMONIA ABUNDANCE; OVERTONE BAND; MU-M; TEMPERATURES; SCATTERING; PAIRS; SPOT; SPECTROPHOTOMETRY	A new laboratory-generated chemical compound made from photodissociated ammonia (NH3) molecules reacting with acetylene (C2H2) was suggested as a possible coloring agent for Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) by Carlson et al. (2016, Icarus 274, 106-115). Baines et al. (2016, Icarus, submitted) showed that the GRS spectrum measured by the visual channels of the Cassini VIMS instrument in 2000 could be accurately fit by a cloud model in which the chromophore appeared as a physically thin layer of small particles immediately above the main cloud layer of the GRS. Here we show that the same chromophore and same layer location can also provide close matches to the short wavelength spectra of many other cloud features on Jupiter, suggesting this material may be a nearly universal chromophore that could explain the various degrees of red coloration on Jupiter. This is a robust conclusion, even for 12% changes in VIMS calibration and large uncertainties in the refractive index of the main cloud layer due to uncertain fractions of NH4SH and NH3 in its cloud particles. The chromophore layer can account for color variations among north and south equatorial belts, equatorial zone, and the Great Red Spot, by varying particle size from 0.12 mu m to 0.29 mu m and 1-mu m optical depth from 0.06 to 0.76. The total mass of the chromophore layer is much less variable, ranging from 18 to 30 mu g/cm(2), except in the equatorial zone, where it is only 10-13 mu g/cm(2). We also found a depression of the ammonia volume mixing ratio in the two belt regions, which averaged 0.4 0.5 x 10(-4) immediately below the ammonia condensation level, while the other regions averaged twice that value.(C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Along-track and cross-track displacements produced with conventional SAR interferometry (InSAR) and multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) techniques were integrated to retrieve the east, north, and up components of surface deformation. The resulting 3D displacement maps clearly delineated the right-lateral shear motion of the fault rupture with a maximum surface displacement of approximately 45 cm along the fault's strike, showing the east and north components of the trace particularly clearly. These maps also suggested a betterconstrained model for the South Napa earthquake. We determined a strike of approximately 338 and dip of 85 by applying the Okada dislocation model considering a single patch with a homogeneous slip motion. Using the distributed slip model obtained by a linear solution, we estimated that a peak slip of approximately 1.7 m occurred around 4 km depth from the surface. 3D modelling using the retrieved 3D maps helps clarify the fault's nature and thus characterize its behaviour.

We also evaluate the effects of OMI row anomaly (RA) on the retrieval by dividing the dataset into before and after the occurrence of serious OMI RA, i.e., pre-RA (2004-2008) and post-RA (2009-2014). The retrieval shows good agreement with ozonesondes in the tropics and midlatitudes and for pressure < similar to 50 hPa in the high latitudes. It demonstrates clear improvement over the a priori down to the lower troposphere in the tropics and down to an average of similar to 550 (300) hPa at middle (high) latitudes. In the tropics and midlatitudes, the profile mean biases (MBs) are less than 6 %, and the standard deviations (SDs) range from 5 to 10% for pressure < similar to 50 hPa to less than 18% (27 %) in the tropics (midlatitudes) for pressure > similar to 50 hPa after applying OMI averaging kernels to ozonesonde data. The MBs of the stratospheric ozone column (SOC, the ozone column from the tropopause pressure to the ozonesonde burst pressure) are within 2% with SDs of < 5% and the MBs of the tropospheric ozone column (TOC) are within 6% with SDs of 15 %. In the high latitudes, the profile MBs are within 10% with SDs of 5-15% for pressure < similar to 50 hPa but increase to 30% with SDs as great as 40% for pressure > similar to 50 hPa. The SOC MBs increase up to 3% with SDs as great as 6% and the TOC SDs increase up to 30 %. The comparison generally degrades at larger solar zenith angles (SZA) due to weaker signals and additional sources of error, leading to worse performance at high latitudes and during the midlatitude winter. Agreement also degrades with increasing cloudiness for pressure > similar to 100 hPa and varies with cross-track position, especially with large MBs and SDs at extreme off-nadir positions. In the tropics and midlatitudes, the post-RA comparison is considerably worse with larger SDs reaching 2% in the stratosphere and 8% in the troposphere and up to 6% in TOC. There are systematic differences that vary with latitude compared to the pre-RA comparison. The retrieval comparison demonstrates good long-term stability during the pre-RA period but exhibits a statistically significant trend of 0.14-0.7% year 1 for pressure < similar to 80 hPa, 0.7DUyear(-1) in SOC, and 0 : 33DUyear(-1) in TOC during the post-RA period. The spatiotemporal variation of retrieval performance suggests the need to improve OMI's radiometric calibration especially during the post-RA period to maintain the long-term stability and reduce the latitude/season/SZA and cross-track dependency of retrieval quality.

The 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko observation campaign in support of the Rosetta mission	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; Rosetta; observations	TARGET COMET 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; NARROW-BAND PHOTOMETRY; ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES; DUST ENVIRONMENT; DEEP IMPACT; INNER COMA; NUCLEUS; EVOLUTION; SPITZER; CO2	We present a summary of the campaign of remote observations that supported the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission. Telescopes across the globe (and in space) followed comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko from before Rosetta's arrival until nearly the end of the mission in September 2016. These provided essential data for mission planning, large-scale context information for the coma and tails beyond the spacecraft and a way to directly compare 67P with other comets. The observations revealed 67P to be a relatively 'well-behaved' comet, typical of Jupiter family comets and with activity patterns that repeat from orbit to orbit. Comparison between this large collection of telescopic observations and the in situ results from Rosetta will allow us to better understand comet coma chemistry and structure. This work is just beginning as the mission ends-in this paper, we present a summary of the ground-based observations and early results, and point to many questions that will be addressed in future studies. This article is part of the themed issue 'Cometary science after Rosetta'.	[Snodgrass, C.; Green, S. F.; Kokotanekova, R.] Open Univ, Sch Phys Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [A'Hearn, M.

Model simulations, performed at various spatial resolutions and driven with a variety of meteorological datasets (WFDEI-GPCC, WFDEI-CRU and PRINCETON), were compared to the MODIS GPP product, spatially gridded estimates of upscaled GPP from the FLUXNET network (FLUXNET-MTE) and the CARDAMOM terrestrial carbon cycle analysis. Firstly, when JULES was driven with the WFDEI-GPCC dataset (at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution), the annual average global GPP simulated by JULES for 2001-2010 was higher than the observation-based estimates (MODIS and FLUXNET-MTE), by 25 and 8 %, respectively, and CARDAMOM estimates by 23 %. JULES was able to simulate the standard deviation of monthly GPP fluxes compared to CARDAMOM and the observation-based estimates on global scales. Secondly, GPP simulated by JULES for various biomes (forests, grasslands and shrubs) on global and regional scales were compared. Differences among JULES, MODIS, FLUXNET-MTE and CARDAMOM on global scales were due to differences in simulated GPP in the tropics. Thirdly, it was shown that spatial resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, 1 degrees x 1 degrees and 2 degrees x 2 degrees) had little impact on simulated GPP on these large scales, with global GPP ranging from 140 to 142 PgCyear(-1). Finally, the sensitivity of JULES to meteorological driving data, a major source of model uncertainty, was examined. Estimates of annual average global GPP were higher when JULES was driven with the PRINCETON meteorological dataset than when driven with the WFDEI-GPCC dataset by 3 PgCyear(-1). On regional scales, differences between the two were observed, with the WFDEI-GPCC-driven model simulations estimating higher GPP in the tropics (5 degrees N-5 degrees S) and the PRINCETON-driven model simulations estimating higher GPP in the extratropics (30-60 degrees N).

Diffraction of electromagnetic waves in the gravitational field of the Sun	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MASSLESS SCALAR WAVES; SCATTERING; LENS; PROPAGATION; CAUSTICS	We consider the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the gravitational field of the Sun within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We solve Maxwell's equations for the EM field propagating on the background of a static mass monopole and find an exact closed form solution for the Debye potentials, which, in turn, yield a solution to the problem of diffraction of EM waves in the gravitational field of the Sun. The solution is given in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function and, as such, it is valid for all distances and angles. Using this solution, we develop a wave-theoretical description of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) and derive expressions for the EM field and energy flux in the immediate vicinity of the focal line of the SGL. Aiming at the potential practical applications of the SGL, we study its optical properties and discuss its suitability for direct high-resolution imaging of a distant exoplanet.

Human presence impacts fungal diversity of inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat	MICROBIOME			English	Article						Closed habitat; Surface; Mycobiome; Succession	INTERNATIONAL-SPACE-STATION; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; PROPIDIUM MONOAZIDE; QUANTITATIVE PCR; IONIZING-RADIATION; INDOOR AIR; IDENTIFICATION; CONTAMINATION; MICROBIOMES; DISPERSAL	Background: An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat. Results: Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.

Sagittarius A* High-energy X-Ray Flare Properties during NuStar Monitoring of the Galactic Center from 2012 to 2015	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; quasars: supermassive black holes; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; X-rays: individual (sgra)	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLE; SGR-A; XMM-NEWTON; BRIGHTEST FLARE; EMISSION; CHANDRA; GALAXY; SPECTROSCOPY; DISCOVERY; HORIZON	Understanding the origin of the flaring activity from the Galactic center supermassive black hole Sagittarius. A* is a major scientific goal of the NuSTAR Galactic plane survey campaign. We report on the data obtained between 2012 July and 2015 April, including 27 observations on Sgr A*, with a total exposure of similar or equal to 1 Ms. We found a total of 10 X-ray flares detected in the NuSTAR observation window, with luminosities in the range of L3-79keV similar to (0.2-4.0) X 10(35) erg s(-1). With this largest hard X-ray Sgr A* flare data set to date, we studied the flare spectral properties. Seven flares are detected above 5 sigma significance, showing a range of photon indices (Gamma similar to 2.0-2.8) with typical uncertainties of +/- 0.5 (90% confidence level). We found no significant spectral hardening for brighter flares, as indicated by a smaller sample. The accumulation of all of the flare spectra in 1-79 keV can be well fit with an absorbed power-law model with Gamma = 2.2 +/- 0.1, and does not require the existence of a spectral break. The lack of variation in the X-ray spectral index with luminosity would point to a single mechanism for the flares and is consistent with the synchrotron scenario. Lastly, we present the quiescentstate spectrum of Sgr A*, and derive an upper limit on the quiescent luminosity of Sgr A* above 10 keV to be L-Xq,(10-79) (keV) <= (2.9 +/- 0.2) X 10(34) erg s(-1).

Core or Cusps: The Central Dark Matter Profile of a Strong Lensing Cluster with a Bright Central Image at Redshift 1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark matter; galaxies: clusters: individual (SPT-CLJ2011-5228); galaxies: halos; gravitational lensing: strong	GRAVITATIONALLY LENSED QUASAR; POLE TELESCOPE SURVEY; 720 SQUARE DEGREES; GALAXY CLUSTERS; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; DENSITY PROFILES; MASS MODELS; STATISTICS; RECONSTRUCTION; SEXTRACTOR	We report on SPT-CLJ2011-5228, a giant system of arcs created by a cluster at z = 1.06. The arc system is notable for the presence of a bright central image. The source is a Lyman break galaxy at z(s) = 2.39 and the mass enclosed within the Einstein ring of radius 14 arcsec is similar to 10(14.2) M.. We perform a full reconstruction of the light profile of the lensed images to precisely infer the parameters of the mass distribution. The brightness of the central image demands that the central total density profile of the lens be shallow. By fitting the dark matter as a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile-with a free parameter for the inner density slope-we find that the break radius is 270(-76)(+48) kpc, and that the inner density falls with radius to the power -0.38 +/- 0.04 at 68% confidence. Such a shallow profile is in strong tension with our understanding of relaxed cold dark matter halos; dark matter-only simulations predict that the inner density should fall as r(-1). The tension can be alleviated if this cluster is in fact a merger; a two-halo model can also reconstruct the data, with both clumps (density varying as r(-0.8) and r(-1.0)) much more consistent with predictions from dark matter-only simulations. At the resolution of our Dark Energy Survey imaging, we are unable to choose between these two models, but we make predictions for forthcoming Hubble Space Telescope imaging that will decisively distinguish between them.

J	Miyazaki, K; Bowman, K				Miyazaki, Kazuyuki; Bowman, Kevin			Evaluation of ACCMIP ozone simulations and ozonesonde sampling biases using a satellite-based multi-constituent chemical reanalysis	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; LONG-TERM CHANGES; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; CLIMATE MODEL; DATA-ASSIMILATION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; INTERIM REANALYSIS; NOX; MLS	The Atmospheric Chemistry Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) ensemble ozone simulations for the present day from the 2000 decade simulation results are evaluated by a state-of-the-art multi-constituent atmospheric chemical reanalysis that ingests multiple satellite data including the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) for 2005-2009. Validation of the chemical reanalysis against global ozonesondes shows good agreement throughout the free troposphere and lower stratosphere for both seasonal and year-to-year variations, with an annual mean bias of less than 0.9 ppb in the middle and upper troposphere at the tropics and midlatitudes. The reanalysis provides comprehensive spatiotemporal evaluation of chemistry-model performance that compliments direct ozonesonde comparisons, which are shown to suffer from significant sampling bias. The reanalysis reveals that the ACCMIP ensemble mean overestimates ozone in the northern extratropics by 6-11 ppb while underestimating by up to 18 ppb in the southern tropics over the Atlantic in the lower troposphere. Most models underestimate the spatial variability of the annual mean lower tropospheric concentrations in the extratropics of both hemispheres by up to 70 %. The ensemble mean also overestimates the seasonal amplitude by 25-70% in the northern extratropics and overestimates the inter-hemispheric gradient by about 30% in the lower and middle troposphere. A part of the discrepancies can be attributed to the 5-year reanalysis data for the decadal model simulations. However, these differences are less evident with the current sonde network. To estimate ozonesonde sampling biases, we computed model bias separately for global coverage and the ozonesonde network. The ozonesonde sampling bias in the evaluated model bias for the seasonal mean concentration relative to global coverage is 40-50% over the western Pacific and east Indian Ocean and reaches 110% over the equatorial Americas and up to 80% for the global tropics. In contrast, the ozonesonde sampling bias is typically smaller than 30% for the Arctic regions in the lower and middle troposphere. These systematic biases have implications for ozone radiative forcing and the response of chemistry to climate that can be further quantified as the satellite observational record extends to multiple decades.

Carbon dioxide and methane measurements from the Los Angeles Megacity Carbon Project - Part 1: calibration, urban enhancements, and uncertainty estimates	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							INVERSE MODELING TECHNIQUE; FUEL CO2 EMISSIONS; TOP-DOWN ESTIMATE; MOLE FRACTIONS; NATURAL-GAS; CLARS-FTS; CH4; SYSTEM; BASIN; QUANTIFICATION	We report continuous surface observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the Los Angeles (LA) Megacity Carbon Project during 2015. We devised a calibration strategy, methods for selection of background air masses, calculation of urban enhancements, and a detailed algorithm for estimating uncertainties in urban-scale CO2 and CH4 measurements. These methods are essential for understanding carbon fluxes from the LA megacity and other complex urban environments globally. We estimate background mole fractions entering LA using observations from four "extra-urban" sites including two "marine" sites located south of LA in La Jolla (LJO) and offshore on San Clemente Island (SCI), one "continental" site located in Victorville (VIC), in the high desert northeast of LA, and one "continental/mid-troposphere" site located on Mount Wilson (MWO) in the San Gabriel Mountains. We find that a local marine background can be established to within similar to 1 ppm CO2 and similar to 10 ppb CH4 using these local measurement sites. Overall, atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels are highly variable across Los Angeles. "Urban" and "suburban" sites show moderate to large CO2 and CH4 enhancements relative to a marine background estimate. The USC (University of Southern California) site near downtown LA exhibits median hourly enhancements of similar to 20 ppm CO2 and similar to 150 ppb CH4 during 2015 as well as similar to 15 ppm CO2 and similar to 80 ppb CH4 during mid-afternoon hours (12:00-16:00 LT, local time), which is the typical period of focus for flux inversions. The estimated measurement uncertainty is typically better than 0.1 ppm CO2 and 1 ppb CH4 based on the repeated standard gas measurements from the LA sites during the last 2 years, similar to Andrews et al. (2014). The largest component of the measurement uncertainty is due to the single-point calibration method; however, the uncertainty in the background mole fraction is much larger than the measurement uncertainty. The background uncertainty for the marine background estimate is similar to 10 and similar to 15% of the median mid-afternoon enhancement near downtown LA for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Overall, analytical and background uncertainties are small relative to the local CO2 and CH4 enhancements; however, our results suggest that reducing the uncertainty to less than 5% of the median mid-afternoon enhancement will require detailed assessment of the impact of meteorology on background conditions.

Uncertainty in the response of terrestrial carbon sink to environmental drivers undermines carbon-climate feedback predictions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; PROGRAM MULTISCALE SYNTHESIS; NITROGEN INTERACTIONS; LAND; CO2; PRODUCTIVITY; TRENDS	Terrestrial ecosystems play a vital role in regulating the accumulation of carbon (C) in the atmosphere. Understanding the factors controlling land C uptake is critical for reducing uncertainties in projections of future climate. The relative importance of changing climate, rising atmospheric CO2, and other factors, however, remains unclear despite decades of research. Here, we use an ensemble of land models to show that models disagree on the primary driver of cumulative C uptake for 85% of vegetated land area. Disagreement is largest in model sensitivity to rising atmospheric CO2 which shows almost twice the variability in cumulative land uptake since 1901 (1 s.d. of 212.8 PgC vs. 138.5 PgC, respectively). We find that variability in CO2 and temperature sensitivity is attributable, in part, to their compensatory effects on C uptake, whereby comparable estimates of C uptake can arise by invoking different sensitivities to key environmental conditions. Conversely, divergent estimates of C uptake can occur despite being based on the same environmental sensitivities. Together, these findings imply an important limitation to the predictability of C cycling and climate under unprecedented environmental conditions. We suggest that the carbon modeling community prioritize a probabilistic multi-model approach to generate more robust C cycle projections.	[Huntzinger, D.

Sea-ice deformation in a coupled ocean-sea-ice model and in satellite remote sensing data	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							ARCTIC-OCEAN; PACK ICE; THICKNESS; MOTION; DYNAMICS; RADARSAT; RHEOLOGY; SYSTEM; COVER	A realistic representation of sea-ice deformation in models is important for accurate simulation of the sea-ice mass balance. Simulated sea-ice deformation from numerical simulations with 4.5, 9, and 18 km horizontal grid spacing and a viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice rheology are compared with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite observations (RGPS, RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System) for the time period 1996-2008. All three simulations can reproduce the large-scale ice deformation patterns, but small-scale sea-ice deformations and linear kinematic features (LKFs) are not adequately reproduced. The mean sea-ice total deformation rate is about 40% lower in all model solutions than in the satellite observations, especially in the seasonal sea-ice zone. A decrease in model grid spacing, however, produces a higher density and more localized ice deformation features. The 4.5 km simulation produces some linear kinematic features, but not with the right frequency. The dependence on length scale and probability density functions (PDFs) of absolute divergence and shear for all three model solutions show a power-law scaling behavior similar to RGPS observations, contrary to what was found in some previous studies. Overall, the 4.5 km simulation produces the most realistic divergence, vorticity, and shear when compared with RGPS data. This study provides an evaluation of high and coarse-resolution viscous-plastic sea-ice simulations based on spatial distribution, time series, and power-law scaling metrics.

These missions will depend on high-performance silicon detector arrays being delivered affordably and in high numbers. To that end, we have advanced delta-doping technology to high-throughput and high-yield wafer-scale processing, encompassing a multitude of state-of-the-art silicon-based detector formats and designs. We have embarked on a number of field observations, instrument integrations, and independent evaluations of delta-doped arrays. We present recent data and innovations from JPL's Advanced Detectors and Systems Program, including two-dimensional doping technology, JPL's end-to-end postfabrication processing of high-performance UV/optical/NIR arrays and advanced coatings for detectors. While this paper is primarily intended to provide an overview of past work, developments are identified and discussed throughout. Additionally, we present examples of past, in-progress, and planned observations and deployments of delta-doped arrays.

We constrain Copahue's source models with satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation observations. InSAR time series from descending track RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed data span the entire inflation period from 2011 to 2016, with their initially high rates of 12 and 15 cm/yr, respectively, slowing only slightly despite ongoing small eruptions through 2016. InSAR ascending and descending track time series for the 2013-2016 time period constrain a two-source compound dislocation model, with a rate of volume increase of 13 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. They consist of a shallow, near-vertical, elongated source centered at 2.5 km beneath the summit and a deeper, shallowly plunging source centered at 7 km depth connecting the shallow source to the deeper caldera. The deeper source is located directly beneath the volcano tectonic seismicity with the lower bounds of the seismicity parallel to the plunge of the deep source. InSAR time series also show normal fault offsets on the NE flank Copahue faults. Coulomb stress change calculations for right-lateral strike slip (RLSS), thrust, and normal receiver faults show positive values in the north caldera for both RLSS and normal faults, suggesting that northward trending seismicity and Copahue fault motion within the caldera are caused by the modeled sources. Together, the InSAR-constrained source model and the seismicity suggest a deep conduit or transfer zone where magma moves from the central caldera to Copahue's upper edifice. Plain Language Summary Copahue volcano straddling the edge of the Agrio-Caviahue caldera along the Chile-Argentina border in the southern Andes has been in unrest since inflation began in late 2011. Its asymmetric deformation pattern extending into the caldera observed by radar interferometry suggests a complex magma plumbing system. We constrain models of its plumbing system with satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface displacement observations. Displacement time series from RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed satellite data span the entire inflation period from 2011 to 2016, with their initially high rates of 12 and 15 cm/yr, respectively, slowing only slightly through 2016. InSAR observations for the 2013-2016 time period constrain a two-source compound dislocation model, with a rate of volume increase of 13 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. They consist of a shallow, near-vertical, elongated source centered at 2.5 km beneath the summit, and a deeper, shallowly plunging source centered at 7 kmdepth connecting the shallow source to the deeper caldera. The deeper source is located directly beneath the volcano tectonic seismicity with the lower bounds of the seismicity parallel to the plunge of the deep source.

Tony			Decadal sea level variability in the East China Sea linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Pacific-Asian Marginal Seas (PAMS)	APR 21-23, 2015	Naha, JAPAN			Regional sea level; Decadal variability; PDO; NPGO; Wind stress curl	TROPICAL PACIFIC; OCEAN; TRENDS; RISE; CIRCULATION; BOUSSINESQ	In view of coastal community's need for adapting to sea level rise (SLR), understanding and predicting regional variability on decadal to longer time scales still remain a challenging issue in SLR research. Here, we have examined the low-frequency sea level signals in the East China Sea (ECS) from the 50-year hindcast of a non-Boussinesq ocean model in comparison with data sets from altimeters, tide-gauges, and steric sea level produced by in-situ profiles. It is shown that the mean sea levels in the ECS represent significant decadal fluctuations over the past 50 years, with a multi-decadal trend shift since the mid-1980s compared to the preceding 30 years. The decadal fluctuations in sea level are more closely linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) rather than the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which reflects the multi-decadal trend shift. A composite analysis indicates that wind patterns associated with the NPGO is shown to control the decadal variability of the western subtropical North Pacific. A positive NPGO corresponds to cyclonic wind stress curl anomaly in the western subtropical regions that results in a higher sea level in the ECS, particularly along the continental shelf, and lower sea levels off the ECS. The reverse occurs in years of negative NPGO.	[Moon, Jae-Hong] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Earth & Marine Sci, Ara 1 Dong, Jejusi 690756, South Korea; [Song, Y.

We used a time series of eight acquisitions from the TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight (TSX-ST) mode. The ST mode is different from conventional Stripmap mode; therefore, we adjusted the Doppler phase correction for interferometric processing. We analyzed the three interferometric pairs with an 11-day temporal baseline, and among these three pairs found only one gives a high coherence. The results show that the high coherence in different paddocks is due to the cutting of the grass in the month of June, however the temporal decorrelation in other paddocks is mainly due to the grass growth and high sensitivity of the X-band SAR signals to the vegetation cover. The InSAR coherence (over coherent paddocks) shows a good correlation with SAR backscatter (R-dB(2) = 0.65, p < 0.05) and grassland biophysical parameters (R-Height(2) = 0.55, p < 0.05, R-Biomass(2) = 0.75, p < 0.05). It is thus possible to detect different management practices (e.g., grazing, mowing/cutting) using SAR backscatter (dB) and coherence information from high spatial short baseline X-band imagery; however, the rate of decorrelation over vegetated areas is high. Initial findings from the June pair show the possibility of change detection due to the grass growth, grazing, and mowing events by using	[Ali, Iftikhar; Neumann, Maxim] Jet Prop Lab, Radar Sci & Engn Sect, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Ali, Iftikhar] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Remote Sensing Res Grp, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Barrett, Brian] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Cawkwell, Fiona] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Geog, Cork, Ireland; [Green, Stuart] Teagasc Ashtown Dublin, Spatial Anal Unit, Dublin, Ireland; [Dwyer, Edward] EurOcean European Ctr Informat Marine Sci & Techn, P-1249074 Lisbon, Portugal	Ali, I (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Remote Sensing Res Grp, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.	iftikhar.ali@geo.tuwien.ac.at; Brian.Barrett@glasgow.ac.uk; f.cawkwell@ucc.ie; stuart.green@teagasc.ie; ned.dwyer@eurocean.org; maxim.neumann@jpl.nasa.gov	Cawkwell, Fiona/N-2424-2019	Cawkwell, Fiona/0000-0002-7365-8909; Neumann, Maxim/0000-0002-1967-318X; Barrett, Brian/0000-0002-4380-4020	Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Program	This work was supported by Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Program.

Spatially resolved evolution of the local H2O production rates of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from the MIRO instrument on Rosetta	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; submillimeter: general; techniques: spectroscopic	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; WATER PRODUCTION; LIGHT CURVES; EXCITATION; VIRTIS; CO2; SIMULATION; MORPHOLOGY; NUCLEUS; EROSION	Aims. Using spectroscopic and continuum data measured by the MIRO instrument on board Rosetta of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it is possible to derive and track the change in the water production rate, to learn how the outgassing evolves with heliocentric distance. The MIRO data are well suited to investigate the evolution of 67P, in unprecedented spatial and temporal detail. Methods. To obtain estimates of the local effective Haser production rates we developed an efficient and reliable retrieval approach with precalculated lookup tables. We employed line area ratios ((H2O)-O-16/(H2O)-O-18) from pure nadir observations as the key variable, along with the Doppler shift velocity, and continuum temperature. This method was applied to the MIRO data from August 2014 until April 2016. Perihelion occurred on August 13, 2015 when the comet was 1.24 AU from the Sun. Results. During the perihelion approach, the water production rates increased by an order of magnitude, and from the observations, the derived maximum for a single observation on August 29, 2015 is (1.42 +/- 0.51) x 10(28). Modeling the data indicates that there is an offset in the peak outgassing, occurring 34 +/- 10 days after perihelion. During the pre-perihelion phase, the production rate changes with heliocentric distance as r(h)(-3.8 +/- 0.2) ; during post-perihelion, the dependence is r(h)(-4.3 +/- 0.2) . The comet is calculated to have lost 0.12 +/- 0.06 % of its mass during the perihelion passage, considering only water ice sublimation. Additionally, this method provides well sampled data to determine the spatial distribution of outgassing versus heliocentric distance. The time evolution is definitely not uniform across the surface. Pre- and post-perihelion, the surface temperature on the southern hemisphere changes rapidly, as does the sublimation rate with an exponent of similar to-6. There is a strong latitudinal dependence on the r(h) exponent with significant variation between northern and southern hemispheres, and so the average over the comet surface may only be of limited importance. We present more detailed regional variation in the outgassing, demonstrating that the highest derived production rates originate from the Wosret, Neith and Bes regions during perihelion.

The new mission concept relies on two emerging technologies: the technique of synthetic tracking and the new generation of small and capable interplanetary spacecraft. Synthetic tracking is a technique that de-streaks asteroid images by taking multiple fast exposures. With synthetic tracking, an 800 s observation with a 10 cm telescope in space can detect a moving object with apparent magnitude of 20.5 without losing sensitivity from streaking. We refer to NEOs with a minimum orbit intersection distance of < 0.002 au as Earth-grazers (EGs), representing typical albedo distributions. We show that a constellation of six SmallSats (comparable in size to 9U CubeSats) equipped with 10 cm synthetic tracking cameras and evenly-distributed in 1.0 au heliocentric orbit could detect 90% of EGs with H <= 22 mag in similar to 3.8 yr of observing time. A more advanced constellation of nine 20 cm telescopes could detect 90% of H = 24.2 mag (i.e., similar to 50 m in size) EGs in less than 5 yr.

The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover Mastcam instruments: Preflight and in-flight calibration, validation, and data archiving	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; multispectral imaging; calibration; Curiosity rover; Gale crater	IMAGER; SYSTEM; DUST	The NASA Curiosity rover Mast Camera (Mastcam) system is a pair of fixed-focal length, multispectral, color CCD imagers mounted similar to 2m above the surface on the rover's remote sensing mast, along with associated electronics and an onboard calibration target. The left Mastcam (M-34) has a 34mm focal length, an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 0.22mrad, and a FOV of 20 degrees x15 degrees over the full 1648x1200 pixel span of its Kodak KAI-2020 CCD. The right Mastcam (M-100) has a 100mm focal length, an IFOV of 0.074mrad, and a FOV of 6.8 degrees x5.1 degrees using the same detector. The cameras are separated by 24.2cm on the mast, allowing stereo images to be obtained at the resolution of the M-34 camera. Each camera has an eight-position filter wheel, enabling it to take Bayer pattern red, green, and blue (RGB) true color images, multispectral images in nine additional bands spanning similar to 400-1100nm, and images of the Sun in two colors through neutral density-coated filters. An associated Digital Electronics Assembly provides command and data interfaces to the rover, 8Gb of image storage per camera, 11bit to 8bit companding, JPEG compression, and acquisition of high-definition video. Here we describe the preflight and in-flight calibration of Mastcam images, the ways that they are being archived in the NASA Planetary Data System, and the ways that calibration refinements are being developed as the investigation progresses on Mars. We also provide some examples of data sets and analyses that help to validate the accuracy and precision of the calibration. Plain Language Summary We describe the calibration and archiving of the images being obtained from the Mastcam multispectral, stereoscopic imaging system on board the NASA Curiosity Mars rover. Calibration is critical to detailed scientific analysis of instrumental data, and in this paper we not only describe the details of the calibration process and the steps in our resulting data calibration pipeline but also present some examples of the kinds of scientific analyses and discoveries that this calibration has enabled.

Data gaps, cloud contamination, variations in atmospheric profiles of temperature and moisture, and a lack of in situ observations provide challenges for satellite-derived LSWT for climatological analysis or input into geophysical models. In this study, the Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) analysis of LSWT is evaluated between 2007 and 2015 over a small (Lake Oneida), medium (Lake Okeechobee), and large (Lake Michigan) lake. The advantages of the MUR LSWT analyses include daily consistency, high-resolution (similar to 1 km), near-real time production, and multi-platform data synthesis. The MUR LSWT versus in situ measurements for Lake Michigan (Lake Okeechobee) have an overall bias (MUR LSWT-in situ) of -0.20 degrees C (0.31 degrees C) and a RMSE of 0.86 degrees C (0.91 degrees C). The MUR LSWT versus in situ measurements for Lake Oneida have overall large biases (-1.74 degrees C) and RMSE (3.42 degrees C) due to a lack of available satellite imagery over the lake, but performs better during the less cloudy 15 July-30 September period. The results of this study highlight the importance of calculating validation statistics on a seasonal and annual basis for evaluating satellite-derived LSWT.

While the existing literature is divided on the cause of this so-called "warming hole,"anthropogenic aerosols have been hypothesized as playing a primary role in its occurrence. In this study, unique satellite-based observations of aerosol vertical profiles are combined with a one-dimensional radiative transfer model and surface temperature observations to diagnose how major reductions in summertime aerosol burden since 2001 have impacted surface temperatures in the southeast US. We show that a significant improvement in air quality likely contributed to the elimination of the warming hole and acceleration of the positive temperature trend observed in recent years. These reductions coincide with a new EPA rule that was implemented between 2006 and 2010 that revised the fine particulate matter standard downward. Similar to the southeast US in the twentieth century, other regions of the globe may experience masking of long-term warming due to greenhouse gases, especially those with particularly poor air quality.

They could change shape according to a specific exogenous command or by means of a fully integrated adaptive system, and provide an innovative solution for many future applications, such as space exploration in extreme or otherwise challenging environments, post-disaster search and rescue in ground applications, compliant wearable devices, and even in the medical field for in vivo applications. This perspective provides an initial assessment of existing capabilities that could be leveraged to pursue the topic of "Smart Fluid Systems" or "Liquid Engineered Systems".

I star-forming region using proper motions and photometry measured from optical and infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, and ground-based facilities. Through near-IR spectroscopy at Gemini Observatory, we have confirmed six of the candidates as new late-type members of Chamaeleon I (>= M8). One of these objects, Cha J11110675-7636030, has the faintest extinction-corrected M-K among known members, which corresponds to a mass of 3-6 M-Jup according to evolutionary models. That object and two other new members have redder mid-IR colors than young photospheres at. <= M9.5, which may indicate the presence of disks. However, since those objects may be later than M9.5 and the mid-IR colors of young photospheres are ill-defined at those types, we cannot determine conclusively whether color excesses from disks are present. If Cha J11110675-7636030 does have a disk, it would be a contender for the least-massive known brown dwarf with a disk. Since the new brown dwarfs that we have found extend below our completeness limit of 6-10. M-Jup, deeper observations are needed to measure the minimum mass of the initial mass function in Chamaeleon. I.	[Esplin, T. L.; Luhman, K.

Determining Tropical Cyclone Surface Wind Speed Structure and Intensity with the CYGNSS Satellite Constellation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							MICROWAVE SOUNDING UNIT; OBJECTIVE SCHEME; DVORAK TECHNIQUE; RETRIEVALS	The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) consists of a constellation of eight microsatellites that provide observations of surface wind speed in all precipitating conditions. A method for estimating tropical cyclone (TC) metrics-maximum surface wind speed V-MAX, radius of maximum surface wind speed R-MAX, and wind radii (R-64, R-50, and R-34)-from CYGNSS observations is developed and tested using simulated CYGNSS observations with realistic measurement errors. Using two inputs, 1) CYGNSS observations and 2) the storm center location, estimates of TC metrics are possible through the use of a parametric wind model algorithm that effectively interpolates between the available observations as a constraint on the assumed wind speed distribution. This methodology has a promising performance as evaluated from the simulations presented. In particular, after quality-control filters based on sampling properties are applied to the population of test cases, the standard deviation of retrieval error for V-MAX is 4.3 m s(-1) (where 1 m s(-1) = 1.94 kt), for R-MAX is 17.4 km, for R-64 is 16.8 km, for R-50 is 21.6 km, and for R-34 is 41.3 km (where 1 km = 0.54 n mi). These TC data products will be available for the 2017 Atlantic Ocean hurricane season using on-orbit CYGNSS observations, but near-real-time operations are the subject of future work. Future work will also include calibration and validation of the algorithm once real CYGNSS data are available.

The full capabilities of the GPM Core Observatory are tested by analyzing more than 20 observables and adopting the hydrometeor classification on the basis of ground-based polarimetric measurements being truth. The proxies have been tested using the critical success index (CSI) as a verification measure. The hail-detection algorithm that is based on the mean Ku-band reflectivity in the mixed-phase layer performs the best of all considered proxies (CSI of 45%). Outside the dual-frequency precipitation radar swath, the polarization-corrected temperature at 18.7GHz shows the greatest potential for hail detection among all GPM Microwave Imager channels (CSI of 26% at a threshold value of 261 K). When dual-variable proxies are considered, the combination involving the mixed-phase reflectivity values at both Ku and Ka bands outperforms all of the other proxies, with a CSI of 49%. The best-performing radar-radiometer algorithm is based on the mixed-phase reflectivity at Ku band and on the brightness temperature (TB) at 10.7 GHz (CSI of 46%). When only radiometric data are available, the algorithm that is based on the TBs at 36.6 and 166 GHz is themost efficient, with a CSI of 27.5%.

Nevertheless, its orbit allows the constellation to view regions up to 40 degrees latitude. As such, it is possible that CYGNSS will provide observations of a number of low-latitude extratropical cyclones and their associated fronts. In this study, one year of simulated CYGNSS specular point locations is combined with a database of objectively identified fronts and cyclones to assess the potential efficacy of CYGNSS for observing extratropical systems. It is found that, with the exception of regions poleward of warm fronts, the subset of locations in the simulated CYGNSS dataset nearly exactly matches the distribution of wind speeds and surface fluxes across frontal zones and near cyclone centers in the reanalysis database.

The ALE process utilizes the same chemistry previously demonstrated in the atomic layer deposition of aluminum fluoride thin films, and can therefore be exploited to remove the surface oxide from metallic aluminum and replace it with thin fluoride layers in order to improve the performance of ultraviolet aluminum mirrors. This ALE process is modified relative to existing methods through the use of a chamber conditioning film of lithium fluoride, which is shown to enhance the loss of fluorine surface species and results in conformal layer-by-layer etching of aluminum oxide films. Etch properties were explored over a temperature range of 225-300 degrees C with the Al2O3 etch rate increasing from 0.8 to 1.2 angstrom per ALE cycle at a fixed HF exposure of 60 ms per cycle. The effective etch rate has a dependence on the total HF exposure, but the process is shown to be scalable to large area substrates with a postetch uniformity of better than 2% demonstrated on 125 mm diameter wafers. The efficacy of the ALE process in reducing interfacial native aluminum oxide on evaporated aluminum mirrors is demonstrated using characterization by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and measurements of ultraviolet reflectance at wavelengths down to 120 nm.

The debris disk is imaged with the high contrast imaging instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope, and is revealed by both the IRDIS and IFS subsytems, operating in the H and YJ bands respectively. The disk has a high infrared luminosity of L-IR/L-star. similar to 5 x 10(-3), and has been resolved in other studies using ALMA. We detect a nearly edge-on ring, with evidence of an inner clearing. We fit the debris disk using a model characterized by a single bright ring, with radius similar to 60-70. au, in broad agreement with previous analyses of the target SED. The disk is vertically thin, and has an inclination angle of similar to 75 degrees. Along with other previously imaged edge-on disks in the Sco-Cen association such as HD 110058, HD 115600, and HD 111520, this disk image will allow of the structure and morphology of very young debris disks, shortly after the epoch of planet formation has ceased.

GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with AV. 7 mag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH3 and other key molecular tracers. This first release includes the data for four regions in the. Gould Belt clouds: B18 in Taurus, NGC 1333 in Perseus, L1688 in Ophiuchus, and Orion A North in Orion. We compare the NH3 emission to dust continuum emission from Herschel. and find that the two tracers correspond closely. We find that. NH3 is present in over 60% of the. lines. of. sight with AV greater than or similar to 7 mag in three of the four DR1 regions, in agreement with expectations from previous observations. The sole exception is B18, where NH3 is detected toward similar to 40% of the. lines. of. sight with AV greater than or similar to 7 mag. Moreover, we find that the NH3 emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense cores. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH3 column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2) lines. We show that the NH3 velocity dispersion, sigma(v), and gas kinetic temperature, T-K, vary systematically between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value and the spread of sv and TK with increasing star formation activity. The data presented in this paper are publicly available (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/GAS_DR1).

Performance Analysis of a Low-Power Magnetically Shielded Hall Thruster: Computational Modeling	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							DISCHARGE	The applicability of a fully shielding magnetic field topology to a low-power xenon Hall thruster was demonstrated through testing of the MaSMi-60. Although the discharge channel lifetime was significantly increased, performance testing of the device revealed a peak anode efficiency of under 30%, which was lower than expected given the available data on high-power magnetically shielded Hall thrusters. Experimental measurements in a vacuum facility with operating pressures of <5 x 10(6) torr suggest that the MaSMi-60's current utilization, mass utilization, and beam divergence efficiencies were the key contributors to its moderate performance. To better understand the physics causing these performance deficiencies, a computational analysis including 2D plasma modeling of the MaSMi-60 was conducted. Results from the 2D numerical models confirmed that the MaSMi-60 achieved the parameters necessary for magnetic shielding. The physics governing the low mass utilization, current utilization, and beam divergence efficiencies were then identified and described using the computational model results. The low mass utilization is attributed to a long ionization mean free path in the discharge channel caused by the predominantly axial trajectory of the injected propellant. Insufficient magnetic field strength enabling excessive electron current to the anode was the primary cause for the poor current utilization. Lastly, the high beam divergence was due to an overly shielding magnetic field topology that promoted high-energy ions to be accelerated far off the thruster's axis.

J	Boca, A; Warwick, R; White, B; Ewell, R				Boca, Andreea; Warwick, Richard; White, Brett; Ewell, Richard			A Data-Driven Evaluation of the Viability of Solar Arrays at Saturn	IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article						Photovoltaic cells; photovoltaic systems; Saturn; space exploration; space technology	MISSION	Solar arrays are a low-cost, readily available, and highly reliable power source for space exploration, which makes them attractive to multiple NASA mission concepts up to and including the orbit of Saturn (9.5 AU). This paper addresses the viability of currently available solar cell and solar array technologies under extremely low irradiance and low temperature (LILT) conditions. We present ground-based measurements of solar cell performance in laboratory environments relevant to Saturn missions. Several space-qualified cell products were evaluated, including Spectrolab UTJ, SolAero ZTJ, and Azur 3G28-LILT. Test conditions consisted of irradiances corresponding to sun distances from 1 AU to 9.5 AU, and junction temperatures from + 150 degrees C to -165 degrees C. The various cell options were all found to have highly viable average efficiencies under Saturn LILT conditions, in the similar to 30-34% range. We also present in-flight solar array telemetry data obtained by the Juno mission under Saturn-like environmental conditions. Juno is a solar-powered spacecraft, currently in polar orbit around Jupiter. During the Jupiter orbit insertion maneuver, the Juno solar array temporarily experienced effective irradiances and temperatures comparable to those that would be experienced by a solar array at Saturn. We evaluate the actual array performance under those conditions and compare it to the ground-based laboratory data.

Analysis of Evolving Oil Spills in Full-Polarimetric and Hybrid-Polarity SAR	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Hybrid polarity (HP); NORSE2015; oil spill observation; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); time series; uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR)	OCEAN SURFACE; COMPACT; RADAR; SIGNATURES; HYBRID/COMPACT; MULTIFREQUENCY; POLARIZATION; DISTANCE; SLICKS; MODEL	Oil spill detection using a time series of images acquired off Norway in June 2015 with the uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar is examined. The relative performance of a set of features derived from quad-polarization versus hybrid-polarity (HP) modes in detection of various types of slicks as they evolve on a high wind driven sea surface is evaluated. It is shown that the HP mode is comparable with the full-polarimetric mode in its ability to distinguish the various slicks from open water (OW) for challenging conditions of high winds (9-12 m/s), small release volumes (0.2-0.5 m(3)), and during the period 0-9 h following release. The features that contain the cross-polarization component are better for distinguishing the various slicks from open water at later and more developed stages. Although these features are not available in the HP mode, we identify alternative features to achieve similar results. In addition, a clear correlation between the results of individual features and their dependence on particular components within the two-scale Bragg scattering theory is identified. The features that show poor detectability of the oil slicks are those that are independent of the small-scale roughness, while the features resulting in good separability were dependent on several factors in the two-scale Bragg scattering model. We conclude that the HP mode is a viable alternative for SAR-based oil spill detection and monitoring that provides comparable results to those from the quad-polarimetric SAR.

High-fidelity Simulations of the Near-Earth Object Search Performance of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: numerical; minor planets, asteroids: general; surveys; telescopes	PAN-STARRS; SYSTEM; POPULATION; ASTEROIDS; PROGRAM	We perform high-fidelity simulations of a wide-field telescopic survey searching for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) larger than 140 m, focusing on the observation and detection model, as well as detection efficiency and accuracy. As a test survey, we select the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We use its proposed pointings for a 10-year mission, and model the detection of NEOs in the fields. We discuss individual model parameters for magnitude losses, vignetting, fading, asteroid rotation and colors, fill factor, limiting magnitude, rate of motion, field shape and rotation, and survey patterns. We assess results in terms of the cumulative completeness of the detected population as a function of size and time. Additionally, we examine the sources of modeling uncertainty, and derive the overall NEO population completeness for the baseline LSST survey to be 55 +/- 5% for NEOs with absolute magnitude brighter than 22. Including already discovered objects and ongoing surveys, the NEO completeness at the end of the LSST baseline survey should reach similar to 77%.

Near-Earth Object Orbit Linking with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: numerical; minor planets, asteroids: general; surveys; telescopes	PAN-STARRS; PROCESSING SYSTEM	We have conducted a detailed simulation of the ability of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to link near-Earth and main belt asteroid detections into orbits. The key elements of the study were a high-fidelity detection model and the presence of false detections in the form of both statistical noise and difference image artifacts. We employed the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) to generate tracklets, tracks, and orbits with a realistic detection density for one month of the LSST survey. The main goals of the study were to understand whether (a) the linking of near-Earth objects (NEOs) into orbits can succeed in a realistic survey, (b) the number of false tracks and orbits will be manageable, and (c) the accuracy of linked orbits would be sufficient for automated processing of discoveries and attributions. We found that the overall density of asteroids was more than 5000 per LSST field near opposition on the ecliptic, plus up to 3000 false detections per field in good seeing. We achieved 93.6% NEO linking efficiency for H < 22 on tracks composed of tracklets from at least three distinct nights within a 12 day interval. The derived NEO catalog was comprised of 96% correct linkages. Less than 0.1% of orbits included false detections, and the remainder of false linkages stemmed from main belt confusion, which was an artifact of the short time span of the simulation. The MOPS linking efficiency can be improved by refined attribution of detections to known objects and by improved tuning of the internal kd-tree linking algorithms.

Our package relies on the extensive python stack of scientific libraries and aims to provide a flexible framework for high-contrast data and image processing. In this paper, we describe the capabilities of VIP related to processing image sequences acquired using the angular differential imaging (ADI) observing technique. VIP implements functionalities for building high-contrast data processing pipelines, encompassing pre- and post-processing algorithms, potential source. position and flux estimation, and sensitivity curve. generation. Among the reference point-spread. function subtraction techniques for ADI post-processing, VIP includes several flavors of principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithms, such as annular PCA and incremental PCA algorithms capable of processing big datacubes (of several gigabytes) on a computer with limited memory. Also, we present a novel ADI algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization, which comes from the same family of low-rank matrix approximations as PCA and provides fairly similar results. We showcase the ADI capabilities of the VIP library using a deep sequence on HR 8799 taken with the LBTI/LMIRCam and its recently commissioned L-band vortex coronagraph. Using VIP, we investigated the presence of additional companions around HR 8799 and did not find any significant additional point source beyond the four known planets. VIP is available at http://github. com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP and is accompanied with Jupyter notebook tutorials illustrating the main functionalities of the library.

In this study, we present new K1 (1.90-2.19 mu m) and K2 (2.10-2.40 mu m) spectra taken with the Gemini Planet Imager as well as an updated L-P (3.76 mu m) and new M-S (4.67 mu m) photometry from the NIRC2 Narrow camera. The new data were combined with J (1.13-1.35 mu m) and H (1.50-1.80 mu m) spectra from the discovery epoch with the goal of better characterizing the planet properties. The 51 Eri b photometry is redder than field brown dwarfs as well as known young T-dwarfs with similar spectral type (between T4 and T8), and we propose that 51 Eri b might be in the process of undergoing the transition from L-type to T-type. We used two complementary atmosphere model grids including either deep iron/silicate clouds or sulfide/salt clouds in the photosphere, spanning a range of cloud properties, including fully cloudy, cloud-free, and patchy/intermediate-opacity clouds. The model fits suggest that 51 Eri. b has an effective temperature ranging between 605 and 737 K, a solar metallicity, and a surface gravity of log(g) = 3.5-4.0 dex, and the atmosphere requires a patchy cloud atmosphere to model the spectral energy distribution (SED). From the model atmospheres, we infer a luminosity for the planet of -5.83 to -5.93 (logL/L circle dot),leaving 51 Eri b in the unique position of being one of the only directly imaged planets consistent with having formed via a cold-start scenario. Comparisons of the planet SED against warm-start models indicate that the planet luminosity is best reproduced by a planet formed via core accretion with a core mass between 15 and 127 M-circle plus.

The Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey I. A steep linewidth- size relation and suppression of star formation	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; methods: data analysis; stars: formation	YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; H II REGION; SAGITTARIUS-D; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; H2O MASERS; MILKY-WAY; CONTINUUM EMISSION; INITIAL CONDITIONS; LINE OBSERVATIONS; COLOGNE DATABASE	The central molecular zone (CMZ; inner similar to 200 pc) of the Milky Way is a star formation (SF) environment with very extreme physical properties. Exploration of SF in this region is important because (i) this region allows us to test models of star formation under exceptional conditions; and (ii) the CMZ clouds might be suitable to serve as templates to understand the physics of starburst galaxies in the nearby and the distant universe. For this reason we launched the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), the first systematic study that resolves all major CMZ clouds at interferometer angular resolution (i.e., a few arc seconds). Here we present initial results based on observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). Our study is complemented by dust emission data from the Herschel Space Telescope and a comprehensive literature survey of CMZ star formation activity. Our research reveals (i) an unusually steep linewidth-size relation, sigma(v) alpha re(ff)(0.66 +/- 0.18) , down to velocity dispersions similar to 0.6 km s(-1) at 0.1 pc scale. This scaling law potentially results from the decay of gas motions to transonic velocities in strong shocks. The data also show that, relative to dense gas in the solar neighborhood, (ii) star formation is suppressed by factors greater than or similar to 10 in individual CMZ clouds. This observation encourages exploration of processes that can suppress SF inside dense clouds for a significant period of time.

A lack of dense gas and cloud evolution along Galactic center orbits	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; methods: data analysis; stars: formation; Galaxy: center	STAR-FORMATION RATE; INFRARED DARK CLOUDS; MASS-SIZE RELATION; CENTER DUST RIDGE; SGR A-ASTERISK; CENTER REGION; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; CENTER ENVIRONMENT; INITIAL CONDITIONS; FORMATION RATES	We present the first systematic study of the density structure of clouds found in a complete sample covering all major molecular clouds in the central molecular zone (CMZ; inner similar to 200 pc) of the Milky Way. This is made possible with data from the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), which is the first study resolving all major molecular clouds in the CMZ at interferometer angular resolution. We find that many CMZ molecular clouds have unusually shallow density gradients compared to regions elsewhere in the Milky Way. This is possibly a consequence of weak gravitational binding of the clouds. The resulting relative absence of dense gas on spatial scales similar to 0.1 pc is probably one of the reasons why star formation (SF) in dense gas of the CMZ is suppressed by a factor similar to 10, compared to solar neighborhood clouds. Another factor suppressing star formation is the high SF density threshold that likely results from the observed gas kinematics. Further, it is possible but not certain that the star formation activity and cloud density structure evolve systematically as clouds orbit the CMZ.

J	Ueda, T; Okuzumi, S; Flock, M				Ueda, Takahiro; Okuzumi, Satoshi; Flock, Mario			Analytic Expressions for the Inner-rim Structure of Passively Heated Protoplanetary Disks	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						protoplanetary disks	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; ACCRETION DISKS; TURBULENCE; INSTABILITY; TRANSPORT; REGIONS; GROWTH; MODELS	We analytically derive the expressions for the structure of the inner region of protoplanetary disks based on the results from the recent hydrodynamical simulations. The inner part of a disk can be divided into four regions: a dust- free region with a gas temperature in the optically thin limit, an optically thin dust halo, an optically thick condensation front, and the classical, optically thick region, in order from the innermost to the outermost. We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio profile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation regulates the temperature relative to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust halo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available silicate gas condenses out. The curvature of the condensation surface is determined by the condition that the surface temperature must be nearly equal to the characteristic temperature similar to 1200 K. We derive the midplane temperature in the outer two regions using the two-layer approximation, with the additional heating by the condensation front for the outermost region. As a result, the overall temperature profile is step-like, with steep gradients at the borders between the outer three regions. The borders might act as planet traps where the inward migration of planets due to gravitational interaction with the gas disk stops. The temperature at the border between the two outermost regions coincides with the temperature needed to activate magnetorotational instability, suggesting that the inner edge of the dead zone must lie at this border. The radius of the dead zone inner edge predicted from our solution is similar to 2-3 times larger than that expected from the classical optically thick temperature.

J	Van der Stocken, T; Menemenlis, D				Van der Stocken, Tom; Menemenlis, Dimitris			Modelling mangrove propagule dispersal trajectories using high-resolution estimates of ocean surface winds and currents	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						connectivity; eddy currents; long distance dispersal; Mozambique Channel; tidal motion; Western Indian Ocean	GENETIC-STRUCTURE; PLANT MIGRATION; RHIZOPHORACEAE; ESTABLISHMENT; CONNECTIVITY; VARIABILITY; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; FORESTS; SETTLEMENT	Mangrove forests are systems that provide ecosystem services and rely on floating propagules of which the dispersal trajectories are determined by ocean currents and winds. Quantitating connectivity of mangrove patches is an important conservation concern. Current estimates of connectivity, however, fail to integrate the link between ocean currents at different spatial scales and dispersal trajectories. Here, we use high-resolution estimates of ocean currents and surface winds from meteorological and oceanographic analyses, in conjunction with experimental data on propagule traits (e.g., density, size, and shape) and dispersal vector properties (e.g., strength and direction of water and wind currents). We incorporate these data in a dispersal model to illustrate the potential effect of wind on dispersal trajectories of hydrochorous propagules from different mangrove species. We focus on the Western Indian Ocean, including the Mozambique Channel, which has received much attention because of its reported oceanic complexity, to illustrate the effect of oceanic features such as eddy currents and tides. In spite of the complex pattern of ocean surface currents and winds, some propagules are able to cross the Mozambique Channel. Eddy currents and tides may delay arrival at a suitable site. Experimentally demonstrated differences in wind sensitivity among propagule types were shown to affect the probability of departure and the shape of dispersal trajectories. The model could be used to reconstruct current fluxes of mangrove propagules that may help explain past and current distributions of mangrove forests and assess the potential for natural expansion of these forests.

Different sensitivities of snowpacks to warming in Mediterranean climate mountain areas	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						snow; Mediterranean mountains; climate warming; snow simulations	BALANCE SNOWMELT MODEL; ENERGY-BALANCE; LATENT-HEAT; WATER AVAILABILITY; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; WARMER WORLD; SURFACE; BASIN; CATCHMENT; RADIATION	In this study we quantified the sensitivity of snow to climate warming in selected mountain sites having a Mediterranean climate, including the Pyrenees in Spain and Andorra, the Sierra Nevada in Spain and California (USA), the Atlas in Morocco, and the Andes in Chile. Meteorological observations from high elevations were used to simulate the snow energy and mass balance (SEMB) and calculate its sensitivity to climate. Very different climate sensitivities were evident amongst the various sites. For example, reductions of 9%-19% and 6-28 days in the mean snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow duration, respectively, were found per degrees C increase. Simulated changes in precipitation (+/- 20%) did not affect the sensitivities. The Andes and Atlas Mountains have a shallow and cold snowpack, and net radiation dominates the SEMB; and explains their relatively low sensitivity to climate warming. The Pyrenees and USA Sierra Nevada have a deeper and warmer snowpack, and sensible heat flux is more important in the SEMB; this explains the much greater sensitivities of these regions. Differences in sensitivity help explain why, in regions where climate models project relatively greater temperature increases and drier conditions by 2050 (such as the Spanish Sierra Nevada and the Moroccan Atlas Mountains), the decline in snow accumulation and duration is similar to other sites (such as the Pyrenees and the USA Sierra Nevada), where models project stable precipitation and more attenuated warming. The snowpack in the Andes (Chile) exhibited the lowest sensitivity to warming, and is expected to undergo only moderate change (a decrease of < 12% in mean SWE, and a reduction of < 7 days in snow duration under RCP 4.5). Snow accumulation and duration in the other regions are projected to decrease substantially (a minimum of 40% in mean SWE and 15 days in snow duration) by 2050.	[Lopez-Moreno, J.

Forest Plantation Using Airborne Laser Scanning Data and Random Forest	FORESTS			English	Article						forest inventory; lidar; remote sensing; supply chain	DISCRETE-RETURN LIDAR; LANDSAT TIME-SERIES; LOW-DENSITY LIDAR; CANOPY STRUCTURE; DOUGLAS-FIR; BASAL AREA; ATTRIBUTES; INVENTORY; ACCURACY; BRAZIL	Improvements in the management of pine plantations result in multiple industrial and environmental benefits. Remote sensing techniques can dramatically increase the efficiency of plantation management by reducing or replacing time-consuming field sampling. We tested the utility and accuracy of combining field and airborne lidar data with Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to estimate stem total and assortment (commercial and pulpwood) volumes in an industrial Pinus taeda L. forest plantation in southern Brazil. Random Forest was populated using field and lidar-derived forest metrics from 50 sample plots with trees ranging from three to nine years old. We found that a model defined as a function of only two metrics (height of the top of the canopy and the skewness of the vertical distribution of lidar points) has a very strong and unbiased predictive power. We found that predictions of total, commercial, and pulp volume, respectively, showed an adjusted R2 equal to 0.98, 0.98 and 0.96, with unbiased predictions of 0.17%, 0.12% and 0.23%, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 7.83%, 7.71% and 8.63%. Our methodology makes use of commercially available airborne lidar and widely used mathematical tools to provide solutions for increasing the industry efficiency in monitoring and managing wood volume.

J	McGranaghan, RM; Mannucci, AJ; Verkhoglyadova, O; Malik, N				McGranaghan, Ryan M.; Mannucci, Anthony J.; Verkhoglyadova, Olga; Malik, Nishant			Finding multiscale connectivity in our geospace observational system: Network analysis of total electron content	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							GPS TEC VARIATIONS; GEOMAGNETIC STORM; COMPLEX NETWORKS; SOLAR-WIND; IONOSPHERE; CLIMATOLOGY; CONVECTION; SCINTILLATIONS; MAGNETOSPHERE; VARIABILITY	We present the first complex network theory-based analysis of high-latitude total electron content (TEC) data, including dependencies on interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle and hemisphere. We examine several network measures to quantify the spatiotemporal correlation patterns in the TEC data for winter and summer months in 2016. We find that significant structure exists in the correlation patterns, distinguishing the dayside and nightside ionosphere, and specific features in the high latitudes such as the polar cap and auroral oval, including the cusp and ionospheric foot points of magnetospheric boundary layers. These features vary with the IMF, exhibiting a strong dependence on the north-south direction and generally larger variations during the winter months in both hemispheres. Our exploratory results suggest that network analysis of TEC data can be used to study characteristic ionospheric spatial scales at high latitudes, thereby extending the utility of these data. We explore mesoscale and large scale (greater than tens of kilometers and greater than hundreds of kilometers, respectively) as a function of winter/summer season, hemisphere, and IMF direction and conclude that the relative importance of different ionospheric scales is not a constant relationship. Together with an identification of important areas of future work, our findings provide a foundation for the application of network analysis techniques to ionospheric TEC. Our results suggest that network analysis can reveal new physical connections in the ionospheric system. Plain Language Summary Network analysis is a methodology used to investigate the structure and dynamics of a system by identifying objects (nodes) and connections between objects (edges). These methods originated in the social sciences in which people are the objects and connections are defined by the presence of a predefined relationship between people. Network analysis has since flourished and been used to provide new scientific discovery in a broad range of disciplines, including biological, engineering, and geophysical systems. We use this approach to investigate the near-Earth ionized space environment, the ionosphere. Performing a novel network analysis of total electron content (TEC) data, significant structure emerges. Notably, dayside and nightside ionospheric TEC effects are distinct. Further, within the dayside and nightside systems distinct regions emerge in response to space weather activity. We suggest that network analysis can provide significant new, and complementary, understanding of the Earth's space environment and outline important future directions. This work illustrates the importance of data-driven discovery to improve understanding of our space environment and underscores the broader theme of embracing data science in the discipline of heliophysics.

Performance Analysis of a Low-Power Magnetically Shielded Hall Thruster: Experiments	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article								The successful application of a fully shielding magnetic field topology in a low-power Hall thruster is demonstrated through the testing of the MaSMi-60 Hall thruster (an improved variant of the original Magnetically Shielded Miniature Hall thruster). The device was operated at discharge powers from 160 to 750 W at discharge voltages ranging from 200 to 400 V. Several techniques were used to determine the effectiveness of magnetic shielding achieved by the MaSMi-60 and to estimate the reduction in discharge channel erosion rate enabled by the shielding field topology. This ultimately suggested an improvement in discharge channel life by a factor of at least 10 times, and likely greater than 100 times, when compared to unshielded devices. Thruster performance, measured both directly by a thrust stand and indirectly by plume diagnostics, was lower than expected when compared to results from high-power magnetically shielded Hall thrusters. However, the plume diagnostic measurements enabled the identification of the primary causes for the MaSMi-60's moderate performance.

J	Lee, AY				Lee, Allan Y.			Risk Assessment of Hypervelocity Impact of Saturn Dust on Cassini Sun Sensors	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							SPACECRAFT; GLASS	Cassini is one of the most sophisticated interplanetary spacecraft that humans have ever built and launched. Since achieving orbit at Saturn in 2004, Cassini has collected science data throughout its four-year prime mission (2004-2008), and it has since been approved for first and second extended missions through September 2017. In April 2017, the Cassini spacecraft will begin a daring set of ballistic orbits that will hop the rings and dive between the upper atmosphere of Saturn and its innermost D ring. The "dusty" environment of the inner D-ring region the spacecraft must fly through is hazardous because of the possible damage that dust particles, travelling at speeds as high as 31.4 km/s (relative to the spacecraft), can do to spacecraft hardware. During proximal ring-plane crossings, the mission operation team plans to point the high-gain antenna to the spacecraft velocity relative to dust particles in order to protect most of spacecraft instruments from the incoming dust particles. However, this attitude exposes two sun sensors (that are mounted on the antenna) to the incoming particles. High-velocity impacts on the sun sensor coverglass might penetrate it. Moreover, craters created by these impacts on the coverglass will degrade the transmissibility of light through it. Analyses performed to quantify the risks that the sun sensors must contend with during these hazardous ring-plane crossings are given in this paper.

Evidence of sub-surface energy storage in comet 67P from the outburst of 2016 July 03	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			acceleration of particles; scattering; solid state: refractory; solid state: volatile; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	INNER COMA; MASS-SPECTROMETER; WATER ICE; PARTICLES; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; NUCLEI; COSIMA; MODEL; MECHANISM; EVOLUTION	On 2016 July 03, several instruments onboard ESA's Rosetta spacecraft detected signs of an outburst event on comet 67P, at a heliocentric distance of 3.32 au from the Sun, outbound from perihelion. We here report on the inferred properties of the ejected dust and the surface change at the site of the outburst. The activity coincided with the local sunrise and continued over a time interval of 14-68 min. It left a 10-m-sized icy patch on the surface. The ejected material comprised refractory grains of several hundred microns in size, and sub-micron-sized water ice grains. The high dust mass production rate is incompatible with the free sublimation of crystalline water ice under solar illumination as the only acceleration process. Additional energy stored near the surface must have increased the gas density. We suggest a pressurized sub-surface gas reservoir, or the crystallization of amorphous water ice as possible causes.

As the comet approached the Sun, the plasma of cometary origin grew enough in density and size to present an obstacle to the solar wind. Our results demonstrate how the initial slight perturbations of the solar wind prefigure the formation of a solar wind cavity, with a particular interest placed on the discontinuity (solar wind cavity boundary) passing over the spacecraft. The slowing down and heating of the solar wind can be followed and understood in terms of single particle motion. We propose a simple geometric illustration that accounts for the observations, and shows how a cometary magnetosphere is seeded from the gradual steepening of an initially slight solar wind perturbation. A perspective is given concerning the difference between the diamagnetic cavity and the solar wind cavity.

The scattering phase function of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko coma as seen from the Rosetta/OSIRIS instrument	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			scattering; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	DUST; ANGLE; PHOTOMETRY; SOHO	The study of dust, the most abundant material in cometary nuclei, is pivotal in understanding the original materials forming the Solar system. Measuring the coma phase function provides a tool to investigate the nature of cometary dust. Rosetta/OSIRIS sampled the coma phase function of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, covering a large phase angle range in a small amount of time. Twelve series were acquired in the period from 2015 March to 2016 February for this scientific purpose. These data allowed, after stray light removal, measuring the phase function shape, its reddening, and phase reddening while varying heliocentric and nucleocentric distances. Despite small dissimilarities within different series, we found a constant overall shape. The reflectance has a u-shape with minimum at intermediate phase angles, reaching similar values at the smallest and largest phase angle sampled. The comparison with cometary phase functions in literature indicates OSIRIS curves being consistent with the ones found in many other single comets. The dust has a negligible phase reddening at alpha < 90 degrees, indicating a coma dominated by single scattering. We measured a reddening of [11-14] %/100 nm between 376 and 744 nm. No trend with heliocentric or nucleocentric distance was found, indicating the coma doesn't change its spectrum with time. These results are consistent with single coma grains and close-nucleus coma photometric results. Comparison with nucleus photometry indicates a different backscattering phase function shape and similar reddening values only at alpha < 30 degrees. At larger phase angles, the nucleus becomes significantly redder than the coma.

The highly active Anhur-Bes regions in the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet: results from OSIRIS/ROSETTA observations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			methods: data analysis; methods: observational; techniques: photometric; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	EXPOSED WATER ICE; NUCLEUS; OSIRIS; SURFACE	The Southern hemisphere of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet has become visible from Rosetta only since 2015 March. It was illuminated during the perihelion passage and therefore it contains the regions that experienced the strongest heating and erosion rates, thus exposing the sub-surface most pristine material. In this work we investigate, thanks to the OSIRIS images, the geomorphology, the spectrophotometry and some transient events of two Southern hemisphere regions: Anhur and part of Bes. Bes is dominated by outcropping consolidated terrain covered with fine particle deposits, while Anhur appears strongly eroded with elongated canyon-like structures, scarp retreats, different kinds of deposits and degraded sequences of strata indicating a pervasive layering. We discovered a new 140 m long and 10 m high scarp formed in the Anhur-Bes boundary during/after the perihelion passage, close to the area where exposed CO2 and H2O ices were previously detected. Several jets have been observed originating from these regions, including the strong perihelion outburst, an active pit and a faint optically thick dust plume. We identify several areas with a relatively bluer slope (i.e. a lower spectral slope value) than their surroundings, indicating a surface composition enriched with some water ice. These spectrally bluer areas are observed especially in talus and gravitational accumulation deposits where freshly exposed material had fallen from nearby scarps and cliffs. The investigated regions become spectrally redder beyond 2 au outbound when the dust mantle became thicker, masking the underlying ice-rich layers.	[Fornasier, S.; Feller, C.; Hasselmann, P.

Modelling of the outburst on 2015 July 29 observed with OSIRIS cameras in the Southern hemisphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			methods: data analysis; methods: numerical; methods: observational; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ROSETTA	Images of the nucleus and the coma (gas and dust) of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have been acquired by the OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System) cameras since 2014 March using both the wide-angle camera and the narrow-angle camera (NAC). We use images from the NAC camera to study a bright outburst observed in the Southern hemisphere on 2015 July 29. The high spatial resolution of the NAC is needed to localize the source point of the outburst on the surface of the nucleus. The heliocentric distance is 1.25 au and the spacecraft-comet distance is 186 km. Aiming to better understand the physics that led to the outgassing, we used the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method to study the gas flow close to the nucleus and the dust trajectories. The goal is to understand the mechanisms producing the outburst. We reproduce the opening angle of the outburst in the model and constrain the outgassing ratio between the outburst source and the local region. The outburst is in fact a combination of both gas and dust, in which the active surface is approximately 10 times more active than the average rate found in the surrounding areas. We need a number of dust particles 7.83 x 10(11) to 6.90 x 10(15) (radius 1.97-185 mu m), which correspond to a mass of dust (220-21) x 10(3) kg.

Characterization of dust aggregates in the vicinity of the Rosetta spacecraft	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			techniques: image processing; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	COMET 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; PARTICLES; VELOCITIES; IMPACTS; M/S	In a Rosetta/OSIRIS imaging activity in 2015 June, we have observed the dynamic motion of particles close to the spacecraft. Due to the focal setting of the OSIRIS wide angle camera, these particles were blurred, which can be used to measure their distances to the spacecraft. We detected 109 dust aggregates over a 130 min long sequence, and find that their sizes are around a millimetre and their distances cluster between 2 and 40 m from the spacecraft. Their number densities are about a factor 10 higher than expected for the overall coma and highly fluctuating. Their velocities are small compared to the spacecraft orbital motion and directed away from the spacecraft, towards the comet. From this we conclude that they have interacted with the spacecraft and assess three possible scenarios. In the likeliest of the three scenarios, centimetre-sized aggregates collide with the spacecraft and we would observe the fragments. Ablation of a dust layer on the spacecraft's z panel (remote instrument viewing direction) when rotated towards the Sun is a reasonable alternative. We could also measure an acceleration for a subset of 18 aggregates, which is directed away from the Sun and can be explain by a rocket effect, which requires a minimum ice fraction of the order of 0.1 per cent.

The opposition effect of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on post-perihelion Rosetta images	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			Rosetta: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; photometry	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; SOLAR-SYSTEM OBJECTS; COMET 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; COHERENT BACKSCATTERING; PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS; PLANETARY SURFACES; DISORDERED MEDIA; DUST PARTICLES; PHASE CURVES; LIGHT	High-resolution OSIRIS/Rosetta images of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko acquired on the night run of 2016 April 9-10 show, at large scale, an opposition effect (OE) spot sweeping across Imhotep as the phase angle ranges from 0 degrees to 17 degrees. In this work, we fitted the phase curve of the whole surface imaged as well as three particular features using both the linear-exponential and Hapke models. These features encompass different types of spectral behaviour: a circular mesa, one venous structure and an assemblage of bright spots, going from red to blue colours. Both the Hapke and linear-exponential parameters indicate a stepwise sharpening of the OE from bright spots to circular mesa. Yet a very broad nonlinear phase curve is verified and no sign of sharp OE associated with a coherent-backscattering mechanism is observed. We estimate that the 67P surface is dominated by opaque, desiccated and larger-than-wavelength irregular grains. Veins and bright spots display photometric properties consistent with surfaces becoming slightly brighter as they are enriched by high-albedo ice grains. We also report the estimation of normal albedo for all cometary regions observed throughout the image sequence. Comparison to pre-perihelion results indicates that far better insolation of northern brighter regions, i.e. Hapi, Hathor and Seth, is sufficient to explain mismatches on the photometric parameters. However, metre-scale photometric analysis of the Imhotep-Ash boundary area advocates for mild darkening (<7 per cent) of the surface at local scale.	[Hasselmann, P. H.; Barucci, M.

Diamagnetic region(s): structure of the unmagnetized plasma around Comet 67P/CG	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			plasmas; methods: data analysis; Comets: individual: 67P	SOLAR-WIND; SPREAD-F; ROSETTA; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; RPC; CONSORTIUM; CAVITY; MAGNETOMETER; INSTABILITY; IONOSPHERE	The ESA's comet chaser Rosetta has monitored the evolution of the ionized atmosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/CG) and its interaction with the solar wind, during more than 2 yr. Around perihelion, while the cometary outgassing rate was highest, Rosetta crossed hundreds of unmagnetized regions, but did not seem to have crossed a large-scale diamagnetic cavity as anticipated. Using in situ Rosetta observations, we characterize the structure of the unmagnetized plasma found around comet 67P/CG. Plasma density measurements from RPC-MIP are analysed in the unmagnetized regions identified with RPC-MAG. The plasma observations are discussed in the context of the cometary escaping neutral atmosphere, observed by ROSINA/COPS. The plasma density in the different diamagnetic regions crossed by Rosetta ranges from similar to 100 to similar to 1500 cm(-3). They exhibit a remarkably systematic behaviour that essentially depends on the comet activity and the cometary ionosphere expansion. An effective total ionization frequency is obtained from in situ observations during the high outgassing activity phase of comet 67P/CG. Although several diamagnetic regions have been crossed over a large range of distances to the comet nucleus (from 50 to 400 km) and to the Sun (1.25-2.4 au), in situ observations give strong evidence for a single diamagnetic region, located close to the electron exobase. Moreover, the observations are consistent with an unstable contact surface that can locally extend up to about 10 times the electron exobase.

Thermal modelling of water activity on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with global dust mantle and plural dust-to-ice ratio	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			solid state: refractory; solid state: volatile; methods: numerical; comets: general; comets: individual (67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko)	TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION; SOLAR-SYSTEM; SURFACE; SUBLIMATION; NUCLEUS; TOPOGRAPHY; TRANSPORT; HISTORY; BODIES; CAMERA	We perform a thermo-physical analysis on water activity of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). The sublimation of water is assumed to occur from beneath a global, desiccated dust mantle over the irregular-shaped nucleus. The concept of two thermal models, the recipe of model formulation and the strategy of application to comet 67P are described. For an accurate and efficient evaluation of energy input by insolation and self-heating over the nucleus, a Landscape data base is devised based on polyhedral shape models of the nucleus. We apply the thermal models to investigate the impact of certain parameters of nucleus properties on water production. It is found that the measured water production of 67P can be overall attributed to sublimation of water ice with a mass abundance of a few to 10 per cent beneath a uniform dust mantle of several millimetres to one centimetre in thickness. Insofar as 67P is concerned, we argue against the necessity to invoke assumptions on localized water activity, or on the distinction of active/dormant surface areas.

Geomorphological and spectrophotometric analysis of Seth's circular niches on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko using OSIRIS images	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			methods: data analysis; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	WATER ICE; NUCLEUS; SURFACE; DISTRIBUTIONS; 67P	We provide a detailed geomorphological and spectrophotometric analysis of the circular niches located on the Seth region of 67P using OSIRIS images. The features can be related to landslide events that occurred on 67P and shaped its surface, as the recent Aswan cliff collapse detected in the same region. We therefore provide an analysis of the area pre -and post-perihelion suggesting that no specific changes have been observed. To assess this, after performing a geomorphological map of the area that allows us to identify different terrain units, we computed the boulders cumulative size frequency distribution (SFD) of the niches, before and after the perihelion passage. The niches SFDs are characterized by a similar trend with two different power-law indices within the same deposit: lower power-law value (between -2.3 and -2.7) for boulders smaller than 5 m and steeper power-law value (between -4.7 and -5.0) for boulders larger than 5 m. These trends suggest that smaller boulders have evolved and progressively have been depleted (lower power-law index), while bigger boulders are more representative of the event that generated the deposit and are less degraded. Then, we perform the spectrophotometric analysis of this region comparing pre-and post-perihelion results. We found colour changes within the area, in particular brighter patches related to the presence of exposed water ice mixed to the refractory materials have been detected in the post-perihelion images.

Long-term survival of surface water ice on comet 67P	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: imaging spectroscopy; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; ROSETTA; IMAGES; OSIRIS	Numerous water-ice-rich deposits surviving more than several months on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko were observed during the Rosetta mission. We announce the first-time detection of water-ice features surviving up to 2 yr since their first observation via OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System) NAC (narrow angle camera). Their existence on the nucleus of comet 67P at the arrival of the Rosetta spacecraft suggests that they were exposed to the surface during the comet's previous orbit. We investigated the temporal variation of large water-ice patches to understand the long-term sustainability of water ice on cometary nuclei on time-scales of months and years. Large clusters are stable over typical periods of 0.5 yr and reduce their size significantly around the comet's perihelion passage, while small exposures disappear. We characterized the temporal variation of their multispectral signatures. In large clusters, dust jets were detected, whereas in large isolated ones no associated activity was detected. Our thermal analysis shows that the long-term sustainability of water-ice-rich features can be explained by the scarce energy input available at their locations over the first half year. However, the situation reverses for the period lasting several months around perihelion passage. Our two end-member mixing analysis estimates a pure water-ice equivalent thickness up to 15 cm within one isolated patch, and up to 2 m for the one still observable through the end of the mission. Our spectral modelling estimates up to 48 per cent water-ice content for one of the large isolated feature, and up to 25 per cent water ice on the large boulders located within clusters.

Dust mass distribution around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko determined via parallax measurements using Rosetta's OSIRIS cameras	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			techniques: image processing; parallaxes; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko		The OSIRIS (optical, spectroscopic and infrared remote imaging system) instrument on board the ESA Rosetta spacecraft collected data of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for over 2 yr. OSIRIS consists of two cameras, a Narrow Angle Camera and a Wide Angle Camera. For specific imaging sequences related to the observation of dust aggregates in 67P's coma, the two cameras were operating simultaneously. The two cameras are mounted 0.7 m apart from each other, as a result this baseline yields a parallax shift of the apparent particle trails on the analysed images directly proportional to their distance. Thanks to such shifts, the distance between observed dust aggregates and the spacecraft was determined. This method works for particles closer than 6000 m to the spacecraft and requires very few assumptions. We found over 250 particles in a suitable distance range with sizes of some centimetres, masses in the range of 10(-6)-10(2) kg and a mean velocity of about 2.4 m s(-1) relative to the nucleus. Furthermore, the spectral slope was analysed showing a decrease in the median spectral slope of the particles with time. The further a particle is from the spacecraft the fainter is its signal. For this reason, this was counterbalanced by a debiasing. Moreover, the dust mass-loss rate of the nucleus could be computed as well as the Af rho of the comet around perihelion. The summed-up dust mass-loss rate for the mass bins 10(-4)-10(2) kg is almost 8300 kg s(-1).

The pebbles/boulders size distributions on Sais: Rosetta's final landing site on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; comets: individual (67PC-G)	OSIRIS; COLORS; SYSTEM; 67P	By using the imagery acquired by the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System Wide-Angle Camera (OSIRIS WAC), we prepare a high-resolution morphological map of the Rosetta Sais final landing site, characterized by an outcropping consolidated terrain unit, a coarse boulder deposit and a fine particle deposit. Thanks to the 0.014 m resolution images, we derive the pebbles/boulders size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the area in the size range of 0.07-0.70 m. Sais' SFD is best fitted with a two-segment differential power law: the first segment is in the range 0.07-0.26 m, with an index of -1.7 +/- 0.1, while the second is in the range 0.26-0.50 m, with an index of -4.2 + 0.4/-0.8. The 'knee' of the SFD, located at 0.26 m, is evident both in the coarse and fine deposits. When compared to the Agilkia Rosetta Lander Imaging System images, Sais surface is almost entirely free of the ubiquitous, cm-sized debris blanket observed by Philae. None the less, a similar SFD behaviour of Agilkia, with a steeper distribution above similar to 0.3 m, and a flatter trend below that, is observed. The activity evolution of 67P along its orbit provides a coherent scenario of how these deposits were formed. Indeed, different lift pressure values occurring on the two locations and at different heliocentric distances explain the presence of the cm-sized debris blanket on Agilkia observed at 3.0 au inbound. Contrarily, Sais activity after 2.1 au outbound has almost completely eroded the fine deposits fallen during perihelion, resulting in an almost dust-free surface observed at 3.8 au.

A three-dimensional modelling of the layered structure of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			methods: data analysis; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko		We provide a three-dimensional model of the inner layered structure of comet 67P based on the hypothesis of an extended layering independently wrapping each lobe. A large set of terrace orientations was collected on the latest shape model and then used as a proxy for the local orientation of the surfaces of discontinuity which defines the layers. We modelled the terraces as a family of concentric ellipsoidal shells with fixed axis ratios, producing a model that is completely defined by just eight free parameters. Each lobe of 67P has been modelled independently, and the two sets of parameters have been estimated by means of non-linear optimization of the measured terrace orientations. The proposed model is able to predict the orientation of terraces, the elongation of cliffs, the linear traces observed in the Wosret and Hathor regions and the peculiar alignment of boulder-like features which has been observed in the Hapi region, which appears to be related to the inner layering of the big lobe. Our analysis allowed us to identify a plane of junction between the two lobes, further confirming the independent nature of the lobes. Our layering models differ from the best-fitting topographic ellipsoids of the surface, demonstrating that the terraces are aligned to an internal structure of discontinuities, which is unevenly exposed on the surface, suggesting a complex history of localized material removal from the nucleus.

Long-term monitoring of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's jets with OSIRIS onboard Rosetta	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	CAMERA	We used the OSIRIS camera system onboard the Rosetta spacecraft to monitor jet activity of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. With a monthly cadence, we covered an epoch from 2014 December to 2015 October, thereby including the first equinox and the perihelion passage. Jet features were measured in individual images, which were used to perform a statistical inversion. The study provides maps for the locations of likeliest sources of jet activity on the comet's surface as a function of time. The sources follow the subsolar latitude, show clustering and a broadening of the activity band with time in the Northern hemisphere. In the Southern hemisphere, they are not clustered but show a broader spread over all longitudes which is either related to the north-south dichotomy of the comet's topography or due to a higher insolation during southern summer.

Constraints on cometary surface evolution derived from a statistical analysis of 67P's topography	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cometary Science - Comets - A New Vision after Rosetta and Philae	NOV 14-18, 2016	Toulouse, FRANCE			comets: general; comets: individual: 67P	67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; MORPHOLOGY; SHAPE; PITS	We present a statistical analysis of the distribution of large-scale topographic features on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. We observe that the cumulative cliff height distribution across the surface follows a power law with a slope equal to -1.69 +/- 0.02. When this distribution is studied independently for each region, we find a good correlation between the slope of the power law and the orbital erosion rate of the surface. For instance, the Northern hemisphere topography is dominated by structures on the 100 m scale, while the Southern hemisphere topography, illuminated at perihelion, is dominated by 10 m scale terrain features. Our study suggests that the current size of a cliff is controlled not only by material cohesion but also by the dominant erosional process in each region. This observation can be generalized to other comets, where we argue that primitive nuclei are characterized by the presence of large cliffs with a cumulative height-power index equal to or above -1.5, while older, eroded cometary surfaces have a power index equal to or below -2.3. In effect, our model shows that a measure of the topography provides a quantitative assessment of a comet's erosional history, that is, its evolutionary age.	[Vincent, J. -B.; Hviid, S.

Optical-SZE scaling relations for DES optically selected clusters within the SPT-SZ Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: observational; methods: statistical; galaxies: abundances; galaxies: clusters: general; large-scale structure of Universe	LOCAL GALAXY CLUSTERS; HALO MASS FUNCTION; II. X-RAY; SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; SAMPLE; RICHNESS; CALIBRATION; DEG(2); I.	We study the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signature in South Pole Telescope (SPT) data for an ensemble of 719 optically identified galaxy clusters selected from 124.6 deg(2) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) science verification data, detecting a clear stacked SZE signal down to richness lambda similar to 20. The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of the 2500 deg(2) SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and the degeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adopting as priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibrated using SPT-selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al. (A10) X-ray analysis. We measure the SPT signal-to-noise zeta - lambda relation and two integrated Compton-y Y500-lambda relations for the DES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations that account for the SZE-optical centre offset distribution. For clusters with lambda > 80, the two SPT-calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements, while for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of 0.61 +/- 0.12 compared to the prediction. For clusters at 20 < lambda < 80, the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of similar to 0.20-0.80 (between 2.3 sigma and 10 sigma significance) compared to the prediction, with the SPT-calibrated scaling relations and larger lambda clusters showing generally better agreement. We quantify the required corrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness-dependent bias that can be explained by some combination of (1) contamination of the observables and (2) biases in the estimated halo masses. We also discuss particular physical effects associated with these biases, such as contamination of. from line-of-sight projections or of the SZE observables from point sources, larger offsets in the SZE-optical centring or larger intrinsic scatter in the lambda-mass relation at lower richnesses.

LoBAL quasars are a minority of all BALs, and rarer still is that this object also exhibits broad Fe II (an FeLoBAL) and Balmer absorption. This is the first BAL quasar that has signatures of recently truncated star formation, which we estimate ended about 40 Myr ago. The characteristic signatures of an FeLoBAL require high column densities, which could be explained by the emergence of a young quasar from an early, dust-enshrouded phase, or by clouds compressed by a blast wave. The age of the starburst component is comparable to estimates of the lifetime of quasars, so if we assume the quasar activity is related to the truncation of the star formation, this object is better explained by the blast wave scenario.

Eight new luminous z >= 6 quasars discovered via SED model fitting of VISTA, WISE and Dark Energy Survey Year 1 observations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: formation; galaxies: high redshift; quasars individual: VDES J0224-4711; dark ages; reionization, first stars	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; Z-SIMILAR-TO-6 QUASARS; REDSHIFT; REIONIZATION; SYSTEM; SAMPLE; SEXTRACTOR; EVOLUTION; ZONES; I.	We present the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation with the European Southern Observatory New Technology Telescope (NTT) and Gemini South telescopes of eight new, and the rediscovery of two previously known, 6.0 < z < 6.5 quasars with z(AB) < 21.0. These quasars were photometrically selected without any morphological criteria from 1533 deg2 using spectral energy distribution (SED) model fitting to photometric data from Dark Energy Survey (g, r, i, z, Y), VISTA Hemisphere Survey (J, H, K) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (W1, W2). The photometric data were fitted with a grid of quasar model SEDs with redshift-dependent Ly a forest absorption and a range of intrinsic reddening as well as a series of low-mass cool star models. Candidates were ranked using an SED-model-based chi(2)-statistic, which is extendable to other future imaging surveys (e. g. LSST and Euclid). Our spectral confirmation success rate is 100 per cent without the need for follow-up photometric observations as used in other studies of this type. Combined with automatic removal of the main types of non-astrophysical contaminants, the method allows large data sets to be processed without human intervention and without being overrun by spurious false candidates. We also present a robust parametric redshift estimator that gives comparable accuracy to Mg II and CO-based redshift estimators. We find two z similar to 6.2 quasars with HII near zone sizes <= 3 proper Mpc that could indicate that these quasars may be young with ages less than or similar to 10(6) -10(7) years or lie in over dense regions of the IGM. The z = 6.5 quasar VDES J0224-4711 has JAB = 19.75 and is the second most luminous quasar known with z = 6.5.	[Reed, S. L.; McMahon, R. G.; Banerji, M.; Auger, M.; Hewett, P. C.; Koposov, S.

Lightning as a major driver of recent large fire years in North American boreal forests	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARCTIC TUNDRA; WILDLAND FIRE; UNITED-STATES; ALASKA; PATTERNS; CANADA; VEGETATION; RESPONSES; REGIME	Changes in climate and fire regimes are transforming the boreal forest, the world's largest biome. Boreal North America recently experienced two years with large burned area: 2014 in the Northwest Territories and 2015 in Alaska. Here we use climate, lightning, fire and vegetation data sets to assess the mechanisms contributing to large fire years. We find that lightning ignitions have increased since 1975, and that the 2014 and 2015 events coincided with a record number of lightning ignitions and exceptionally high levels of burning near the northern treeline. Lightning ignition explained more than 55% of the interannual variability in burned area, and was correlated with temperature and precipitation, which are projected to increase by mid-century. The analysis shows that lightning drives interannual and long-term ignition and burned area dynamics in boreal North America, and implies future ignition increases may increase carbon loss while accelerating the northward expansion of boreal forest.

DES Collaboration	Astrometric Calibration and Performance of the Dark Energy Camera	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						astrometry; atmospheric effects; instrumentation: detectors; methods: data analysis		We characterize the ability of the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to perform relative astrometry across its 500. Mpix, 3-deg(2) science field of view and across four years of operation. This is done using internal comparisons of similar to 4 x10(7) measurements of high signal-to-noise ratio stellar images obtained in repeat visits to fields of moderate stellar density, with the telescope dithered to move the sources around the array. An empirical astrometric model includes terms for optical distortions; stray electric fields in the CCD detectors; chromatic terms in the instrumental and atmospheric optics; shifts in CCD relative positions of up to approximate to 10 mu m when the DECam temperature cycles; and low-order distortions to each exposure from changes in atmospheric refraction and telescope alignment. Errors in this astrometric model are dominated by stochastic variations with typical amplitudes of 10-30. mas (in a 30 s exposure) and 5'-10' coherence length, plausibly attributed to Kolmogorov-spectrum atmospheric turbulence. The size of these atmospheric distortions is not closely related to the seeing. Given an astrometric reference catalog at density approximate to 0.7 arcmin(-2), e.g., from Gaia, the typical atmospheric distortions can be interpolated to approximate to 7 mas rms accuracy (for 30 s exposures) with 1' coherence length in residual errors. Remaining detectable error contributors are 2- 4. mas rms from unmodelled stray electric fields in the devices, and another 2- 4. mas rms from focal plane shifts between camera thermal cycles. Thus the astrometric solution for a single DECam exposure is accurate to 3- 6. mas (approximate to 0.02 pixels, or approximate to 300 nm) on the focal plane, plus the stochastic atmospheric distortion.

Validation and scaling of soilmoisture in a semi-arid environment: SMAP validation experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAPVEX15; PALS; SMAP; Soil moisture	SURFACE SOIL-MOISTURE; ACTIVE L-BAND; MICROWAVE EMISSION; OCEAN SALINITY; SENSOR; CAMPAIGN; CALIBRATION; RETRIEVALS; VEGETATION; RADIOMETER	The NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission conducted the SMAP Validation Experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15) in order to support the calibration and validation activities of SMAP soil moisture data products. The main goals of the experiment were to address issues regarding the spatial disaggregation methodologies for improvement of soil moisture products and validation of the in situ measurement upscaling techniques. To support these objectives high-resolution soil moisture maps were acquired with the airborne PALS (Passive Active L-band Sensor) instrument over an area in southeast Arizona that includes the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW), and intensive ground sampling was carried out to augment the permanent in situ instrumentation. The objective of the paper was to establish the correspondence and relationship between the highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of soil moisture on the ground and the coarse resolution radiometer-based soil moisture retrievals of SMAP. The high-resolution mapping conducted with PALS provided the required connection between the in situ measurements and SMAP retrievals. The in situ measurements were used to validate the PALS soil moisture acquired at 1-km resolution. Based on the information from a dense network of rain gauges in the study area, the in situ soil moisture measurements did not capture all the precipitation events accurately. That is, the PALS and SMAP soil moisture estimates responded to precipitation events detected by rain gauges, which were in some cases not detected by the in situ soil moisture sensors. It was also concluded that the spatial distribution of the soil moisture resulted from the relatively small spatial extents of the typical convective storms in this region was not completely captured with the in situ stations. After removing those cases (approximately 10% of the observations) the following metrics were obtained: RMSD (root mean square difference) of 0.016 m(3)/m(3) and correlation of 0.83. The PALS soil moisture was also compared to SMAP and in situ soil moisture at the 36-km scale, which is the SMAP grid size for the standard product. PALS and SMAP soil moistures were found to be very similar owing to the close match of the brightness temperature measurements and the use of a common soil moisture retrieval algorithm. Spatial heterogeneity, which was identified using the high-resolution PALS soilmoisture and the intensive ground sampling, also contributed to differences between the soilmoisture estimates. In general, discrepancies found between the L-band soilmoisture estimates and the 5-cm depth in situ measurements require methodologies to mitigate the impact on their interpretations in soilmoisture validation and algorithm development. Specifically, the metrics computed for the SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture product over WGEW will include errors resulting from rainfall, particularly during the monsoon season when the spatial distribution of soil moisture is especially heterogeneous.

Size-resolved particulate matter concentrations derived from 4.4 km-resolution size-fractionated Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol optical depth over Southern California	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						MISR; Aerosol optical depth; Air pollution; PM2.5; PM10; Public health	GROUND-LEVEL PM2.5; AIR-POLLUTION; COMPONENT CONCENTRATIONS; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT; FINE; MODIS; SURFACE; ASSOCIATION; PARTICLES	There is significant public health interest in gaining a better understanding of the health effects associated with particulate matter (PM) of differing sizes and compositions. Unfortunately the PM monitoring data needed for such studies are limited. Satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been used to overcome this limitation, but existing techniques using AOD to estimate surface concentrations of PMhave limited ability to differentiate particle size and type, and the spatial resolution is often too coarse to evaluate PM variability on local scales. Fortunately there has been a significant breakthrough in aerosol product from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument onboard the NASA Terra satellite. Recent computational advances have made it possible to derive a "local mode" MISR aerosol product at a spatial resolution of 4.4 km that maintains the quality of the 17.6 km resolution Version 22 operational aerosol product. MISR is uniquely capable of providing total AOD as well as AOD fractionated by size (small, medium, and large), enabling estimation of size-resolved surface PM concentrations. Total and size-fractionated AOD from the MISR 4.4 km aerosol product were used to develop spatio-temporal models to estimate surface concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5 chemical species over Southern California. We found, and confirmed by leave-one-site-out cross validation, that PM2.5 was best estimated with a spatio-temporal model of AOD small + medium that also included adjustment for relative humidity and wind speed (R-2 = 0.67, CV R-2= 0.51), while PM10 was best estimated from AOD large with adjustment for dew point and wind speed (R-2 = 0.76, CV R-2 = 0.44). Total AOD was most strongly associated with PM2.5 components SO4 2 ( R-2= 0.74, CV R-2= 0.69) and NO3(-)(R-2= 0.72, CV R-2= 0.39). The best fitting models were applied to all available MISR aerosol retrievals over the region, generating surfaces of estimated size-resolved PM concentrations that will be a great asset to the environmental science and public health communities.

Surface Deformation of North-Central Oklahoma Related to the 2016 M-w 5.8 Pawnee Earthquake from SAR Interferometry Time Series	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WASTE-WATER INJECTION; BAYESIAN INVERSION; MODELS; FAULT; SEQUENCE; RADAR	The 3 September 2016 M-w 5.8 Pawnee earthquake shook a large area of north-central Oklahoma and was the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in the state. We processed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B and Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellites with interferometric SAR analysis for the area of north-central Oklahoma that surrounds Pawnee. The interferograms do not show phase discontinuities that would indicate surface ruptures during the earthquake. Individual interferograms have substantial atmospheric noise caused by variations in radar propagation delays due to tropospheric water vapor, so we performed a time-series analysis of the Sentinel-1 stack to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ground deformation in the coseismic time interval and the time variation of deformation before and after the earthquake. The time-series fit for a step function at the time of the Pawnee shows about 3 cm peak-to-peak amplitude of the coseismic surface deformation in the radar line of sight with a spatial pattern that is consistent with fault slip on a plane trending east-southeast. This fault, which we call the Sooner Lake fault, is parallel to the west-northwest nodal plane of the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center moment tensor solution. We model the fault plane by fitting hypoDD-relocated aftershocks aligned in the same trend. Our preferred slip model on this assumed fault plane, allowing only strike-slip motion, has no slip shallower than 2.3 km depth, an area of moderate slip extending 7 km along strike between 2.3 and 4.5 km depth (which could be due to aftershocks and afterslip), and larger slip between 4.5 and 14 km depth extending about 12 km along strike. The large slip below the 4.5 km depth of our relocated hypocenter indicates that the coseismic rupture propagated down-dip. The time-series results do not show significant deformation before or after the earthquake above the high atmospheric noise level within about 40 km of the earthquake rupture.

This event was located near the K2 Campaign 9 field that was observed by a large number of telescopes. As a result, the event was in the microlensing survey area of a number of these telescopes, and this enabled good coverage of the planetary light-curve signal. High angular resolution adaptive optics images from the Keck telescope reveal excess flux at the position of the source above the flux of the source star, as indicated by the light-curve model. This excess flux could be due to the lens star, but it could also be due to a companion to the source or lens star, or even an unrelated star. We consider all these possibilities in a Bayesian analysis in the context of a standard Galactic model. Our analysis indicates that it is unlikely that a large fraction of the excess flux comes from the lens, unless solar-type stars are much more likely to host planets of this mass ratio than lower mass stars. We recommend that a method similar to the one developed in this paper be used for other events with high angular resolution follow-up observations when the follow-up observations are insufficient to measure the lens-source relative proper motion.

The European Space Agency P-band radar BIOMASS mission will help to reduce this uncertainty by providing unprecedented information on the distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB), particularly in the tropics where the gaps are greatest and knowledge is most needed. Mission selection was made in full knowledge of coverage restrictions over Europe, North and Central America imposed by the US Department of Defense Space Objects Tracking Radar (SOTR) stations. Under these restrictions, only 3% of AGB carbon stock coverage is lost in the tropical forest biome, with this biome representing 66% of global AGB carbon stocks in 2005. The loss is more significant in the temperate (72%), boreal (37%) and subtropical (29%) biomes, with these accounting for approximately 12%, 15% and 7%, respectively, of the global forest AGB carbon stocks. In terms of global carbon cycle modelling, there is minimal impact in areas of high AGB density, since mainly lower biomass forests in cooler climates are affected. In addition, most areas affected by the SOTR stations are located in industrialized countries with well-developed national forest inventories, so that extensive information on AGB is already available. Hence the main scientific objectives of the BIOMASS mission are not seriously compromised. Furthermore, several space sensors that can estimate AGB in lower biomass forests are in orbit or planned for launch between now and the launch of BIOMASS in 2021, which will help to fill the gaps in mission coverage.

A review of available thermodynamic data for species found in mixtures of carbon-phenolic pyrolysis and ablation gases and atmospheres rich with C, H, O, and N such as those of Earth, Mars, Titan, and Venus, is performed. Over 1200 unique chemical species are identified from four widely used thermodynamic databases and a systematic procedure is described for combining these data into a comprehensive model. The detailed dataset is then compared with the Chemical Equilibrium with Applications thermodynamic database developed by NASA in order to quantify the differences in equilibrium thermodynamic properties obtained with the two databases. In addition, a consistent reduction methodology using the mixture thermodynamic properties as an objective function is developed to generate reduced species sets for a variety of temperature, pressure, and elemental composition spaces. It is found that 32 and 23 species are required to model carbon-phenolic pyrolysis gases mixed with air and CO2, respectively, to maintain a maximum error in thermodynamic quantities below 10%.

The late-time light curve of the Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual: SN 2011fe	DELAYED-DETONATION MODELS; LATE SPECTRAL EVOLUTION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS; RADIOACTIVE DECAY; NEBULAR SPECTRA; HIGH-RESOLUTION; PROGENITOR; EMISSION; M101	We present late-time optical R-band imaging data from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) for the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe. The stacked PTF light curve provides densely sampled coverage down to R similar or equal to 22 mag over 200-620 d past explosion. Combining with literature data, we estimate the pseudo-bolometric light curve for this event from 200 to 1600 d after explosion, and constrain the likely near-infrared (Near-IR) contribution. This light curve shows a smooth decline consistent with radioactive decay, except over similar to 450 to similar to 600 d where the light curve appears to decrease faster than expected based on the radioactive isotopes presumed to be present, before flattening at around 600 d. We model the 200-1600 d pseudo-bolometric light curve with the luminosity generated by the radioactive decay chains of Ni-56, Ni-57 and Co-55, and find it is not consistent with models that have full positron trapping and no infrared catastrophe (IRC); some additional energy escape other than optical/near-IR photons is required. However, the light curve is consistent with models that allow for positron escape (reaching 75 per cent by day 500) and/or an IRC (with 85 per cent of the flux emerging in non-optical wavelengths by day 600). The presence of the Ni-57 decay chain is robustly detected, but the Co-55 decay chain is not formally required, with an upper mass limit estimated at 0.014M(circle dot). The measurement of the Ni-57/Ni-56 mass ratio is subject to significant systematic uncertainties, but all of our fits require a high ratio >0.031 (> 1.3 in solar abundances).

Bacterial growth tolerance to concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate salts relevant to Mars	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						chlorate; extremophiles; growth tolerance; Mars; perchlorate; planetary protection	SPACECRAFT-ASSEMBLY FACILITY; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; GALE CRATER; REDUCTION; DIVERSITY; NITRATE; WATER; SOIL; MICROORGANISMS; RESISTANT	The Phoenix lander at Mars polar cap found appreciable levels of (per)chlorate salts, a mixture of perchlorate and chlorate salts of Ca, Fe, Mg and Na at levels of similar to 0.6% in regolith. These salts are highly hygroscopic and can form saturated brines through deliquescence, likely producing aqueous solutions with very low freezing points on Mars. To support planetary protection efforts, we have measured bacterial growth tolerance to (per)chlorate salts. Existing bacterial isolates from the Great Salt Plains of Oklahoma (NaCl-rich) and Hot Lake in Washington (MgSO4-rich) were tested in high concentrations of Mg, K and Na salts of chlorate and perchlorate. Strong growth was observed with nearly all of these salinotolerant isolates at 1% (similar to 0.1 M) (per)chlorate salts, similar to concentrations observed in bulk soils on Mars. Growth in perchlorate salts was observed at concentrations of at least 10% (similar to 1.0 M). Greater tolerance was observed for chlorate salts, where growth was observed to 2.75 M (>25%). Tolerance to K salts was greatest, followed by Mg salts and then Na salts. Tolerances varied among isolates, even among those within the same phylogenetic clade. Tolerant bacteria included genera that also are found in spacecraft assembly facilities. Substantial microbial tolerance to (per)chlorate salts is a concern for planetary protection since tolerant microbes contaminating spacecraft would have a greater chance for survival and proliferation, despite the harsh chemical conditions found near the surface of Mars.

Orbit-spin coupling and the circulation of the Martian atmosphere	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; Mars atmosphere; Mars dust storms; Orbit-spin coupling	GLOBAL DUST STORMS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; TIDAL DISSIPATION; THERMAL TIDES; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; EARTHS ROTATION; SUNS MOTION; MARS; EVOLUTION	The physical origins of the observed interannual variability of weather and climate on Mars are poorly understood. In this paper we introduce a deterministic physical mechanism that may account for much of the variability of the circulation of the Mars atmosphere on seasonal and longer timescales. We focus on a possible coupling between the planetary orbital angular momentum and the angular momentum of the planetary rotation. We suspect that the planetary atmosphere may participate in an exchange of momentum between these two reservoirs. Nontrivial changes in the circulation of the atmosphere are likely to occur, as the atmospheric system gains and loses angular momentum, during this exchange. We derive a coupling expression linking orbital and rotational motions that produces an acceleration field varying with position and with time on and within a subject body. The spatially and temporally varying accelerations may interfere constructively or destructively with large-scale flows of geophysical fluids that are established and maintained by other means. This physical hypothesis predicts cycles of intensification and relaxation of circulatory flows of atmospheres on seasonal and longer timescales that are largely independent of solar forcing. The predictions of this hypothesis may be tested through numerical modeling. Examples from investigations of the atmospheric circulation of Mars are provided to illustrate qualitative features and quantitative aspects of the coupling mechanism proposed.

Numerical modeling of orbit-spin coupling accelerations in a Mars general circulation model: Implications for global dust storm activity	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; MarsWRF; Orbit-spin coupling; Surface stress; Global dust storm; GCM	INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; ATMOSPHERE; SIMULATION; EVOLUTION; IMPACT; CYCLE	We employ the MarsWRF general circulation model (GCM) to test the predictions of a new physical hypothesis: a weak coupling of the orbital and rotational angular momenta of extended bodies is predicted to give rise to cycles of intensification and relaxation of circulatory flows within atmospheres. The dynamical core of MarsWRF has been modified to include the orbit-spin coupling accelerations due to solar system dynamics for the years 1920-2030. The modified GCM is subjected to extensive testing and verification. We compare forced and unforced model outcomes for large-scale zonal and meridional flows, and for near-surface wind velocities and surface wind stresses. The predicted cycles of circulatory intensification and relaxation within the modified GCM are observed. Most remarkably, the modified GCM reproduces conditions favorable for the occurrence of perihelion-season global-scale dust storms (GDSs) on Mars in years in which such storms were observed. A strengthening of the meridional overturning circulation during the dust storm season occurs in the GCM in all recorded years with perihelion-season global-scale dust storms. The increased upwelling produced in the southern hemisphere in southern summer may facilitate the transport of dust to high altitudes in the Mars atmosphere during the dust storm season, where radiative heating may further strengthen the circulation. Significantly increased surface winds and surface wind stresses are also obtained. These may locally facilitate dust lifting from the surface. Based on comparison to the historical record, there is a strong likelihood of a perihelion-season GDS in Mars year 33 and/or Mars year 34.

These materials have been suggested to originate from the crystal. lization of brines that reached the surface from below. Here we report a systematic study of the chemistry of frozen brines containing sodium, ammonium, chloride, and carbonate ions via micro-Raman spectroscopy. Natrite and hydrohalite (NaCl center dot 2H(2)O) are found to form preferentially, even in ammonium-dominated solutions. Additionally, NH4Cl could only form when NH4+ or Cl- (or both) are present in excess in the brine solutions. The detection of NH4Cl on Ceres' surface may thus imply an early subsurface reservoir rich in ammonium and/or chloride, placing an important constraint on modeling of the liquid composition.

Noncircular features in Saturn's rings IV: Absolute radius scale and Saturn's pole direction	ICARUS			English	Article						Occultations; Planets: Rings	CASSINI DIVISION; STELLAR OCCULTATION; SYSTEM; VOYAGER-2; KRONOSEISMOLOGY; SATELLITES; ENCOUNTER; SCIENCE; 28-SGR	We present a comprehensive solution for the geometry of Saturn's ring system, based on orbital fits to an extensive set of occultation observations of 122 individual ring edges and gaps. We begin with a restricted set of very high quality Cassini VIMS, UVIS, and RSS measurements for quasi-circular features in the C and B rings and the Cassini Division, and then successively add suitably weighted additional Cassini and historical occultation measurements (from Voyager, HST and the widely-observed 28 Sgr occultation of 3 Jul 1989) for additional non-circular features, to derive an absolute radius scale applicable across the entire classical ring system. As part of our adopted solution, we determine first-order corrections to the spacecraft trajectories used to determine the geometry of individual occultation chords. We adopt a simple linear model for Saturn's precession, and our favored solution yields a precession rate on the sky (n) over cap (p) = 0.207 +/- 0.006 '' yr(-1), equivalent to an angular rate of polar motion Omega(p) = 0.451 +/- 0.014 '' yr(-1). The 3% formal uncertainty in the fitted precession rate is approaching the point where it can provide a useful constraint on models of Saturn's interior, although realistic errors are likely to be larger, given the linear approximation of the precession model and possible unmodeled systematic errors in the spacecraft ephemerides. Our results are largely consistent with independent estimates of the precession rate based on historical RPX times (Nicholson et al., 1999 AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts #31 31, 44.01) and from theoretical expectations that account for Titan's 700-yr precession period (Vienne and Duriez 1992, Astronomy and Astrophysics 257, 331-352). The fitted precession rate based on Cassini data only is somewhat lower, which may be an indication of unmodeled shorter term contributions to Saturn's polar motion from other satellites, or perhaps the result of inconsistencies in the assumed direction of Saturn's pole in the reconstructed Cassini spacecraft ephemerides. Overall, the agreement of our results with the widely-used French et al. (1993, Icarus 103, 163-214) radius scale is excellent, with very small (less than or similar to 0.1 km) systematic differences, although differences in a few individual feature radii are as large as 6 km. Our new solution incorporates many more features across the ring system, and the fitted orbital elements correct for the several-km biases in the radii of many ring features in the French et al. (1993) catalog that were unresolved because of the large projected diameter of the occulted star in the 28 Sgr event. The formal errors in the fitted radii are generally quite small-on the order of tens of meters. Systematic errors stemming from uncertainty in the precession rate of Saturn's pole and its effect on the accuracy of the reconstructed Cassini trajectories are somewhat larger, but the absolute radius scale is relatively insensitive to 5-sigma changes in the pole direction or precession rate, and we estimate the combined magnitude of these systematic errors and pole uncertainties to be of order 250 m. This estimate is likely to be improved once a new set of reconstructed Cassini trajectories has been developed, based on a self-consistent model for Saturn's pole. We demonstrate the utility of the new radius scale and the associated trajectory corrections in the analysis of short-wavelength density waves in the C ring. In online supplementary material, we provide in machine-readable form the more than 15,000 individual ring measurements used in this study, as well as details of the ring orbit fits underlying this work.

We measured for the first time the emission of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn across the 0.3 to 1.3 mm wavelength range using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer mounted on the 10.4 m dish of the CSO at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, 4100 m above sea level. A careful calibration, including the evaluation of the antenna performance over such a wide wavelength range and the removal of the Earth's atmosphere effects, has allowed the detection of broad absorption lines on those planets' atmospheres. The calibrated data allowed us to verify the predictions of standard models for both planets in this spectral region, and to confirm the absolute radiometry in the case of Jupiter. Besides their physical interest, the results are also important as both planets are calibration references in the current era of operating ground-based and space-borne submillimeter instruments.

Excitation using deep UV wavelengths (< 250 nm), in particular, offers the benefits of spectra obtained in a largely fluorescence-free region while taking advantage of signal enhancing resonance Raman effects for key classes of organic compounds, such as the aromatics. In order to demonstrate the utility of this technique for planetary exploration and astrobiological applications, we interrogated three sets of samples using a custom built Raman instrument equipped with a deep UV (248.6 nm) excitation source. The sample sets included: (1) the Mojave Mars Simulant, a well characterized basaltic sample used as an analog for Martian regolith, in which we detected similar to 0.04 wt% of condensed carbon; (2) a suite of organic (aromatic hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, and amino acids) and astrobiologically relevant inorganic (sulfates, carbonates, phosphates, nitrates and perchlorate) standards, many of which have not had deep UV Raman spectra in the solid phase previously reported in the literature; and (3) Mojave Mars Simulant spiked with a representative selection of these standards, at a concentration of 1 wt%, in order to investigate natural 'real world' matrix effects. We were able to resolve all of the standards tested at this concentration. Some compounds, such as the aromatic hydrocarbons, have especially strong signals due to resonance effects even when present in trace amounts. Phenanthrene, one of the aromatic hydrocarbons, was also examined at a concentration of 0.1 wt% and even at this level was found to have a strong signal-to-noise ratio. It should be noted that the instrument utilized in this study was designed to approximate the operation of a 'fieldable' spectrometer in order to test astrobiological applications both here on Earth as well as for current and future planetary missions. It is the foundation of SHERLOC, an arm mounted instrument recently selected by NASA to fly on the next rover mission to Mars in 2020. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A.			Young lunar volcanic features: Thermophysical properties and formation	ICARUS			English	Article						Moon; Volcanism; Infrared observations; Thermal histories	EVOLUTION; SURFACE; MOON; BASALT; MODEL	Irregular mare patches (IMPs) are small volcanic features on the lunar nearside with young model ages. Several formation mechanisms have been proposed including: caldera collapse, explosive outgassing, lava flow inflation, pyroclastic eruption, and regolith drainage. We present new observations of the four largest IMPs (Sosigenes, Ina, Cauchy-5, and Maskelyne) using the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner Lunar Radiometer (Diviner) and evaluate the formation hypotheses in the context of both previous results and the results presented here. We find that the IMPs have a rock abundance slightly higher than their surrounding terrain. Comparison of the Diviner data with thermal models excludes the possibility of extensive competent rocks within similar to 15 cm of the surface at the IMPs. We also derive the thermal inertia at the four largest IMPs. Three appear to have thermal inertias slightly higher than typical regolith due to alteration by nearby craters or mass wasting from surrounding steep slopes, but Ina has a thermal inertia lower than the surrounding terrain. In particular, the largest smooth mound in Ina is the area with the lowest thermal inertia, suggesting that the material on the mound is less consolidated than typical regolith and/or contains fewer small rocks (<1 m). Formation by lava flows or regolith drainage is not expected to result in material with a lower thermal inertia than pre-existing regolith, so some other process such as explosive outgassing or pyroclastic eruptions must have occurred.

While the impact of aerosol-cloud interactions on meteorology and climate has been extensively studied, their feedback on air quality remains unclear. Using a fully coupled meteorology-chemistry model, we find that increased aerosol loading due to anthropogenic activities in China substantially increases column cloud droplet number concentration and liquid water path (LWP), which further leads to a reduction in the downward shortwave radiation at surface, surface air temperature and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. The shallower PBL and accelerated cloud chemistry due to larger LWP in turn enhance the concentrations of particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) by up to 33.2 mu g m(-3) (25.1%) and 11.0 mu g m(-3) (12.5%) in January and July, respectively. Such a positive feedback amplifies the changes in PM2.5 concentrations, indicating an additional air quality benefit under effective pollution control policies but a penalty for a region with a deterioration in PM2.5 pollution. Additionally, we show that the cloud processing of aerosols, including wet scavenging and cloud chemistry, could also have substantial effects on PM2.5 concentrations.

The influence of meridional ice transport on Europa's ocean stratification and heat content	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SUBSURFACE OCEAN; SNOWBALL EARTH; SHELL; CONSTRAINTS; ENTRAINMENT; SURFACE; TEMPERATURES; CONVECTION; DYNAMICS; FLUID	Jupiter's moon Europa likely hosts a saltwater ocean beneath its icy surface. Geothermal heating and rotating convection in the ocean may drive a global overturning circulation that redistributes heat vertically and meridionally, preferentially warming the ice shell at the equator. Here we assess the previously unconstrained influence of ocean-ice coupling on Europa's ocean stratification and heat transport. We demonstrate that a relatively fresh layer can form at the ice-ocean interface due to a meridional ice transport forced by the differential ice shell heating between the equator and the poles. We provide analytical and numerical solutions for the layer's characteristics, highlighting their sensitivity to critical ocean parameters. For a weakly turbulent and highly saline ocean, a strong buoyancy gradient at the base of the freshwater layer can suppress vertical tracer exchange with the deeper ocean. As a result, the freshwater layer permits relatively warm deep ocean temperatures.

J	Su, Z				Su, Zhan			Preconditioning of Antarctic maximum sea ice extent by upper ocean stratification on a seasonal timescale	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CIRCULATION; WATER; TRENDS; CONVECTION; PENINSULA; MODEL; STATE	This study uses an observationally constrained and dynamically consistent ocean and sea ice state estimate. The author presents a remarkable agreement between the location of the edge of Antarctic maximum sea ice extent, reached in September, and the narrow transition band for the upper ocean (0-100 m depths) stratification, as early as April to June. To the south of this edge, the upper ocean has high stratification, which forbids convective fluxes to cross through; consequently, the ocean heat loss to the atmosphere is an efficient way to cool the surface ocean to the freezing point during April to September. To the north, the upper ocean has low stratification such that the ocean heat loss to the atmosphere is not efficient to cool the upper ocean. The upper ocean is instead cooled mainly through mixing with the colder inflow carried by northward Ekman transport but cannot reach the freezing point due to the nature of mixing. Therefore, upper ocean stratification, dominated by salinity here, provides an important constraint on the northward expansion of Antarctic sea ice to its maximum.

Routine lidar observations obtained in July-August 2013-2014 reveal a consistent ozone enhancement of 23 ppbv in the free troposphere (6-9 km), when ozone-rich air is transported along the western edge of the upper level anticyclone associated with the NA monsoon from regions where maximum lightning-induced NOx production occurs. When the high-pressure system shifts to the southeast, a zonal westerly flow of the air parcels reaching the Table Mountain Facility (TMF) occurs, prohibiting the lightning-induced ozone enhanced air to reach TMF. This modulation of tropospheric ozone by the position of the NA monsoon anticyclone could have implications on long-term ozone trends associated with our changing climate, due to the expected widening of the tropical belt affecting the strength and position of the anticyclone.

The effect of differential rotation on Jupiter's low-degree even gravity moments	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							EQUATION-OF-STATE; DEEP ZONAL WINDS; GIANT PLANETS; GRAVITATIONAL SIGNATURE; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; SATURN; CONVECTION; MODEL; HYDROGEN; INTERIORS	The close-by orbits of the ongoing Juno mission allow measuring with unprecedented accuracy Jupiter's low-degree even gravity moments J(2), J(4), J(6), and J(8). These can be used to better determine Jupiter's internal density profile and constrain its core mass. Yet the largest unknown on these gravity moments comes from the effect of differential rotation, which gives a degree of freedom unaccounted for by internal structure models. Here considering a wide range of possible internal flow structures and dynamical considerations, we provide upper bounds to the effect of dynamics (differential rotation) on the low-degree gravity moments. In light of the recent Juno gravity measurements and their small uncertainties, this allows differentiating between the various models suggested for Jupiter's internal structure.

Joint Sentinel-1 and SMAP data assimilation to improve soil moisture estimates	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Sentinel-1; SMAP; data assimilation; soil moisture	CLIMATE REFERENCE NETWORK; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER MODEL; VALIDATION	SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) radiometer observations at similar to 40 km resolution are routinely assimilated into the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model to generate the 9 km SMAP Level-4 Soil Moisture product. This study demonstrates that adding high-resolution radar observations from Sentinel-1 to the SMAP assimilation can increase the spatiotemporal accuracy of soil moisture estimates. Radar observations were assimilated either separately from or simultaneously with radiometer observations. Assimilation impact was assessed by comparing 3-hourly, 9 km surface and root-zone soil moisture simulations with in situ measurements from 9 km SMAP core validation sites and sparse networks, from May 2015 to December 2016. The Sentinel-1 assimilation consistently improved surface soil moisture, whereas root-zone impacts were mostly neutral. Relatively larger improvements were obtained from SMAP assimilation. The joint assimilation of SMAP and Sentinel-1 observations performed best, demonstrating the complementary value of radar and radiometer observations.

Continued retreat of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, controlled by bed topography and ocean circulation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						ice sheet dynamics; ocean; modeling; Antarctica; coupled model; Amundsen Sea	PINE ISLAND GLACIER; AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; MARINE ICE-SHEET; GROUNDING LINE RETREAT; BASAL MELT RATES; SHELF; SENSITIVITY; MODEL; WIDESPREAD; GREENLAND	The Amundsen Sea sector is experiencing the largest mass loss, glacier acceleration, and grounding line retreat in Antarctica. Enhanced intrusion of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf has been proposed as the primary forcing mechanism for the retreat. Here we investigate the dynamics and evolution of Thwaites Glacier with a novel, fully coupled, ice-ocean numerical model. We obtain a significantly improved agreement with the observed pattern of glacial retreat using the coupled model. Coupled simulations over the coming decades indicate a continued mass loss at a sustained rate. Uncoupled simulations using a depth-dependent parameterization of sub-ice-shelf melt significantly overestimate the rate of grounding line retreat compared to the coupled model, as the parameterization does not capture the complexity of the ocean circulation associated with the formation of confined cavities during the retreat. Bed topography controls the pattern of grounding line retreat, while oceanic thermal forcing impacts the rate of grounding line retreat. The importance of oceanic forcing increases with time as Thwaites grounding line retreats farther inland.

Here we simulate the glacier's evolution from 1985 to 2016 using a three-dimensional thermomechanical ice flow model. The model captures the timing and 90% of the observed changes by forcing the calving front. Basal drag in the trough is low, and lateral drag balances the ice stream's driving stress. The calving front position is the dominant control on changes of Jakobshavn Isbrae since the ice viscosity in the shear margins instantaneously drops in response to the stress perturbation caused by calving front retreat, which allows for widespread flow acceleration. Gradual shear margin warming contributes 5 to 10% to the total acceleration. Our simulations suggest that the glacier will contribute to eustatic sea level rise at a rate comparable to or higher than at present.

Sensitivity of CO2 surface flux constraints to observational coverage	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; GOSAT; SINKS; XCO2; VALIDATION; INVERSION	Inverse modeling of regional CO2 fluxes using atmospheric CO2 data is sensitive to the observational coverage of the observing network. Here we use the GEOS-Chem adjoint model to examine the sensitivity to CO2 fluxes of observations from the in situ surface network, the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2). We find that OCO-2 has high sensitivity to fluxes throughout the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, while surface observations have high sensitivity to fluxes in the northern extratropics throughout the year. For GOSAT viewing modes, ocean glint data provide the strongest constraints on fluxes in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere during Northern Hemisphere fall and winter relative to other viewing modes. In contrast, GOSAT nadir land data offer the greater sensitivity to fluxes in these regions during Northern Hemisphere spring and summer. For OCO-2 viewing modes, ocean glint data provided the dominant sensitivity to the surface fluxes in the northern subtropics, tropics, and Southern Hemisphere. We performed a series of inversion analyses using pseudodata and found that the varying sensitivities can result in large differences in regional flux estimates. However, combining measurements from different observing systems to exploit their complementarity may lead to a posteriori flux estimates with improved accuracy.	[Byrne, B.; Jones, D. B.

Observations of bromine monoxide transport in the Arctic sustained on aerosol particles	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							POLAR TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; BOUNDARY-LAYER; SEA-ICE; DEPLETION EVENTS; BRO COLUMNS; WIND-SPEED; MERCURY; CHEMISTRY; AIRBORNE; SUNRISE	The return of sunlight in the polar spring leads to the production of reactive halogen species from the surface snowpack, significantly altering the chemical composition of the Arctic near-surface atmosphere and the fate of long-range transported pollutants, including mercury. Recent work has shown the initial production of reactive bromine at the Arctic surface snowpack; however, we have limited knowledge of the vertical extent of this chemistry, as well as the lifetime and possible transport of reactive bromine aloft. Here, we present bromine monoxide (BrO) and aerosol particle measurements obtained during the March 2012 BRomine Ozone Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) near Utqiagvik (Barrow), AK. The airborne differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements provided an unprecedented level of spatial resolution, over 2 orders of magnitude greater than satellite observations and with vertical resolution unable to be achieved by satellite methods, for BrO in the Arctic. This novel method provided quantitative identification of a BrO plume, between 500m and 1 km aloft, moving at the speed of the air mass. Concurrent aerosol particle measurements suggest that this lofted reactive bromine plume was transported and maintained at elevated levels through heterogeneous reactions on colocated supermicron aerosol particles, independent of surface snowpack bromine chemistry. This chemical transport mechanism explains the large spatial extents often observed for reactive bromine chemistry, which impacts atmospheric composition and pollutant fate across the Arctic region, beyond areas of initial snowpack halogen production. The possibility of BrO enhancements disconnected from the surface potentially contributes to sustaining BrO in the free troposphere and must also be considered in the interpretation of satellite BrO column observations, particularly in the context of the rapidly changing Arctic sea ice and snowpack.

Large volcanic eruptions produce sulfur dioxide, which in turn produces aerosols; these eruptions thus represent a natural experiment through which to quantify aerosol-cloud interactions. Here we show that the massive 2014-2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets-consistent with expectations-but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around -0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.

Methane emissions from dairies in the Los Angeles Basin	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							4 CORNERS; TOP-DOWN; CO2; RETRIEVALS; MODEL; FTIR; VERIFICATION; FLUXES; MEXICO; ERRORS	We estimate the amount of methane (CH4) emitted by the largest dairies in the southern California region by combining measurements from four mobile solar-viewing ground-based spectrometers (EM27/SUN), in situ isotopic (CH4)-C-13/12 measurements from a CRDS analyzer (Picarro), and a high-resolution atmospheric transport simulation with a Weather Research and Forecasting model in large-eddy simulation mode (WRF-LES). The remote sensing spectrometers measure the total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CH4 and CO2 (X-CH4 and X-CO2) in the near infrared region, providing information on total emissions of the dairies at Chino. Differences measured between the four EM27/SUN ranged from 0.2 to 22 ppb (part per billion) and from 0.7 to 3 ppm (part per million) for X-CH4 and X-CO2, respectively. To assess the fluxes of the dairies, these differential measurements are used in conjunction with the local atmospheric dynamics from wind measurements at two local airports and from the WRF-LES simulations at 111 m resolution. Our top-down CH4 emissions derived using the Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) observations of 1.4 to 4.8 ppt s(-1) are in the low end of previous top-down estimates, consistent with reductions of the dairy farms and urbanization in the domain. However, the wide range of inferred fluxes points to the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of the sources and meteorology. Inverse modeling from WRF-LES is utilized to resolve the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions in the domain. Both the model and the measurements indicate heterogeneous emissions, with contributions from anthropogenic and biogenic sources at Chino. A Bayesian inversion and a Monte Carlo approach are used to provide the CH4 emissions of 2.2 to 3.5 ppt s(-1) at Chino.

J	Kwok, R; Pang, SS; Kacimi, S				Kwok, Ron; Pang, Shirley S.; Kacimi, Sahra			Sea ice drift in the Southern Ocean: Regional patterns, variability, and trends	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article							MOTION; WIND; TEMPERATURE; CIRCULATION; CLIMATE; SYSTEM; SAR	Understanding long-term changes in large-scale sea ice drift in the Southern Ocean is of considerable interest given its contribution to ice extent, to ice production in open waters, with associated dense water formation and heat flux to the atmosphere, and thus to the climate system. In this paper, we -examine the trends and variability of this ice drift in a 34-year record (1982-2015) derived from satellite -observations. Uncertainties in drift (similar to 3 to 4 km day-1) were assessed with higher resolution observations. In a linear model, drift speeds were similar to 1.4% of the geostrophic wind from reanalyzed sea-level pressure, nearly 50% higher than that of the Arctic. This result suggests an ice cover in the Southern Ocean that is thinner, weaker, and less compact. Geostrophic winds explained all but similar to 40% of the variance in ice drift. Three spatially distinct drift patterns were shown to be controlled by the location and depth of -atmospheric lows centered over the Amundsen, Riiser-Larsen, and Davis seas. Positively correlated changes in sea-level pressures at the three centers (up to 0.64) suggest correlated changes in the wind-driven drift patterns. Seasonal trends in ice edge are linked to trends in meridional winds and also to on-ice/ -off-ice trends in zonal winds, due to zonal asymmetry of the Antarctic ice cover. Sea ice area export at flux gates that parallel the 1000-m isobath were extended to cover the 34-year record. Interannual variability in ice export in the Ross and Weddell seas linked to the depth and location of the Amundsen Sea and Riiser-Larsen Sea lows to their east. Compared to shorter records, where there was a significant positive trend in Ross Sea ice area flux, the longer 34-year trends of outflow from both seas are now statistically insignificant.

AEGIS autonomous targeting for ChemCam on Mars Science Laboratory: Deployment and results of initial science team use	SCIENCE ROBOTICS			English	Article							GALE CRATER; INSTRUMENT SUITE; MISSION; ROCKS; UNIT	Limitations on interplanetary communications create operations latencies and slow progress in planetary surface missions, with particular challenges to narrow-field-of-view science instruments requiring precise targeting. The AEGIS (Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science) autonomous targeting system has been in routine use on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover since May 2016, selecting targets for the ChemCam remote geochemical spectrometer instrument. AEGIS operates in two modes; in autonomous target selection, it identifies geological targets in images from the rover's navigation cameras, choosing for itself targets that match the parameters specified by mission scientists the most, and immediately measures them with ChemCam, without Earth in the loop. In autonomous pointing refinement, the system corrects small pointing errors on the order of a few milliradians in observations targeted by operators on Earth, allowing very small features to be observed reliably on the first attempt. AEGIS consistently recognizes and selects the geological materials requested of it, parsing and interpreting geological scenes in tens to hundreds of seconds with very limited computing resources. Performance in autonomously selecting the most desired target material over the last 2.5 kilometers of driving into previously unexplored terrain exceeds 93% (where similar to 24% is expected without intelligent targeting), and all observations resulted in a successful geochemical observation. The system has substantially reduced lost time on the mission and markedly increased the pace of data collection with ChemCam. AEGIS autonomy has rapidly been adopted as an exploration tool by the mission scientists and has influenced their strategy for exploring the rover's environment.

A robotic device using gecko-inspired adhesives can grasp and manipulate large objects in microgravity	SCIENCE ROBOTICS			English	Article							DRY; FATIGUE; SOFT	Grasping and manipulating uncooperative objects in space is an emerging challenge for robotic systems. Many traditional robotic grasping techniques used on Earth are infeasible in space. Vacuum grippers require an atmosphere, sticky attachments fail in the harsh environment of space, and handlike opposed grippers are not suited for large, smooth space debris. We present a robotic gripper that can gently grasp, manipulate, and release both flat and curved uncooperative objects as large as a meter in diameter while in microgravity. This is enabled by (i) space-qualified gecko-inspired dry adhesives that are selectively turned on and off by the application of shear forces, (ii) a load-sharing system that scales small patches of these adhesives to large areas, and (iii) a nonlinear passive wrist that is stiff during manipulation yet compliant when overloaded. We also introduce and experimentally verify a model for determining the force and moment limits of such an adhesive system. Tests in microgravity show that robotic grippers based on dry adhesion are a viable option for eliminating space debris in low Earth orbit and for enhancing missions in space.

ISM Properties of a Massive Dusty Star-forming Galaxy Discovered at z similar to 7	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						early universe; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: star formation	EARLY UNIVERSE; MOLECULAR GAS; HIGH-REDSHIFT; REIONIZATION; STARBURSTS; TELESCOPE; EMISSION; CARBON; CORES; DISKS	We report the discovery and constrain the physical conditions of the interstellar medium of the highest-redshift millimeter-selected dusty star-forming galaxy to date, SPT-S J031132-5823.4 (hereafter SPT0311-58), at z = 6.900 +/- 0.002. SPT0311-58 was discovered via its 1.4 mm thermal dust continuum emission in the South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ survey. The spectroscopic redshift was determined through an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 3 mm frequency scan that detected CO(6-5), CO(7-6), and [C I](2-1), and subsequently was confirmed by detections of CO(3-2) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and[C II] with APEX. We constrain the properties of the ISM in SPT0311-58 with a radiative transfer analysis of the dust continuum photometry and the CO and [C I] line emission. This allows us to determine the gas content without ad hoc assumptions about gas mass scaling factors. SPT0311-58 is extremely massive, with an intrinsic gas mass of M-gas = 3.3 +/- 1.9 x 10(11) M-circle dot. Its large mass and intense star formation is very rare for a source well into the epoch of reionization.	[Strandet, M. L.; Weiss, A.; Rotermund, K.

Composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) on Cassini	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTROMETERS; MICHELSON INTERFEROMETER; TITANS ATMOSPHERE; ISOTOPIC-RATIOS; FOCAL-PLANE; SPECTROSCOPY; MISSION; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION	The Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn carries the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) designed to study thermal emission from Saturn and its rings and moons. CIRS, a Fourier transform spectrometer, is an indispensable part of the payload providing unique measurements and important synergies with the other instruments. It takes full advantage of Cassini's 13-year-long mission and surpasses the capabilities of previous spectrometers on Voyager 1 and 2. The instrument, consisting of two interferometers sharing a telescope and a scan mechanism, covers over a factor of 100 in wavelength in the mid and far infrared. It is used to study temperature, composition, structure, and dynamics of the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan, the rings of Saturn, and surfaces of the icy moons. CIRS has returned a large volume of scientific results, the culmination of over 30 years of instrument development, operation, data calibration, and analysis. As Cassini and CIRS reach the end of their mission in 2017, we expect that archived spectra will be used by scientists for many years to come. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America	[Jennings, D.

We also searched for, with shallower integrations, two other water transitions that sample warmer gas. The detection rate is low, and the upper limits provided by the observations are generally much lower than predictions of thermo-chemical models with canonical inputs. One ground-state transition is newly detected in the stacked spectrum of AA. Tau, DM. Tau, LkCa. 15, and MWC. 480. We run a grid of models to show that the abundance of gas-phase oxygen needs to be reduced by a factor of at least similar to 100 to be consistent with the observational upper limits (and positive detections) if a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 were to be assumed. As a continuation of previous ideas, we propose that the underlying reason for the depletion of oxygen (hence the low detection rate) is the freeze-out of volatiles such as water and CO onto dust grains followed by grain growth and settling/migration, which permanently removes these gas-phase molecules from the emissive upper layers of the outer disk. Such depletion of volatiles is likely ubiquitous among different disks, though not necessarily to the same degree. The volatiles might be returned back to the gas phase in the inner disk (less than or similar to 15 au), which is consistent with current constraints. Comparison with studies on disk dispersal due to photoevaporation indicates that the timescale for volatile depletion is shorter than that of photoevaporation.

Manipulating the ABCs of self-assembly via low-chi block polymer design	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						block polymer; self-assembly; polymer nanostructure; domain spacing; LAM(P)	PHASE-BEHAVIOR; MORPHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; TRIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; EQUILIBRIUM BEHAVIOR; DIBLOCK COPOLYMER; POLY(LACTIC ACID); ORDERED STRUCTURE; BINARY BLENDS; SEPARATION; HOMOPOLYMERS	Block polymer self-assembly typically translates molecular chain connectivity into mesoscale structure by exploiting incompatible blocks with large interaction parameters (chi(ij)). In this article, we demonstrate that the converse approach, encoding low-chi interactions in ABC bottlebrush triblock terpolymers (chi(AC) less than or similar to 0), promotes organization into a unique mixed-domain lamellar morphology, which we designate LAM(P). Transmission electron microscopy indicates that LAM(P) exhibits ACBC domain connectivity, in contrast to conventional three-domain lamellae (LAM(3)) with ABCB periods. Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering experiments reveal a strongly decreasing domain spacing with increasing total molar mass. Self-consistent field theory reinforces these observations and predicts that LAM(P) is thermodynamically stable below a critical chi(AC), above which LAM(3) emerges. Both experiments and theory expose close analogies to ABA' triblock copolymer phase behavior, collectively suggesting that low-(chi) interactions between chemically similar or distinct blocks intimately influence self-assembly. These conclusions provide fresh opportunities for block polymer design with potential consequences spanning all self-assembling soft materials.

Cavity QED analysis of an exciton-plasmon hybrid molecule via the generalized nonlocal optical response method	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; DIELECTRIC FUNCTION; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; DAMPING RATES; RESONANCE; PARTICLES; SIZE; DESIGN; BISTABILITY; FREQUENCIES	A metal nanoparticle coupled to a semiconductor quantum dot forms a tunable hybrid system which exhibits remarkable optical phenomena. Small metal nanoparticles possess nanocavitylike optical concentration capabilities due to the presence of strong dipolar excitation modes in the form of localized surface plasmons. Semiconductor quantum dots have strong luminescent capabilities widely used in many applications such as biosensing. When a quantum dot is kept in the vicinity of a metal nanoparticle, a dipole-dipole coupling occurs between the two nanoparticles giving rise to various optical signatures in the scattered spectra. This coupling makes the two nanoparticles behave like a single hybrid molecule. Hybrid molecules made of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and quantum dots (QDs) under the influence of an external driving field have been extensively studied in literature, using the local response approximation (LRA). However, such previous work in this area was not adequate to explain some experimental observations such as the size-dependent resonance shift of metal nanoparticles which becomes quite significant with decreasing diameter. The nonlocal response of metallic nanostructures which is hitherto disregarded by such studies is a main reason for such nonclassical effects. The generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) model provides a computationally less-demanding path to incorporate such properties into the theoretical models. It allows unified theoretical explanation of observed experimental phenomena which previously seemed to require ab initio microscopic theory. In this paper, we analyze the hybrid molecule in an external driving field as an open quantum system using a cavity-QED approach. In the process, we quantum mechanically model the dipole moment operator and the dipole response field of the metal nanoparticle taking the nonlocal effects into account. We observe that the spectra resulting from the GNOR based model effectively demonstrate the experimentally observed size dependent amplitude scaling, linewidth broadening, and resonance shift phenomena compared to the respective LRA counterparts. Then, we provide a comparison between our suggested GNOR based cavity-QED model and the conventional LRA model, where it becomes evident that our analytical model provides a close match to the experimentally suggested behavior. Furthermore, we show that the Rayleigh scattering spectra of the MNP-QD hybrid molecule possess an asymmetric Fano interference pattern that is tunable to suit various applications.

Results show that the WRF-Chem model successfully captures the distribution and magnitude of and variation in SJV aerosols during the cold season. However, aerosols are not well represented in the warm season. Aerosol simulations in urban areas during the cold season are sensitive to model horizontal resolution, with better simulations at 4 km resolution than at 20 km resolution, mainly due to inhomogeneous distribution of anthropogenic emissions and precipitation that is represented better in the 4 km simulation. In rural areas, the model sensitivity to grid size is rather small. Our observational analysis reveals that dust is a primary contributor to aerosols in the SJV, especially during the warm season. Aerosol simulations in the warm season are sensitive to the parameterization of dust emission in WRF-Chem. The GOCART (Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport) dust scheme produces very little dust in the SJV, while the DUSTRAN (DUST TRANsport model) scheme overestimates dust emission. Vertical mixing of aerosols is not adequately represented in the model based on CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared pathfinder Satellite Observation) aerosol extinction profiles. Improved representation of dust emission and vertical mixing in the boundary layer is needed for better simulations of aerosols during the warm season in the SJV.

The nadir brightness temperatures show that the Equatorial Zone is likely to be an ideal adiabat, which allows a determination of the deep ammonia abundance in the range 362-33+33ppm. The combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo method and Tikhonov regularization is studied to invert Jupiter's global ammonia distribution assuming a prescribed temperature profile. The result shows (1) that ammonia is depleted globally down to 50-60bars except within a few degrees of the equator, (2) the North Equatorial Belt is more depleted in ammonia than elsewhere, and (3) the ammonia concentration shows a slight inversion starting from about 7bars to 2bars. These results are robust regardless of the choice of water abundance. Plain Language Summary The distribution of ammonia gas on Jupiter's atmosphere was derived by fitting the microwave spectra measured by the Juno spacecraft. The result showed that the concentration of ammonia gas in the extratropics was much less than expected and had a local minimum near 7bars of pressure.

This study examines this possible effect with monthly satellite observations such as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cirrus fraction, and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes averaged over different tropical domains from March 2000 to October 2014. To confirm that high-level cirrus is relevant to this study, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization high cloud observations were also analyzed from June 2006 to December 2015. Our analysis revealed that the increase in sea surface temperature in the tropical western Pacific tends to concentrate convective cloud systems. This concentration effect very likely induces the significant reduction of both stratiform rain rate and cirrus fraction, without appreciable change in the convective rain rate. This reduction of stratiform rain rate and cirrus fraction cannot be found over its subregion or the tropical eastern Pacific, where the concentration effect of anvil cirrus is weak. Consistently, over the tropical western Pacific, the higher ratio of convective rain rate to total rain rate (i.e., precipitation efficiency) significantly correlates with warmer sea surface temperature and lower cirrus fraction. The reduced cirrus eventually increased outgoing longwave radiation to a greater degree than absorbed solar radiation. Finally, the negative relationship between precipitation efficiency and cirrus fraction tends to correspond to a low global equilibrium climate sensitivity in the models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. This suggests that tropical anvil cirrus clouds exert a negative climate feedback in strong association with precipitation efficiency. Plain Language Summary The Earth may have a cooling mechanism, so called the iris effect, under green house gas forcing, as if human eyes control the light influx. This feedback process of the tropical cloud to increased sea surface temperature is confirmed using various satellite observation. It is found that the precipitation efficiency increases as the temperature increases and the cirrus decreases as the precipitation efficiency increases in the tropical Western Pacific. This negative relationship suggests the presence of the cooling mechanism (negative feedback). Our climate models also tend to show lower warming rate if the observed negative relationship is properly mimicked, vice versa.

A k-means cluster analysis of TRMM and CloudSat matchups identifies three tropical cloud and precipitation regimes: the first two regimes correspond to, respectively, organized deep convection with heavy rain and cirrus anvils with moderate rain; the third regime is a convectively suppressed regime that can be further divided into three subregimes, which correspond to, respectively, stratocumulus clouds with drizzle, cirrus overlying low clouds, and nonprecipitating cumulus. Inclusion of CALIPSO data adds to the dynamic range of cloud properties and identifies one more cluster; subcluster analysis further identifies a thin, midlevel cloud regime associated with tropical mountain ranges. The radar-lidar cloud regimes are compared with the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) weather states (WSs) for the extended tropics. Focus is placed on the four convectively active WSs, namely, WS1-WS4. ISCCP WS1 and WS2 are found to be counterparts of Regime 1 and Regime 2 in radar-lidar observations, respectively. ISCCP WS3 and WS4, which are mainly isolated convection and broken, detached cirrus, do not have a strong association with any individual radar and lidar regimes, a likely effect of the different sampling strategies between ISCCP and active sensors and patchy cloudiness of these WSs.

A heavy ion and proton radiation belt inside of Jupiter's rings	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Juno; Jupiter; energetic particles; energetic neutral atoms ENA; CRAND; radiation belt	TRANSPORT; HYDROGEN; FLUXES; SYSTEM; TORUS	Energetic charged particle measurements by the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) on board Juno have revealed a radiation belt of hundreds of keV ions up to the atomic mass of sulfur, located between Jupiter's rings and atmosphere. Proton energy spectra display an unusual intensity increase above 300keV. We suggest that this is because charge exchange in Jupiter's neutral environment does not efficiently remove ions at such high energies. Since this innermost belt includes heavy ions, it cannot be exclusively supplied by cosmic ray albedo neutron decay, which is an important source at Earth and Saturn but only supplies protons and electrons. We find indications that the stripping of energetic neutral atoms in Jupiter's high atmosphere might be the ion source. Since the stripped off electrons are of low energy, this hypothesis is consistent with observations of the ratio of energetic electrons to ions being much less than 1. Plain Language Summary Planets with their own a magnetic field, as Earth and Jupiter, are surrounded by "belts" of radiation. In case of Jupiter, most of this radiation extends to relatively large distances to Jupiter ( several times the size of the planet) but is so strong that it is difficult to engineer satellites that can fly through them safely. Juno is the first spacecraft that repeatedly passes close to Jupiter and its Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument ( JEDI) was now able to measure and quantify a small, separate radiation belt close to Jupiter. The measured population was unknown before and is located between Jupiter's atmosphere and its tenuous rings, inward to the main radiation belt.	[Kollmann, P.; Paranicas, C.; Clark, G.; Mauk, B.

Infrared observations of Jovian aurora from Juno's first orbits: Main oval and satellite footprints	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						aurora; Jupiter	IO FLUX TUBE; ULTRAVIOLET; JUPITER; EMISSION; IONOSPHERE; MORPHOLOGY; SPOTS; MODEL	The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) is an imager/spectrometer on board NASA/Juno mission for the study of the Jovian aurorae. The first results of JIRAM's imager channel observations of the H-3(+) infrared emission, collected around the first Juno perijove, provide excellent spatial and temporal distribution of the Jovian aurorae, and show the morphology of the main ovals, the polar regions, and the footprints of Io, Europa and Ganymede. The extended Io tail persists for similar to 3h after the passage of the satellite flux tube. Multi-arc structures of varied spatial extent appear in both main auroral ovals. Inside the main ovals, intense, localized emissions are observed. In the southern aurora, an evident circular region of strong depletion of H-3(+) emissions is partially surrounded by an intense emission arc. The southern aurora is brighter than the north one in these observations. Similar, probably conjugate emission patterns are distinguishable in both polar regions.

Independent evolution of stratospheric temperatures in Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions from 2014 to 2016	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						aurora; stratosphere; Juno	POLAR ATMOSPHERE; HAZE FORMATION; EMISSION; CHEMISTRY; IRIS	We present retrievals of the vertical temperature profile of Jupiter's high latitudes from Infrared Telescope Facility-Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph measurements acquired on 10-11 December 2014 and 30 April to 1 May 2016. Over this time range, 1mbar temperature in Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions exhibited independent evolution. The northern auroral hot spot exhibited negligible net change in temperature at 1mbar and its longitudinal position remained fixed at 180 degrees W (System III), whereas the southern auroral hot spot exhibited a net increase in temperature of 11.1 5.2K at 0.98mbar and its longitudinal orientation moved west by approximately 30 degrees. This southern auroral stratospheric temperature increase might be related to (1) near-contemporaneous brightening of the southern auroral ultraviolet/near-infrared H3+ emission measured by the Juno spacecraft and (2) an increase in the solar dynamical pressure in the preceding 3days. We therefore suggest that 1mbar temperature in the southern auroral region might be modified by higher-energy charged particle precipitation.	[Sinclair, J. A.; Orton, G.

The quantitative water mass budget in the TP is poorly known. Here we examine annual changes in lake area, level, and volume during 1970s-2015. We find that a complex pattern of lake volume changes during 1970s-2015: a slight decrease of -2.78Gtyr(-1) during 1970s-1995, followed by a rapid increase of 12.53Gtyr(-1) during 1996-2010, and then a recent deceleration (1.46Gtyr(-1)) during 2011-2015. We then estimated the recent water mass budget for the Inner TP, 2003-2009, including changes in terrestrial water storage, lake volume, glacier mass, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and permafrost. The dominant components of water mass budget, namely, changes in lake volume (7.720.63Gtyr(-1)) and groundwater storage (5.011.59Gtyr(-1)), increased at similar rates. We find that increased net precipitation contributes the majority of water supply (74%) for the lake volume increase, followed by glacier mass loss (13%), and ground ice melt due to permafrost degradation (12%). Other term such as SWE (1%) makes a relatively small contribution. These results suggest that the hydrologic cycle in the TP has intensified remarkably during recent decades.

Atmospheric rivers in 20 year weather and climate simulations: A multimodel, global evaluation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						atmospheric rivers; weather; climate simulations; model evaluation	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; FUTURE CHANGES; UNITED-STATES; WEST-COAST; MOISTURE; PERFORMANCE; CALIFORNIA; ALGORITHM; FREQUENCY	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, elongated, synoptic jets of water vapor that play important roles in the global water cycle and meteorological/hydrological extremes. Increasing evidence shows that ARs have signatures and impacts in many regions across different continents. However, global-scale characterizations of AR representations in weather and climate models have been very limited. Using a recently developed AR detection algorithm oriented for global applications, the representation of AR activities in multidecade weather/climate simulations is evaluated. The algorithm is applied to 6-hourly (daily) integrated water vapor transport (IVT) from 22 (2) global weather/climate models that participated in the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Atmospheric System Study-Year of Tropical Convection Multimodel Experiment, including four models with ocean-atmosphere coupling and two models with superparameterization. Multiple reanalysis products are used as references to help quantify model errors in the context of reanalysis uncertainty. Model performance is examined for key aspects of ARs (frequency, intensity, geometry, and seasonality), with the focus on identifying and understanding systematic errors in simulated ARs. The results highlight the range of model performances relative to reanalysis uncertainty in representing the most basic features of ARs. Among the 17 metrics considered, AR frequency, zonal IVT, fractional zonal circumference, fractional total meridional IVT, and three seasonality metrics have consistently large errors across all models. Possible connections between AR simulation qualities and aspects of model configurations are discussed. Despite the lack of a monotonic relationship, the importance of model horizontal resolution to the overall quality of AR simulation is suggested by the evaluation results.

On the impact of granularity of space-based urban CO2 emissions in urban atmospheric inversions: A case study for Indianapolis, IN	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article							INVENTORY; QUANTIFICATION; CH4	Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cities is a key challenge towards effective emissions management. An inversion analysis from the INdianapolis FLUX experiment (INFLUX) project, as the first of its kind, has achieved a top-down emission estimate for a single city using CO2 data collected by the dense tower network deployed across the city. However, city-level emission data, used as a priori emissions, are also a key component in the atmospheric inversion framework. Currently, fine-grained emission inventories (EIs) able to resolve GHG city emissions at high spatial resolution, are only available for few major cities across the globe. Following the INFLUX inversion case with a global 1 x 1 km ODIAC fossil fuel CO2 emission dataset, we further improved the ODIAC emission field and examined its utility as a prior for the city scale inversion. We disaggregated the 1 x 1 km ODIAC non-point source emissions using geospatial datasets such as the global road network data and satellite-data driven surface imperviousness data to a 30 x 30 m resolution. We assessed the impact of the improved emission field on the inversion result, relative to priors in previous studies (Hestia and ODIAC). The posterior total emission estimate (5.1 MtC/yr) remains statistically similar to the previous estimate with ODIAC (5.3 MtC/yr). However, the distribution of the flux corrections was very close to those of Hestia inversion and the model-observation mismatches were significantly reduced both in forward and inverse runs, even without hourly temporal changes in emissions. EIs reported by cities often do not have estimates of spatial extents. Thus, emission disaggregation is a required step when verifying those reported emissions using atmospheric models. Our approach offers gridded emission estimates for global cities that could serves as a prior for inversion, even without locally reported EIs in a systematic way to support city-level Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) practice implementation.

In this paper, we describe the comparisons between the first major release of the OCO-2 retrieval algorithm (B7r) and X-CO2 from OCO-2's primary ground-based validation network: the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The OCO-2 X-CO2 retrievals, after filtering and bias correction, agree well when aggregated around and coincident with TCCON data in nadir, glint, and target observation modes, with absolute median differences less than 0.4 ppm and RMS differences less than 1.5 ppm. After bias correction, residual biases remain. These biases appear to depend on latitude, surface properties, and scattering by aerosols. It is thus crucial to continue measurement comparisons with TCCON to monitor and evaluate the OCO-2 X-CO2 data quality throughout its mission.

Considering the information in the galaxy power spectrum, we here derive the properties of a galaxy clustering survey that would optimize constraints on primordial nonGaussianity using this technique. Specifically, we ask the question of what survey design is needed to reach a precision sigma(f(N)(loc)) approximate to 1. To answer this question, we calculate the sensitivity to f(NL)(loc) as a function of galaxy number density, redshift accuracy and sky coverage. We include the multitracer technique, which helps minimize cosmic variance noise, by considering the possibility of dividing the galaxy sample into stellar mass bins. We show that the ideal survey for f(NL)(loc) looks very different than most galaxy redshift surveys scheduled for the near future. Since those are more or less optimized for measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, they typically require spectroscopic redshifts. On the contrary, to optimize the f(NL)(loc) measurement, a deep, wide, multiband imaging survey is preferred. An uncertainty sigma(f(NL)(loc)) = 1 can be reached with a full-sky survey that is complete to an i-band AB magnitude i approximate to 23 and has a number density similar to 8 arcmin(-2). Requirements on the multiband photometry are set by a modest photo-z accuracy sigma(z)/(1 + z) < 0.1 and the ability to measure stellar mass with a precision similar to 0.2 dex or better (or another proxy for halo mass with equivalent scatter). Finally, we estimate that for the idealized case of a survey measuring all halos down to a mass 10(10)h(-1) M-circle dot on the full sky out to high redshift, in principle a precision of order sigma(f(NL)) similar to 0.1 can be achieved.

Despite considerable advances, the experimental detection still presents difficulties such as advected aerosol layers coupled to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) which usually produces an overestimation of the z(PBL). To improve the detection of the z(PBL) in these complex atmospheric situations, we present a new algorithm, called POLARIS (PBL height estimation based on lidar depolarisation). POLARIS applies the wavelet covariance transform (WCT) to the range-corrected signal (RCS) and to the perpendicular-to-parallel signal ratio (delta) profiles. Different candidates for z(PBL) are chosen and the selection is done based on the WCT applied to the RCS and delta. We use two ChArMEx (Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment) campaigns with lidar and microwave radiometer (MWR) measurements, conducted in 2012 and 2013, for the POLARIS' adjustment and validation. POLARIS improves the z(PBL) detection compared to previous methods based on lidar measurements, especially when an aerosol layer is coupled to the PBL. We also compare the z(PBL) provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction (NWP) model with respect to the z(PBL) determined with POLARIS and the MWR under Saharan dust events.

Lensing of Fast Radio Bursts by Plasma Structures in Host Galaxies	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: distances and redshifts; galaxies: ISM; scattering; stars: individual (FRB 121102); stars: magnetars; stars: neutron	EXTREME SCATTERING EVENTS; COLD NEUTRAL MEDIUM; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; FRB 121102; CRAB PULSAR; CAUSTICS; DISTANCES; LENSES; MODEL	The amplitudes of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be strongly modulated by plasma lenses in their host galaxies, including that of the repeating FRB 121102 at similar to 1 Gpc luminosity distance. Caustics require the lens' dispersion measure depth (DMl), scale size (a), and distance from the source (d(sl)) to satisfy DM(l)d(sl)/a(2) greater than or similar to 0.65 pc(2) au(-2) cm(-3) . Caustics produce strong magnifications (less than or similar to 10(2)) on short timescales (less than or similar to hours to days) that appear as narrow spectral peaks (0.1-1 GHz). They also suppress the flux density in longer-duration (similar to months) troughs. Multiply imaged bursts will arrive differentially by < 1 mu s to tens of ms with different apparent dispersion measures, delta DM similar to 1 pc cm(-3). When differing by less than the burst width, interference effects in dynamic spectra will be seen. Larger arrival time perturbations may mask any underlying periodicity with period less than or similar to 1 s. Strong lensing requires sources smaller than (Fresnel scale)(2)/a, which includes compact objects such as neutron star magnetospheres but excludes active galactic nuclei. We discuss constraints on densities, magnetic fields, and locations of plasma lenses related to the conditions needed for lensing to occur. Much of the phenomenology of the repeating FRB source FRB 121102 can be accounted for in this picture, which can be tested by obtaining wideband spectra of bursts (from < 1 to 10 GHz and possibly higher) that will also help characterize the plasma environment near FRB sources. A rich variety of phenomena is expected from an ensemble of lenses near an FRB source.	[Cordes, J. M.; Wasserman, I.; Chatterjee, S.; Wharton, R.

We present a new matched-filter algorithm for direct detection of point sources in the immediate vicinity of bright stars. The stellar point-spread function (PSF) is first subtracted using a Karhunen-Love image processing (KLIP) algorithm with angular and spectral differential imaging (ADI and SDI). The KLIP-induced distortion of the astrophysical signal is included in the matched-filter template by computing a forward model of the PSF at every position in the image. To optimize the performance of the algorithm, we conduct extensive planet injection and recovery tests and tune the exoplanet spectra template and KLIP reduction aggressiveness to maximize the signalto- noise ratio (S/N) of the recovered planets. We show that only two spectral templates are necessary to recover any young Jovian exoplanets with minimal S/N loss. We also developed a complete pipeline for the automated detection of point-source candidates, the calculation of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), contrast curves based on. false positives, and completeness contours. We process in a uniform manner more than 330 data sets from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey and assess GPI typical sensitivity as a function of the star and the hypothetical companion spectral type. This work allows for the first time a comparison of different detection algorithms at a survey scale accounting for both planet completeness and false-positive rate. We show that the new forward model matched filter allows the detection of 50% fainter objects than a conventional cross-correlation technique with a Gaussian PSF template for the same false-positive rate.

We discuss the survey's aims and objectives. We describe the rationale behind the survey, and the questions that. the survey will aim to answer. The most important of these is the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process on the scale of individual filaments and cores in dense regions. We describe the data acquisition and reduction processes for POL-2, demonstrating both repeatability and consistency with previous data. We present a first-look analysis of the first results from the BISTRO survey in the OMC 1 region. We see that the magnetic field lies approximately perpendicular to the famous "integral filament" in the densest regions of that filament. Furthermore, we see an "hourglass" magnetic field morphology extending beyond the densest region of the integral filament into the less-dense surrounding material, and discuss possible causes for this. We also discuss the more complex morphology seen along the Orion Bar region. We examine the morphology of the field along the lower-density northeastern filament. We find consistency with previous theoretical models that predict magnetic fields lying parallel to low-density, non-self-gravitating filaments, and perpendicular to higher-density, self-gravitating filaments.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DENSITY PERTURBATIONS; MODELS; CONSTRAINTS; FLATNESS; UNIVERSE; HORIZON	Future galaxy surveys promise to probe local primordial non-Gaussianity at unprecedented precision, sigma(f(NL)) less than or similar to 1 We study the implications for multifield inflation by considering spectator models, where inflation is driven by the inflaton field, but the primordial perturbations are (partially) generated by a second, spectator field. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo likelihood analysis using Planck data to study quantitative predictions for fNL and other observables for a range of such spectator models. We show that models where the primordial perturbations are dominated by the spectator field, while fine-tuned within the broader parameter space, typically predict fNL of order unity. Therefore, upcoming galaxy clustering measurements will constitute a stringent test of whether or not the generation of primordial perturbations and the accelerated expansion in the inflationary universe are due to separate phenomena.

Looking through the same lens: Shear calibration for LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST with stage 4 CMB lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; SOUTH-POLE TELESCOPE; SCIENCE VERIFICATION DATA; MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; DARK ENERGY SURVEY; COSMIC SHEAR; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; GALAXY ALIGNMENTS; CROSS-CORRELATION; COVARIANCE MATRICES	The next-generation weak lensing surveys (i.e., LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST) will require exquisite control over systematic effects. In this paper, we address shear calibration and present the most realistic forecast to date for LSST/Euclid/WFIRSTand CMB lensing from a stage 4 CMB experiment ("CMB S4"). We use the COSMOLIKE code to simulate a joint analysis of all the two-point functions of galaxy density, galaxy shear, and CMB lensing convergence. We include the full Gaussian and non-Gaussian covariances and explore the resulting joint likelihood with Monte Carlo Markov chains. We constrain shear calibration biases while simultaneously varying cosmological parameters, galaxy biases, and photometric redshift uncertainties. We find that CMB lensing from CMB S4 enables the calibration of the shear biases down to 0.2%-3% in ten tomographic bins for LSST (below the similar to 0.5% requirements in most tomographic bins), down to 0.4%-2.4% in ten bins for Euclid, and 0.6%-3.2% in ten bins for WFIRST. For a given lensing survey, the method works best at high redshift where shear calibration is otherwise most challenging. This self-calibration is robust to Gaussian photometric redshift uncertainties and to a reasonable level of intrinsic alignment.

Multi-temporal radar mosaics were manually interpreted for evidence of loss and gain in forest extent and its associated driver. Mangrove loss as a consequence of human activities was observed across their entire range. Between 1996-2010 12% of the 1168 1 degrees x1 degrees radar mosaic tiles examined contained evidence of mangrove loss, as a consequence of anthropogenic degradation, with this increasing to 38% when combined with evidence of anthropogenic activity prior to 1996. The greatest proportion of loss was observed in Southeast Asia, whereby approximately 50% of the tiles in the region contained evidence of mangrove loss, corresponding to 18.4% of the global mangrove forest tiles. Southeast Asia contained the greatest proportion (33.8%) of global mangrove forest. The primary driver of anthropogenic mangrove loss was found to be the conversion of mangrove to aquaculture/agriculture, although substantial advance of mangroves was also evident in many regions.

Tightening of tropical ascent and high clouds key to precipitation change in a warmer climate	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; CIRCULATION CHANGES; CONSTRAINT; FEEDBACK; MODEL; CMIP5; SENSITIVITY; IMPACTS	The change of global-mean precipitation under global warming and interannual variability is predominantly controlled by the change of atmospheric longwave radiative cooling. Here we show that tightening of the ascending branch of the Hadley Circulation coupled with a decrease in tropical high cloud fraction is key in modulating precipitation response to surface warming. The magnitude of high cloud shrinkage is a primary contributor to the intermodel spread in the changes of tropical-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and global-mean precipitation per unit surface warming (dP/dT(s)) for both interannual variability and global warming. Compared to observations, most Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 models underestimate the rates of interannual tropical-mean dOLR/dT(s) and global-mean dP/dT(s), consistent with the muted tropical high cloud shrinkage. We find that the five models that agree with the observation-based interannual dP/dT(s) all predict dP/dT(s) under global warming higher than the ensemble mean dP/dT(s) from the similar to 20 models analysed in this study.

Here, we evaluate bottom water temperature as a potential driver for hydrate dissociation and methane release from a recently discovered, gas-hydrate-bearing system south of Spitsbergen (Storfjordrenna, similar to 380m water depth). Modelling of the non-steady-state porewater profiles and observations of distinct layers of methane-derived authigenic carbonate nodules in the sediments indicate centurial to millennial methane emissions in the region. Results of temperature modelling suggest limited impact of short-term warming on gas hydrates deeper than a few metres in the sediments. We conclude that the ongoing and past methane emission episodes at the investigated sites are likely due to the episodic ventilation of deep reservoirs rather than warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation in this shallow water seep site.

A global wetland methane emissions and uncertainty dataset for atmospheric chemical transport models (WetCHARTs version 1.0)	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							PROGRAM MULTISCALE SYNTHESIS; HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; CH4 EMISSIONS; AMAZON BASIN; CARBON; FLUXES; NORTHERN; SURFACE; GOSAT	Wetland emissions remain one of the principal sources of uncertainty in the global atmospheric methane (CH4) budget, largely due to poorly constrained process controls on CH4 production in waterlogged soils. Process-based estimates of global wetland CH4 emissions and their associated uncertainties can provide crucial prior information for model-based top-down CH4 emission estimates. Here we construct a global wetland CH4 emission model ensemble for use in atmospheric chemical transport models (WetCHARTs version 1.0). Our 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution model ensemble is based on satellite-derived surface water extent and precipitation reanalyses, nine heterotrophic respiration simulations (eight carbon cycle models and a data-constrained terrestrial carbon cycle analysis) and three temperature dependence parameterizations for the period 2009-2010; an extended ensemble subset based solely on precipitation and the data-constrained terrestrial carbon cycle analysis is derived for the period 2001-2015. We incorporate the mean of the full and extended model ensembles into GEOS-Chem and compare the model against surface measurements of atmospheric CH4; the model performance (site-level and zonal mean anomaly residuals) compares favourably against published wetland CH4 emissions scenarios. We find that uncertainties in carbon decomposition rates and the wetland extent together account for more than 80% of the dominant uncertainty in the timing, magnitude and seasonal variability in wetland CH4 emissions, although uncertainty in the temperature CH4 : C dependence is a significant contributor to seasonal variations in mid-latitude wetland CH4 emissions. The combination of satellite, carbon cycle models and temperature dependence parameterizations provides a physically informed structural a priori uncertainty that is critical for topdown estimates of wetland CH4 fluxes. Specifically, our ensemble can provide enhanced information on the prior CH4 emission uncertainty and the error covariance structure, as well as a means for using posterior flux estimates and their uncertainties to quantitatively constrain the biogeochemical process controls of global wetland CH4 emissions.

Unlike the microgravity environment of space, there is a directionality that gives rise, over time, to strangely familiar geologic textures and landforms. In addition to advancing planetary science, and furthering technologies for hazardous asteroid mitigation and in situ resource utilization, simplified access to long-duration milligravity offers significant potential for advancing human spaceflight, biomedicine and manufacturing. We show that a commodity 3U (10 x 10 x 34 cm(3)) cubesat containing a laboratory of loose materials can be spun to 1 r.p.m. = 2p/60 s(-1) on its long axis, creating a centrifugal force equivalent to the surface gravity of a kilometer-sized asteroid. We describe the first flight demonstration, where small meteorite fragments will pile up to create a patch of real regolith under realistic asteroid conditions, paving the way for subsequent missions where landing and mobility technology can be flight-proven in the operational environment, in low-Earth orbit. The 3U design can be adapted for use onboard the International Space Station to allow for variable gravity experiments under ambient temperature and pressure for a broader range of experiments.

Geological reconstructions from Curiosity rover data have revealed an ancient, habitable lake environment fed by rivers draining into the crater. We synthesize geochemical and mineralogical data from lake-bed mudstones collected during the first 1300 martian solar days of rover operations in Gale. We present evidence for lake redox stratification, established by depth-dependent variations in atmospheric oxidant and dissolved-solute concentrations. Paleoclimate proxy data indicate that a transition from colder to warmer climate conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy. Finally, a late phase of geochemical modification by saline fluids is recognized.	[Hurowitz, J. A.; McLennan, S. M.; Siebach, K.

For this reason, techniques need to be developed that permit autonomous determination of sampling directives based on science goals and responses to in situ, remote-sensing, and model-derived information. Techniques that can accommodate large arrays of assets and permit sustained observations of rapidly evolving ocean properties are especially needed for capturing interactions between physical circulation and biogeochemical cycling. Here we document the first field program of the Satellites to Seafloor project, designed to enable a closed loop of numerical model prediction, vehicle path-planning, in situ path implementation, data collection, and data assimilation for future model predictions. We present results from the first of two field programs carried out in Monterey Bay, California, over a period of three months in 2016. While relatively modest in scope, this approach provides a step toward an observing array that makes use of multiple information streams to update and improve sampling strategies without human intervention.

The aim of this work is to constrain properties of the disk around the archetype FU Orionis object, FU Ori, with as good as similar to 25 au resolution. Methods. We resolved FU Ori at 29-37 GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in the A-array configuration, which provided the highest possible angular resolution to date at this frequency band (similar to 0 ''.07). We also performed complementary JVLA 8-10 GHz observations, Submillimeter Array (SMA) 224 GHz and 272 GHz observations, and compared these with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 346 GHz observations to obtain the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Results. Our 8-10 GHz observations do not find evidence for the presence of thermal radio jets, and constrain the radio jet/wind flux to at least 90 times lower than the expected value from the previously reported bolometric luminosity-radio luminosity correlation. The emission at frequencies higher than 29 GHz may be dominated by the two spatially unresolved sources, which are located immediately around FU Ori and its companion FU Ori S, respectively. Their deconvolved radii at 33 GHz are only a few au, which is two orders of magnitude smaller in linear scale than the gaseous disk revealed by the previous Subaru-HiCIAO 1.6 mu m coronagraphic polarization imaging observations. We are struck by the fact that these two spatially compact sources contribute to over 50% of the observed fluxes at 224 GHz, 272 GHz, and 346 GHz. The 8-346 GHz SEDs of FU Ori and FU Ori S cannot be fit by constant spectral indices (over frequency), although we cannot rule out that it is due to the time variability of their (sub)millimeter fluxes. Conclusions. The more sophisticated models for SEDs considering the details of the observed spectral indices in the millimeter bands suggest that the >29 GHz emission is contributed by a combination of free-free emission from ionized gas and thermal emission from optically thick and optically thin dust components. We hypothesize that dust in the innermost parts of the disks (less than or similar to 0.1 au) has been sublimated, and thus the disks are no longer well shielded against the ionizing photons. The estimated overall gas and dust mass based on SED modeling, can be as high as a fraction of a solar mass, which is adequate for developing disk gravitational instability. Our present explanation for the observational data is that the massive inflow of gas and dust due to disk gravitational instability or interaction with a companion/intruder, was piled up at the few-au scale due to the development of a deadzone with negligible ionization. The piled up material subsequently triggered the thermal instability and the magnetorotational instability when the ionization fraction in the inner sub-au scale region exceeded a threshold value, leading to the high protostellar accretion rate.

A new unified approach to determine geocentre motion using space geodetic and GRACE gravity data	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Global change from geodesy; Loading of the Earth; Satellite geodesy; Time variable gravity	SEA-LEVEL; GNSS; COMBINATION; OCEAN; FIELD	Geocentre motion between the centre-of-mass of the Earth system and the centre-of-figure of the solid Earth surface is a critical signature of degree-1 components of global surface mass transport process that includes sea level rise, ice mass imbalance and continental-scale hydrological change. To complement GRACE data for complete-spectrum mass transport monitoring, geocentre motion needs to be measured accurately. However, current methods of geodetic translational approach and global inversions of various combinations of geodetic deformation, simulated ocean bottom pressure and GRACE data contain substantial biases and systematic errors. Here, we demonstrate a new and more reliable unified approach to geocentre motion determination using a recently formed satellite laser ranging based geocentric displacement time-series of an expanded geodetic network of all four space geodetic techniques and GRACE gravity data. The unified approach exploits both translational and deformational signatures of the displacement data, while the addition of GRACE's near global coverage significantly reduces biases found in the translational approach and spectral aliasing errors in the inversion.

A New Spectral Feature on the Trailing Hemisphere of Europa at 3.78 mu m	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: composition; planets and satellites: individual (Europa); planets and satellites: surfaces	SULFURIC-ACID; CARBONIC-ACID; WATER-ICE; SURFACE; IO; SPECTROMETER; BOMBARDMENT; IMPLANTATION; SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE	We present hemispherically resolved spectra of the surface of Europa from similar to 3.1-4.13 mu m, which we obtained using the near-infrared spectrometer NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope. These include the first high-quality L-band spectra of the surface to extend beyond 4 mu m. In our data, we identify a previously unseen spectral feature at 3.78 mu m on the trailing hemisphere. The longitudinal distribution of the feature is consistent with that of a radiolytic product created by electron or Iogenic ion bombardment. This feature is coincident with an absorption feature of SO2 frost seen in both laboratory spectra and spectra of Io. However, the corresponding, typically stronger 4.07 mu m feature of SO2 frost is absent from our data. This result is contrary to the suggested detection of SO2 at 4.05 mu m in Galileo NIMS data of the trailing hemisphere, which was severely affected by radiation noise. We use simple spectral modeling to argue that the 3.78 mu m feature is not easily explained by the presence of SO2 frost on the surface. We explore alternative explanations and discuss other potential candidate species.

Perspectives from Ground-Based and Spaceborne Radars	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							CLOUD PROFILING RADAR; MOSAIC QPE; PRODUCT; SYSTEM; NETWORK	High temporal and spatial resolution observations of precipitation occurrence from the NEXRAD-based Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system are compared to matched observations from CloudSat for 3 years over the contiguous United States (CONUS). Across the CONUS, precipitation is generally reported more frequently by CloudSat (7.8%) than by MRMS (6.3%), with dependence on factors such as the NEXRAD beam height, the near-surface air temperature, and the surface elevation. There is general agreement between ground-based and satellite-derived precipitation events over flat surfaces, especially in widespread precipitation events and when the NEXRAD beam heights are low. Within 100 km of the nearest NEXRAD site, MRMS reports a precipitation frequency of 7.54% while CloudSat reports 7.38%. However, further inspection reveals offsetting biases between the products, where CloudSat reports more snow and MRMS reports more rain. The magnitudes of these discrepancies correlate with elevation, but they are observed in both the complex terrain of the Rocky Mountains and the relatively flat midwestern areas of the CONUS. The findings advocate for caution when using MRMS frequency and accumulations in complex terrain, when temperatures are below freezing, and at ranges greater than 100 km. A multiresolution analysis shows that no more than 1.88% of CloudSat pixels over flat terrain are incorrectly identified as nonprecipitating as a result of shallow showers residing the CloudSat clutter-filled blind zone when near-surface air temperatures are above 158 degrees C.

Daily rainfall fields were simulated at 24-km resolution using the NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) Model for June-August 2000. Four cumulus parameterization schemes and two options for shallow cumulus components in a specific scheme were tested. The spread in the domain-mean rainfall rates across the parameterization schemes was generally consistent between the entire CONUS and most subregions. The selection of the shallow cumulus component in a specific scheme had more impact than that of the four cumulus parameterization schemes. Regional variability in the performance of each scheme was assessed by calculating optimally weighted ensembles that minimize full root-mean-square errors against reference datasets. The spatial pattern of the seasonally averaged rainfall was insensitive to the selection of cumulus parameterization over mountainous regions because of the topographical pattern constraint, so that the simulation errors were mostly attributed to the overall bias there. In contrast, the spatial patterns over the Great Plains regions as well as the temporal variation over most parts of the CONUS were relatively sensitive to cumulus parameterization selection. Overall, adopting a single simulation result was preferable to generating a better ensemble for the seasonally averaged daily rainfall simulation, as long as their overall biases had the same positive or negative sign. However, an ensemble of multiple simulation results was more effective in reducing errors in the case of also considering temporal variation.

On the use of a snow aridity index to predict remotely sensed forest productivity in the presence of bark beetle disturbance	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							RIO-GRANDE HEADWATERS; MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE; WATER EQUIVALENT; HIGH-ELEVATION; COVER DATA; TREE MORTALITY; SEVERE DROUGHT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BOREAL FOREST; UNITED-STATES	We used multiple sources of remotely sensed and ground based information to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of snowpack accumulation, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) throughout the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion, USA. Relationships between these variables were used to establish baseline values of expected forest productivity given water and energy inputs. Although both the snow water equivalent (SWE) and a snow aridity index (SAI), which used SWE to normalize PET, were significant predictors of the long-term (1989-2012) NDVI, SAI explained 11% more NDVI variability than SWE. Deviations from these relationships were subsequently explored in the context of widespread forest mortality due to bark beetles. Over the entire study area, NDVI was lower per unit SAI in beetle-disturbed compared to undisturbed areas during snow-related drought; however, both SAI and NDVI were spatially heterogeneous within this domain. As a result, we selected three focus areas inside the larger study area within which to isolate the relative impacts of SAI and disturbance on NDVI using multivariate linear regression. These models explained 66%-85% of the NDVI and further suggested that both SAI and disturbance effects were significant, although the disturbance effect was generally greater. These results establish the utility of SAI as a measure of moisture limitation in snow-dominated systems and demonstrate a reduction in forest productivity due to bark beetle disturbance that is particularly evident during drought conditions resultant from low snow accumulation during the winter.

An isolated, bright cusp aurora at Saturn	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Saturn; aurora; cusp; reconnection; magnetosphere	INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; PLANETARY PERIOD OSCILLATIONS; WIND DYNAMIC PRESSURE; ALIGNED CURRENTS; POLAR CUSP; MAGNETOSPHERE; RECONNECTION; MAGNETOPAUSE; MAGNETOTAIL	Saturn's dayside aurora displays a number of morphological features poleward of the main emission region. We present an unusual morphology captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on 14 June 2014 (day 165), where for 2 h, Saturn's FUV aurora faded almost entirely, with the exception of a distinct emission spot at high latitude. The spot remained fixed in local time between 10 and 15 LT and moved poleward to a minimum colatitude of similar to 4 degrees. It was bright and persistent, displaying intensities of up to 49 kR over a lifetime of 2 h. Interestingly, the spot constituted the entirety of the northern auroral emission, with no emissions present at any other local time-including Saturn's characteristic dawn arc, the complete absence of which is rarely observed. Solar wind parameters from propagation models, together with a Cassini magnetopause crossing and solar wind encounter, indicate that Saturn's magnetosphere was likely to have been embedded in a rarefaction region, resulting in an expanded magnetosphere configuration during the interval. We infer that the spot was sustained by reconnection either poleward of the cusp or at low latitudes under a strong component of interplanetary magnetic field transverse to the solar wind flow. The subsequent poleward motion could then arise from either reconfiguration of successive open field lines across the polar cap or convection of newly opened field lines. We also consider the possible modulation of the feature by planetary period rotating current systems.	[Kinrade, J.; Badman, S. V.; Grocott, A.; Gray, R. L.; Arridge, C.

Electron impact study of the 100eV emission cross section and lifetime of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band system of N-2: Direct excitation and cascade	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							RADIATIVE LIFETIME; DISSOCIATIVE EXCITATION; INCIDENT ENERGIES; C4 1-SIGMA-U+; STATES; ULTRAVIOLET; NITROGEN; N2; W(1)DELTA(U); TRANSITIONS	We have measured the 100eV emission cross section of the optically forbidden Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band system (a(g)(1)X(1)sigma(+)(g)) of N-2 by electron-impact-induced fluorescence. Using a large (1.5m diameter) vacuum chamber housing an electron gun system and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph optical engineering model, we have obtained calibrated spectral measurements of the LBH band system from 115 to 175nm over a range of lines of sight to capture all of the optical emissions. These measurements represent the first experiment to directly isolate in the laboratory single-scattering electron-impact-induced fluorescence from both direct excitation of the a(g)(1) state and cascading contributions to the a(g)(1) state (a(1)sigma(-)(u) and w(u)(1)a(g)(1)X(1)sigma(+)(g)). The determination of the total LBH emission cross section is accomplished by measuring the entire cylindrical glow pattern of the metastable emission from electron impact by imaging lines of sight that measure the glow intensity from zero to similar to 400mm radial distance and calculating the ratio of the integrated intensity from the LBH glow pattern to that of a simultaneously observed optically allowed transition with a well-established cross section: Ni 120.0nm. The direct emission cross section of the a(g)(1) state at 100eV was determined to be sigma(em)(dir)=(6.411.3)x10(-18)cm(2). An important observation from the glow pattern behavior is that the total (direct+cascading) emission cross section is pressure dependent due to collision-induced cascade transitions between close-lying electronic states.

However, the productivity response to these environmental factors is uncertain at the global scale and has largely been defined using limited observations from sparse monitoring sites, including carbon flux towers. Recent studies have shown that satellite observations of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) are highly correlated with ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). Here, we use a relatively long-term global SIF observational record from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) sensors to investigate the relationships between SIF, used as a proxy for GPP, and selected bio-climatic factors constraining plant growth at the global scale. We compared the satellite SIF retrievals with collocated GPP observations from a global network of tower carbon flux monitoring sites and surface meteorological data from model reanalysis, including soil moisture, Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and minimum daily air temperature (Tmin). We found strong correspondence (R-2 > 80%) between SIF and GPP monthly climatologies for tower sites characterized by mixed, deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf forests, and croplands. For other land cover types including savanna, shrubland, and evergreen broadleaf forest, SIF showed significant but higher variability in correlations between sites. In order to analyze temperature and moisture related effects on ecosystem productivity, we divided SIF by photosynthetically active radiation (SIFp) and examined partial correlations between SIFp and the climatic factors across a global range of flux tower sites, and over broader regional and global extents. We found that productivity in arid ecosystems is more strongly controlled by soil water content to an extent that soil moisture explains a higher proportion of the seasonal cycle in productivity than VPD. At the global scale, ecosystem productivity is affected by joint climatic constraint factors so that VPD, Tmin, and soil moisture were significant (p < 0.05) controls over 60, 59, and 35 percent of the global domain, respectively. Our study identifies and confirms dominant climate control factors influencing productivity at the global scale indicated from satellite SIF observations. The results are generally consistent with climate response characteristics indicated from sparse global tower observations, while providing more extensive coverage for verifying and refining global carbon and climate model assumptions and predictions.

Lansbury and collaborators recently completed a catalog of 497 sources serendipitously detected in the 3-24 keV band using 13 deg(2) of NuSTAR coverage. Here, we report on an optical and X-ray study of 16 Galactic sources in the catalog. We identify 8 of them as stars (but some or all could have binary companions), and use information from Gaia to report distances and X-ray luminosities for 3 of them. There are 4 CVs or CV candidates, and we argue that NuSTAR J233426-2343.9 is a relatively strong CV candidate based partly on an X-ray spectrum from XMM-Newton. NuSTAR J092418-3142.2, which is the brightest serendipitous source in the Lansbury catalog, and NuSTAR J073959-3147.8 are low-mass X-ray binary candidates, but it is also possible that these 2. sources are CVs. One of the sources is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), and NuSTAR J105008-5958.8 is a new HMXB candidate that. has strong Balmer emission lines in its optical spectrum and a hard X-ray spectrum. We discuss the implications of finding these HMXBs for the surface density (log N-log S) and luminosity function of Galactic HMXBs. We conclude that. with the large fraction of unclassified sources in the Galactic plane detected by NuSTAR in the 8-24 keV band, there could be a significant population of low-luminosity HMXBs.

Since its last major eruption in the fifteenth century, El Misti has experienced a series of modest phreatic eruptions and fluctuating fumarolic activity. Here, we present the first measurements of the compositions of gas emitted from the lava dome in the summit crater. The gas composition is found to be fairly dry with a H2O/SO2 molar ratio of 32 +/- 3, a CO2/ SO2 molar ratio of 2.7 +/- 0.2, a H2S/SO2 molar ratio of 0.23 +/- 0.02 and a H-2/SO2 molar ratio of 0.012 +/- 0.002. This magmatic gas signature with minimal evidence of hydrothermal or wall rock interaction points to a shallow magma source that is efficiently outgassing through a permeable conduit and lava dome. Field and satellite observations show no evolution of the lava dome over the last decade, indicating sustained outgassing through an established fracture network. This stability could be disrupted if dome permeability were to be reduced by annealing or occlusion of outgassing pathways. Continued monitoring of gas composition and flux at El Misti will be essential to determine the evolution of hazard potential at this dangerous volcano.

The filter set includes a broadband near-infrared cutoff filter for RGB Bayer imaging on each camera and 12 narrow-band geology filters distributed between the two cameras, spanning the wavelength range 445-1013 nm. This wavelength region includes the relatively broad charge-transfer and crystal-field absorption bands that are most commonly due to the presence of iron-bearing minerals. To identify such spectral features, sequences of images taken with identical pointings through different filters have been calibrated to relative reflectance using pre-flight calibration coefficients and in-flight measurements of an onboard calibration target. Within the first 1000 sols of the mission, Mastcam observed a spectrally diverse set of materials displaying absorption features consistent with the presence of iron-bearing silicate, iron oxide, and iron sulfate minerals. Dust-coated surfaces as well as soils possess a strong positive reflectance slope in the visible, consistent with the presence of nanophase iron oxides, which have long been considered the dominant visible-wavelength pigmenting agent in weathered martian surface materials. Fresh surfaces, such as tailings produced by the drill tool and the interiors of rocks broken by the rover wheels, are grayer in visible wavelengths than their reddish, dust-coated surfaces but possess reflectance spectra that vary considerably between sites. To understand the mineralogical basis of observed Mastcam reflectance spectra, we focus on a subset of the multispectral data set for which additional constraints on the composition of surface materials are available from other rover instruments, with an emphasis on sample sites for which detailed mineralogy is provided by the results of CheMin X-ray diffraction analyses. We also discuss the results of coordinated observations with the ChemCam instrument, whose passive mode of operation is capable of acquiring reflectance spectra over wavelengths that considerably overlap the range spanned by the Mastcam filter set (Johnson et al. 2016). Materials that show a distinct 430 nm band in ChemCam data also are observed to have a strong near-infrared absorption band in Mastcam spectral data, consistent with the presence of a ferric sulfate mineral. Long-distance Mastcam observations targeted toward the flanks of the Gale crater central mound are in agreement with both ChemCam spectra and orbital results, and in particular exhibit the spectral features of a crystalline hematite layer identified in MRO/CRISM data. Variations observed in Mastcam multi-filter images acquired to date have shown that multispectral observations can discriminate between compositionally different materials within Gale Crater and are in qualitative agreement with mineralogies from measured samples and orbital data.

We additionally characterized the magnitude and type (rain versus snow) of precipitation and the resulting hydrologic response of surface and subsurface waters to this precipitation variability. The three catchments were representative of the montane rain-snow transition zone (snow was 39% of total precipitation; sigma (standard deviation) = 10%), the subalpine zone (69% snow; sigma = 5%), and the alpine zone (84% snow; sigma = 10%). All three catchments were identified as three end-member systems with their respective source waters being groundwater, snow precipitation or melt, rain (montane and subalpine only), and subsurface water from talus slopes (alpine only). Mean annual groundwater contributions were greater in forested catchments (28%; sigma = 6% in the montane, 31%; sigma = 8% in the subalpine) than in the alpine (19%; sigma = 5%) catchment. Snow-derived water contributions to streamflow were inversely related to groundwater and increased with elevation from 46% (sigma = 15%) in the montane zone to 58% (sigma =12%) in the subalpine and 61% (sigma = 7%) in the alpine. Rain was 27% (sigma = 8%) of discharge in the montane and 11% (sigma = 4%) in the subalpine, while talus waters made up the final 21% (sigma =12%) of streamflow in the alpine. Our results suggest that subsurface source waters (i.e. groundwater and talus water) that are influenced by the timing, magnitude, and type of recharge and by the storage capabilities of the subsurface may be the most sensitive to climate variability at higher elevations. In contrast, the proportion of rain versus snow was the primary control on source water variability at lower elevations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unlike a typical mission where the balloon lifts a gondola that carries the primary scientific instrument, the EVA mission is a first-of-its-kind in that the balloon itself is part of the science instrument. Specifically, a toroidal RF reflector is mounted onto the outside surface of a superpressure balloon (SPB) and a feed antenna is suspended inside the balloon, creating a high-gain antenna system with a synoptic view of the Antarctic ice sheet. The EVA mission presents a number of technical challenges. For example, can a stowed feed antenna be inserted through an opening in the top-plate? Can the feed antenna be deployed during the ascent? Once float altitude is achieved, how might small shape changes in the balloon shape affect the antenna performance over the life of the EVA mission? The EVA team utilized a combination of testing with a 1/20-scale physical model, mathematical modeling and numerical simulations to probe these and related questions. While the problems are challenging, they are solvable with current technology and expertise. Experiments with a 1/20-scale EVA physical model outline a pathway for inserting a stowed feed into a SPB. Analysis indicates the EVA system will ascend, deploy and assume a stable configuration at float altitude. Nominal shape changes in an Antarctic SPB are sufficiently small to allow the use of the surface of the balloon as a high-gain reflector.

Antarctic Surface Reflectivity Measurements from the ANITA-3 and HiCal-1 Experiments	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Balloons; instrumentation: interferometers; instrumentation: detectors	COSMIC-RAYS; ENERGY	The primary science goal of the NASA-sponsored ANITA project is measurement of ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, observed via radio-frequency signals resulting from a neutrino or cosmic ray interaction with terrestrial matter (e.g. atmospheric or ice molecules). Accurate inference of the energies of these cosmic rays requires understanding the transmission/reflection of radio wave signals across the ice-air boundary. Satellite-based measurements of Antarctic surface reflectivity, using a co-located transmitter and receiver, have been performed more-or-less continuously for the last few decades. Our comparison of four different reflectivity surveys, at frequencies ranging from 2 to 45 GHz and at near-normal incidence, yield generally consistent maps of high versus low reflectivity, as a function of location, across Antarctica. Using the Sun as an RF source, and the ANITA-3 balloon borne radio-frequency antenna array as the RF receiver, we have also measured the surface reflectivity over the interval 200-1000 MHz, at elevation angles of 12-30 degrees. Consistent with our previous measurement using ANITA-2, we find good agreement, within systematic errors (dominated by antenna beam width uncertainties) and across Antarctica, with the expected reflectivity as prescribed by the Fresnel equations. To probe low incidence angles, inaccessible to the Antarctic Solar technique and not probed by previous satellite surveys, a novel experimental approach ("HiCal-1") was devised. Unlike previous measurements, HiCal-ANITA constitute a bi-static transmitter-receiver pair separated by hundreds of kilometers. Data taken with HiCal, between 200 and 600MHz shows a significant departure from the Fresnel equations, constant with frequency over that band, with the deficit increasing with obliquity of incidence, which we attribute to the combined effects of possible surface roughness, surface grain effects, radar clutter and/or shadowing of the reflection zone due to Earth curvature effects. We discuss the science implications of the HiCal results, as well as improvements planned for HiCal-2, preparing for launch in December 2016.	[Gorham, P. W.; Fox, B.

We have developed techniques for automatically determining surface fault slip and location using deformation images from the NASA Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), which is similar to satellite-based SAR but has more mission flexibility and higher resolution (pixels are approximately 7 m). This radar interferometry provides a highly sensitive method, clearly indicating faults slipping at levels of 10 mm or less. But interferometric images are subject to decorrelation between revisit times, creating spots of bad data in the image. Our method begins with freely available data products from the UAVSAR mission, chiefly unwrapped interferograms, coherence images, and flight metadata. The computer vision techniques we use assume no data gaps or holes; so a preliminary step detects and removes spots of bad data and fills these holes by interpolation and blurring. Detected and partially validated surface fractures from earthquake main shocks, aftershocks, and aseismic-induced slip are shown for faults in California, including El Mayor-Cucapah (M7.2, 2010), the Ocotillo aftershock (M5.7, 2010), and South Napa (M6.0, 2014). Aseismic slip is detected on the San Andreas Fault from the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, in regions of highly patterned partial decorrelation. Validation is performed by comparing slip estimates from two interferograms with published ground truth measurements.

Packaged ice is commercially produced and can be easily found in grocery and convenience stores. However, the quality and safety of packaged ice products is not consistent. The Packaged Ice Quality Control Standards manual (PIQCS) published by the International Packaged Ice Association provides the quality and processing standards for packaged ice produced by its members. Packaged ice produced on the premise of stores (on-site packaged ice) is not required to be in compliance with these standards. In this study, packaged ice produced by manufacturing plants or by in-store bagger (ISB) machines and on-site packaged ice were compared for their microbiological quality and microbial diversity. Our results revealed that 19% of the 120 on-site packaged ice samples did not meet the PIQCS microbial limit of 500 CFU/mL (or g) and also the absence of coliforms and Escherichia coli. Staphylococci were found in 34% of the on-site packaged ice samples, most likely through contamination from the packaging workers. None of the ISB and manufactured packaged ice samples had unacceptable microbial levels, and all were devoid of staphylococci. Salmonella was absent in all samples analyzed in this study. Microbial community analysis of ice based on 16S/18S rRNA targeted sequencing revealed a much higher microbial diversity and abundance in the on-site packaged ice than in the ISB ice. Proteobacteria, especially Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, were the dominant bacterial groups in all samples tested. Most of these bacteria were oligotrophic; however, a few opportunistic or potential pathogens were found at low levels in the on-site packaged ice but not in the ISB packaged ice. The types of microbes identified may provide information needed to investigate potential sources of contamination. Our data also suggest a need for enforcement of processing standards during the on-site packaging of ice.

As a low-parasitic device that operates well into the THz range, Schottky diodes provide useful detection and power generation for a number of practical applications. Mixers and multipliers, working as high as similar to 3 THz, have already been demonstrated. This paper reviews the current status of diode technology, detailing some of the different ways for fabricating THz chips. An overview regarding the current state of technology and performance for THz frequency multipliers and mixers is presented, along with applications enabled by these diodes.

Traditional computer numerically controlled (CNC) metal machining can still be used for component and simple single-pixel receiver fabrication but falls short when highly compact and integrated systems are needed. Several micromachining methods have shown potential at these frequencies with permanent thick-resists, thick-resist electroforming and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon micromachining are discussed in detail. These techniques use photolithographic techniques to produce features accurate to 3 mu m or less. Silicon micromachining and electroforming offers the additional advantage of vertical stacking of components, enabling higher circuit densities for these waveguide-based components. To demonstrate these capabilities several integrated systems are discussed.

Both single-source and multisource feeding schemes are considered. For the single-source case, two approaches are investigated. In the first one, the MTS aperture is divided into several angular sectors, each one devoted to the formation of a beam in a given direction. In the second approach, the whole aperture is shared by a superposition of individual modulations, which correspond to those required to obtain beams in the desired set of directions. It is shown that the latter solution provides beams with a higher gain. The configuration based on a multisource feeding scheme is also tailored by a superposition of modulation patterns. The main advantage of the latter approach is the possibility of having one independent beam at a time when each of the sources are active, as opposed to the single-source case where all the beams coexist at the same time. Closed-form expressions are provided for the MTS surface impedance in each of the proposed solutions. The design equations include appropriate amplitude tapering to improve the beam efficiency. Numerical results based on the method of moments are presented for validation.

Two Small Transiting Planets and a Possible Third Body Orbiting HD 106315	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						eclipses; stars: individual (HD 106315); techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic	SUPER-EARTHS; LOW-MASS; MULTIPLANET SYSTEMS; RADIAL-VELOCITIES; K2 MISSION; M DWARFS; STARS; KEPLER; EXOPLANETS; CANDIDATES	The masses, atmospheric makeups, spin-orbit alignments, and system architectures of extrasolar planets can be best studied when the planets orbit bright stars. We report the discovery of three bodies orbiting HD 106315, a bright (V = 8.97 mag) F5 dwarf targeted by our K2 survey for transiting exoplanets. Two small, transiting planets have radii of 2.23(-0.25)(+0.30) R-circle plus and 3.95(-0.39)(+0.42) R-circle plus and orbital periods of 9.55 d and 21.06 d, respectively. A radial velocity (RV) trend of 0.3 +/- 0.1 m/s(-1) day(-1) indicates the likely presence of a third body orbiting HD 106315 with period greater than or similar to 160 days and mass greater than or similar to 45 M-circle plus. Transits of this object would have depths of greater than or similar to 0.1% and are definitively ruled out. Though the star has v sin i = 13.2 km/s(-1), it exhibits short-timescale RV variability of just 6.4 m/s(-1),Thus it is a good target for RV measurements of the mass and density of the inner two planets and the outer object's orbit and mass. Furthermore, the combination of RV noise and moderate v sin i makes HD 106315 a valuable laboratory for studying the spin-orbit alignment of small planets through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Space-based atmospheric characterization of the two transiting planets via transit and eclipse spectroscopy should also be feasible. This discovery demonstrates again the power of K2 to find compelling exoplanets worthy of future study.	[Crossfield, Ian J.

The Intelligent Payload Experiment (IPEX) is a CubeSat that flew from December 2013 through January 2015 and validated autonomous operations for onboard instrument processing and product generation for the Intelligent Payload Module of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission concept. IPEX used several artificial intelligence technologies. First, IPEX used machine learning and computer vision in its onboard processing. IPEX used machine-learned random decision forests to classify images onboard (to downlink classification maps) and computer vision visual salience software to extract interesting regions for downlink in acquired imagery. Second, IPEX flew the Continuous Activity Scheduler Planner Execution and Re-planner AI planner/scheduler onboard to enable IPEX operations to replan to best use spacecraft resources such as file storage, CPU, power, and downlink bandwidth.

Optically coherent image formation and denoising using a plug and play inversion framework	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION; APERTURE; SPARSE; RADAR; RECONSTRUCTION; AUTOFOCUS	The performance of optically coherent imaging systems can be limited by measurement and speckle noise. In this paper, we develop an image formation framework for computing the maximum a posteriori estimate of an object's reflectivity when imaged using coherent illumination and detection. The proposed approach allows for the use of Gaussian denoising algorithms (GDAs), without modification, to mitigate the exponentially distributed and signal-dependent noise that occurs in coherent imaging. Several GDAs are compared using both simulated and experimental data. The proposed framework is shown to be robust to noise and significantly reduce reconstruction error compared to the standard inversion technique.

A Time-Series Approach to Estimating Soil Moisture From Vegetated Surfaces Using L-Band Radar Backscatter	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Parameter estimation; radar; remote sensing; soil	RETRIEVAL	Many previous studies have shown the sensitivity of radar backscatter to surface soil moisture content, particularly at L-band. Moreover, the estimation of soil moisture from radar for bare soil surfaces is well-documented, but estimation underneath a vegetation canopy remains unsolved. Vegetation significantly increases the complexity of modeling the electromagnetic scattering in the observed scene, and can even obstruct the contributions from the underlying soil surface. Existing approaches to estimating soil moisture under vegetation using radar typically rely on a forward model to describe the backscattered signal and often require that the vegetation characteristics of the observed scene be provided by an ancillary data source. However, such information may not be reliable or available during the radar overpass of the observed scene (e.g., due to cloud coverage if derived from an optical sensor). Thus, the approach described herein is an extension of a change-detection method for soil moisture estimation, which does not require ancillary vegetation information, nor does it make use of a complicated forward scattering model. Novel modifications to the original algorithm include extension to multiple polarizations and a new technique for bounding the radar-derived soil moisture product using radiometer-based soil moisture estimates. Soil moisture estimates are generated using data from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) satellite-borne radar and radiometer data, and are compared with up-scaled data from a selection of in situ networks used in SMAP validation activities. These results show that the new algorithm can consistently achieve rms errors less than 0.07 m(3)/m(3) over a variety land cover types.

J	Duan, XY; Moghaddam, M				Duan, Xueyang; Moghaddam, Mahta			Full-Wave Electromagnetic Scattering From Rough Surfaces With Buried Inhomogeneities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Electromagnetic scattering; extended boundary condition method (EBCM); generalized iterative extended boundary condition method (GIEBCM); inhomogeneous media; root scattering; scattering matrix (S-matrix)	MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS; FAST MULTIPOLE METHOD; RANDOM-MEDIA; OBJECTS; BENEATH; PERMITTIVITY; VEGETATION	We develop a methodology for modeling coherent electromagnetic scattering from rough surfaces with buried inhomogeneities in three dimensions. The inhomogeneities considered in this paper include random spherical media, random cylindrical media, and root-like cylindrical clusters. They are used to simulate rocks, ice particles, and vegetation roots buried beneath the ground surface that can be seen by the low-frequency radars in Earth remote sensing applications. The approach we develop first calculates volumetric scattering from the media using coherent approaches, including both the conventional recursive transition matrix (T-matrix) method as well as a new generalized iterative extended boundary condition method we developed for tilted finite cylinders, and then transforms the T-matrix to the scattering matrix, which is then used to form the full scattered field of layered structures with rough surface and subsurfaces. We validate the methodology by comparing with other numerical solutions for special cases, and show sensitivity results for scattering from rough surface with buried random spherical media and random cylindrical media of different densities. We also construct a basic root model and calculate the scattering cross sections from single and multiple root clusters with or without a subsurface interface underneath. With the approach developed in this paper, we are able to study the sensitivity of radar signals to subsurface scatterers. For example, our simulations show that, depending on their density and water content, buried roots could enhance the backscatter from a single rough surface by as much as 5 dB in co-pol components, and substantially more in cross-pol components. The results of this model are expected to enable more accurate geophysical retrievals of soil moisture as well as soil organic content.

Derived Observations From Frequently Sampled Microwave Measurements of Precipitation-Part I: Relations to Atmospheric Thermodynamics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Atmospheric modeling; spaceborne radar		This is the first of two papers that quantify the high added value of frequent 3-D radar observations of the atmosphere to capture the dynamics of weather systems. Recent advances in small-satellite and radar technologies, such as the "Radar in Cubesat" developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, are paving the way for the design of convoys of spaceborne radars that can directly observe the evolution of severe weather at very fine temporal scales. The analyses presented here are to establish the relation between such observations to the underlying cloud variables and processes, and to quantify the sensitivity to the different physical and instrument parameters. In this first part, a robust algorithm is proposed to estimate the horizontal advection from successive radar reflectivity measurements, and use it to compute total time derivatives d(t) Z of the observed radar reflectivity factors Z. As illustrated using Next-Generation Radar measurements in a blizzard coupled with an atmospheric river in California, the maps of dt Z reveal features about locations of sources and sinks of condensed water, which are, otherwise, not visible in the maps of Z alone. Using numerical simulations of the blizzard and a radiative-transfer model to forward calculate the corresponding reflectivity factors Z in the S-band, we show the robust correlation between d(t) Z and the moistening of the troposphere.

Objective Detection of Indian Summer Monsoon Onset Using QuikSCAT Seawinds Scatterometer	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Indian monsoon; onset; QuikSCAT estimates; surface cooling	INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SOUTHWEST MONSOON; KERALA; SENSITIVITY; DEFINITION; MECHANISMS; WITHDRAWAL; SATELLITE; EVOLUTION; VORTEX	Surface winds from the QuikSCAT scatterometer over a region parallel to southern peninsular (SP) India are analyzed to monitor the daily evolution of the monsoon. For this purpose, the daily flow direction (DFD) and the corresponding optimal angle are derived from scatterometer winds for the period 2003-2009. These are correlated with the modern era retrospective analysis for research and application reanalysis land surface temperatures averaged over the SP. In the time series for DFD, positive DFD period is wet monsoon with a well-defined onset, followed by a short wet-to-dry transition where DFD is mostly negative and decreasing, then negative DFD period is dry monsoon, and followed by a dry-to-wet transition during which the sign and amplitude of DFD alternates daily between positive and negative. The correlation of DFD with averaged land surface temperatures shows that maximum temperature is achieved during the dry-to-wet transition season and is more pronounced in the years 2004-2007. Though 2005 and 2006 have the longest period of precursor cooling, in 2008 the land surface temperature continues to increase right up to the onset of monsoon. The hypotheses derived from these are: every year, the land surface cooling begins weeks before the monsoon onset over Kerala (MOK); the potential for convection over land is most favorable where DFD is positive, and is inhibited when negative. This study also reveals that one can extract the onset dates with a standard deviation of 3-4 days from these time series data sets, and the latter are used to objectively define the MOK.	[Ragi, A.

Weak lensing cosmology will be challenging: in addition to highly accurate galaxy shape measurements, statistically robust and accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates for billions of faint galaxies will be needed in order to reconstruct the three-dimensional matter distribution. Here we present an overview of and initial results from the Complete Calibration of the Color-Redshift Relation (C3R2) survey, which is designed specifically to calibrate the empirical galaxy color-redshift relation to the Euclid depth. These redshifts will also be important for the calibrations of LSST and WFIRST. The C3R2 survey is obtaining multiplexed observations with Keck (DEIMOS, LRIS, and MOSFIRE), the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC; OSIRIS), and the Very Large Telescope (VLT; FORS2 and KMOS) of a targeted sample of galaxies that are most important for the redshift calibration. We focus spectroscopic efforts on undersampled regions of galaxy color space identified in previous work in order to minimize the number of spectroscopic redshifts needed to map the color-redshift relation to the required accuracy. We present the C3R2 survey strategy and initial results, including the 1283 high-confidence redshifts obtained in the 2016A semester and released as Data Release 1.

In spite of this, our understanding of what produces these jets is still incomplete. X-ray observations, which can probe the processes operating in the central regions in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole, the presumed jet launching point, are potentially particularly valuable in illuminating the jet formation process. Here, we present the hard X-ray NuSTAR observations of the radio-loud quasar 4C 74.26 in a joint analysis with quasi-simultaneous, soft X-ray Swift observations. Our spectral analysis reveals a high-energy cutoff of 183(35)(+51) keV and confirms the presence of ionized reflection in the source. From the average spectrum we detect that the accretion disk is mildly recessed, with an inner radius of R-in - 4-180 R-g. However, no significant evolution of the inner radius is seen during the three months covered by our NuSTAR campaign. This lack of variation could mean that the jet formation in this radio-loud quasar differs from what is observed in broad-line radio galaxies.

Mapping Snow Depth From Ka-Band Interferometry: Proof of Concept and Comparison With Scanning Lidar Retrievals	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Hydrology; interferometry; lidar; snow	RADAR	This letter presents the first demonstration of millimeter-wave single-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for snow-depth mapping. Maps are presented over the Tuolumne River Basin region of the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, and compared with those collected by a scanning lidar onboard the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory for the same region on the same snow day. For this observation, the snow surface was wet and melting and as such penetration of the electromagnetic wave into the snow volume can be effectively neglected. Despite the rugged terrain, heavy tree-cover, and very low snow-volume, depth maps had a standard deviation < 1 m with the largest differences occurring on slopes exceeding 40 degrees. While additional evaluation is needed with demonstration of the InSAR capability over a greater range of conditions and terrain, these results are promising. InSAR for snow-depth mapping holds significant advantages for a spaceborne mission if proven viable as it can operate through cloud cover, day or night, and measure snowpack when wet or melting.

J	Kalaydzhyan, T; Murchikova, E				Kalaydzhyan, Tigran; Murchikova, Elena			Thermal chiral vortical and magnetic waves: New excitation modes in chiral fluids	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B			English	Article							FIELD	In certain circumstances, chiral (parity-violating) medium can be described hydrodynamically as a chiral fluid with Microscopic quantum anomalies. Possible examples of such systems include strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, liquid helium He-3-A, neutron stars and the Early Universe. We study first-order hydrodynamics of a chiral fluid on a vortex background and in an external magnetic field. We show that there are two previously undiscovered modes describing heat waves propagating along the vortex and magnetic field. We call them the Thermal Chiral Vortical Wave and Thermal Chiral Magnetic Wave. We also identify known gapless excitations of density (chiral vortical and chiral magnetic waves) and transverse velocity (chiral Alfven wave). We demonstrate that the velocity of the chiral vortical wave is zero, when the full hydrodynamic framework is applied, and hence the wave is absent and the excitation reduces to the charge diffusion mode. We also comment on the frame-dependent contributions to the obtained propagation velocities. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

High-resolution Ceres Low Altitude Mapping Orbit Atlas derived from Dawn Framing Camera images	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Dawn; Ceres; Dwarf planets; Planetary mapping	IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION	The Dawn spacecraft Framing Camera (FC) acquired over 31,300 clear filter images of Ceres with a resolution of about 35 m/pxl during the eleven cycles in the Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) phase between December 16, 2015 and August 8, 2016. We ortho-rectified the images from the first four cycles and produced a global, high-resolution, uncontrolled photomosaic of Ceres. This global mosaic is the basis for a high-resolution Ceres atlas that consists of 62 tiles mapped at a scale of 1:250,000. The nomenclature used in this atlas was proposed by the Dawn team and was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The full atlas is available to the public through the Dawn Geographical Information System (GIS) web page [http://dawngis.dIr.de/atlas] and will become available through the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) (http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/).

J	Thill, M; Hassibi, B				Thill, Matthew; Hassibi, Babak			Low-Coherence Frames From Group Fourier Matrices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Frame; coherence; unit norm tight frame; group representation; group frame; Fourier transform over groups; Welch bound; spherical codes; compressive sensing	TIGHT FRAMES; COMPLEX CODEBOOKS; SIGNAL RECOVERY; PRODUCTS; CODES	Many problems in areas such as compressive sensing and coding theory seek to design a set of equal-norm vectors with large angular separation. This idea is essentially equivalent to constructing a frame with low coherence. The elements of such frames can in turn be used to build high-performance spherical codes, quantum measurement operators, and compressive sensing measurement matrices, to name a few applications. In this paper, we allude to the group-frame construction first described by Slepian and further explored in the works of Vale and Waldron. We present a method for selecting representations of a finite group to construct a group frame that achieves low coherence. Our technique produces a tight frame with a small number of distinct inner product values between the frame elements, in a sense approximating a Grassmannian frame. We identify special cases in which our construction yields some previously known frames with optimal coherence meeting the Welch lower bound, and other cases in which the entries of our frame vectors come from small alphabets. In particular, we apply our technique to the problem choosing a subset of rows of an Hadamard matrix so that the resulting columns form a low-coherence frame. Finally, we give an explicit calculation of the average coherence of our frames, and find regimes in which they satisfy the strong coherence property described by Mixon, Bajwa, and Calderbank.

The split of forward (S-21) and backward (S-12) transmissions is observed by applying a dc electric field through the active area with a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) sheet. The nonreciprocity (similar to 20.7 dB/mmmax. in this letter) variesby tuning the gate voltage to deplete the 2DEG sheet carrier density, which agrees with model prediction for the interaction between 2DEG and surface acoustic waves. Our preliminary results prove the feasibility of implementing chip-scale non-reciprocal acoustic devices in a GaN platform through acoustoelectric amplification.

The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission produced a daily landscape FT product at 3-km spatial resolution derived from ascending and descending orbits of SMAP high-resolution L-band (1.4 GHz) radar measurements. Following the failure of the SMAP radar in July 2015, coarser (36-km) footprint SMAP radiometer inputs were used to develop an alternative daily passive microwave freeze/thaw product. In this study, in situ observations are used to examine differences in the sensitivity of the 3-km radar versus the 36-km radiometer measurements to the landscape freeze/thaw state during the period of overlapping instrument operation. Assessment of the retrievals at high-latitude SMAP core validation sites showed excellent agreement with in situ flags, exceeding the 80% SMAP mission accuracy requirement. Similar performance was found for the radar and radiometer products using both air temperature and soil temperature derived FT reference flags. There was a tendency for SMAP thaw retrievals to lead the surface flags due to the influence of wet snow cover conditions on both the radar and radiometer signal. Comparison with other satellite derived FT products showed those derived from passive measurements (SMAP radiometer; Aquarius radiometer; Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - 2) retrieved less frozen area than the active products (SMAP radar; Aquarius radar).

Low-energy electron bombardment with 200-300 eV electrons leads to H2O depletion, as monitored by reflection-absorption infrared spectros-200 copy (RAIRS) of the remaining c-ASW film. Cross sections for H2O depletion were calculated to be in the range from 1.6 +/- 1.0 X 10(-16) to 5.2 +/- 3.0 X 10(-16) cm(2). However, mass spectrometric measurements identify a major component of the desorbing material as H-2, which appears with kinetics similar to those for H2O loss.

GPI data include both polarized intensity and total intensity imagery, and MagAO data are taken in Simultaneous Differential Imaging mode at Ha. The new GPI H-band total intensity data represent a significant enhancement in sensitivity and field rotation compared to previous data sets and enable a detailed exploration of substructure in the disk. The data are processed with a variety of differential imaging techniques (polarized, angular, reference, and simultaneous differential imaging) in an attempt to identify the disk structures that are most consistent across wavelengths, processing techniques, and algorithmic parameters. The inner disk cavity at 15 au is clearly resolved in multiple data sets, as are a variety of spiral features. While the cavity and spiral structures are identified at levels significantly distinct from the neighboring regions of the disk under several algorithms and with a range of algorithmic parameters, emission at the location of HD 100546 "c" varies from point-like under aggressive algorithmic parameters to a smooth continuous structure with conservative parameters, and is consistent with disk emission. Features identified in the HD 100546 disk bear qualitative similarity to computational models of a moderately inclined two-armed spiral disk, where projection effects and wrapping of the spiral arms around the star result in a number of truncated spiral features in forward-modeled images.

Kent; Ward-Duong, Kimberly; Wiktorowicz, Sloane			An Optical/Near-infrared Investigation of HD 100546 b with the Gemini Planet Imager and MagAO	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; planet-disk interactions; planetary systems; stars: individual (HD 100546)	LOW-MASS; PROTOPLANETARY DISK; CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK; TRANSITIONAL DISK; SCATTERED-LIGHT; ACCRETION RATES; RESOLVED IMAGES; GIANT PLANET; BROWN DWARFS; YOUNG	We present H band spectroscopic and H alpha photometric observations of HD 100546 obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager and the Magellan Visible AO camera. We detect H band emission at the location of the protoplanet HD 100546 b, but show that the choice of data processing parameters strongly affects the morphology of this source. It appears point-like in some aggressive reductions, but rejoins an extended disk structure in the majority of the others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emission appears stationary on a timescale of 4.6 years, inconsistent at the 2 sigma level with a Keplerian clockwise orbit at 59 au in the disk plane. The H band spectrum of the emission is inconsistent with any type of low effective temperature object or accreting protoplanetary disk. It strongly suggests a scattered-light origin, as this is consistent with the spectrum of the star and the spectra extracted at other locations in the disk. A nondetection at the 5 sigma level of HD 100546 b in differential H alpha imaging places an upper limit, assuming the protoplanet lies in a gap free of extinction, on the accretion luminosity of 1.7 x 10(-4) L-circle dot and M(M) over dot < 6.3 x 10(-7) M-Jup(2) yr(-1) for 1 R-Jup. These limits are comparable to the accretion luminosity and accretion rate of T-Tauri stars or LkCa 15 b. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that the H band source at the location of HD 100546 b is not emitted by a planetary photosphere or an accreting circumplanetary disk but is a disk feature enhanced by the point-spread function subtraction process. This non-detection is consistent with the non-detection in the K. band reported in an earlier study but does not exclude the possibility that HD 100546 b is deeply embedded.

GRAVITY Collaboration	Accretion-ejection morphology of the microquasar SS 433 resolved at sub-au scale	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: individual: SS 433; ISM: jets and outflows; techniques: interferometric; infrared: stars	MASS DONOR STAR; SS-433; JETS; SS433; PARAMETERS; SPECTRUM	We present the first optical observation of the microquasar SS 433 at sub-milliarcsecond (mas) scale obtained with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope interferometer (VLTI). The 3.5-h exposure reveals a rich K-band spectrum dominated by hydrogen Br gamma and He i lines, as well as (red-shifted) emission lines coming from the jets. The K-band-continuum-emitting region is dominated by a marginally resolved point source (<1 mas) embedded inside a diffuse background accounting for 10% of the total flux. The jet line positions agree well with the ones expected from the jet kinematic model, an interpretation also supported by the consistent sign (i.e., negative/positive for the receding/approaching jet component) of the phase shifts observed in the lines. The significant visibility drop across the jet lines, together with the small and nearly identical phases for all baselines, point toward a jet that is off set by less than 0.5 mas from the continuum source and resolved in the direction of propagation, with a typical size of 2 mas. The jet position angle of similar to 80 degrees is consistent with the expected one at the observation date. Jet emission so close to the central binary system would suggest that line locking, if relevant to explain the amplitude and stability of the 0.26c jet velocity, operates on elements heavier than hydrogen. The Br gamma profile is broad and double peaked. It is better resolved than the continuum and the change of the phase signal sign across the line on all baselines suggests an East-West-oriented geometry similar to the jet direction and supporting a (polar) disk wind origin.

The NANOGrav Nine-year Data Set: Measurement and Analysis of Variations in Dispersion Measures	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: general; pulsars: general	PULSAR TIMING ANALYSIS; 37 MILLISECOND PULSARS; INTERSTELLAR PLASMA; DATA RELEASE; SCINTILLATION; SCATTERING; PARAMETERS; B1937+21	We analyze dispersion measure (DM) variations of 37 millisecond pulsars in the nine-year North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) data release and constrain the sources of these variations. DM variations can result from a changing distance between Earth and the pulsar, inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium, and solar effects. Variations are significant for nearly all pulsars, with characteristic timescales comparable to or even shorter than the average spacing between observations. Five pulsars have periodic annual variations, 14 pulsars have monotonically increasing or decreasing trends, and 14 pulsars show both effects. Of the four pulsars with linear trends that have line-of-sight velocity measurements, three are consistent with a changing distance and require an overdensity of free electrons local to the pulsar. Several pulsars show correlations between DM excesses and lines of sight that pass close to the Sun. Mapping of the DM variations as a function of the pulsar trajectory can identify localized interstellar medium features and, in one case, an upper limit to the size of the dispersing region of 4 au. Four pulsars show roughly Kolmogorov structure functions (SFs), and another four show SFs less steep than Kolmogorov. One pulsar has too large an uncertainty to allow comparisons. We discuss explanations for apparent departures from a Kolmogorov-like spectrum, and we show that the presence of other trends and localized features or gradients in the interstellar medium is the most likely cause.

The Coldest Place in the Universe: Probing the Ultra-cold Outflow and Dusty Disk in the Boomerang Nebula	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: close; circumstellar matter; planetary nebulae: individual ( Boomerang Nebula); polarization; stars: AGB and post-AGB; stars: mass-loss	MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; YOUNG PLANETARY-NEBULAE; GIANT BRANCH STARS; MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; PREPLANETARY NEBULAE; ALMA OBSERVATIONS; AGB STARS; EMISSION; ENVELOPE; MASS	Our Cycle 0 ALMA observations confirmed that the Boomerang Nebula is the coldest known object in the universe, with a massive high-speed outflow that has cooled significantly below the cosmic background temperature. Our new CO 1-0 data reveal heretofore unseen distant regions of this ultra-cold outflow, out to greater than or similar to 120,000 au. We find that in the ultra-cold outflow, the mass-loss rate (M.) increases with radius, similar to its expansion velocity (V)-taking V alpha r, we find M alpha r(0.9-2.2). The mass in the ultra-cold outflow is greater than or similar to 3.3 M-circle dot, and the Boomerang's main-sequence progenitor mass is greater than or similar to 4 M-circle dot. Our high angular resolution (similar to 0.'' 3) CO J = 3-2 map shows the inner bipolar nebula's precise, highly collimated shape, and a dense central waist of size (FWHM) similar to 1740 au x 275 au. The molecular gas and the dust as seen in scattered light via optical Hubble Space Telescope imaging show a detailed correspondence. The waist shows a compact core in thermal dust emission at 0.87-3.3 mm, which harbors (4-7) x 10(-4) M-circle dot of very large (similar to millimeter-to-centimeter sized), cold (similar to 20-30 K) grains. The central waist (assuming its outer regions to be expanding) and fast bipolar outflow have expansion ages of less than or similar to 1925 years and <= 1050 years: the ''jet-lag'' (i.e., torus age minus the fast-outflow age) in the Boomerang supports models in which the primary star interacts directly with a binary companion. We argue that this interaction resulted in a common-envelope configuration, while the Boomerang's primary was an RGB or early-AGB star, with the companion finally merging into the primary's core, and ejecting the primary's envelope that now forms the ultra-cold outflow.

Past studies have presented opposing views about whether temperature or precipitation is the primary factor driving the response of the land carbon sink to ENSO. Here, we show that the dominant driver varies with ENSO phase. Whereas tropical temperature explains sink dynamics following El Nino conditions (rTG, P = 0.59, p < 0.01), the post La Nina sink is driven largely by tropical precipitation (rPG, T = -0.46, p = 0.04). This finding points to an ENSO-phase-dependent interplay between water availability and temperature in controlling the carbon uptake response to climate variations in tropical ecosystems. We further find that none of a suite of ten contemporary terrestrial biosphere models captures these ENSO-phase- dependent responses, highlighting a key uncertainty in modeling climate impacts on the future of the global land carbon sink.

Centimeter to decimeter hollow concretions and voids in Gale Crater sediments, Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Concretions; Voids; Spherules; Nodules; Gale crater; Mars; Mars science laboratory	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; CARBONATE CONCRETIONS; ORIGIN; SPECTROSCOPY; MINERALOGY; SANDSTONE; SULFATE; GROWTH; UNIT	Voids and hollow spheroids between 1 and 23 cm in diameter occur at several locations along the traverse of the Curiosity rover in Gale crater, Mars. These hollow spherical features are significantly different from anything observed in previous landed missions. The voids appear in dark-toned, rough-textured outcrops, most notably at Point Lake (sols 302-305) and Twin Cairns Island (sol 343). Point Lake displays both voids and cemented spheroids in close proximity; other locations show one or the other form. The spheroids have 1-4 mm thick walls and appear relatively dark-toned in all cases, some with a reddish hue. Only one hollow spheroid (Winnipesaukee, sol 653) was analyzed for composition, appearing mafic (Fe-rich), in contrast to the relatively felsic host rock. The interior surface of the spheroid appears to have a similar composition to the exterior with the possible exceptions of being more hydrated and slightly depleted in Fe and K. Origins of the spheroids as Martian tektites or volcanic bombs appear unlikely due to their hollow and relatively fragile nature and the absence of in-place clearly igneous rocks. A more likely explanation to both the voids and the hollow spheroids is reaction of reduced iron with oxidizing groundwater followed by some re-precipitation as cemented rind concretions at a chemical reaction front. Although some terrestrial concretion analogs are produced from a precursor siderite or pyrite, diagenetic minerals could also be direct precipitates for other terrestrial concretions. The Gale sediments differ from terrestrial sandstones in their high initial iron content, perhaps facilitating a higher occurrence of such diagenetic reactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

With a superconducting critical temperature (T-c) of 39 K, which is far above that of other conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, and its faster thermal response, ultrathin MgB2 films present a promising alternative for the use in HEBs and SS-NPDs. In this paper, we present the results on ultrathin MgB2 films grown by hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition. The films less than 10 nm are difficult to achieve directly because of weak grain connectivity due to incomplete film coverage. To achieve high-quality films less than 10-nm Ar ion milling of thicker films was employed. The ultrathin films fabricated by ion milling show superior quality over as-grown films. The surface roughness of the films was significantly improved and the suppression of T-c from the bulk value is much slower in milled films than in as-grown films. The critical current density of the 5-nm milled film is 1 x 10(7) A.cm(-2) at 4 K, which is the same as that of the 10-nm as-grown film.

Multivariate analysis of GPS position time series of JPL second reprocessing campaign	JOURNAL OF GEODESY			English	Article						GPS position time series; JPL second reprocessing campaign; Multivariate noise assessment; Multivariate power spectrum	ERROR ANALYSIS; DRACONITIC ERRORS; CRUSTAL VELOCITY; TIDE-GAUGES; SEA-LEVEL; NOISE; PERMANENT; MODEL; DISPLACEMENTS; DEFORMATION	The second reprocessing of all GPS data gathered by the Analysis Centers of IGS was conducted in late 2013 using the latest models and methodologies. Improved models of antenna phase center variations and solar radiation pressure in JPL's reanalysis are expected to significantly reduce errors. In an earlier work, JPL estimates of position time series, termed first reprocessing campaign, were examined in terms of their spatial and temporal correlation, power spectra, and draconitic signal. Similar analyses are applied to GPS time series at 89 and 66 sites of the second reanalysis with the time span of 7 and 21 years, respectively, to study possible improvements. Our results indicate that the spatial correlations are reduced on average by a factor of 1.25. While the white and flicker noise amplitudes for all components are reduced by 29-56 %, the random walk amplitude is enlarged. The white, flicker, and random walk noise amount to rate errors of, respectively, 0.01, 0.12, and 0.09 mm/yr in the horizontal and 0.04, 0.41 and 0.3 mm/yr in the vertical. Signals reported previously, such as those with periods of 13.63, 14.76, 5.5, and 351.4 / n for days, are identified in multivariate spectra of both data sets. The oscillation of the draconitic signal is reduced by factors of 1.87, 1.87, and 1.68 in the east, north and up components, respectively. Two other signals with Chandlerian period and a period of 380 days can also be detected.	[Amiri-Simkooei, A.

Recent advances in the understanding and modeling capability of open ocean currents have revealed the ubiquitous presence of eddies, fronts, and filaments at scales 10-100 km. Based on realistic numerical models, we show that these structures can be the main source of variability in significant wave heights at scales less than 200 km, including important variations down to 10 km. Model results are consistent with wave height variations along satellite altimeter tracks, resolved at scales larger than 50 km. The spectrum of significant wave heights is found to be of the order of 70 < H-s >(2)/(g(2)< T-m0,T--1 > (2)) times the current spectrum, where < H-s > is the spatially averaged significant wave height, < T-m0,T--1 > is the energy-averaged period, and g is the gravity acceleration. This variability induced by currents has been largely overlooked in spite of its relevance for extreme wave heights and remote sensing. Plain Language Summary We show that the variations in currents at scales 10 to 100 km are the main source of variations in wave heights at the same scales. Our work uses a combination of realistic numerical models for currents and waves and data from the Jason-3 and SARAL/AltiKa satellites. This finding will be of interest for the investigation of extreme wave heights, remote sensing, and air-sea interactions. As an immediate application, the present results will help constrain the error budget of the up-coming satellite missions, in particular the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, and decide how the data will have to be processed to arrive at accurate sea level and wave measurements. It will also help in the analysis of wave measurements by the CFOSAT satellite.

Mars plasma system response to solar wind disturbances during solar minimum	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						ICME transient; fast solar wind stream; ionosphere of Mars; Martian plasma system; Martian boundaries; solar minimum	CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; COROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS; MARTIAN IONOSPHERE; 3-DIMENSIONAL PROPAGATION; RADAR SOUNDINGS; GLOBAL SURVEYOR; MAGNETIC-FIELD; EXPRESS; BOUNDARY; DEPRESSIONS	This paper is a phenomenological description of the ionospheric plasma and induced magnetospheric boundary (IMB) response to two different types of upstream solar wind events impacting Mars in March 2008, at the solar minimum. A total of 16 Mars Express orbits corresponding to five consecutive days is evaluated. Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-B (STEREO-B) at 1AU and Mars Express and Mars Odyssey at 1.644AU detected the arrival of a small transient interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME-like) on the 6 and 7 of March, respectively. This is the first time that this kind of small solar structure is reported at Mars's distance. In both cases, it was followed by a large increase in solar wind velocity that lasted for similar to 10days. This scenario is simulated with the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) - ENLIL + Cone solar solar wind model. At Mars, the ICME-like event caused a strong compression of the magnetosheath and ionosphere, and the recovery lasted for similar to 3 orbits (similar to 20h). After that, the fast stream affected the upper ionosphere and the IMB, which radial and tangential motions in regions close to the subsolar point are analyzed. Moreover, a compression in the Martian plasma system is also observed, although weaker than after the ICME-like impact, and several magnetosheath plasma blobs in the upper ionosphere are detected by Mars Express. We conclude that, during solar minimum and at aphelion, small solar wind structures can create larger perturbations than previously expected in the Martian system.	[Sanchez-Cano, B.; Hall, B. E.

J.; Hong, Yang; Behrangi, Ali; Flamig, Zachary			Evaluation of MRMS Snowfall Products over the Western United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							PRECIPITATION DETECTION; DENSITY; RADAR; TEMPERATURE; SURFACES; LAND	Snow is important to water resources and is of critical importance to society. Ground-weather-radar-based snowfall observations have been highly desirable for large-scale weather monitoring and water resources applications. This study conducts an evaluation of the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) quantitative estimates of snow rate using the Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) daily snow water equivalent (SWE) datasets. A detectability evaluation shows that MRMS is limited in detecting very light snow (daily snow accumulation <5 mm) because of the quality control module in MRMS filtering out weak signals (<5 dBZ). For daily snow accumulation greater than 10 mm, MRMS has good detectability. The quantitative comparisons reveal a bias of -77.37% between MRMS and SNOTEL. Amajority of the underestimation bias occurs in relatively warm conditions with surface temperatures ranging from 2108 to 0 degrees C. A constant reflectivity SWE intensity relationship does not capture the snow mass flux increase associated with denser snow particles at these relatively warm temperatures. There is no clear dependence of the bias on radar beam height. The findings in this study indicate that further improvement in radar snowfall products might occur by deriving appropriate reflectivity-SWE relationships considering the degree of riming and snowflake size.

The Dark Energy Survey view of the Sagittarius stream: discovery of two faint stellar system candidates	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						globular clusters: general; galaxies: dwarf	DWARF SPHEROIDAL GALAXY; MILKY-WAY SATELLITES; PAN-STARRS1 3-PI SURVEY; OLD OPEN CLUSTERS; GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS; STAR CLUSTER; MAGELLAN/M2FS SPECTROSCOPY; HALO; CONSTELLATION; KINEMATICS	We report the discovery of two new candidate stellar systems in the constellation of Cetus using the data from the first two years of the Dark E nergy Survey (DES). The objects, DES J0111-1341 and DES J0225+ 0304, are located at a heliocentric distance of -25 kpc and appear to have old and metal-poor populations. Their distances to the Sagittarius orbital plane, -1.73 kpc (DES J0111-1341) and -0.50 kpc (DES J0225+ 0304), indicate that they are possibly associated with the Sagittarius dwarf stream. The half-light radius (r(h) similar or equal to 4.55 pc) and luminosity (MV similar or equal to + 0.3) of DES J0111-1341 are consistent with it being an ultrafaint stellar cluster, while the half-light radius (rh similar or equal to 18.55 pc) and luminosity (MV similar or equal to -1.1) of DES J0225+ 0304 place it in an ambiguous region of size-luminosity space between stellar clusters and dwarf galaxies. Determinations of the characteristic parameters of the Sagittarius stream, metallicity spread (-2.18 <= [ Fe/ H] <= -0.95) and distance gradient (23 kpc <= D-circle dot <= 29 kpc), within the DES footprint in the Southern hemisphere, using the same DES data, also indicate a possible association between these systems. If these objects are confirmed through spectroscopic follow-up to be gravitationally bound systems and to share a Galactic trajectory with the Sagittarius stream, DES J0111-1341 and DES J0225+ 0304 would be the first ultrafaint stellar systems associated with the Sagittarius stream. Furthermore, DES J0225+ 0304 would also be the first confirmed case of an ultrafaint satellite of a satellite.

Using in situ accelerometers, we measure the acceleration profile during the impacts and determine the peak accelerations, collision durations and maximum penetration depth. We find that the penetration depth scales linearly with the collision velocity but is independent of the effective gravity for the experimental range tested, and that the collision duration is independent of both the effective gravity and the collision velocity. No rebounds are observed in any of the experiments. Our low-gravity experimental results indicate that the transition from the quasi-static regime to the inertial regime occurs for impact energies two orders of magnitude smaller than in similar impact experiments under terrestrial gravity. The lower energy regime change may be due to the increased hydrodynamic drag of the surface material in our experiments, but may also support the notion that the quasi-static regime reduces as the effective gravity becomes lower.

Growing supermassive black holes in the late stages of galaxy mergers are heavily obscured	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general; galaxies: Seyfert; infrared: galaxies; X-rays: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; ULTRALUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES; MU-M SPECTROSCOPY; HARD X-RAY; SKY LIRG SURVEY; SIMILAR-TO 2; VIBRATIONALLY EXCITED HCN; SPITZER-SPACE-TELESCOPE; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA	Mergers of galaxies are thought to cause significant gas inflows to the inner parsecs, which can activate rapid accretion on to supermassive black holes (SMBHs), giving rise to active galactic nuclei (AGN). During a significant fraction of this process, SMBHs are predicted to be enshrouded by gas and dust. Studying 52 galactic nuclei in infrared-selected local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies in different merger stages in the hard X-ray band, where radiation is less affected by absorption, we find that the amount of material around SMBHs increases during the last phases of the merger. We find that the fraction of Compton-thick (CT, N-H >= 10(24) cm(-2)) AGN in late-merger galaxies is higher (f(CT) = 65(-13)(+12) per cent) than in local hard X-ray selected AGN (f(CT) = 27 +/- 4 per cent), and that obscuration reaches its maximum when the nuclei of the two merging galaxies are at a projected distance of D-12 +/- 0.4-10.8 kpc (f(CT) = 77(-17)(+13) per cent). We also find that all AGN of our sample in late-merger galaxies have N-H > 10(23) cm(-2), which implies that the obscuring material covers 95(-8)(+4) per cent of the X-ray source. These observations show that the material is most effectively funnelled from the galactic scale to the inner tens of parsecs during the late stages of galaxy mergers, and that the close environment of SMBHs in advanced mergers is richer in gas and dust with respect to that of SMBHs in isolated galaxies, and cannot be explained by the classical AGN unification model in which the torus is responsible for the obscuration.

A stellar overdensity associated with the Small Magellanic Cloud	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: interactions; Magellanic Clouds	STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; N-BODY SIMULATIONS; PROPER-MOTION; RED GIANTS; SKY SURVEY; DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION; DWARF GALAXY; STREAM; ORIGIN; MASS	We report the discovery of a stellar overdensity 8 degrees north of the centre of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Small Magellanic Cloud Northern Over-Density; SMCNOD), using data from the first 2 yr of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the first year of the MAGellanic SatelLITEs Survey (MagLiteS). The SMCNOD is indistinguishable in age, metallicity and distance from the nearby SMC stars, being primarily composed of intermediate-age stars (6 Gyr, Z=0.001), with a small fraction of young stars (1 Gyr, Z=0.01). The SMCNOD has an elongated shape with an ellipticity of 0.6 and a size of similar to 6 degrees x 2 degrees. It has an absolute magnitude of M-V congruent to -7.7, r(h) = 2.1 kpc, and mu v(r < r(h)) = 31.2 mag arcsec(-2). We estimate a stellar mass of similar to 10(5) M-circle dot, following a Kroupa mass function. The SMCNOD was probably removed from the SMC disc by tidal stripping, since it is located near the head of the Magellanic Stream, and the literature indicates likely recent Large Magellanic Cloud-SMC encounters. This scenario is supported by the lack of significant H-1 gas. Other potential scenarios for the SMCNOD origin are a transient overdensity within the SMC tidal radius or a primordial SMC satellite in advanced stage of disruption.	[Pieres, A.; Santiago, B.

Galaxy populations in massive galaxy clusters to z=1.1: colour distribution, concentration, halo occupation number and red sequence fraction	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: clusters: individual; galaxies: evolution; galaxies:formation; galaxies: luminosity function; mass function	SOUTH-POLE TELESCOPE; SIMILAR-TO 1; BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; SPT-SZ SURVEY; NEAR-INFRARED PROPERTIES; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; K-BAND PROPERTIES; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; MAGNITUDE RELATION; X-RAY	We study the galaxy populations in 74 Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters from the South Pole Telescope survey, which have been imaged in the science verification phase of the Dark Energy Survey. The sample extends up to z similar to 1.1 with 4 x 10(14)M(circle dot) <= M-200 <= 3 x 10(15)M(circle dot). Using the band containing the 4000 angstrom break and its redward neighbour, we study the colour-magnitude distributions of cluster galaxies to similar to m(*) + 2, finding that: (1) The intrinsic rest frame g - r colour width of the red sequence (RS) population is similar to 0.03 out to z similar to 0.85 with a preference for an increase to similar to 0.07 at z = 1, and (2) the prominence of the RS declines beyond z similar to 0.6. The spatial distribution of cluster galaxies is well described by the NFW profile out to 4R(200) with a concentration of c(g) = 3.59(-0.18)(+0.20), 5.37(-0.24)(+0.27) and 1.38(-0.19)(+0.21) for the full, the RS and the blue non-RS populations, respectively, but with similar to 40 per cent to 55 per cent cluster to cluster variation and no statistically significant redshift or mass trends. The number of galaxies within the virial region N-200 exhibits a mass trend indicating that the number of galaxies per unit total mass is lower in the most massive clusters, and shows no significant redshift trend. The RS fraction within R-200 is (68 +/- 3) per cent at z = 0.46, varies from similar to 55 per cent at z = 1 to similar to 80 per cent at z = 0.1 and exhibits intrinsic variation among	[Hennig, C.; Mohr, J.

VLT/FORS2 comparative transmission spectroscopy II: Confirmation of a cloud deck and Rayleigh scattering in WASP-31b, but no potassium?	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; techniques: spectroscopic; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; stars: individual: WASP-31; planetary systems	TIME-SERIES PHOTOMETRY; EXOPLANET HD 189733B; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; TRANSITING PLANET; ATMOSPHERIC HAZE; SPECTRUM; HUBBLE; CLEAR; NA	We present transmission spectroscopy of the hot-Jupiter WASP-31b using the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large Telescope during two primary transits. The observations cover a wavelength range of approximate to 400-840 nm. The light curves are corrupted by significant systematics, but these were to first-order invariant with wavelength and could be removed using a common-mode correction derived from the white light curves. We reach a precision in the transit depth of approximate to 140 ppm in 15 nm bins, although the precision varies significantly over the wavelength range. Our FORS2 observations confirm the cloud deck previously inferred using Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). We also re-analyse the HST/STIS data using a Gaussian process model, finding excellent agreement with earlier measurements. We reproduce the Rayleigh scattering signature at short wavelengths (less than or similar to 5300 angstrom) and the cloud deck at longer wavelengths. However, our FORS2 observations appear to rule out the large potassium feature previously detected using STIS, yet it is recovered from the HST/STIS data, although with reduced amplitude and significance (approximate to 2.5 sigma). The discrepancy between our results and the earlier STIS detection of potassium (approximate to 4.3 sigma) is either a result of telluric contamination of the ground-based observations, or an underestimate of the uncertainties for narrow-band features in HST/STIS when using linear basis models to account for the systematics. Our results further demonstrate the use of ground-based multi-object spectrographs for the study of exoplanet atmospheres, and highlight the need for caution in our interpretation of narrow-band features in low-resolution spectra of hot Jupiters.

This survey, the largest of its kind to date, finds eight confirmed binary systems and three confirmed triple systems. These include three new multi-stellar systems (HD 30856, HD 86081, and HD 207832) and three multi-stellar systems with newly confirmed common proper motion (HD 43691, HD 116029, and HD 164509). We combine these systems with seven RV planet-hosting multi-stellar systems from the literature in order to test for differences in the properties of planets with semimajor axes ranging between 0.1 and 5 au in single versus multi-stellar systems. We find no evidence that the presence or absence of stellar companions alters the distribution of planet properties in these systems. Although the observed stellar companions might influence the orbits of more distant planetary companions in these systems, our RV observations currently provide only weak constraints on the masses and orbital properties of planets beyond 5 au. In order to aid future efforts to characterize long-period RV companions in these systems, we publish our contrast curves for all 144 targets. Using four years of astrometry for six hierarchical triple star systems hosting giant planets, we fit the orbits of the stellar companions in order to characterize the orbital architecture in these systems. We find that the orbital plane of the secondary and tertiary companions are inconsistent with an edge-on orbit in four out of six cases.

Upper-Ocean Contribution to Short-Term Regional Coastal Sea Level Variability along the United States	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							WARMING HIATUS; NORTH-AMERICA; PACIFIC; RISE; CIRCULATION; SLOWDOWN	The upper ocean thermal structure is largely influenced by natural internal variability, and it modulates global surface temperature as well as regional sea level anomalies over decadal time scales. The internal variability of some important oceanographic processes, such as the Pacific decadal oscillation, can cause differences of 10 to 20 cm relative to the global mean in many coastal locations. These differences are sufficient to alter decisions between soft and/or large protective measures on every coast. Yet, current indicators of sea level changes are based on either surface variables or subsurface ocean measurements through the entire water column. There is also a lack of focus on short-term predictions of sea level change and concrete applications of these predictions at regional scale, which clouds local decision-making. The results herein confirm that the information contained within the top 300m of the ocean is essential to capture decadal, regional relative sea level variability, whereas depths well below the thermocline do not appear to be closely tied to these large oscillations. Hence, the authors propose a regionally scoped indicator based on upperocean temperature as a first step toward identifying trend changes in short-term sea level rise over large coastal regions of the United States. The proposed indicator is a promising new tool that could help close the gaps mentioned above and improve the utility of existing local sea level records.

A powerful flare from Sgr A* confirms the synchrotron nature of the X-ray emission	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; methods: data analysis; Galaxy: centre	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLE; SIMULTANEOUS MULTIWAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS; SOFT GAMMA-RAY; GALACTIC-CENTER; XMM-NEWTON; STELLAR WINDS; RELATIVISTIC RECONNECTION; INFRARED VARIABILITY; GRMHD SIMULATIONS; BRIGHTEST FLARE	We present the first fully simultaneous fits to the near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray spectral slope (and its evolution) during a very bright flare from Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the MilkyWay's centre. Our study arises from ambitious multiwavelength monitoring campaigns with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and SINFONI. The average multiwavelength spectrum is well reproduced by a broken power law with Gamma(NIR) = 1.7 +/- 0.1 and Gamma(X) = 2.27 +/- 0.12. The difference in spectral slopes (Delta Gamma = 0.57 +/- 0.09) strongly supports synchrotron emission with a cooling break. The flare starts first in the NIR with a flat and bright NIR spectrum, while X-ray radiation is detected only after about 103 s, when a very steep X-ray spectrum (Delta Gamma = 1.8 +/- 0.4) is observed. These measurements are consistent with synchrotron emission with a cooling break and they suggest that the high-energy cut-off in the electron distribution (gamma(max)) induces an initial cut-off in the optical-UV band that evolves slowly into the X-ray band. The temporal and spectral evolution observed in all bright X-ray flares are also in line with a slow evolution of gamma(max). We also observe hints for a variation of the cooling break that might be induced by an evolution of the magnetic field (from B similar to 30 +/- 8 G to B similar to 4.8 +/- 1.7 G at the X-ray peak). Such drop of the magnetic field at the flare peak would be expected if the acceleration mechanism is tapping energy from the magnetic field, such as in magnetic reconnection. We conclude that synchrotron emission with a cooling break is a viable process for Sgr A*' s flaring emission.

Laboratory measurements of nitrogen dissolution in Titan lake fluids	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Geological processes; Titan surface	ORTHOBARIC LIQUID DENSITIES; MOLAR-MASS ALKANES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; TRANSIENT FEATURES; HYDROCARBON LAKES; EXCESS VOLUMES; KRAKEN MARE; METHANE; SURFACE; ETHANE	We obtained laboratory measurements of nitrogen solubility in mixed solutions of ethane and methane at temperatures and pressures relevant to Titan's lakes and seas. Our results show that nitrogen solubility is increased at higher methane concentration, lower temperature, and higher pressure. We developed an empirical fit that agrees well with our measurements. We show that significant volumes of nitrogen gas will be released from Titan lake fluids on heating, and that significant volumes of nitrogen gas will be absorbed by Titan lake fluids on cooling. The densities of the lake fluids will be affected by nitrogen dissolution. We also show that mixing of two cryogenic fluids of different composition can lead to the release of large amounts of nitrogen gas. This has implications for lake fluids, bubble formation, geological phenomena, and also for future landed missions on the surface of Titan. We find in particular that methane-rich lakes at lower temperatures on Titan will be the most sensitive to changes in surface conditions, either cooling, heating, or compositional mixing.

A stellar census of the nearby, young 32 Orionis group	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: fundamental parameters; stars: kinematics and dynamics; stars: pre-mainsequence; open clusters and associations: general; solar neighbourhood	T-TAURI STARS; LITHIUM DEPLETION BOUNDARY; LOW-MASS STARS; VERY-LOW MASS; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; MAIN-SEQUENCE ISOCHRONES; RADIAL-VELOCITIES; BETA-PICTORIS; FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETERS; MAGNETIC INHIBITION	The 32 Orionis group was discovered almost a decade ago and despite the fact that it represents the first northern, young (age similar to 25Myr) stellar aggregate within 100 pc of the Sun (d similar or equal to 93 pc), a comprehensive survey for members and detailed characterization of the group has yet to be performed. We present the first large-scale spectroscopic survey for new (predominantly M type) members of the group after combining kinematic and photometric data to select candidates with Galactic space motion and positions in colour-magnitude space consistent with membership. We identify 30 new members, increasing the number of known 32 Ori group members by a factor of 3 and bringing the total number of identified members to 46, spanning spectral types B5 to L1. We also identify the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) of the group, i.e. the luminosity at which lithium remains unburnt in a coeval population. We estimate the age of the 32 Ori group independently using both isochronal fitting and LDB analyses and find it is essentially coeval with the beta Pictoris moving group, with an age of 24 +/- 4Myr. Finally, we have also searched for circumstellar disc hosts utilizing the AllWISE catalogue. Although we find no evidence for warm, dusty discs, we identify several stars with excess emission in the WISE W4 band at 22 mu m. Based on the limited number of W4 detections, we estimate a debris disc fraction of 32(-8)(+12) per cent for the 32 Ori group.	[Bell, Cameron P.

An analytical formalism accounting for clouds and other 'surfaces' for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						radiative transfer; atmospheric effects; methods: analytical; planets and satellites: atmospheres	WEBB-SPACE-TELESCOPE; TRANSITING PLANET ATMOSPHERES; SUPER-EARTHS; GJ 1214B; RAYLEIGH-SCATTERING; RETRIEVAL; SPECTRUM; ECLIPSE; WATER; REFRACTION	Although the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et al. is extremely useful to understand what shapes transmission spectra of exoplanets, it does not include the effects of a sharp change in flux with altitude generally associated with surfaces and optically thick clouds. Recent advances in understanding the effects of refraction in exoplanet transmission spectra have, however, demonstrated that even clear thick atmospheres have such a sharp change in flux due to a refractive boundary. We derive a more widely applicable analytical formalism by including first-order effects from all these 'surfaces' to compute an exoplanet's effective radius, effective atmospheric thickness and spectral modulation for an atmosphere with a constant scaleheight. We show that the effective radius cannot be located below these 'surfaces' and that our formalism matches the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et al. in the case of a clear atmosphere. Our formalism explains why clouds and refraction reduce the contrast of spectral features, and why refraction decreases the Rayleigh scattering slope as wavelength increases, but also shows that these are common effects of all 'surfaces'. We introduce the concept of a 'surface' cross-section, the minimum mean cross-section that can be observed, as an index to characterize the location of 'surfaces' and provide a simple method to estimate their effects on the spectral modulation of homogeneous atmospheres. We finally devise a numerical recipe that extends our formalism to atmospheres with a non-constant scaleheight and arbitrary sources of opacity, a potentially necessary step to interpret observations.

We explore how future CFIRB experiments can optimally improve the SFR constraints beyond the current measurements of Planck. We introduce a model-independent, piecewise parametrization for SFR as a function of halo mass and redshift, and we calculate the Fisher matrix and principal components of these parameters to estimate the SFR constraints of future experiments. We investigate how the SFR constraints depend on angular resolution, number and range of frequency bands, survey coverage and instrumental sensitivity. We find that the angular resolution and the instrumental sensitivity play the key roles. Improving the angular resolution from 20 to 4 arcmin can improve the SFR constraints by 1.5-2.5 orders of magnitude. With the angular resolution of Planck, improving the sensitivity by 10 or 100 times can improve the SFR constraints by one or two orders of magnitude, and doubling the number of frequency bands can also improve the SFR constraints by an order of magnitude. We find that survey designs like the Cosmic Origins Explorer (CORE) are very close to the optimal design for improving the SFR constraints at all redshifts, while survey designs like LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 can significantly improve the SFR constraints at z greater than or similar to 3.

The weak Fe fluorescence line and long-term X-ray evolution of the Compton-thick active galactic nucleus in NGC7674	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: individual (NGC 7674)	NUSTAR EXTRAGALACTIC SURVEYS; SUBARCSECOND MIDINFRARED VIEW; SEYFERT 2 GALAXIES; XMM-NEWTON; COMPLETE SAMPLE; STAR-FORMATION; NUMBER COUNTS; OBSCURED AGN; K EMISSION; RADIO-LOUD	We present NuSTAR X-ray observations of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC7674. The source shows a flat X-ray spectrum, suggesting that it is obscured by Compton-thick gas columns. Based upon long-term flux dimming, previous work suggested the alternate possibility that the source is a recently switched-off AGN with the observed X-rays being the lagged echo from the torus. Our high-quality data show the source to be reflection-dominated in hard X-rays, but with a relatively weak neutral Fe K alpha emission line (equivalent width [ EW] of approximate to 0.4 keV) and a strong Fe XXVI ionized line (EW approximate to 0.2 keV). We construct an updated longterm X-ray light curve of NGC7674 and find that the observed 2-10 keV flux has remained constant for the past approximate to 20 yr, following a high-flux state probed by Ginga. Light travel time arguments constrain the minimum radius of the reflector to be similar to 3.2 pc under the switched-off AGN scenario, approximate to 30 times larger than the expected dust sublimation radius, rendering this possibility unlikely. A patchy Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN) solution is plausible, requiring a minimum line-of-sight column density (N-H) of 3 x 10(24) cm(-2) at present, and yields an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of (3-5) x 10(43) erg s(-1). Realistic uncertainties span the range of approximate to (1-13) x10(43) erg s(-1). The source has one of the weakest fluorescence lines amongst bona fide CTAGN, and is potentially a local analogue of bolometrically luminous systems showing complex neutral and ionized Fe emission. It exemplifies the difficulty of identification and proper characterization of distant CTAGN based on the strength of the neutral Fe K alpha line.	[Gandhi, P.; Boorman, P.

Optimization of Parameters of MgB2 Hot-Electron Bolometers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY			English	Article						Hot electron bolometers; MgB2; superconducting devices; terahertz mixers		Hot-electron bolometers (HEBs) made with MgB2 have proven to have a large intermediate frequency and have shown potential for a low noise into the terahertz range. Although practical results from these mixers have been achieved fairly quickly, effort is still needed to realize an MgB2 HEB with improved sensitivity to compete with state-of-the-art mixers. Here, we present the results of our mixer work to achieve MgB2 HEBs based on hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition grown films, with improved sensitivity and higher temperature operation. A new fabrication process is developed which utilizes even thinner films (< 10 nm) allowing for the improvement of the impedance match of the mixer device with the Au spiral antenna. Integrated superconducting contacts prevent deterioration of the sensitivity due to the electron diffusion. The mixer noise temperature is 2000 and 3600 K at 600 and 1.9 THz, respectively, with minimal dependence on the bath temperature until over 20 K. The noise bandwidth of the mixer is 6.5 GHz at 4.2 K and is expected to be larger at higher operating temperature.

Here, we present a study of its calving dynamics combining a two-dimensional flow-band full-Stokes (FS) model of its viscous flow with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory to model crevasse propagation and ice fracturing. We compare the results with those obtained with the higher-order (HO) and the shallow-shelf approximation (SSA) models coupled with LEFM. We find that FS/LEFM produces surface and bottom crevasses that are consistent with the distribution of depth and width of surface and bottom crevasses observed by NASA's Operation IceBridge radar depth sounder and laser altimeter, whereas HO/LEFM and SSA/LEFM do not generate crevasses that are consistent with observations. We attribute the difference to the non-hydrostatic condition of ice near the grounding line, which facilitates crevasse formation and is accounted for by the FS model but not by the HO or SSA models. We find that calving is enhanced when pre-existing surface crevasses are present, when the ice shelf is shortened or when the ice shelf front is undercut. The role of undercutting depends on the timescale of calving events. It is more prominent for glaciers with rapid calving rates than for glaciers with slow calving rates. Glaciers extending into a shorter ice shelf are more vulnerable to calving than glaciers developing a long ice shelf, especially as the ice front retreats close to the grounding line region, which leads to a positive feedback to calving events. We conclude that the FS/LEFM combination yields substantial improvements in capturing the stress field near the grounding line of a glacier for constraining crevasse formation and iceberg calving.

High quality factor manganese-doped aluminum lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors sensitive to frequencies below 100 GHz	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							TEMPERATURE; ALLOYS	Aluminum lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) sensitive to millimeter-wave photons have been shown to exhibit high quality factors, making them highly sensitive and multi-plexable. The superconducting gap of aluminum limits aluminum LEKIDs to photon frequencies above 100 GHz. Manganese-doped aluminum (Al-Mn) has a tunable critical temperature and could therefore be an attractive material for LEKIDs sensitive to frequencies below 100 GHz if the internal quality factor remains sufficiently high when manganese is added to the film. To investigate, we measured some of the key properties of Al-Mn LEKIDs. A prototype eight-element LEKID array was fabricated using a 40 nm thick film of Al-Mn deposited on a 500 mu m thick high-resistivity, float-zone silicon substrate. The manganese content was 900 ppm, the measured T-c = 694 +/- 1mK, and the resonance frequencies were near 150 MHz. Using measurements of the forward scattering parameter S-21 at various bath temperatures between 65 and 250 mK, we determined that the Al-Mn LEKIDs we fabricated have internal quality factors greater than 2 x 10(5), which is high enough for millimeter-wave astrophysical observations. In the dark conditions under which these devices were measured, the fractional frequency noise spectrum shows a shallow slope that depends on bath temperature and probe tone amplitude, which could be two-level system noise. The anticipated white photon noise should dominate this level of low-frequency noise when the detectors are illuminated with millimeter-waves in future measurements. The LEKIDs responded to light pulses from a 1550 nm light-emitting diode, and we used these light pulses to determine that the quasiparticle lifetime is 60 mu s. (C) 2017 Author(s).

Poleward of 64-68 degrees planetocentric latitude, where Jupiter's east-west banded structure breaks down, several types of discrete features appear on a darker background. Cyclonic oval features are clustered near both poles. Other oval-shaped features are also present, ranging in size from 2000 km down to JunoCam's resolution limits. The largest and brightest features often have chaotic shapes. Two narrow linear features in the north, associated with an overlying haze feature, traverse tens of degrees of longitude. JunoCam also detected an optically thin cloud or haze layer past the northern nightside terminator estimated to be 58 +/- 21 km (approximately three scale heights) above the main cloud deck. JunoCam will acquire polar images on every perijove, allowing us to track the state and evolution of longer-lived features.

Multiple-wavelength sensing of Jupiter during the Juno mission's first perijove passage	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERE	We compare Jupiter observations made around 27 August 2016 by Juno's JunoCam, Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM), MicroWave Radiometer (MWR) instruments, and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. Visibly dark regions are highly correlated with bright areas at 5 mu m, a wavelength sensitive to gaseous NH3 gas and particulate opacity at p <= 5 bars. A general correlation between 5-mu m and microwave radiances arises from a similar dependence on NH3 opacity. Significant exceptions are present and probably arise from additional particulate opacity at 5 mu m. JIRAM spectroscopy and the MWR derive consistent 5-bar NH3 abundances that are within the lower bounds of Galileo measurement uncertainties. Vigorous upward vertical transport near the equator is likely responsible for high NH3 abundances and with enhanced abundances of some disequilibrium species used as indirect indicators of vertical motions. Plain Language Summary Comparison of observations of Jupiter by different Juno and ground-based instruments verified some long-standing relationships, such as those between visibly dark regions and clear, dry parts of the atmosphere. But Juno saw significant exceptions. Different instrument results for the abundance of ammonia gas, a condensate similar to water in the Earth's atmosphere, at 5 bars of pressure were self-consistent and within the uncertainty of Galileo results. The substantial upwelling of ammonia detected by the Microwave Radiometer from great depth near the equator is consistent with other indirect tracers of vertical winds.	[Orton, G.

The shallow subduction interface is typically located in unconsolidated sediments that are considered too weak to accumulate elastic strain. However, the spectrum of shallow fault slip behavior is still elusive, due in large part to the lack of near-field observations. Here we combine measurements from seafloor pressure sensors near the trench and an onshore GPS network in a time-dependent inversion to image the initiation and migration of a well-documented slow slip event (SSE) in 2007 at the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. Our results show that the shallow SSE initiated on the shallow subduction interface at a depth of similar to 15km, where pore fluid pressure is inferred to be high, and propagated all the way to the trench. The migrating event may have triggered a second subevent that occurred 1 month later. Our results document the release of elastic strain at the shallow part of the subduction megathrust and suggest prior accumulation of elastic strain. In conjunction with near-trench shallow slow slip recently reported for the Hikurangi subduction zone and trench breaching ruptures revealed in some large earthquakes, our results suggest that near-trench strain accumulation and release at the shallower portions of the subduction interface is more common than previously thought.

Mass transport waves amplified by intense Greenland melt and detected in solid Earth deformation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ICE-SHEET; SEA-LEVEL; MODEL; ACCELERATION; DRIVEN; LAKE; SPEED; GRACE	The annual cycle and secular trend of Greenland mass loading are well recorded in measurements of solid Earth deformation. Horizontal crustal displacements can potentially track the spatiotemporal detail of mass changes with great fidelity. Our analysis of Greenland crustal motion data reveals that a significant excitation of horizontal amplitudes occurs during the intense melt years. We discover that solitary seasonal waves of substantial mass transport (1.67 +/- 0.54 Gt/month) traveled at an average speed of 7.1 km/month through Rink Glacier in 2012. We deduce that intense surface melting enhanced either basal lubrication or softening of shear margins, or both, causing the glacier to thin dynamically in summer. The newly routed upstream subglacial water was likely to be both retarded and inefficient, thus providing a causal mechanism for the prolonged ice transport to continue well into the winter months. As the climate continues to produce increasingly warmer spring and summer, amplified seasonal waves of mass transport may become ever more present with important ramifications for the future sea level rise. Plain Language Summary It has become well known that seasonal ice flow variability of Greenland outlet glaciers may often be associated with the drainage of supraglacial lakes that accumulate meltwater during summer. However, tracking the details is inevitably limited due to the fact that the mechanisms and rates of meltwater transfer are hidden from view, and theoretical models are fraught with a number of difficulties. Here we use a previously unrecognized source of data that constrain the mass transport during a season of intense Greenland melting and document the evolution of a mass transport wave as it passes down glacier. The breakthrough is twofold: demonstration of the power of the new technique and the first measurement of the mass amplitude. The technique is effectively using the measurement of the deformed solid Earth elastic response as a filter that uniquely responds to neighboring glacier mass changes. We quantify that the wave through Rink Glacier is enormous in terms of its mass transport, amounting to about half of the average annual discharge during 2000-2005, and travels at an average speed of 7.1 km/month. Our mass transport wave measurement is the first of its kind, on any of the major outlet glaciers of either Greenland or Antarctica.	[Adhikari, S.; Ivins, E.

Accelerated flows at Jupiter's magnetopause: Evidence for magnetic reconnection along the dawn flank	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							EARTHS MAGNETOPAUSE; MESSENGER OBSERVATIONS; JOVIAN MAGNETOPAUSE; FIELD; MAGNETOSPHERES; DYNAMICS	We report on plasma and magnetic field observations from Juno's Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment and Magnetic Field Investigation at 18 magnetopause crossings when the spacecraft was located at similar to 6 h magnetic local time and 73-114 Jovian radii from Jupiter. Several crossings showed evidence of plasma energization, accelerated ion flows, and large magnetic shear angles, each representing a signature of magnetic reconnection. These signatures were observed for times when the magnetosphere was in both compressed and expanded states. We compared the flow change magnitudes to a simplified Walen relation and found similar to 60% of the events to be 110% or less of the predicted values. Close examination of two magnetopause encounters revealed characteristics of a rotational discontinuity and an open magnetopause. These observations provide compelling evidence that magnetic reconnection can occur at Jupiter's dawn magnetopause and should be incorporated into theories of solar wind coupling and outer magnetosphere dynamics at Jupiter.

Juno observations of energetic charged particles over Jupiter's polar regions: Analysis of monodirectional and bidirectional electron beams	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							AURORAL OVAL	Juno obtained unique low-altitude space environment measurements over Jupiter's poles on 27 August 2016. Here Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument observations are presented for electrons (25-800 keV) and protons (10-1500 keV). We analyze magnetic field-aligned electron angular beams over expected auroral regions that were sometimes symmetric (bidirectional) but more often strongly asymmetric. Included are variable but surprisingly persistent upward, monodirectional electron angular beams emerging from what we term the "polar cap," poleward of the nominal auroral ovals. The energy spectra of all beams were monotonic and hard (not structured in energy), showing power law-like distributions often extending beyond similar to 800 keV. Given highly variable downward energy fluxes (below 1 R-J altitudes within the loss cone) as high as 280mW/m(2), we suggest that mechanisms generating these beams are among the primary processes generating Jupiter's uniquely intense auroral emissions, distinct from what is typically observed at Earth.

Observation and interpretation of energetic ion conics in Jupiter's polar magnetosphere	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PARTICLE ENERGIZATION; CURRENT REGION; ACCELERATION; BEAMS	NASA's Juno spacecraft successfully completed its first science polar pass over Jupiter's northern and southern aurora, with all the instruments powered, on 27 August 2016. Observations of conical energetic proton distributions at low altitudes (<6 R-J) over the northern polar region are interpreted as resulting from transversely (to the local magnetic field lines) accelerated H+ at a position planetward of the point of observation. The proton conics were observed within a broad region of upward beaming electrons and were accompanied by broadband low-frequency wave emissions as well as low-altitude trapped magnetospheric protons and heavy ions. The characteristic energies associated with these accelerated ion conics are similar to 100 times more energetic than similar distributions observed in the Earth's auroral region and similar in energy to those found at Saturn. In addition, the ion conics also exhibited pitch angle dispersion with time that is interpreted as a consequence of the structure of the source location. Mapping these distributions along magnetic field lines connected from the spacecraft to the ionosphere suggests that the source region exists at altitudes between similar to 3 and 5 R-J. These new and exciting observations of accelerated ions over the polar region of Jupiter open up new areas for comparative planetary auroral physics.	[Clark, G.; Mauk, B.

Radiation near Jupiter detected by Juno/JEDI during PJ1 and PJ3	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article								After its capture into Jupiter orbit early in the summer of 2016, the Juno spacecraft made three close flybys of the planet to date. The Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) made continuous measurements during perijoves in late August and early December. Here we describe the radiation (approximately hundreds of keV to more than 10 MeV charged particles) that was measured close to Jupiter. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the first direct energetic charged particle measurements ever obtained at high magnetic latitude very close to Jupiter and to interpret these data using techniques that rely on the instrument design. We generate an electron energy spectrum in an intense radiation region where the JEDI foreground is only about 40% of the rate due to > 15 MeV electrons.	[Paranicas, C.; Mauk, B. H.; Haggerty, D.

Generation of the Jovian hectometric radiation: First lessons from Juno	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							AURORAL KILOMETRIC RADIATION; MASER SYNCHROTRON INSTABILITY; CYCLOTRON; MECHANISM	Using Juno plasma and wave and magnetic observations (JADE and Waves and MAG instruments), the generation mechanism of the Jovian hectometric radio emission is analyzed. It is shown that suitable conditions for the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) are observed in the regions of the radio sources. Pronounced loss cone in the electron distributions are likely the source of free energy for the instability. The theory reveals that sufficient growth rates are obtained from the distribution functions that are measured by the JADE-Electron instrument. The CMI would be driven by upgoing electron populations at 5-10 keV and 10-30 degrees pitch angle, the amplified waves propagating at 82 degrees-87 degrees from the B field, a fraction of a percent above the gyrofrequency. Typical e-folding times of 10(-4) s are obtained, leading to an amplification path of similar to 1000 km. Overall, this scenario for generation of the Jovian hectometric waves differs significantly from the case of the auroral kilometric radiation at Earth.

Plasma waves in Jupiter's high-latitude regions: Observations from the Juno spacecraft	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WHISTLER-MODE RADIATION; AURORAL HISS; FIELD; FLUX	The Juno Waves instrument detected a new broadband plasma wave emission (similar to 50 Hz to 40 kHz) on 27 August 2016 as the spacecraft passed over the low-altitude polar regions of Jupiter. We investigated the characteristics of this emission and found similarities to whistler mode auroral hiss observed at Earth, including a funnel-shaped frequency-time feature. The electron cyclotron frequency is much higher than both the emission frequency and local plasma frequency, which is assumed to be similar to 20-40 kHz. The E/cB ratio was about three near the start of the event and then decreased to one for the rest of the period. A correlation of the electric field spectral density with the flux of an upgoing 20 to 800 keV electron beam was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.59. We conclude that the emission is propagating in the whistler mode and is driven by the energetic upgoing electron beam.	[Tetrick, S. S.; Gurnett, D. A.; Kurth, W. S.; Imai, M.; Hospodarsky, G.

P.; Levin, Steven M.; Lecacheux, Alain; Lamy, Laurent; Zarka, Philippe			Latitudinal beaming of Jovian decametric radio emissions as viewed from Juno and the Nancay Decameter Array	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							JUPITER	Two well-defined Jovian decametric radio arcs were observed at latitudinal separations of 11 degrees-16 degrees from the Juno spacecraft near Jupiter and the Nancay Decameter Array (NDA) at Earth on 17 May and 25 August 2016. These discrete arcs are from the so-called A source covering both Io-related and non-Io-related emissions. By measuring the wave arrival time at two distant observers with propagation time correction, the remaining delay times are 92.8 +/- 1.3 min for the first arc and 116.0 +/- 1.2 min for the second arc. This implies that both radio sources are not controlled by the orbital motion of Io but Jupiter's rotation itself. The geometrical information for Juno and NDA and the loss cone-driven electron cyclotron maser instability theory provide these radio sources that are located at about 173 degrees +/- 10 degrees in system III longitude projected onto Jupiter's north surface and imply resonant electron energy ranges from 0.5 to 11 keV.

Morphology of the UV aurorae Jupiter during Juno's first perijove observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							IO FLUX TUBE; JOVIAN AURORA; INJECTIONS; EMISSION; TAIL	On 27 August 2016, the NASA Juno spacecraft performed its first close-up observations of Jupiter during its perijove. Here we present the UV images and color ratio maps from the Juno-UVS UV imaging spectrograph acquired at that time. Data were acquired during four sequences (three in the north, one in the south) from 5:00 UT to 13:00 UT. From these observations, we produced complete maps of the Jovian aurorae, including the nightside. The sequence shows the development of intense outer emission outside the main oval, first in a localized region (255 degrees - 295 degrees System III longitude) and then all around the pole, followed by a large nightside protrusion of auroral emissions from the main emission into the polar region. Some localized features show signs of differential drift with energy, typical of plasma injections in the middle magnetosphere. Finally, the color-ratio map in the north shows a well-defined area in the polar region possibly linked to the polar cap.

Juno's Radiation Monitoring Investigation collected particle counts and noise signatures from penetrating high-energy particle impacts in images acquired by the Stellar Reference Unit and Advanced Stellar Compass star trackers, and the Jupiter Infrared Auroral Mapper infrared imager. This coordinated observation campaign sampled radiation at the inner edges of the high-latitude lobes of the synchrotron emission region and more distant environments. Inferred omnidirectional >5 MeV and >10 MeV electron fluxes derived from these measurements provide valuable constraints for models of relativistic electron environments in the inner radiation belts. Several intense bursts of high-energy particle counts were also observed by the Advanced Stellar Compass in polar regions outside the radiation belts.

Jovian bow shock and magnetopause encounters by the Juno spacecraft	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PLASMA-WAVE OBSERVATIONS; FREQUENCY; JUPITER	The Juno spacecraft has crossed Jupiter's bow shock (BS) and magnetopause (MP) multiple times in the dawn sector (near 0600 local time), both during the approach to Jupiter and during the first three apojove periods. A survey of all of these crossings using the Juno field and particle instruments has been performed, with 51 bow shock and 97 magnetopause crossings being detected. The BS crossings ranged from 92 to 128 R-J with 1 encounter during the approach, 36 during the first apojove period, 0 on the second, and 14 during the third. The MP crossings ranged from 73 to 114 R-J, with 8 MP encounters during the approach, 40 encounters during the first apojove period, 24 encounters on the second, and 46 during the third. During the approach, Juno initially encountered an expanding magnetosphere resulting in a single BS and MP crossing, followed a few days later by a contracting magnetosphere, resulting in 7 more MP crossings and a BS crossing on the first outbound orbit at 92 R-J. The lack of BS crossings and the limited number of MP crossings during the second apojove period suggests a long period of an expanded magnetosphere, likely caused by a prolonged period of low solar wind dynamic pressure associated with a rarefaction region. The detection of BS crossings on the third apojove period suggests another period of a highly compressed magnetosphere.	[Hospodarsky, G. B.; Kurth, W.

Variability of Jupiter's IR H-3(+) aurorae during Juno approach	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							JOVIAN IONOSPHERE; UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; MAGNETIC-FIELD; THERMOSPHERE; EMISSION; DENSITY; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS; ENERGY; MAGNETOSPHERE	We present ground-based observations of Jupiter's H3(+) aurorae over four nights in April 2016 while the Juno spacecraft was monitoring the upstream interplanetary magnetic field. High-precision maps of auroral H3(+) densities, temperatures, and radiances reveal significant variabilities in those parameters, with regions of enhanced density and emission accompanied by reduced temperature. Juno magnetometer data, combined with solar wind propagation models, suggest that a shock may have impacted Jupiter in the days preceding the observation interval but that the solar wind was quiescent thereafter. Auroral H3(+) temperatures reveal a downward temporal trend, consistent with a slowly cooling upper atmosphere, such as might follow a period of shock recovery. The brightest H3(+) emissions are from the end of the period, 23 April. A lack of definitive signatures in the upstream interplanetary magnetic field lends supporting evidence to the possibility that this brightening event may have been driven by internal magnetospheric processes.

Statistical study of latitudinal beaming of Jupiter's decametric radio emissions using Juno	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article								Synoptic decametric (DAM) radio observations at Jupiter were made in a broad Jovicentric latitudinal range of -21 degrees to +15 degrees by the Juno polar orbiting spacecraft from 21 June to 10 December 2016. We investigated the occurrence probability of non-Io-related DAM. At 19.5 MHz, as Juno's latitude varies from +15 degrees to -21 degrees, a peak of non-Io-B occurrence probability at 175 degrees System III central meridian longitude (CML) gradually shifts in longitude to 140 degrees CML. Also, another peak occurs at 110 degrees CML between -15 degrees and -9 degrees, merging into the bottom edge of the former peak. This J-shaped feature is similarly seen at 16.5 MHz. Using the Jovian magnetic field models, the fixed hollow cone model can reasonably account for the J-shaped structure for radio sources traced along active magnetic flux tubes onto Jupiter's surface projected at about 135 degrees-149 degrees System III longitude. Moreover, these non-Io-B spectral profiles extend from 13.5 to 23.5 MHz.

The spectra acquired in the 4-5 mu m spectral range were analyzed to infer the residual opacities of the uppermost cloud deck as well as the mean mixing ratios of water, ammonia, and phosphine at the approximate level of few bars. Our results support the current view of hot spots as regions of prevailing descending vertical motions in the atmosphere but extend this view suggesting that upwelling may occur at the southern boundaries of these structures. Comparison with the global ammonia abundance measured by Juno Microwave Radiometer suggests also that hot spots may represent sites of local enrichment of this gas. JIRAM also identifies similar spatial patterns in water and phosphine contents in the two hot spots.	[Grassi, D.; Adriani, A.; Mura, A.; Dinelli, B.

Methodology and analysis applied to the Jovian northern polar region	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							H-3(+) EMISSION; JUPITERS AURORA	During the first orbit around Jupiter of the NASA/Juno mission, the Jovian Auroral Infrared Mapper (JIRAM) instrument observed the auroral regions with a large number of measurements. The measured spectra show both the emission of the H-3(+) ion and of methane in the 3-4 mu m spectral region. In this paper we describe the analysis method developed to retrieve temperature and column density (CD) of the H-3(+) ion from JIRAM spectra in the northern auroral region. The high spatial resolution of JIRAM shows an asymmetric aurora, with CD and temperature ovals not superimposed and not exactly located where models and previous observations suggested. On the main oval averaged H-3(+) CDs span between 1.8 x 10(12) cm(-2) and 2.8 x 10(12) cm(-2), while the retrieved temperatures show values between 800 and 950 K. JIRAM indicates a complex relationship among H-3(+) CDs and temperatures on the Jupiter northern aurora.	[Dinelli, B. M.; Fabiano, F.; Moriconi, M. L.] ISAC CNR, Bologna, Italy; [Dinelli, B.

H-3(+) (trihydrogen cation) and CH4 (methane) emissions have been identified and measured. The observations have been carried out in nadir and slant viewing both by a L-filtered imager and a 2-5m spectrometer. Results from the spectral analysis of the all observations taken over the South Pole by the instrument are reported. The coverage of the southern aurora during these measurements has been partial, but sufficient to determine different regions of temperature and abundance of the H-3(+) ion from its emission lines in the 3-4 mu m wavelength range. Finally, the results from the southern aurora are also compared with those from the northern ones from the data taken during the same perijove pass and reported by Dinelli et al. (2017).

Evidence of diffuse methane presence in the Jupiter auroral regions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						JIRAM spectrometer; Jupiter atmosphere; methane fluorescence	X-RAY-EMISSION; BRIGHTENINGS	Throughout the first orbit of the NASA Juno mission around Jupiter, the Jupiter InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) targeted the northern and southern polar regions several times. The analyses of the acquired images and spectra confirmed a significant presence of methane (CH4) near both poles through its 3.3m emission overlapping the H-3(+) auroral feature at 3.31m. Neither acetylene (C2H2) nor ethane (C2H6) have been observed so far. The analysis method, developed for the retrieval of H-3(+) temperature and abundances and applied to the JIRAM-measured spectra, has enabled an estimate of the effective temperature for methane peak emission and the distribution of its spectral contribution in the polar regions. The enhanced methane inside the auroral oval regions in the two hemispheres at different longitude suggests an excitation mechanism driven by energized particle precipitation from the magnetosphere.

Here we report on a selection of interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures. We demonstrate that a dilute core, expanded to a significant fraction of the planet's radius, is helpful in reconciling the calculated J(n) with Juno's observations. Although model predictions are strongly affected by the chosen equation of state, the prediction of an enrichment of Z in the deep, metallic envelope over that in the shallow, molecular envelope holds. We estimate Jupiter's core to contain a 7-25 Earth mass of heavy elements. We discuss the current difficulties in reconciling measured J(n) with the equations of state and with theory for formation and evolution of the planet. Plain Language Summary The Juno spacecraft has measured Jupiter's gravity to unprecedented precision. We present models of the planet's interior structure, which treat the hydrogen-helium mixture using computer simulations of the material. We demonstrate that dilute core, with the heavy elements dissolved in hydrogen and expanded outward through a portion of the planet, may be helpful for explaining Juno's measurements.	[Wahl, S.

Characterization of the white ovals on Jupiter's southern hemisphere using the first data by the Juno/JIRAM instrument	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; ovals; spectroscopy; JIRAM; Juno; atmosphere	CLOUD STRUCTURE; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; ICE; EQUATORIAL; ATMOSPHERE; PARTICLES	During the first perijove passage of the Juno mission, the Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) observed a line of closely spaced oval features in Jupiter's southern hemisphere, between 30 degrees S and 45 degrees S. In this work, we focused on the longitudinal region covering the three ovals having higher contrast at 5m, i.e., between 120 degrees W and 60 degrees W in System III coordinates. We used the JIRAM's full spectral capability in the range 2.4-3m together with a Bayesian data inversion approach to retrieve maps of column densities and altitudes for an NH3 cloud and an N2H4 haze. The deep (under the saturation level) volume mixing ratio and the relative humidity for gaseous ammonia were also retrieved. Our results suggest different vortex activity for the three ovals. Updraft and downdraft together with considerations about the ammonia condensation could explain our maps providing evidences of cyclonic and anticyclonic structures.

A planetary-scale disturbance in the most intense Jovian atmospheric jet from JunoCam and ground-based observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						planetary atmospheres; Jupiter; atmospheric dynamics	JUPITER; SIMULATIONS; STORMS	We describe a huge planetary-scale disturbance in the highest-speed Jovian jet at latitude 23.5 degrees N that was first observed in October 2016 during the Juno perijove-2 approach. An extraordinary outburst of four plumes was involved in the disturbance development. They were located in the range of planetographic latitudes from 22.2 degrees to 23.0 degrees N and moved faster than the jet peak with eastward velocities in the range 155 to 175ms(-1). In the wake of the plumes, a turbulent pattern of bright and dark spots (wave number 20-25) formed and progressed during October and November on both sides of the jet, moving with speeds in the range 100-125ms(-1) and leading to a new reddish and homogeneous belt when activity ceased in late November. Nonlinear numerical models reproduce the disturbance cloud patterns as a result of the interaction between local sources (the plumes) and the zonal eastward jet.

Jupiter gravity field estimated from the first two Juno orbits	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter gravity	RADIO SCIENCE; TRACKING DATA; VOYAGER; PIONEER; SATURN; TORUS; DEPTH	The combination of the Doppler data from the first two Juno science orbits provides an improved estimate of the gravity field of Jupiter, crucial for interior modeling of giant planets. The low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients, especially J(4) and J(6), are determined with accuracies better than previously published by a factor of 5 or more. In addition, the independent estimates of the Jovian gravity field, obtained by the orbits separately, agree within uncertainties, pointing to a good stability of the solution. The degree 2 sectoral and tesseral coefficients, C-2,C-1, S-2,S-1, C-2,C-2, and S-2,S-2, were determined to be statistically zero as expected for a fluid planet in equilibrium.	[Folkner, W.

Observations of interplanetary dust by the Juno magnetometer investigation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Juno; interplanetary dust; cruise phase	SPACECRAFT; PARTICLES; IMPACTS	One of the Juno magnetometer investigation's star cameras was configured to search for unidentified objects during Juno's transit en route to Jupiter. This camera detects and registers luminous objects to magnitude 8. Objects persisting in more than five consecutive images and moving with an apparent angular rate of between 2 and 18,000arcsec/s were recorded. Among the objects detected were a small group of objects tracked briefly in close proximity to the spacecraft. The trajectory of these objects demonstrates that they originated on the Juno spacecraft, evidently excavated by micrometeoroid impacts on the solar arrays. The majority of detections occurred just prior to and shortly after Juno's transit of the asteroid belt. This rather novel detection technique utilizes the Juno spacecraft's prodigious 60m(2) of solar array as a dust detector and provides valuable information on the distribution and motion of interplanetary (>m sized) dust. Plain Language Summary The Juno magnetometer investigation uses star cameras co-located with the magnetic sensors at the outer end of one of Juno's solar arrays. These cameras compare images with an onboard star catalog to determine the orientation of the sensors in inertial space. They also serendipitously recorded multiple images of small particles excavated from the spacecraft by high-velocity dust impacts. We trace their trajectories back in time to demonstrate that they evolved from the spacecraft. This allows us to use the vast collecting area of Juno's solar arrays (60m(2)) as a novel dust detector, sensitive to particles with a mass range never before measured in situ.

Diagenetic silica enrichment and late-stage groundwater activity in Gale crater, Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Diagenesis; Silica; Groundwater; Gale crater; Mars; MSL	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; X-RAY SPECTROMETER; SANDSTONES; EVOLUTION; DEPOSITS; ORIGIN; ROCKS; BASIN; STATE; UNIT	Diagenetic silica enrichment in fracture-associated halos that crosscut lacustrine and unconformably overlying aeolian sedimentary bedrock is observed on the lower north slope of Aeolis Mons in Gale crater, Mars. The diagenetic silica enrichment is colocated with detrital silica enrichment observed in the lacustrine bedrock yet extends into a considerably younger, unconformably draping aeolian sandstone, implying that diagenetic silica enrichment postdates the detrital silica enrichment. A causal connection between the detrital and diagenetic silica enrichment implies that water was present in the subsurface of Gale crater long after deposition of the lacustrine sediments and that it mobilized detrital amorphous silica and precipitated it along fractures in the overlying bedrock. Although absolute timing is uncertain, the observed diagenesis likely represents some of the most recent groundwater activity in Gale crater and suggests that the timescale of potential habitability extended considerably beyond the time that the lacustrine sediments of Aeolis Mons were deposited.

However, numerical modeling of such transport can have large uncertainties due to the lack of observations for parameterization schemes and for describing fire emission and meteorology in this region. These uncertainties are analyzed here, for the first time, with an ensemble of 24 Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations. The ensemble reproduces the time series of observed surface nonsea-salt PM2.5 concentrations observed from the Vasco vessel during 17-30 September 2011 and overall agrees with satellite (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. The difference of meteorology between National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP's) Final (FNL) and European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF's) ERA renders the biggest spread in the ensemble (up to 20 mu g m(-3) or 200% in surface PM2.5), with FNL showing systematically superior results. The second biggest uncertainty is from fire emissions; the 2 day maximum Fire Locating and Modelling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) emission is superior than the instantaneous one. While Grell-Devenyi (G3) and Betts-Miller-Janjic cumulus schemes only produce a difference of 3 mu g m(-3) of surface PM2.5 over the Sulu Sea, the ensemble mean agrees best with Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing (CMORPH)'s spatial distribution of precipitation. Simulation with FNL-G3, 2 day maximum FLAMBE, and 800 m injection height outperforms other ensemble members. Finally, the global transport model (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS)) outperforms all WRF-Chem simulations in describing smoke transport on 20 September 2011, suggesting the challenges to model tropical meteorology at mesoscale and finer scale. Plain Language Summary It is well known that smoke particles from fires in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia can affect each other's air quality. Less known and surely not well documented is the transport of smoke particles from these countries to the Philippines. Here we use the first-ever measurements took nearby the coastal of the Philippines to analyze an ensemble of 24 WRF-Chem simulations of smoke transport. Because of persistent cloud cover and the complexity of meteorology, mesoscale modeling of smoke transport in these regions normally has large uncertainties. We show these uncertainties are caused first by meteorology and then by fire emissions. We further show that models with finer resolution not necessarily produce better results.

We investigate variations of high cloud fraction with surface temperature (Ts) from July 2002 to June 2015 and compute their radiative effects on Qr using the Fu-Liou-Gu plane-parallel radiation model. We find that the tropical mean (30 degrees S-30 degrees N) high cloud fraction decreases with increasing Ts at a rate of about -1.0 +/- 0.34% K-1 from 2002 to 2015, which leads to an enhanced atmospheric cooling around 0.86 W m(-2) K-1. On the other hand, the northern midlatitudes (30 degrees N-60 degrees N) high cloud fraction increases with surface warming at a rate of 1.85 +/- 0.65% K-1 and the near-global mean (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) high cloud fraction shows a statistically insignificant decreasing trend with increasing Ts over the analysis period. Dividing high clouds into cirrus, cirrostratus, and deep convective clouds, we find that cirrus cloud fraction increases with surface warming at a rate of 0.32 +/- 0.11% K-1 (0.01 +/- 0.17% K-1) for the near-global mean (tropical mean), while cirrostratus and deep convective clouds decrease with surface warming at a rate of -0.02 +/- 0.18% K-1 and -0.33 +/- 0.18% K-1 for the near-global mean and -0.64 +/- 0.23% K-1 and -0.37 +/- 0.13% K-1 for the tropical mean, respectively. High cloud fraction response to feedback to Ts accounts for approximately 1.9 +/- 0.7% and 16.0 +/- 6.1% of the increase in precipitation per unit surface warming over the period of 2002-2015 for the near-global mean and the tropical mean, respectively.

A comprehensive overview of the climatological composition of the Asian summermonsoon anticyclone based on 10 years of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SUMMER MONSOON ANTICYCLONE; BOUNDARY-LAYER SOURCES; CARIBIC PASSENGER AIRCRAFT; STRATOSPHERIC WATER-VAPOR; TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE LAYER; IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; TRANSPORT PATHWAYS; BOREAL SUMMER	Intense deep convection associated with the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) lofts surface pollutants to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS), where strong winds and long chemical lifetimes allow intercontinental transport, affecting atmospheric composition around the globe. The Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), launched in 2004, makes simultaneous colocated measurements of trace gases and cloud ice water content (a proxy for deep convection) in the UTLS on a daily basis. Here we exploit the dense spatial and temporal coverage, long-term data record, extensive measurement suite, and insensitivity to aerosol and most clouds of Aura MLS to characterize the climatological (2005-2014) composition of the ASM anticyclone throughout its annual life cycle. We use version 4 MLS data to quantify spatial and temporal variations in both tropospheric (H2O, CO, CH3Cl, CH3CN, CH3OH) and stratospheric (O-3, HNO3, HCl) tracers on four potential temperature surfaces (350-410 K). Inside the mature anticyclone, all species exhibit substantial changes, not only from their premonsoon distributions in the ASM region but also from their summertime distributions in the rest of the hemisphere. Different tracers exhibit dissimilar seasonal evolution, and the exact location and timing of their extreme values vary. Although individual aspects of the anticyclone have been described previously, we present a uniquely comprehensive overview of the climatological seasonal evolution of the ASM and its impact on UTLS composition. This work provides valuable context for planned in situ measurements as well as a benchmark for model evaluation and future investigations of interannual variability and long-term changes in monsoon processes.

We developed a simple temperature domain two-source energy balance (TD-TSEB) model within a hybrid two-source model scheme by coupling "layer" and "patch" models to estimate surface heat fluxes from Landsat thematic mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) imagery. For estimating latent heat flux (LE) of full soil, we proposed a temperature domain residual of the energy balance equation based on a simplified framework of total aerodynamic resistances, which provides a key link between thermal satellite temperature and subsurface moisture status. Additionally, we used a modified Priestley-Taylor model for estimating LE of full vegetation. The proposed method was applied to TM/ETM+ imagery and was validated using the ground-measured data at five crop eddy-covariance tower sites in China. The results showthat TD-TSEB yielded root-mean-square-error values between 24.9 (8.9) and 78.2 (21.4) W/m(2) and squared correlation coefficient (R-2) values between 0.60 (0.51) and 0.97 (0.90), for the estimated instantaneous (daily) surface net radiation, soil, latent, and sensible heat fluxes at all five sites. The TD-TSEBmodel shows good accuracy for partitioning LE into soil (LEsoil) and canopy (LEcanopy) components with an average bias of 11.1% for the estimated LEsoil/LE ratio at the Daman site. Importantly, the TD-TSEB model produced comparable accuracy but requires fewer forcing data (i.e., no wind speed and roughness length are needed) when compared with two other widely used surface energy balance models. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this accurate operational model provides an alternative method for mapping field surface heat fluxes with satisfactory performance.

Jupiter's interior and deep atmosphere: The initial pole-to-pole passes with the Juno spacecraft	SCIENCE			English	Article							HYDROGEN; ABUNDANCE; MODELS; FIELD	On 27 August 2016, the Juno spacecraft acquired science observations of Jupiter, passing less than 5000 kilometers above the equatorial cloud tops. Images of Jupiter's poles show a chaotic scene, unlike Saturn's poles. Microwave sounding reveals weather features at pressures deeper than 100 bars, dominated by an ammonia-rich, narrow low-latitude plume resembling a deeper, wider version of Earth's Hadley cell. Near-infrared mapping reveals the relative humidity within prominent downwelling regions. Juno's measured gravity field differs substantially from the last available estimate and is one order of magnitude more precise. This has implications for the distribution of heavy elements in the interior, including the existence and mass of Jupiter's core. The observed magnetic field exhibits smaller spatial variations than expected, indicative of a rich harmonic content.	[Bolton, S. J.; Anderson, J.; Waite, J.; Ebert, R. W.; Greathouse, T.

Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurorae observed by the Juno spacecraft during its first polar orbits	SCIENCE			English	Article							IO FLUX TUBE; H-3(+); EMISSIONS	The Juno spacecraft acquired direct observations of the jovian magnetosphere and auroral emissions from a vantage point above the poles. Juno's capture orbit spanned the jovian magnetosphere from bow shock to the planet, providing magnetic field, charged particle, and wave phenomena context for Juno's passage over the poles and traverse of Jupiter's hazardous inner radiation belts. Juno's energetic particle and plasma detectors measured electrons precipitating in the polar regions, exciting intense aurorae, observed simultaneously by the ultraviolet and infrared imaging spectrographs. Juno transited beneath the most intense parts of the radiation belts, passed about 4000 kilometers above the cloud tops at closest approach, well inside the jovian rings, and recorded the electrical signatures of high-velocity impacts with small particles as it traversed the equator.

However, controlling doping has been a major challenge in complex semiconductors as there are many possibilities for charged intrinsic defects (e.g., vacancies, interstitials, antisite defects) whose energy depends on competing impurity phases. Even in compounds with no apparent deviation from a stoichiometric nominal composition, such defects commonly lead to free carrier concentrations in excess of 1020 cm(-3). Nevertheless, by slightly altering the nominal composition, these defect concentrations can be tuned with small variation of the chemical potentials (composition) of each element. While the variation of chemical composition is undetectable, it is shown that the changes can be inferred by mapping (in nominal composition space) the boundaries where different competing impurity phases form. In the inexpensive Zintl compound Ca9Zn4+xSb9, the carrier concentrations can be finely tuned within three different three-phase regions by altering the nominal composition (x = 0.2-0.8), enabling the doubling of thermoelectric performance (zT). Because of the low thermal conductivity, the zT can reach as high as 1.1 at 875 K, which is one of the highest among the earth abundant p-type thermoelectrics with no ion conducting.

Spatial variability in tropospheric peroxyacetyl nitrate in the tropics from infrared satellite observations in 2005 and 2006	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SOUTH-ATLANTIC; LOWER STRATOSPHERE; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; EMISSION SPECTROMETER; REACTIVE NITROGEN; PAN; OZONE; ISOPRENE; FIRES; MODEL	Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) plays a fundamental role in the global ozone budget and is the primary reservoir of tropospheric reactive nitrogen over much of the globe. However, large uncertainties exist in how surface emissions, transport and lightning affect the global distribution, particularly in the tropics. We present new satellite observations of free-tropospheric PAN in the tropics from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer. This dataset allows us to test expected spatiotemporal distributions that have been predicted by models but previously not well observed. We compare here with the GEOS-Chem model with updates specifically for PAN. We observe an austral springtime maximum over the tropical Atlantic, a feature that model predictions attribute primarily to lightning. Over northern central Africa in December, observations show strong interannual variability, despite low variation in fire emissions, that we attribute to the combined effects of changes in biogenic emissions and lightning. We observe small enhancements in free-tropospheric PAN corresponding to the extreme burning event over Indonesia associated with the 2006 El Nino.

Carbon dioxide sources from Alaska driven by increasing early winter respiration from Arctic tundra	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						carbon dioxide; Arctic; early winter respiration; Alaska; tundra	BLACK SPRUCE FOREST; NORTHERN ECOSYSTEMS; PLANT PRODUCTIVITY; SEASONAL CYCLE; CO2 EXCHANGE; EMISSIONS; CLIMATE; FLUXES; METHANE; SOIL	High-latitude ecosystems have the capacity to release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in response to increasing temperatures, representing a potentially significant positive feedback within the climate system. Here, we combine aircraft and tower observations of atmospheric CO2 with remote sensing data and meteorological products to derive temporally and spatially resolved year-round CO2 fluxes across Alaska during 2012-2014. We find that tundra ecosystems were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere annually, with especially high rates of respiration during early winter (October through December). Long-term records at Barrow, AK, suggest that CO2 emission rates from North Slope tundra have increased during the October through December period by 73% +/- 11% since 1975, and are correlated with rising summer temperatures. Together, these results imply increasing early winter respiration and net annual emission of CO2 in Alaska, in response to climate warming. Our results provide evidence that the decadalscale increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle may be linked with increasing biogenic emissions in the Arctic, following the growing season. Early winter respirationwas not well simulated by the Earth System Models used to forecast future carbon fluxes in recent climate assessments. Therefore, these assessments may underestimate the carbon release from Arctic soils in response to a warming climate.

Ambiguity in the causes for decadal trends in atmospheric methane and hydroxyl	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						methane; renewed growth; hydroxyl; oxidative capacity; troposphere	NATURAL-GAS PRODUCTION; FOSSIL-FUEL; GROWTH-RATE; EMISSIONS; ETHANE; OIL; ACCUMULATION; VARIABILITY; GENERATION; INCREASE	Methane is the second strongest anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its atmospheric burden has more than doubled since 1850. Methane concentrations stabilized in the early 2000s and began increasing again in 2007. Neither the stabilization nor the recent growth are well understood, as evidenced by multiple competing hypotheses in recent literature. Here we use a multispecies twobox model inversion to jointly constrain 36 y of methane sources and sinks, using ground-based measurements of methane, methyl chloroform, and the C-13/C-12 ratio in atmospheric methane (delta(CH4)-C-13) from 1983 through 2015. We find that the problem, as currently formulated, is underdetermined and solutions obtained in previous work are strongly dependent on prior assumptions. Based on our analysis, the mathematically most likely explanation for the renewed growth in atmospheric methane, counterintuitively, involves a 25-Tg/y decrease in methane emissions from 2003 to 2016 that is offset by a 7% decrease in global mean hydroxyl (OH) concentrations, the primary sink for atmospheric methane, over the same period. However, we are still able to fit the observations if we assume that OH concentrations are time invariant (as much of the previous work has assumed) and we then find solutions that are largely consistent with other proposed hypotheses for the renewed growth of atmospheric methane since 2007. We conclude that the current surface observing system does not allow unambiguous attribution of the decadal trends in methane without robust constraints on OH variability, which currently rely purely on methyl chloroform data and its uncertain emissions estimates.

The Detection of an Extremely Bright Fast Radio Burst in a Phased Array Feed Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						instrumentation: interferometers; methods: data analysis; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; surveys	DISPERSION MEASURE; FRB 121102; ASKAP; EFFICIENT; DISTANCES; PULSAR; GALAXY; HOST	We report the detection of an ultra-bright fast radio burst (FRB) from a modest, 3.4-day pilot survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. The survey was conducted in a wide-field fly's-eye configuration using the phased-array-feed technology deployed on the array to instantaneously observe an effective area of 160 deg(2), and achieve an exposure totaling 13200 deg2 hr. We constrain the position of FRB. 170107 to a region 8' x 8' in size (90% containment) and its fluence to be 58 +/- 6 Jy ms. The spectrum of the burst shows a sharp cutoff above 1400 MHz, which could be due to either scintillation or an intrinsic feature of the burst. This confirms the existence of an ultra-bright (> 20 Jy ms) population of FRBs.	[Bannister, K. W.; Shannon, R. M.; Edwards, P. G.; Allison, J.; Bell, M.; Chippendale, A. P.; Collier, J.

At the peak of the optical flare, F01004-2237 was IR quiescent. About three years later, its MIR fluxes have shown a steady increase, rising by 1.34 and 1.04 mag in 3.4 and 4.6 mu m up to the end of 2016. The host-subtracted MIR peak luminosity is 2-3. x. 10(44) erg s(-1). We interpret the MIR LCs as an infrared echo, i.e., dust reprocessed emission of the optical flare. Fitting the MIR LCs using our dust model, we infer a dust torus of the size of a few parsecs at some inclined angle. The derived dust temperatures range from 590-850 K, and the warm dust mass is similar to 7M(circle dot). Such a large mass implies that the dust cannot be newly formed. We also derive the UV luminosity of 4-11 x 10(44) erg s(-1). The inferred total IR energy is 1-2. x. 10(52) erg, suggesting a large dust covering factor. Finally, our dust model suggests that the long tail of the optical flare could be due to dust scattering.

J	Goldsmith, PF; Kauffmann, J				Goldsmith, Paul F.; Kauffmann, Jens			Electron Excitation of High Dipole Moment Molecules Re-examined	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: molecules; molecular processes; photon-dominated region (PDR)	IMPACT ROTATIONAL-EXCITATION; COLLISIONAL EXCITATION; HYPERFINE EXCITATION; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; CARBON MONOSULFIDE; ALMA OBSERVATIONS; STAR-FORMATION; GALAXY NUCLEI; GROUND-STATE; DENSE GAS	Emission from high-dipole moment molecules such as HCN allows determination of the density in molecular clouds, and is often considered to trace the "dense" gas available for star formation. We assess the importance of electron excitation in various environments. The ratio of the rate coefficients for electrons and H-2 molecules,similar or equal to 10(5) for HCN, yields the requirements for electron excitation to be of practical importance if n (H-2) <= 10(5.5) cm(-3) and X(e(-)) >= 10(-5), where the numerical factors reflect the critical values n(c)(H-2) and X*(e(-)). This indicates that in regions where a large fraction of carbon is ionized, X(e(-)) will be large enough to make electron excitation significant. The situation is in general similar for other "high-density tracers," including HCO+, CN, and CS. But there are significant differences in the critical electron fractional abundance, X*(e(-)), defined by the value required for equal effect from collisions with H-2 and e-. Electron excitation is, for example, unimportant for CO and C+. Electron excitation may be responsible for the surprisingly large spatial extent of emission from dense gas tracers in some molecular clouds. The enhanced estimates for HCN abundances and HCN/CO and HCN/HCO+ ratios observed in the nuclear regions of luminous galaxies may be in part a result of electron excitation of high dipole moment tracers. The importance of electron excitation will depend on detailed models of the chemistry, which may well be non-steady state and non-static.

At these angles, X-rays do not pass through the optics and instead illuminate the detectors directly, due to incomplete baffling. Due to the simplicity of the instrument response in this configuration and the good absolute calibration of the detectors, we are able to measure the absolute intrinsic flux of the Crab to better than 4%. We find the spectral parameters of the power law to be T = 2.106 +/- 0.006, N = 9.71 +/- 0.16, in agreement with the values measured 42 years ago by Toor & Seward. This suggests that the observed variability of the Crab is not part of a long-term trend, but instead results from fluctuations around a steady mean. The NuSTAR observation also enabled improved measurement of the detector absorption parameters without the added complications of the mirror response.

Practical Weak-lensing Shear Measurement with Metacalibration	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: observations; gravitational lensing: weak; methods: observational	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; INTRINSIC GALAXY ALIGNMENTS; COSMIC SHEAR; SHAPE MEASUREMENT; SDSS; CALIBRATION; LUMINOSITY; ERRORS; SPACE	METACALIBRATION is a recently introduced method to accurately measure weak gravitational lensing shear using only the available imaging data, without need for prior information about galaxy properties or calibration from simulations. The method involves distorting the image with a small known shear, and calculating the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The method was shown to be accurate in moderate-sized simulations with galaxy images that had. relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without significant selection effects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear response and selection biases. We also observe that. for images with. relatively low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the METACALIBRATION process results in significant bias, for which we develop a simple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image simulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including tests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread function ellipticity at the five-percent level. In each simulation we applied a small. few-percent shear to the galaxy images. We introduced additional challenges that arise in real data, such as detection thresholds, stellar contamination, and missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy properties to induce significant selection effects. Using our formalism, we recovered the input shear with an accuracy better than a part in a thousand in all cases.

Disk Masses around Solar-mass Stars are Underestimated by CO Observations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrochemistry; line: profiles; protoplanetary disks; radiative transfer; submillimeter: planetary systems	YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; HYA PROTOPLANETARY DISK; TW HYA; CIRCUMSTELLAR DISKS; PLANETARY SYSTEM; TEMPERATURE STRUCTURE; COLLISIONAL GROWTH; ALMA OBSERVATIONS; CHEMICAL HISTORY; CARBON-MONOXIDE	Gas in protostellar disks provides. the raw material for giant planet formation and controls the dynamics of the planetesimal-building dust grains. Accurate gas mass measurements help map the observed properties of planet-forming disks onto the formation environments of known exoplanets. Rare isotopologues of carbon monoxide (CO) have been used as gas mass tracers for disks in the Lupus star-forming region, with an assumed interstellar CO/H-2 abundance ratio. Unfortunately, observations of T-Tauri disks show that CO abundance is not interstellar, a finding reproduced by models that show CO abundance decreasing both with distance from the star and as a function of time. Here, we present radiative transfer simulations that assess the accuracy of CO-based disk mass measurements. We find that the combination of CO chemical depletion in the outer disk and optically thick emission from the inner disk leads observers to underestimate gas mass by more than an order of magnitude if they use the standard assumptions of interstellar CO/H-2 ratio and optically thin emission. Furthermore, CO abundance changes on million-year timescales, introducing an age/mass degeneracy into observations. To reach a. factor of a few accuracy for CO-based disk mass measurements, we suggest that observers and modelers adopt the following strategies: (1) select. low-J transitions; (2) observe multiple CO isotopologues and use either intensity ratios or normalized line profiles to diagnose CO chemical depletion; and (3) use spatially resolved observations to measure the CO-abundance distribution.

A spatially-enabled database is a key component of the software that can ingest a suite of satellite and model datasets while facilitating the interfacing with Geographic Information System (GIS) applications. The datasets ingested are obtained from numerous space-borne sensors and represent multiple components of the water cycle. The object-oriented design of the software allows for modularity and extensibility, showcased here with the coupling of the core hydrologic model with a crop growth model. RHEAS can exploit multi-threading to scale with increasing number of processors, while the database allows delivery of data products and associated uncertainty through a variety of GIS platforms. A set of three example implementations of RHEAS in the United States and Kenya are described to demonstrate the different features of the system in real-world applications.

Enhanced stratospheric water vapor over the summertime continental United States and the role of overshooting convection	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE; CLIMATE; PLUMES; DEHYDRATION; VARIABILITY; TRANSPORT; CLOUDS; SYSTEM; DEEP	The NASA ER-2 aircraft sampled the lower stratosphere over North America during the field mission for the NASA Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS). This study reports observations of convectively influenced air parcels with enhanced water vapor in the overworld stratosphere over the summertime continental United States and investigates three case studies in detail. Water vapor mixing ratios greater than 10 ppmv, which is much higher than the background 4 to 6 ppmv of the overworld stratosphere, were measured by the JPL Laser Hygrometer (JLH Mark2) at altitudes between 16.0 and 17.5 km (potential temperatures of approximately 380 to 410 K). Overshooting cloud tops (OTs) are identified from a SEAC(4)RS OT detection product based on satellite infrared window channel brightness temperature gradients. Through trajectory analysis, we make the connection between these in situ water measurements and OT. Back trajectory analysis ties enhanced water to OT 1 to 7 days prior to the intercept by the aircraft. The trajectory paths are dominated by the North American monsoon (NAM) anticyclonic circulation. This connection suggests that ice is convectively transported to the overworld stratosphere in OT events and subsequently sublimated; such events may irreversibly enhance stratospheric water vapor in the summer over Mexico and the United States. A regional context is provided by water observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS).

Results indicate that there is no relationship between the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-2 passive soil moisture product and the upscaled in situ measurements. Additionally, there is very low correlation between modeled brightness temperature using the Community Microwave Emission Model and the Level-1 C SMAP brightness temperature interpolated to the EASE-2 Global grid; however, there is a much stronger relationship to the brightness temperature measurements interpolated to the North Polar grid, suggesting that the soil moisture product could be improved with interpolation on the North Polar grid.

To assess this possibility, we measure ice velocity over 25years using satellite imagery and an optimized modeling approach. More than 30 unnamed outlet glaciers drain the 800km coastline of Western Palmer Land at speeds ranging from 0.5 to 2.5m/d, interspersed with near-stagnant ice. Between 1992 and 2015, most of the outlet glaciers sped up by 0.2 to 0.3m/d, leading to a 13% increase in ice flow and a 15km(3)/yr increase in ice discharge across the sector as a whole. Speedup is greatest where glaciers are grounded more than 300m below sea level, consistent with a loss of buttressing caused by ice shelf thinning in a region of shoaling warm circumpolar water.

J	Chang, KW; L'Ecuyer, TS; Kahn, BH; Natraj, V				Chang, Kai-Wei; L'Ecuyer, Tristan S.; Kahn, Brian H.; Natraj, Vijay			Information content of visible and midinfrared radiances for retrieving tropical ice cloud properties	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						information content; AIRS; MODIS; ice clouds; cirrus; channel selection	OPTIMAL ESTIMATION ALGORITHM; BANDS CALIBRATION ALGORITHM; CIRRUS CLOUDS; OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; GLOBAL OCEANS; OPTICAL DEPTH; PART II; MODIS; TEMPERATURE	Hyperspectral instruments such as Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) have spectrally dense observations effective for ice cloud retrievals. However, due to the large number of channels, only a small subset is typically used. It is crucial that this subset of channels be chosen to contain the maximum possible information about the retrieved variables. This study describes an information content analysis designed to select optimal channels for ice cloud retrievals. To account for variations in ice cloud properties, we perform channel selection over an ensemble of cloud regimes, extracted with a clustering algorithm, from a multiyear database at a tropical Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site. Multiple satellite viewing angles over land and ocean surfaces are considered to simulate the variations in observation scenarios. The results suggest that AIRS channels near wavelengths of 14, 10.4, 4.2, and 3.8m contain the most information. With an eye toward developing a joint AIRS-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) retrieval, the analysis is also applied to combined measurements from both instruments. While application of this method to MODIS yields results consistent with previous channel sensitivity studies, the analysis shows that this combination may yield substantial improvement in cloud retrievals. MODIS provides most information on optical thickness and particle size, aided by a better constraint on cloud vertical placement from AIRS. An alternate scenario where cloud top boundaries are supplied by the active sensors in the A-train is also explored. The more robust cloud placement afforded by active sensors shifts the optimal channels toward the window region and shortwave infrared, further constraining optical thickness and particle size.

Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Southern California Bight; Satellite remote sensing; Coastal pollution; Stormwater runoff	COASTAL WATER-QUALITY; MARINE; DISCHARGES; POLLUTION; IMPACTS; SCALES; MODEL; SHELF	Stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Southern California Bight (SCB), resulting from untreated runoff and pollutants from urban watersheds entering the coastal waters after rainstorms. We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery. A conceptual satellite stormwater runoff monitoring approach is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

OPAL annually maps Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune (and will also map Saturn from 2018) in several visible/near-infrared wavelength filters. The Uranus 2014 OPAL observations were made on the 8/9th November at a time when a huge cloud complex, first observed by de Pater et al. (2015) and subsequently tracked by professional and amateur astronomers (Sayanagi et al., 2016), was present at 30-40 degrees N. We imaged the entire visible atmosphere, including the storm system, in seven filters spanning 467-924 nm, capturing variations in the coloration of Uranus' clouds and also vertical distribution due to wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering and methane absorption optical depth. Here we analyse these new HST observations with the NEMESIS radiative-transfer and retrieval code in multiple-scattering mode to determine the vertical cloud structure in and around the storm cloud system. The same storm system was also observed in the H-band (1.4-1.8 mu m) with the SINFONI Integral Field Unit Spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 31st October and 11th November, reported by Irwin et al. (2016, 10.1016/j.icarus.2015.09.010). To constrain better the cloud particle sizes and scattering properties over a wide wavelength range we also conducted a limb-darkening analysis of the background cloud structure in the 30-40 degrees N latitude band by simultaneously fitting: a) these HST/OPAL observations at a range of zenith angles; b) the VLT/SINFONI observations at a range of zenith angles; and c) IRTF/SpeX observations of this latitude band made in 2009 at a single zenith angle of 23, spanning the wavelength range 0.8-1.8 mu m (Irwin et al., 2015, 10.1016/j.icarus.2014.12.020). We find that the HST observations, and the combined HST/VLT/IRTF observations at all locations are well modelled with a three-component cloud comprised of: 1) a vertically thin, but optically thick 'deep' tropospheric cloud at a pressure of similar to 2 bars; 2) a methane-ice cloud based at the methane-condensation level of 1.23 bar, with variable vertical extent; and 3) a vertically extended tropospheric haze, also based at the methane-condensation level of similar to 1.23 bar. We find that modelling both haze and tropospheric cloud with particles having an effective radius of similar to 0.1 mu m provides a good fit the observations, although for the tropospheric cloud, particles with an effective radius as large as 1.0 mu m provide a similarly good fit. We find that the particles in both the tropospheric cloud and haze are more scattering at short wavelengths, giving them a blue colour, but are more absorbing at longer wavelengths, especially for the tropospheric haze. We find that the spectra of the storm clouds are well modelled by localised thickening and vertical extension of the methane-ice cloud. For the particles in the storm clouds, which we assume to be composed of methane ice particles, we find that their mean radii must lie somewhere in the range 0.1 - 1.0 mu m. We find that the high clouds have low integrated opacity, and that "streamers" reminiscent of convective thunderstorm anvils are confined to levels deeper than 1 bar. These results argue against vigorous moist convective origins for the cloud features. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Irwin, Patrick G.

Resolved spectrophotometric properties of the Ceres surface from Dawn Framing Camera images	ICARUS			English	Article						Ceres; Photometry; Regolith; Surface; Reflectance	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION; ASTEROID 21 LUTETIA; PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS; DARK MATERIAL; CASSINI-VIMS; VESTA; SUBLIMATION; ENCELADUS; COLOR	We present a global spectrophotometric characterization of the Ceres surface using Dawn Framing Camera (FC) images. We identify the photometric model that yields the best results for photometrically correcting images. Corrected FC images acquired on approach to Ceres were assembled into global maps of albedo and color. Generally, albedo and color variations on Ceres are muted. The albedo map is dominated by a large, circular feature in Vendimia Planitia, known from HST images (Li et al., 2006), and dotted by smaller bright features mostly associated with fresh-looking craters. The dominant color variation over the surface is represented by the presence of "blue" material in and around such craters, which has a negative spectral slope over the visible wavelength range when compared to average terrain. We also mapped variations of the phase curve by employing an exponential photometric model, a technique previously applied to asteroid Vesta (Schroder et al., 2013b). The surface of Ceres scatters light differently from Vesta in the sense that the ejecta of several fresh-looking craters may be physically smooth rather than rough. High albedo, blue color, and physical smoothness all appear to be indicators of youth. The blue color may result from the desiccation of ejected material that is similar to the phyllosilicates/water ice mixtures in the experiments of Poch et al. (2016). The physical smoothness of some blue terrains would be consistent with an initially liquid condition, perhaps as a consequence of impact melting of subsurface water ice. We find red terrain (positive spectral slope) near Ernutet crater, where De Sanctis et al. (2017) detected organic material. The spectrophotometric properties of the large Vendimia Planitia feature suggest it is a palimpsest, consistent with the Marchi et al. (2016) impact basin hypothesis. The central bright area in Occator crater, Cerealia Facula, is the brightest on Ceres with an average visual normal albedo of about 0.6 at a resolution of 1.3 km per pixel (six times Ceres average). The albedo of fresh, bright material seen inside this area in the highest resolution images (35 m per pixel) is probably around unity. Cerealia Facula has an unusually steep phase function, which may be due to unresolved topography, high surface roughness, or large average particle size. It has a strongly red spectrum whereas the neighboring, less-bright, Vinalia Faculae are neutral in color. We find no evidence for a diurnal ground fog-type haze in Occator as described by Nathues et al. (2015). We can neither reproduce their findings using the same images, nor confirm them using higher resolution images. FC images have not yet offered direct evidence for present sublimation in Occator.

HAT-P-26b: A Neptune-mass exoplanet with a well-constrained heavy element abundance	SCIENCE			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM; HOT; WATER; FRAMEWORK; METHANE; MODELS; CLOUDS; CLEAR	A correlation between giant-planet mass and atmospheric heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H2O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b's atmospheric heavy element content (4.8(-4.0)(+21.5) times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b's atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals.

Multi-phase volcanic resurfacing at Loki Patera on Io	NATURE			English	Article							THERMAL EMISSION; GALILEO NIMS; AGE	The Jovian moon Io hosts the most powerful persistently active volcano in the Solar System, Loki Patera(1,2). The interior of this volcanic, caldera-like feature is composed of a warm, dark floor covering 21,500 square kilometres(3) surrounding a much cooler central 'island' 4. The temperature gradient seen across areas of the patera indicates a systematic resurfacing process(4-9), which has been seen to occur typically every one to three years since the 1980s(5,10). Analysis of past data has indicated that the resurfacing progressed around the patera in an anti-clockwise direction at a rate of one to two kilometres per day, and that it is caused either by episodic eruptions that emplace voluminous lava flows or by a cyclically overturning lava lake contained within the patera(5,8,9,11). However, spacecraft and telescope observations have been unable to map the emission from the entire patera floor at sufficient spatial resolution to establish the physical processes at play. Here we report temperature and lava cooling age maps of the entire patera floor at a spatial sampling of about two kilometres, derived from ground-based interferometric imaging of thermal emission from Loki Patera obtained on 8 March 2015 ut as the limb of Europa occulted Io. Our results indicate that Loki Patera is resurfaced by a multi-phase process in which two waves propagate and converge around the central island. The different velocities and start times of the waves indicate a non-uniformity in the lava gas content and/or crust bulk density across the patera.

The present work makes use of abundant archival interferometric observations at submillimeter, millimeter, and centimeter wavelength bands to examine grain growth signatures in the dense inner regions (<1000 au) of nine Class 0 YSOs. A systematic data analysis is performed to derive dust temperatures, optical depths, and dust opacity indices based on single-component modified blackbody fittings to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The fitted dust opacity indices (beta) are in a wide range of 0.3-2.0 when single-component SED fitting is adopted. Four out of the nine observed sources show beta lower than 1.7, the typical value of the interstellar dust. Low dust opacity index (or spectral index) values may be explained by the effect of dust grain growth, which makes beta < 1.7. Alternatively, the very small observed values of beta may be interpreted by the presence of deeply embedded and hot inner disks, which only significantly contribute to the observed fluxes at long wavelength bands. This possibility can be tested by the higher angular resolution imaging observations of ALMA or more detailed sampling of SEDs in the millimeter and centimeter bands. The beta values of the remaining five sources are close to or consistent with 1.7, indicating that grain growth would start to significantly reduce the values of beta no earlier than the late Class 0 stage for these YSOs.

Our targets have diverse and interesting observational properties, including a "changing look" AGN and a broad-line radio galaxy. Based on continuum-H beta lags, we measure black hole masses for all five targets. We also obtain H. and H gamma II lambda 4686 lags for all objects except 3C 382. The H gamma II lambda 4686 lags indicate radial stratification of the BLR, and the masses derived from different emission lines are in general agreement. The relative responsivities of these lines are also in qualitative agreement with photoionization models. These spectra have extremely high signal-to-noise ratios (100-300 per pixel) and there are excellent prospects for obtaining velocity-resolved reverberation signatures.	[Fausnaugh, M. M.; Denney, K.

Satellite-derived methane hotspot emission estimates using a fast data-driven method	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CO2 EMISSIONS; SENTINEL-5 PRECURSOR; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; CH4 EMISSIONS; FOSSIL-FUEL; TANSO-FTS; SCIAMACHY	Methane is an important atmospheric greenhouse gas and an adequate understanding of its emission sources is needed for climate change assessments, predictions, and the development and verification of emission mitigation strategies. Satellite retrievals of near-surface-sensitive column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of atmospheric methane, i.e. X CH4, can be used to quantify methane emissions. Maps of time-averaged satellite-derived X CH4 show regionally elevated methane over several methane source regions. In order to obtain methane emissions of these source regions we use a simple and fast data-driven method to estimate annual methane emissions and corresponding 1 sigma uncertainties directly from maps of annually averaged satellite X CH4. From theoretical considerations we expect that our method tends to underestimate emissions. When applying our method to high-resolution atmospheric methane simulations, we typically find agreement within the uncertainty range of our method (often 100 %) but also find that our method tends to underestimate emissions by typically about 40 %. To what extent these findings are model dependent needs to be assessed. We apply our method to an ensemble of satellite X CH4 data products consisting of two products from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and two products from TANSO-FTS/GOSAT covering the time period 2003-2014. We obtain annual emissions of four source areas: Four Corners in the south-western USA, the southern part of Central Valley, California, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. We find that our estimated emissions are in good agreement with independently derived estimates for Four Corners and Azerbaijan. For the Central Valley and Turkmenistan our estimated annual emissions are higher compared to the EDGAR v4.2 anthropogenic emission inventory. For Turkmenistan we find on average about 50% higher emissions with our annual emission uncertainty estimates overlapping with the EDGAR emissions. For the region around Bakersfield in the Central Valley we find a factor of 5-8 higher emissions compared to EDGAR, albeit with large uncertainty. Major methane emission sources in this region are oil/gas and livestock. Our findings corroborate recently published studies based on aircraft and satellite measurements and new bottom-up estimates reporting significantly underestimated methane emissions of oil/gas and/or livestock in this area in EDGAR.

Impact of intercontinental pollution transport on North American ozone air pollution: an HTAP phase 2 multi-model study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; RISING ASIAN EMISSIONS; SURFACE OZONE; BACKGROUND OZONE; UNITED-STATES; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; AURA-TES; DATA ASSIMILATION; MODEL EVALUATION	The recent update on the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of the ground-level ozone (O-3 / can benefit from a better understanding of its source contributions in different US regions during recent years. In the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution experiment phase 1 (HTAP1), various global models were used to determine the O3 source-receptor (SR) relationships among three continents in the Northern Hemisphere in 2001. In support of the HTAP phase 2 (HTAP2) experiment that studies more recent years and involves higher-resolution global models and regional models' participation, we conduct a number of regional-scale Sulfur Transport and dEposition Model (STEM) air quality base and sensitivity simulations over North America during May-June 2010. STEM's top and lateral chemical boundary conditions were downscaled from three global chemical transport models' (i. e., GEOS-Chem, RAQMS, and ECMWF C-IFS) base and sensitivity simulations in which the East Asian (EAS) anthropogenic emissions were reduced by 20 %. The mean differences between STEM surface O3 sensitivities to the emission changes and its corresponding boundary condition model's are smaller than those among its boundary condition models, in terms of the regional/ period-mean (< 10 %) and the spatial distributions. An additional STEM simulation was performed in which the boundary conditions were downscaled from a RAQMS (Realtime Air Quality Modeling System) simulation without EAS anthropogenic emissions. The scalability of O3 sensitivities to the size of the emission perturbation is spatially varying, and the full (i. e., based on a 100% emission reduction) source contribution obtained from linearly scaling the North American mean O-3 sensitivities to a 20% reduction in the EAS anthropogenic emissions may be underestimated by at least 10 %. The three boundary condition models' mean O-3 sensitivities to the 20% EAS emission perturbations are similar to 8%(May-June 2010)/similar to 11%(2010 annual) lower than those estimated by eight global models, and the multi-model ensemble estimates are higher than the HTAP1 reported 2001 conditions. GEOS-Chem sensitivities indicate that the EAS anthropogenic NOx emissions matter more than the other EAS O3 precursors to the North American O-3, qualitatively consistent with previous adjoint sensitivity calculations. In addition to the analyses on large spatial-temporal scales relative to the HTAP1, we also show results on subcontinental and event scales that are more relevant to the US air quality management. The EAS pollution impacts are weaker during observed O-3 exceedances than on all days in most US regions except over some high-terrain western US rural/ remote areas. Satellite O-3 (TES, JPL-IASI, and AIRS) and carbon monoxide (TES and AIRS) products, along with surface measurements and model calculations, show that during certain episodes stratospheric O-3 intrusions and the transported EAS pollution influenced O-3 in the western and the eastern US differently. Free-running (i. e., without chemical data assimilation) global models underpredicted the transported background O-3 during these episodes, posing difficulties for STEM to accurately simulate the surface O-3 and its source contribution. Although we effectively improved the modeled O-3 by incorporating satellite O-3 (OMI and MLS) and evaluated the quality of the HTAP2 emission inventory with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute-Ozone Monitoring Instrument (KNMI-OMI) nitrogen dioxide, using observations to evaluate and improve O-3 source attribution still remains to be further explored.

This leads to direct Bayesian inference on astrophysical parameters. For pulsar timing arrays specifically, we interpolate over the parameter space of supermassive black-hole binary environments, including threebody stellar scattering, and evolving orbital eccentricity. We illustrate our approach on mock data, and assess the prospects for inference with data similar to the NANOGrav 9-yr data release.

Early science with the Large Millimeter Telescope: molecules in the extreme outflow of a protoplanetary nebula	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: late-type; ISM: abundances; ISM: molecules	WATER-FOUNTAIN; IRAS 16342-3814; OH 231.8+4.2; EMISSION; STARS; JETS	Extremely high velocity emission, likely related to jets, is known to occur in some protoplanetary nebulae. However, the molecular complexity of this kinematic component is largely unknown. We observed the known extreme outflow from the protoplanetary nebula IRAS 16342-3814, a prototype water fountain, over the full frequency range from 73111 GHz with the Redshift Search Receiver (RSR) on the Large Millimetre Telescope. We detected the molecules SiO, HCN, SO and (CO)-C-13. All molecular transitions, with the exception of the latter, are detected for the first time in this source and all present emission with velocities up to a few hundred km s(-1). IRAS 16342-3814 is therefore the only source of this kind presenting extreme outflow activity in all these molecules simultaneously, with SO and SiO emission showing the highest velocities found for these species in protoplanetary nebulae. A tentative weak SO component with a full width at half-maximum of similar to 700 km s(-1) remains to be confirmed. The extreme outflow gas consists of dense gas (n(H2) > 104.8-105.7 cm(-3)) with a mass larger than similar to 0.02-0.15 M-circle dot. The relatively high abundances of SiO and SO may be an indication of oxygen-rich extremely high velocity gas.	[Gomez-Ruiz, A.

A comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates showed the highest similarity (>99%) to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. The fatty acid composition, polar lipid profile, peptidoglycan type, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight profiles were consistent with the B. cereus sensu lato group. The phenotypic traits such as motile rods, enterotoxin production, lack of capsule, and resistance to gamma phage/penicillin observed in ISS isolates were not characteristics of B. anthracis. Whole-genome sequence characterizations showed that ISS strains had the plcR non-B. anthracis ancestral "C" allele and lacked anthrax toxin-encoding plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, excluding their identification as B. anthracis. The genetic identities of all 11 ISS isolates characterized via gyrB analyses arbitrarily identified them as members of the B. cereus group, but traditional DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) showed that the ISS isolates are similar to B. anthracis (88% to 90%) but distant from the B. cereus (42%) and B. thuringiensis (48%) type strains. The DDH results were supported by average nucleotide identity (>98.5%) and digital DDH (>86%) analyses. However, the collective phenotypic traits and genomic evidence were the reasons to exclude the ISS isolates from B. anthracis. Nevertheless, multilocus sequence typing and whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism analyses placed these isolates in a clade that is distinct from previously described members of the B. cereus sensu lato group but closely related to B. anthracis. IMPORTANCE The International Space Station Microbial Observatory (Microbial Tracking-1) study is generating a microbial census of the space station's surfaces and atmosphere by using advanced molecular microbial community analysis techniques supported by traditional culture-based methods and modern bioinformatic computational modeling. This approach will lead to long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics in a closed environment and address key questions, including whether microgravity influences the evolution and genetic modification pathogenic (B. anthracis), food poisoning (B. cereus), and biotechnologically useful (B. thuringiensis) microorganisms; their presence in a closed system such as the ISS might be a concern for the health of crew members. A detailed characterization of these potential pathogens would lead to the development of suitable countermeasures that are needed for long-term future missions and a better understanding of microorganisms associated with space missions.

Titan brighter at twilight than in daylight	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							AEROSOLS; ALBEDO; MODEL; ATMOSPHERES; OCCULTATION; PHOTOMETRY; TRANSIT; SURFACE; LIGHT; VENUS	Investigating the overall brightness of planets (and moons) provides insights into their envelopes and energy budgets(1-4). Phase curves (a representation of the overall brightness versus the Sun-object-observer phase angle) for Titan have been published over a limited range of phase angles and spectral passbands(5,6). Such information has been key to the study of the stratification, microphysics and aggregate nature of Titan's atmospheric haze(7,8) and has complemented the spatially resolved observations showing that the haze scatters efficiently in the forward direction(7,9). Here, we present Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem whole-disk brightness measurements of Titan from ultraviolet to near- infrared wavelengths. The observations show that Titan's twilight (loosely defined as the view at phase angles. greater than or similar to 150 degrees) outshines its daylight at various wavelengths. From the match between measurements and models, we show that at even larger phase angles, the back-illuminated moon will appear much brighter than when fully illuminated. This behaviour is unique in our Solar System to Titan and is caused by its extended atmosphere and the efficient forward scattering of sunlight by its atmospheric haze. We infer a solar energy deposition rate (for a solar constant of 14.9 W m(-2)) of (2.84 +/- 0.11) x 1014 W, consistent to within one to two standard deviations with Titan's time-varying thermal emission from 2007 to 201310,11. We propose that a forward scattering signature may also occur at large phase angles in the brightness of exoplanets with extended hazy atmospheres and that this signature has a valuable diagnostic potential for atmospheric characterization.

As an aid to such activities, the various wind datasets are being intercalibrated and merged into consistent climate data records (CDRs). The ocean wind CDRs (OW-CDRs) are evaluated by comparisons with ocean buoys and intercomparisons among the different satellite sensors and among the different data providers. Extending the OW-CDR into the future requires exploiting all available datasets, such as OSCAT-2 scheduled to launch in July 2016. Three planned methods of calibrating the OSCAT-2 so measurements include 1) direct Ku-band sigma(o) ntercalibration to QuikSCAT and RapidScat; 2) multisensor wind speed intercalibration; and 3) calibration to stable rainforest targets. Unfortunately, RapidScat failed in August 2016 and cannot be used to directly calibrate OSCAT-2. A particular future continuity concern is the absence of scheduled new or continuation radiometer missions capable of measuring wind speed. Specialized model assimilations provide 30-year long high temporal/spatial resolution wind vector grids that composite the satellite wind information from OW-CDRs of multiple satellites viewing the Earth at different local times.

These phenomena tend to modulate the across-shore distribution of heat and biogeochemical tracers. A California Undercurrent eddy was detected by shipboard observations in October 2009 off the northern Baja California continental slope. The spatiotemporal variation in the California Undercurrent eddy is investigated by using a mesoscale-resolving hindcast ocean simulation. A poleward coastal current that is driven by an upwelling-wind relaxation event and the coastline geometry instigated the separation of the California Undercurrent from the slope, forming a meander-like structure, which evolved as a mesoscale eddy-like structure. The latter structure evolved as a subsurface eddy with a warm anomaly core, a distinctive feature of eddies that form from the California Undercurrent. During the initial stage, the subsurface eddy presented a cone-shape form, with the maximum amplitude of the relative vorticity in the upper section. The inviscid effect of the irregular bottom topography altered both the initial direction of propagation and the initial eddy shape: the propagation direction of the eddy changed from north-south to southwest, and the shape changed from a cone shape to a subsurface lens shape. The strong eddy-topography interactions triggered a sign change in the heat flux direction from the environment toward the eddy and vice versa through the horizontally divergent component of the velocity field, which accelerated the eddy's decay. This study shows the relevance of the synoptic wind stress events and the irregularity of the bottom topography on the mesoscale eddy activity in the southern portion of the California Current.

New insights on tsunami genesis and energy source	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						tsunami genesis; energy; measurements; experiments; models	COSEISMIC SLIP; EARTHQUAKE; OCEAN; DISPLACEMENT; WAVES; GENERATION; AFTERSLIP	Conventional tsunami theories suggest that earthquakes with significant vertical motions are more likely to generate tsunamis. In tsunami models, the vertical seafloor elevation is directly transferred to the sea-surface as the only initial condition. However, evidence from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake indicates otherwise; the vertical seafloor uplift was only 3-5 m, too small to account for the resultant tsunami. Surprisingly, the horizontal displacement was undeniably larger than anyone's expectation; about 60 m at the frontal wedge of the fault plate, the largest slip ever recorded by in situ instruments. The question is whether the horizontal motion of seafloor slopes had enhanced the tsunami to become as destructive as observed. In this study, we provide proof: (1) combining various measurements from the 2011 Tohoku event, we show that the earthquake transferred a total energy of 3.1e+15 joule to the ocean, in which the potential energy (PE) due to the vertical seafloor elevation (including seafloor uplift/subsidence plus the contribution from the horizontal displacement) was less than a half, while the kinetic energy (KE) due to the horizontal displacement velocity of the continental slope contributed a majority portion; (2) using two modern state-of-the-art wave flumes and a three-dimensional tsunami model, we have reproduced the source energy and tsunamis consistent with observations, including the 2004 Sumatra event. Based on the unified source energy formulation, we offer a competing theory to explain why some earthquakes generate destructive tsunamis, while others do not.	[Song, Y.

Intraseasonal variability and causes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Bay of Bengal; ocean mixed layer; Indian summer monsoon; intraseasonal oscillation; barrier layer	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; BARRIER-LAYER THICKNESS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; ARABIAN SEA; DIURNAL CYCLE; OCEAN SURFACE; ATMOSPHERE; MODEL; SYSTEM; SST	The huge freshwater flux of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM; May-October) gives rise to strong salinity stratification in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), causing a shallow mixed layer and a thick barrier layer, which potentially affects intraseasonal oscillations of the monsoon (MISOs). In this study, intraseasonal variability of the mixed-layer depth (MLD) and barrier layer thickness (BLT) is investigated using in situ observations from Argo floats and moored buoys and an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). The average MLD in the BoB is typically 20-30 m during the ISM, while the BLT increases from approximate to 10 m in May-June to 20-40 m in September-October. MISOs induce in-phase variations in MLD and isothermal layer depth (ILD), both of which are deepened by 8-15 m during MISO active phase, while the change of BLT is small and within the error range of Argo data sampling. In the northern (southern) bay, BLT increases by approximate to 5 m (2 m) during MISOs owing to a larger deepening of ILD than MLD. OGCM experiments are performed to understand the underlying mechanism. In the BoB intraseasonal variations of MLD, ILD and BLT arise largely from ocean internal instability, whereas those induced by MISOs are weaker. The in-phase variations of MLD and ILD during MISOs are induced by different processes. The MLD deepening is primarily caused by wind stress forcing, while the ILD deepening is driven by surface heat fluxes via surface cooling. The limited variability of BLT is due to the offsetting of different forcing processes.

Impact on SST and convection	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						sea surface temperature; intraseasonal variability; Bay of Bengal; mixed layer depth; barrier layer	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE INTERACTION; CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM; DIURNAL CYCLE; BARRIER-LAYER; NORTHWARD PROPAGATION; SOLAR-RADIATION; COUPLED MODEL; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION	The Indian summer monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISOs) induce pronounced intraseasonal sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), which has important feedbacks to atmospheric convection. An ocean general circulation model (OGCM) is employed to investigate the upper-ocean processes affecting intraseasonal SST variability and its feedback to the MISO convection. In the BoB, the MISO induces intraseasonal SST variability predominantly through surface heat flux forcing with comparable contributions from shortwave radiation and turbulent heat flux, and to a much smaller extent through wind-driven ocean mixed layer entrainment. The ocean salinity stratification, represented by mixed layer depth (MLD) and barrier layer thickness (BLT), has a strong control on SST but weak impact on convection of the MISO. The MLD is critical for the amplitude of SST response to various forcing processes, while the BLT mainly affects entrainment by determining the temperature difference between the mixed layer and the water below. From May to mid-June, the shallow MLD and thin barrier layer greatly enhance intraseasonal SST anomalies, which can amplify convection fluctuations of the MISO through air-sea interaction and leads to intense but short-duration postconvection break spells. When either the MLD or the BLT is large, intraseasonal SSTs tend to be weak. Further investigation reveals that freshwater flux of the monsoon gives rise to the shallow MLD and thick barrier layer, and its overall effect on intraseasonal SSTs is a 20% enhancement. These results provide implications for improving the simulation and forecast of the MISO in climate models.

Interactions between energetic electrons and realistic whistler mode waves in the Jovian magnetosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							JUPITERS SYNCHROTRON-RADIATION; QUASI-LINEAR DIFFUSION; RELATIVISTIC ELECTRONS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; RADIO-EMISSION; PLASMA; BELTS; ACCELERATION; CHORUS; POLARIZATION	The role of plasma waves in shaping the intense Jovian radiation belts is not well understood. In this study we use a realistic wave model based on an extensive survey from the Plasma Wave Investigation on the Galileo spacecraft to calculate the effect of pitch angle and energy diffusion on Jovian energetic electrons due to upper and lower band chorus. Two Earth-based models, the Full Diffusion Code and the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt code, are adapted to the case of the Jovian magnetosphere and used to resolve the interaction between chorus and electrons at L = 10. We also present a study of the sensitivity to the latitudinal wave coverage and initial electron distribution. Our analysis shows that the contribution to the electron dynamics from upper band chorus is almost negligible compared to that from lower band chorus. For 100keV electrons, we observe that diffusion leads to redistribution of particles toward lower pitch angles with some particle loss, which could indicate that radial diffusion or interchange instabilities are important. For energies above >500keV, an initial electron distribution based on observations is only weakly affected by chorus waves. Ideally, we would require the initial electron phase space density before transport takes place to assess the importance of wave acceleration, but this is not available. It is clear from this study that the shape of the electron phase space density and the latitudinal extent of the waves are important for both electron acceleration and loss.

Hestia FFCO2 emissions are provided in the form of a group of sector-specific vector layers with point, line, and polygon sources to support carbon cycle science and climate policy. Application to carbon cycle science, in particular, requires regular gridded data in order to link surface carbon fluxes to atmospheric transport models. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of FFCO2 sources within regular grids is sensitive to spatial resolution. From the perspective of a data provider, we need to find a balance between resolution and data volume so that the gridded data product retains the maximum amount of information content while maintaining an efficient data volume. The Shannon entropy determines the minimum bits that are needed to encode an information source and can serve as a metric for the effective information content. In this paper, we present an analysis of the Shannon entropy of gridded FFCO2 emissions with varying resolutions in four Hestia study areas, and find: (1) the Shannon entropy increases with smaller grid resolution until it reaches a maximum value (the max-entropy resolution); (2) total emissions (the sum of several sector-specific emission fields) show a finer max-entropy resolution than each of the sector-specific fields; (3) the residential emissions show a finer max-entropy resolution than the commercial emissions; (4) the max-entropy resolution of the onroad emissions grid is closely correlated to the density of the road network. These findings suggest that the Shannon entropy can detect the information effectiveness of the spatial resolution of gridded FFCO2 emissions. Hence, the resolution-entropy relationship can be used to assist in determining an appropriate spatial resolution for urban CO2 flux studies. We conclude that the optimal spatial resolution for providing Hestia total FFCO2 emissions products is centered around 100 m, at which the FFCO2 emissions data can not only fully meet the requirement of urban flux integration, but also be effectively used in understanding the relationships between FFCO2 emissions and various social-economic variables at the U.S. census block group level.

Strain MP23(T) was slightly halophilic, and the optimal NaCl concentration and temperature for growth were 1% and 30 degrees C, respectively. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, strain MP23(T) was affiliated to the family Enterobacteriaceae and most closely related to Mangrovibacter yixingensis KCTC 42181(T) and Mangrovibacter plantisponsor DSM 19579(T) with 99.71% similarity, followed by Salmonella enterica subsp. salamae DSM 9220(T) (97.22 %), Cronobacter condimenti LMG 26250(T) (97.14 %) and Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae DSM 14847(T) (97 %). Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA, hsp60, gyrB and rpoB genes showed that strain MP23(T) formed a phylogenetic cluster with M. yixingensis KCTC 42181(T) and M. plantisponsor DSM 19579(T) indicating that it belongs to the genus Mangrovibacter. The major cellular fatty acids were C-16 (:) (0), C-18 (:) (1)omega 6c and/or C-18 : 1 omega 7c, C-16 : 1 omega 6c and/or C-16 : 1 omega 7c, C-14 : 0, C-14 : 0 3-OH and/or iso-C-16 : 1 I and C-17 : 0 cyclo. Polar lipids of strain MP23(T) consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content was 50.3 mol%. Based on experimental DNA-DNA hybridization values and average nucleotide identity derived from in silico comparison of whole-genome sequences, strain MP23(T) could be distinguished from its closest neighbours. We therefore conclude that strain MP23(T) represents a novel species of the genus Mangrovibacter for which the name Mangrovibacter phragmitis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MP23(T) (= DSM 100250(T)=KCTC 42580(T)).

Mineralogy and stratigraphy of the Gale crater rim, wall, and floor units	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						planetary geology; remote sensing; mineralogy	PAST AQUEOUS ACTIVITY; YELLOWKNIFE BAY; CLAY-MINERALS; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; CRYSTAL-CHEMISTRY; MOUNT SHARP; MARS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS	The Curiosity rover has detected diverse lithologies in float rocks and sedimentary units on the Gale crater floor, interpreted to have been transported from the rim. To understand their provenance, we examine the mineralogy and geology of Gale's rim, walls, and floor, using high-resolution imagery and infrared spectra. While no significant differences in bedrock spectral properties were observed within most Thermal Emission Imaging System and Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) scenes, some CRISM scenes of rim and wall rocks showed olivine-bearing bedrock accompanied by Fe/Mg phyllosilicates. Hydrated materials with 2.48m absorptions in Gale's eastern walls are spectrally similar to the sulfate unit in Mount Sharp (Aeolis Mons). Sedimentary strata on the Gale floor southwest of the landing site, likely coeval with the Bradbury units explored by Curiosity, also are hydrated and/or have Fe/Mg phyllosilicates. Spectral properties of these phyllosilicates differ from the Al-substituted nontronite detected by CRISM in Mount Sharp, suggesting formation by fluids of different composition. Geologic mapping of the crater floor shows that the hydrated or hydroxylated materials are typically overlain by spectrally undistinctive, erosionally resistant, cliff-forming units. Additionally, a 4km impact crater exposes >250m of the Gale floor, including finely layered units. No basement rocks are exposed, thus indicating sedimentary deposits 250m beneath strata studied by Curiosity. Collectively, the data indicate substantial sedimentary infill of Gale crater, including some materials derived from the crater rim. Lowermost thin layers are consistent with deposition in a lacustrine environment; interbedded hydrated/hydroxylated units may signify changing environmental conditions, perhaps in a drying or episodically dry lake bed. Plain Language Summary The Curiosity rover has detected diverse rocks on the floor of Gale crater; these are interpreted to have been transported there from the crater rim. To better constrain where these rocks came from, we examine the mineralogy and geology of Gale's rim, walls, and floor, using high-resolution images and spectra. While the majority of Gale is dusty and did not reveal any convincing mineral signatures, we did observe some portions of the rim and wall showing iron-rich minerals and probable iron or magnesium bearing clays. Rocks on the Gale floor also have hydration signatures similar to those of clays. These clays and those from the rim and wall are different from those in Mount Sharp because they do not have aluminum; this suggests that the waters they formed in or the rocks they came from were different. Geologic mapping of the crater floor shows that the clay-like materials are typically overlain by bland-appearing, erosionally resistant, cliff-forming units. Additionally, a 4 km impact crater exposes >250 m of material below the Gale floor, including rocks that appear finely layered. None of the original crater rocks are exposed, only rocks that later filled Gale. This indicates later deposits 50 m beneath those traversed by the Curiosity rover. Collectively, the data indicate substantial infill of Gale crater, including materials derived from the crater rim. The lowermost thin layers are consistent with deposition in a lake; alternating levels of hydration in the mapped rock units may imply changing environmental conditions, perhaps in a drying or episodically dry lake bed.

The Inner 25 au Debris Distribution in the is an element of Eri System	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; infrared: stars; planetary systems; stars: individual (is an element of Eri)	MULTIBAND IMAGING PHOTOMETER; STARS NSTARS PROJECT; SOLAR-LIKE STARS; EPSILON-ERIDANI; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; INFRARED ASTRONOMY; SMALL PARTICLES; DISK STRUCTURE; EARLY SCIENCE; CHAOTIC ZONE	Debris disk morphology is wavelength dependent due to the wide range of particle sizes and size-dependent dynamics influenced by various forces. Resolved images of nearby debris disks reveal complex disk structures that are difficult to distinguish from their spectral energy distributions. Therefore, multi-wavelength resolved images of nearby debris systems provide an essential foundation to understand the intricate interplay between collisional, gravitational, and radiative forces that govern debris disk structures. We present the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) 35 mu m resolved disk image of is an element of Eri, the closest debris disk around a star similar to the early Sun. Combining with the Spitzer resolved image at 24 mu m and 15-38 mu m excess spectrum, we examine two proposed origins of the inner debris in is an element of Eri: (1) in situ planetesimal belt(s) and (2) dragged-in grains from the cold outer belt. We find that the presence of in situ dust-producing planetesmial belt(s) is the most likely source of the excess emission in the inner 25 au region. Although a small amount of dragged-in grains from the cold belt could contribute to the excess emission in the inner region, the resolution of the SOFIA data is high enough to rule out the possibility that the entire inner warm excess results from dragged-in grains, but not enough to distinguish one broad inner disk from two narrow belts.

Modelling and simulation of large-scale polarized dust emission over the southern Galactic cap using the GASS HI data	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						dust, extinction; ISM: magnetic fields; ISM: structure; polarization; Galaxy: general; submillimeter: ISM	ABSORPTION-LINE SURVEY; INTERSTELLAR GRAINS; RADIATIVE TORQUES; MAGNETIC-FIELD; POWER SPECTRA; B-MODES; HYDROGEN	The Planck survey has quantified polarized Galactic foregrounds and established that they are a main limiting factor in the quest for the cosmic microwave background B-mode signal induced by primordial gravitational waves during cosmic inflation. Accurate separation of the Galactic foregrounds therefore binds this quest to our understanding of the magnetized interstellar medium. The two most relevant empirical results from analysis of Planck data are line of sight depolarization arising from fluctuations of the Galactic magnetic field orientation and alignment of filamentary dust structures with the magnetic field at high Galactic latitude. Furthermore, Planck and Hi emission data in combination indicate that most of the filamentary dust structures are in the cold neutral medium. The goal of this paper is to test whether these salient observational results, taken together, can account fully for the statistical properties of the dust polarization over a selected low column density region comprising 34% of the southern Galactic cap (b <= -30 degrees). To do this, we construct a dust model that incorporates HI column density maps as tracers of the dust intensity structures and a phenomenological description of the Galactic magnetic field. By adjusting the parameters of the dust model, we were able to reproduce the Planck dust observations at 353 GHz in the selected region. Realistic simulations of the polarized dust emission enabled by such a dust model are useful for testing the accuracy of component separation methods, studying non-Gaussianity, and constraining the amount of decorrelation with frequency.

Broad-band X-ray spectral analysis of the Seyfert 1 galaxy GRS 1734-292	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual: GRS 1734-292; galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; XMM-NEWTON; BEPPOSAX OBSERVATIONS; COMPTONIZATION MODELS; CORONAL PROPERTIES; BLACK-HOLES; NUSTAR; REFLECTION; SPECTROSCOPY	We discuss the broad-band X-ray spectrum ofGRS1734-292 obtained from non-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array) observations, performed in 2009 and 2014, respectively. GRS1734-292 is a Seyfert 1 galaxy, located near the Galactic plane at z = 0.0214. The NuSTAR spectrum (3-80 keV) is dominated by a primary power-law continuum with Gamma = 1.65 +/- 0.05 and a high-energy cut-off E-c = 53(-8)(+11) keV, one of the lowest measured by NuSTAR in a Seyfert galaxy. Comptonization models show a temperature of the coronal plasma of kT(e) = 11.9(-0.9)(+1.2) keV and an optical depth, assuming a slab geometry, tau = 2.98(-0.19)(+0.16) or a similar temperature and tau = 6.7(-0.4)(+0.3) assuming a spherical geometry. The 2009 XMM-Newton spectrum iswell described by a flatter intrinsic continuum (Gamma = 1.47(-0.03)(+0.07)) and one absorption line due to Fe XXV K alpha produced by a warm absorber. Both data sets show a modest iron K alpha emission line at 6.4 keV and the associated Compton reflection, due to reprocessing from neutral circumnuclear material.

In this work, we interpret the observed CFIRB anisotropies using an empirical model based on resolved galaxies in ultraviolet and optical surveys. Our model includes stellar mass functions, star-forming main sequence and dust attenuation. We find that the commonly used linear Kennicutt relation between infrared luminosity and star formation rate overproduces the observed CFIRB amplitudes. The observed CFIRB requires that low-mass galaxies have lower infrared luminosities than expected from the Kennicutt relation, implying that low-mass galaxies have lower dust content and weaker dust attenuation. Our results demonstrate that CFIRB not only provides a stringent consistency check for galaxy evolution models but also constrains the dust content of low-mass galaxies.

J	Vallisneri, M; van Haasteren, R				Vallisneri, Michele; van Haasteren, Rutger			Taming outliers in pulsar-timing data sets with hierarchical likelihoods and Hamiltonian sampling	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational waves; methods: data analysis; pulsars: general		Pulsar-timing data sets have been analysed with great success using probabilistic treatments based on Gaussian distributions, with applications ranging from studies of neutron-star structure to tests of general relativity and searches for nanosecond gravitational waves. As for other applications of Gaussian distributions, outliers in timing measurements pose a significant challenge to statistical inference, since they can bias the estimation of timing and noise parameters, and affect reported parameter uncertainties. We describe and demonstrate a practical end-toend approach to perform Bayesian inference of timing and noise parameters robustly in the presence of outliers, and to identify these probabilistically. The method is fully consistent (i.e. outlier-ness probabilities vary in tune with the posterior distributions of the timing and noise parameters), and it relies on the efficient sampling of the hierarchical form of the pulsar-timing likelihood. Such sampling has recently become possible with a 'no-U-turn' Hamiltonian sampler coupled to a highly customized reparametrization of the likelihood; this code is described elsewhere, but it is already available online. We recommend our method as a standard step in the preparation of pulsar-timing-array data sets: even if statistical inference is not affected, follow-up studies of outlier candidates can reveal unseen problems in radio observations and timing measurements; furthermore, confidence in the results of gravitational-wave searches will only benefit from stringent statistical evidence that data sets are clean and outlier-free.

While many studies have used satellite data to examine the trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD), very few have investigated the trends in aerosol properties associated with particle size, morphology, and light absorption. In this study, we investigate decadal-scale (13-15 year) trends in aerosol loading and properties during 2001-2015 over three populous regions: the Eastern United States (EUS), Western Europe (WEU), and Eastern and Central China (ECC). We use observations from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Relationships between aerosol property trends and air pollutant emission changes are examined. We find that annual mean AOD shows pronounced decreasing trends over EUS and WEU regions, as a result of considerable emission reductions in all major pollutants except for mineral dust and ammonia (NH3). Over the ECC region, AOD increases before 2006 due to emission increases induced by rapid economic development, fluctuates between 2006 and 2011, and subsequently decreases after 2011 in conjunction with effective emission reduction in anthropogenic primary aerosols, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The fraction of small-size AOD (<0.7 mu m diameter), <(A)over circle>ngstrom exponent and single-scattering albedo have generally decreased, while the fractions of large-size (>1.4 mu m diameter), nonspherical and absorbing AOD have generally shown increasing trends over EUS and WEU regions, indicating that fine and light-scattering aerosol constituents have been more effectively reduced than coarse and light-absorbing constituents. These trends are consistent with the larger reduction ratios in S(O)2 and NOx emissions than in primary aerosols, including mineral dust and black carbon (BC). Over the ECC region, no significant trends are observed with respect to size distribution, morphology, or light absorption, which we attribute to a simultaneous increase in emissions of SO2, NOx, and primary aerosols including BC before 2006, and a simultaneous decrease after 2011. This study demonstrates the importance and usefulness of satellite-borne sensors, particularly MISR, in association with evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution control policies.

Inverting Glacial Isostatic Adjustment signal using Bayesian framework and two linearly relaxing rheologies	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Gravity anomalies and Earth structure; Sea level change; Transient deformation; Probability distributions; Dynamics of lithosphere and mantle; Rheology: mantle	SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; ANTARCTIC ICE-SHEET; MANTLE VISCOSITY; LATE PLEISTOCENE; JOINT INVERSION; GRAVITY GRADIENTS; MELTING HISTORY; MODEL; EARTH; DEFORMATION	Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models commonly assume a mantle with a viscoelastic Maxwell rheology and a fixed ice history model. Here, we use a Bayesian Monte Carlo approach with a Markov chain formalism to invert the global GIA signal simultaneously for the mechanical properties of the mantle and the volumes of the ice sheets, using as starting ice models two previously published ice histories. Two stress relaxing rheologies are considered: Burgers and Maxwell linear viscoelasticities. A total of 5720 global palaeo sea level records are used, covering the last 35 kyr. Our goal is not only to seek the model best fitting this data set, but also to determine and display the range of possible solutions with their respective probability of explaining the data. In all cases, our a posteriori probability maps exhibit the classic character of solutions for GIA-determined mantle viscosity with two distinct peaks. What is new in our treatment is the presence of the bi-viscous Burgers rheology and the fact that we invert rheology jointly with ice history, in combination with the greatly expanded palaeo sea level records. The solutions tend to be characterized by an upper-mantle viscosity of around 5 x 10(20) Pa s with one preferred lower-mantle viscosities at 3 x 10(21) Pa s and the other more than 2x10(22) Pa s, a rather classical pairing. Best-fitting models depend upon the starting ice history and the stress relaxing law. A first peak (P1) has the highest probability only in the case with a Maxwell rheology and ice history based on ICE-5G, while the second peak (P2) is favoured for ANU-based ice history or Burgers stress relaxation. The latter solution also may satisfy lower-mantle viscosity inferences from long-term geodynamics and gravity gradient anomalies over Laurentia. P2 is also consistent with large Laurentian and Fennoscandian ice-sheet volumes at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and smaller LGM Antarctic ice volume than in either ICE-5G or ANU. Exploration of a bi-viscous linear relaxing rheology in GIA now seems logical due to a new set of requirements to satisfy observations of transient post-seismic flow seen so ubiquitously in space gravimetry and other global geodetic data.

Topoclimate effects on growing season length and montane conifer growth in complex terrain	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						forest growth; sapflow; montane ecosystem; complex terrain; growing season length; topoclimate	COLORADO FRONT RANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; BOUNDARY-LAYER; WATER-MOVEMENT; FOREST; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHENOLOGY; TRANSPIRATION; DROUGHT	Spatial variability in the topoclimate-driven linkage between forest phenology and tree growth in complex terrain is poorly understood, limiting our understanding of how ecosystems function as a whole. To characterize the influence of topoclimate on phenology and growth, we determined the start, end, and length of the growing season (GS(start), GS(end), and GSL, respectively) using the correlation between transpiration and evaporative demand, measured with sapflow. We then compared these metrics with stem relative basal area increment (relative BAI) at seven sites among elevation and aspects in a Colorado montane forest. As elevation increased, we found shorter GSL (-50 d km(-1)) due to later GS(start) (40 d km(-1)) and earlier GS(end) (-10 d km(-1)). North-facing sites had a 21 d shorter GSL than south-facing sites at similar elevations (i.e. equal to 200 m elevation difference on a given aspect). Growing season length was positively correlated with relative BAI, explaining 83% of the variance. This study shows that topography exerts strong environmental controls on GSL and thus forest growth. Given the climate-related dependencies of these controls, the results presented here have important implications for ecosystem responses to changes in climate and highlight the need for improved phenology representation in complex terrain.

The dynamical consistency is achieved by using the basis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) derived from NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) non-Boussinesq ocean general circulation model (OGCM) output at 1/4 degrees resolution from 1958 to 2013. A convenient singular value decomposition (SVD) method is used to calculate the EOFs, in order to enable efficient computing for a fine spatial grid globally. These EOFs are used as explainable variables and are regressed against the sparsely distributed in situ ocean temperature data at 33 standard depth levels. The observed data are aggregated onto a 18 latitude-longitude grid at each level from the surface to the 5500-m layer for the period 1950-2014. Three representative temperature reconstruction examples are presented and validated: two 10-m-layer (i.e., the second layer from the surface) reconstructions for January 2008 and January 1998, which are compared with independent sea surface temperature (SST) observations; and one 100-m-layer reconstruction for January 1998, which shows a strong cold anomaly El Nino signal in the western tropical Pacific up to -5 degrees C from 150 degrees E to 140 degrees W. The SOG reconstruction can accurately locate the El Nino signal region in different ocean layers. The SOG reconstruction method is shown reliable and yields satisfactory accuracy even with sparse data. Validation and error analysis indicate that no systematic biases exist in the observed and reconstructed data.	[Shen, Samuel S.

They may be cryptoendolithic within pore spaces of weathered rocks, or develop in cracks and fissures as chasmoendolithic communities and are characterised by coloured bands of colonisation. Here we used a precision drill to recover fractions from black, white, green and red layers within colonised granite and sandstone. We combined backscattered scanning electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing to identify major taxa in each band. We confirmed the presence of algal and fungal lichen symbionts, cyanobacteria and free-living algae, plus a diverse heterotrophic bacterial and archaeal component. A clear delineation at the community level was observed. The relatively biodiverse and heterogenous lichen communities occurred in weathered sandstone cliffs, whilst in granite and sandstone boulders, cyanobacterial communities were dominant. Differences between coloured bands of colonisation within each community were less clear. The study demonstrates that endolithic microbial communities can be recovered using a drill technology similar to that planned for the search for endolithic biosignatures on Mars.	[Archer, Stephen D.

Xanthophyll cycle activity in two prominent arctic shrub species	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH			English	Article							THERMAL-ENERGY DISSIPATION; PHOTOCHEMICAL REFLECTANCE INDEX; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; PIGMENT COMPOSITION; SCOTS PINE; PHOTOPROTECTIVE MECHANISMS; DATA ASSIMILATION; SPRING RECOVERY; DIURNAL CHANGES	When the capacity for photosynthesis is constrained by unfavorable growing conditions, excess absorbed light is safely lost from leaves via thermal energy dissipation-a photoprotective mechanism ubiquitous among higher plants. The relatively low irradiance conditions yet stressful growing environment of the arctic tundra suggest contrasting hypotheses regarding the necessity for plant investment in photoprotection. To examine these hypotheses, the photoprotective pigments of the xanthophyll cycle were investigated in conjunction with non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence emission in two dominant arctic shrub species, Salix pulchra and Betula nana. The xanthophyll cycle pool sizes of S. pulchra leaves were substantially higher than those reported in most other higher plant species, whereas B. nana leaves maintain modestly high xanthophyll cycle pool sizes. In addition, high retention of de-epoxidized xanthophyll cycle pigments in both species and saturation of xanthophyll cycle conversion at low-light intensities were observed and associated with high levels of NPQ. The xanthophyll cycle leaf pigment pools reported are among the first published for arctic plants and support the hypothesis that foliar xanthophyll cycle activity is greater in environments prone to harsher growing conditions.

Recommended Practice for Flow Control and Measurement in Electric Propulsion Testing	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article								Accurate control and measurement of propellant flow to a thruster is one of the most basic and fundamental requirements for operation of electric propulsion systems, whether they be in the laboratory or on flight spacecraft. Hence, it is important for the electric propulsion community to have a common understanding of typical methods for flow control and measurement. This paper addresses the topic of propellant flow primarily for the gaseous propellant systems that have dominated laboratory research and flight application over the last few decades, although other types of systems are also briefly discussed. Although most flight systems have employed a type of pressure-fed flow restrictor for flow control, both thermal-based and pressure-based mass flow controllers are routinely used in laboratories. Fundamentals and theory of operation of these types of controllers are presented, along with sources of uncertainty associated with their use. Methods of calibration and recommendations for calibration processes are presented. Finally, details of uncertainty calculations are presented for some common calibration methods and for the linear fits to calibration data that are commonly used.

Recommended Practice for Use of Langmuir Probes in Electric Propulsion Testing	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							ION-BEAM DIAGNOSTICS; PLASMA PARAMETERS; DIRECT-DISPLAY; MACH PROBE; DENSITY-MEASUREMENTS; COLLISIONLESS; MICROWAVE; TRIPLE; TEMPERATURE; COLLECTION	Presented in this work is a guide to standardize the methods of performing correct and accurate Langmuir probe measurements within the plasma environment produced by an electric propulsion device. The construction, installation, operation, and data interpretation of the full family of Langmuir probes are addressed including single Langmuir probes, double Langmuir probes, and triple Langmuir probes. Traditional time-averaged operation as well as high-speed operation are discussed as are the various pressure and external field limitations of Langmuir probes. This recommended practice is established from the vast collection of preexisting Langmuir probe theory and operational experience within the plasma environment of electric propulsion thrusters. Focus is placed on the application of Langmuir probes in the most common electric propulsion devices including Hall, ion, and pulsed thrusters. These electric propulsion devices all create flowing plasmas that require special probe construction and data analysis that is not needed in many other types of plasmas where Langmuir probes are commonly employed. The recommended practices are presented in a concise handbook style, reserving all theoretical derivations and details to the referenced works of their origination.

Although the RCCE approach has been used widely in the past, its application in non-combustion-based reacting flows is rarely done; the flows being investigated in this work do not contain species that can easily be classified as reactants and/or products. The effectiveness of different constraints is investigated before running a full computational simulation, and new constraints not reported in the existing literature are introduced. A constraint based on the enthalpy of formation is shown to work well for the two gas models used for flows that involve both shocks and steady expansions.

In search of the Earth-forming reservoir: Mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic characterizations of the ungrouped achondrite NWA 5363/NWA 5400 and selected chondrites	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							EARLY SOLAR-SYSTEM; CORE FORMATION; HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION; METEORITICAL BULLETIN; ORIGIN; CHRONOLOGY; PLANETARY; ND-142; DIFFERENTIATION; ANOMALIES	High-precision isotope data of meteorites show that the long-standing notion of a chondritic uniform reservoir is not always applicable for describing the isotopic composition of the bulk Earth and other planetary bodies. To mitigate the effects of this isotopic crisis and to better understand the genetic relations of meteorites and the Earth-forming reservoir, we performed a comprehensive petrographic, elemental, and multi-isotopic (O, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Mo, Ru, and W) study of the ungrouped achondrites NWA 5363 and NWA 5400, for both of which terrestrial O isotope signatures were previously reported. Also, we obtained isotope data for the chondrites Pillistfer (EL6), Allegan (H6), and Allende (CV3), and compiled available anomaly data for undifferentiated and differentiated meteorites. The chemical compositions of NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are strikingly similar, except for fluid mobile elements tracing desert weathering. We show that NWA 5363 and NWA 5400 are paired samples from a primitive achondrite parent-body and interpret these rocks as restite assemblages after silicate melt extraction and siderophile element addition. Hafnium-tungsten chronology yields a model age of 2.2 +/- 0.8Myr after CAI, which probably dates both of these events within uncertainty. We confirm the terrestrial O isotope signature of NWA 5363/NWA 5400; however, the discovery of nucleosynthetic anomalies in Ca, Ti, Cr, Mo, and Ru reveals that the NWA5363/NWA 5400 parent-body is not the missing link that could explain the composition of the Earth by the mixing of known meteorites. Until this missing link or a direct sample of the terrestrial reservoir is identified, guidelines are provided of how to use chondrites for estimating the isotopic composition of the bulk Earth.

GRACE-derived TWS provides spatially continuous observations of changes in overall water supply and regional drought extent, persistence and severity, while satellite-derived SM provides enhanced delineation of shallow-depth soil water supply. Together these data provide complementary metrics quantifying available plant water supply. We use these data to investigate the supply changes from water components at different depths in relation to satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) from MODIS and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2, during and following major drought events observed in the state of Texas, USA and its surrounding semiarid area for the past decade. We find that in normal years the spatial pattern of the vegetation-moisture relationship follows the gradient in mean annual precipitation. However since the 2011 hydrological drought, vegetation growth shows enhanced sensitivity to surface SM variations in the grassland area located in central Texas, implying that the grassland, although susceptible to drought, has the capacity for a speedy recovery. Vegetation dependency on TWS weakens in the shrub-dominated west and strengthens in the grassland and forest area spanning from central to eastern Texas, consistent with changes in water supply pattern. We find that in normal years GRACE TWS shows strong coupling and similar characteristic time scale to surface SM, while in drier years GRACE TWS manifests stronger persistence, implying longer recovery time and prolonged water supply constraint on vegetation growth. The synergistic combination of GRACE TWS and surface SM, along with remote-sensing vegetation observations provides new insights into drought impact on vegetation-moisture relationship, and unique information regarding vegetation resilience and the recovery of hydrological drought.

In this paper, we characterize direct detection and heterodyne gain fluctuations of 35-, 30-, and 25-nm gate-length InP MMIC low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) designed for the 200-670-GHz frequency range. Of the twelve MMIC LNAs, five pairs have also been measured in multistage or cascaded configuration. In direct detection mode, the MMICs room temperature (RT) 1/f noise spectrum and responsivity were measured. From these the power spectral density, the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD), equivalent system noise temperature (T-D (D)(sys)), and low-frequency normalized gain fluctuations (Delta G/ G) are derived. On the same set of MMIC LNAs, using a heterodyne down conversion technique, the Allan variance method is applied to obtain the Allan stability time and normalized 4-8 GHz gain fluctuation noise at both RT and two cryogenic temperatures. We find in the case of 35-, 30-, and 25-nm gate-length InP MMIC LNAs that the derived direct detection and heterodyne gain stability is highly process dependent with only a secondary dependence on gate periphery, the number of gate fingers, and/or gain stages. This observation confirms the underlying solid-state physics understanding that gain fluctuation noise is the result of a temporal distribution of the generation and recombination of electron free carriers due to lattice defects and surface impurities. Upon cooling below similar to 66 K, it is observed that on average gain fluctuations increase by greater than or similar to 2.2x and the Allan stability time decreases by similar to 2.5x. The presented measurement results compare favorably to the ALMA system gain specification of Delta G/G <= 1.4E-4 from 0.05-100 s, and offers guidance for application of InP LNAs for RT and cryogenic direct detection and heterodyne systems.

J	Bellan, J				Bellan, Josette			Evaluation of mixture-fraction-based turbulent-reaction-rate model assumptions for high-pressure reactive flows	COMBUSTION AND FLAME			English	Article						High-pressure turbulent reaction rate model; Turbulence production in high-pressure; turbulent flows; Direct Numerical Simulation	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; SOURCE-TERM ESTIMATION; CONDITIONAL MOMENT CLOSURE; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; MIXING LAYER; DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION; SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS; HEAT-TRANSFER; PDF METHODS; FLAMES	Several assumptions of atmospheric-pressure (atmospheric-p) single-phase turbulent reaction rate models are examined for high-p reactive flows having turbulent characteristics. The study uses a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database described elsewhere (Bellan, 2017). This database was obtained with a model combining multi-species mixing under high-p conditions, a real-gas equation of state (EOS) and a single-step chemical reaction. The database, created in the configuration of a temporal mixing layer, probes the effect of the initial Reynolds number, Reo, of the initial pressure, p(0), and of the initial composition of the two mixing-layer streams. The reaction is initiated in a turbulent flow and in each simulation the computations are pursued past a time when a maximum average-volumetric p is attained, t*(pp). The examination of the vorticity and enstrophy equations at a time before reaction initiation and also at t*(pp) highlights the pivotal role of the high density-gradient magnitude regions (Bellan, 2017) in producing turbulence and the crucial role at t*(pp) of the baroclinic effect representing the misalignments of gradients of thermodynamic variables. Compared to the classical mixture fraction equation, the results show that the mixture fraction obeys an equation in which there is an additional diffusion term having a larger r.m.s. magnitude than that of the mixture-fraction typical diffusion term. An assessment of the Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) model assumptions found that, using an accurate mixture fraction probability density function (PDF), one can obtain a very good representation of the turbulent reaction rate in the most intense reaction regions, however the quality of the predictions of CSE deteriorated significantly when a common model for the PDF, the beta-PDF, was used despite the,beta-PDF being constructed with the accurate moments extracted from the DNS. In the regions of minimal reaction, the CSE model using the exact PDF extracted from the DNS does not provide an accurate representation of the turbulent reaction rate, a fact which is attributed to the combined effect of lack of correlation between fluctuations of the reaction rate and of the mixture fraction, and to the strong correlation of the thermodynamic variables through the real-gas EOS in regions of colder and denser fluid.

A global analysis of the system shows that the host star is an evolved subgiant star with T-eff= 5370 +/- 51 K, M* 1.438(-0.052)(+0.061)M(circle dot) R*= 2.72(-0.17) (+0.21) M-circle dot R*=log g* 3.727(-0.046)(+0.040) , and [Fe/H]= 0.180 +/- 0.075. The planet is a low-mass gas giant in a P = 4.736529 +/- 0.00006 day orbit, with M-P =0.195 +/- 0.018 M-J, R-P = 1.37(-0.12)(+0.15) R-J, rho(P) = 0.09(-0.024)(+0.028) g cm(-3), surface gravity log g(P) = 2.407(-0.086)(+0.080) , and equilibrium temperature T-eq = 1712(-46)(+51) K. KELT-11 is the brightest known transiting exoplanet host in the southern hemisphere by more than a magnitude. and is the sixth brightest transit host to date. The planet is one of the most inflated planets known, with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height (2763 km), and an associated size of the expected atmospheric transmission signal of 5.6%. These attributes make the KELT-11 system a valuable target for follow-up and atmospheric characterization, and it promises to become one of the benchmark systems for the study of inflated exoplanets.

The method is fast and accurate for at least 10 000 looks and the full range of interferometric correlations. This is accomplished by computing the products of large and small numbers in the underlying hypergeometric series logarithmically and by deriving a single-term recursion relation to accelerate the computation.

A 1.5-GHz 6.144T Correlations/s 64 x 64 Cross-Correlator With 128 Integrated ADCs for Real-Time Synthetic Aperture Imaging	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Circuits; Mixed analog digital integrated circuits; Synthetic aperture radar; System-on-chip	RADIOMETRY; GEOSTAR; EARTH	A 65-nm CMOS, 18-mm(2), 1.5-GHz 64 x 64 cross-correlator with 128 on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) enables real-time synthetic aperture radiometric imaging. This brief enables high-resolution synthetic aperture radiometry by greatly improving the integration and energy efficiency of the mixed-signal baseband cross-correlator. The design supports analog-in and digital correlation out, removing approximately 5 W of power that would otherwise be needed for I/O between the ADCs and the digital correlation core. The prototype 6.144T correlation/s 1.5 Gsamples/s 64 x 64 correlator is designed for satellite-based radiometric imaging of water in the atmosphere. Massive parallelism together with an optimized correlation scheme leads to a measured energy consumption of only 0.35 pJ/correlation/cycle.

The instrument line shape (ILS) function and dispersion parameters were determined through laser-based spectroscopic measurements, and then further optimized by comparing solar spectra recorded simultaneously on the ground by the OCO-2 flight instrument and a collocated high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS). The resulting ILS profiles and dispersion parameters, when applied to the FTS solar data, showed agreement between the spectra recorded by the spectrometers and FTS to approximately 0.2% RMS, satisfying the preflight spectral calibration accuracy requirement of <0.25% RMS. Specific changes to the OCO-2 instrument and calibration process, compared to the original OCO, include stray-light protection; improved laser setup; increased spectral sampling; enhanced data screening, and incremental improvements in the ILS, dispersion, and FTS optimization analyses.

Measuring Azimuth Deformation With L-Band ALOS-2 ScanSAR Interferometry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2); azimuth deformation; earthquake; ionosphere; scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR)	SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; SAR; IMAGES	We analyze the methods for measuring azimuth deformation with the L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) interferometry. To implement the methods, we extract focused bursts from the ALOS-2 full-aperture product, which is the only product available for ScanSAR interferometry at present. The extracted bursts are properly processed to measure azimuth deformation using interferometric phase. We apply the range split-spectrum method to ScanSAR to estimate the differential ionospheric phase of the interferogram, and take the azimuth derivative of the differential ionospheric phase to mitigate the relative azimuth shift caused by ionosphere. For the first time, azimuth deformation of a large earthquake (April 25, 2015 Nepal earthquake) is nearly completely measured by the L-band ScanSAR interferometry with moderate precision. The result is validated by the azimuth deformation measured by incoherent cross correlation using a pair of high-resolution RADARSAT-2 images. In addition to the final azimuth deformation, we show the possibility of processing full-aperture ScanSAR product using a burst-by-burst approach to form regular interferograms. We also show the recent strong large-scale ionospheric effects on the L-band ALOS-2 ScanSAR interferograms. Other possible applications of this paper include measuring the movement of glaciers.

Interferometry With ALOS-2 Full-Aperture ScanSAR Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2); earthquake; full-aperture; interferometry; scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR)	GORKHA EARTHQUAKE	Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) is designed to routinely acquire both scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) and stripmap data. In this paper, we present a special multiband bandpass filter (MBF) to remove azimuth nonoverlap spectra for the interferometric processing of ALOS-2 full-aperture ScanSAR product. As required by the MBF, we estimate the important ScanSAR system parameters and the start times of raw bursts using ALOS-2 full-aperture ScanSAR image. The resulting MBF can remove the nonoverlap spectra caused by both Doppler centroid frequency difference and burst misalignment. It can be used in ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry, as well as ScanSAR-stripmap interferometry. Based on the MBF, we propose a single processing workflow that is able to implement both ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry and ScanSAR-stripmap interferometry. Finally, we present example interferograms of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal processed using the proposed processing workflow. The interferograms are greatly improved after applying the MBF to remove the significant amount of nonoverlap spectra in the data.

Derived Observations From Frequently Sampled Microwave Measurements of Precipitation. Part II: Sensitivity to Atmospheric Variables and Instrument Parameters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Atmospheric modeling; spaceborne radar	RADAR; MODEL	This is the second of two papers that quantify the high added value of frequent 3-D radar observations of the atmosphere to capture the dynamics of weather systems. Recent advances in small-satellite and radar technologies, such as the "Radar in Cubesat" developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, are paving the way for the design of convoys of spaceborne radars that can directly observe the evolution of severe weather at very fine temporal scales. The analyses presented here are to establish the relation between such observations to the underlying cloud variables and processes, and to quantify the sensitivity to the different physical and instrument parameters. In this paper, we quantify the uncertainty in the relation between the measured radar reflectivities Z and their time derivatives dt Z, on one hand, and the underlying rate of change of the condensed-water mass M, and fluxes of dry and moist air in convection, on the other hand. The uncertainties are due to the variability of the atmospheric parameters as well as the constraints of an observation strategy that would use pairs of spaceborne instruments. We specifically analyze the sensitivities for pairs of satellites, each carrying a Ka-band profiling radar. Our simulations show that, with a convoy of two spacecraft separated by similar to 90 s, each with a pointing accuracy of similar to 0.025 degrees in rms error, a sensitivity of 17 dBZ and a precision of 1 dBZ, the proposed observation strategy would capture more than 70% of the tropical convection between 5 and 10 km of altitude and resolve the air-mass and condensed-water fluxes.

Enabling the Extraction of Climate-Scale Temporal Salinity Variations from Aquarius: An Instrument Based Long-Term Radiometer Drift Correction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Calibration; microwave radiometry; vicarious reference	VICARIOUS COLD REFERENCE; SEA-SURFACE SALINITY; MICROWAVE RADIOMETERS; CALIBRATION; MISSION; ORBIT	All channels of the Aquarius radiometer were observed to have calibration instability consisting of a drift in the antenna temperature during the first couple of months of the mission and pseudo-periodic oscillations of the antenna temperature over the mission life. For the version 4 Aquarius processing, both of these anomalies were corrected by removing a time variable bias in the Aquarius measurements relative to a seven-day global average from a salinity model. In order to accurately track long-term variation of salinity on climate scales it is necessary to decouple Aquarius radiometric calibration from ocean salinity models. In this paper, a new technique is used to investigate the nature of anomalies using nonocean vicarious external sources such as Antarctic ice or Amazonian rain forests. Two completely different solutions are developed to correct the pseudo-periodic oscillations as well as the drift of the Aquarius radiometers, decoupling the Aquarius measurements from salinity model.

A Comparative Study of the SMAP Passive Soil Moisture Product With Existing Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Products	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product (L2_SM_P); microwave remote sensing; soil moisture; Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP); Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)	IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS; SURFACE PARAMETERS; INITIAL ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE MODELS; LAND-SURFACE; RESOLUTION; SALINITY; DATABASE; MISSION	The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched on January 31, 2015 to provide global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every 2-3 days using an L-band (active) radar and an L-band (passive) radiometer. The Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product (L2_SM_P) provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36-km Earth-fixed grid using brightness temperature observations from descending passes. This paper provides the first comparison of the validated-release L2_SM_P product with soil moisture products provided by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Aquarius, Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) missions. This comparison was conducted as part of the SMAP calibration and validation efforts. SMAP and SMOS appear most similar among the five soil moisture products considered in this paper, overall exhibiting the smallest unbiased root-mean-square difference and highest correlation. Overall, SMOS tends to be slightly wetter than SMAP, excluding forests where some differences are observed. SMAP and Aquarius can only be compared for a little more than two months; they compare well, especially over low to moderately vegetated areas. SMAP and ASCAT show similar overall trends and spatial patterns with ASCAT providing wetter soil moistures than SMAP over moderate to dense vegetation. SMAP and AMSR2 largely disagree in their soil moisture trends and spatial patterns; AMSR2 exhibits an overall dry bias, while desert areas are observed to be wetter than SMAP.

Joseph			Observed differences of triple-frequency radar signatures between snowflakes in stratiform and convective clouds	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							SCATTERING; SNOWFALL; PRECIPITATION; SPECTRA	Observed triple-frequency signatures of snowflakes are investigated using a coincident dataset of the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) over ocean. A clear difference is noticed in the triple-frequency signatures between stratiform and convective clouds. Analyzing modeled backscattering properties of various snow particles, it is shown that this difference is likely to be a result of prevalent particle modes occurring in stratiform and convective clouds. Namely, snowflakes in stratiform clouds are mainly large unrimed particles (type B), while convective clouds contain abundant considerably aggregated and/or rimed particles(type C). Those very small particles with similarly weak triple-frequency signatures (type A) are less observed in both cloud types. Based on 2-year combined CPR and DPR data, the relation between snowflake types as defined above and air temperature is investigated. Results show that in stratiform clouds, type B particles dominate in warm temperature regions, while type C particles are frequently populated in cold temperature regions. In convective clouds, type B particles take up a large portion at warmer temperature regions, and type C particles are dominant across regions of a broad temperature range. This work demonstrates the potential of triple-frequency radar measurements in improving the understanding of snowflake microphysics and the modeling of snowflake single scattering properties.

Experimental and observational evidence for plume-induced subduction on Venus	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							PLATE-TECTONICS; CORONA FORMATION; ARTEMIS-CHASMA; MANTLE; LITHOSPHERE; CONVECTION; INITIATION; MODEL; DEFORMATION; MECHANISM	Why Venus lacks plate tectonics remains an unanswered question in terrestrial planet evolution. There is observational evidence for subduction-a requirement for plate tectonics-on Venus, but it is unclear why the features have characteristics of both mantle plumes and subduction zones. One explanation is that mantle plumes trigger subduction. Here we compare laboratory experiments of plume-induced subduction in a colloidal solution of nanoparticles to observations of proposed subduction sites on Venus. The experimental fluids are heated from below to produce upwelling plumes, which in turn produce tensile fractures in the lithosphere-like skin that forms on the upper surface. Plume material upwells through the fractures and spreads above the skin, analogous to volcanic flooding, and leads to bending and eventual subduction of the skin along arcuate segments. The segments are analogous to the semi-circular trenches seen at two proposed sites of plume-triggered subduction at Quetzalpetlatl and Artemis coronae. Other experimental deformation structures and subsurface density variations are also consistent with topography, radar and gravity data for Venus. Scaling analysis suggests that this regime with limited, plume-induced subduction is favoured by a hot lithosphere, such as that found on early Earth or present-day Venus.

Confined dense circumstellar material surrounding a regular type II supernova	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							MASSIVE STARS; LIGHT CURVES; PROGENITOR; EMISSION; ENVIRONMENT; EVOLUTION; OUTBURST; SINGLE	With the advent of new wide-field, high-cadence optical transient surveys, our understanding of the diversity of core-collapse supernovae has grown tremendously in the last decade. However, the pre-supernova evolution of massive stars, which sets the physical backdrop to these violent events, is theoretically not well understood and difficult to probe observationally. Here we report the discovery of the supernova iPTF 13dqy = SN 2013fs a mere similar to 3 h after explosion. Our rapid follow-up observations, which include multiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at similar to 6 h post-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate environment (less than or similar to 1015 cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was surrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final similar to 1 yr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10(-3) solar masses per year. The complete disappearance of flash-ionized emission lines within the first several days requires that the dense CSM be confined to within less than or similar to 10(15) cm, consistent with radio non-detections at 70-100 days. The observations indicate that iPTF 13dqy was a regular type II supernova; thus, the finding that the probable red supergiant progenitor of this common explosion ejected material at a highly elevated rate just prior to its demise suggests that pre-supernova instabilities may be common among exploding massive stars.

Evaluating soil moisture retrievals from ESA's SMOS and NASA's SMAP brightness temperature datasets	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMOS; SMAP; Soil moisture; Statistical regression	PASSIVE MICROWAVE MEASUREMENTS; L-BAND; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; NEAR-SURFACE; EMISSION; NETWORK; MODEL; SCALE; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION	Two satellites are currently monitoring surface soil moisture (SM) using L-band observations: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), a joint ESA (European Space Agency), CNES (Centre national d'etudes spatiales), and CDTI (the Spanish government agency with responsibility for space) satellite launched on November 2, 2009 and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite successfully launched in January 2015. In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40 degrees incidence angle, over the 2013-2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against in situ soil moisture measurements from >400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The in situ observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with in situ observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the in situ observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and in situ measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R = 0.51 and R = 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Assessed interfacial strength and elastic moduli of the bonding material from shear-off test data	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							SOLDER JOINT; RELIABILITY; STRESSES; FATIGUE; ARRAY; UBM	A simple and physically meaningful analytical stress model is developed in application to shear-off testing with an objective to evaluate the interfacial shearing stress in the bonding material from the measured shear off force. The model can be used also for the evaluation of the shear modulus of the bonding material, if the interfacial displacement is also measured. The general concept is illustrated by a numerical example. In the authors' opinion, the suggested methodology, based on the concept of the interfacial compliance, suggested by the first author in his 1986 ASME J. Appl. Mech. paper, could become a basis for a new effective experimental method for assessing the interfacial shearing strength and elastic moduli of the bonding material in electronics. The methodology can be used particularly in application to the recently suggested sintered silver bonding materials to evaluate their bonding strength from the measured force-at-failure and shear modulus from the measured shearing force and displacement.

Orbit-spin coupling and the interannual variability of global-scale dust storm occurrence on Mars	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; Mars atmosphere; Orbit-spin coupling; Mars dust storms; Mars dust cycle; Atmospheric interannual variability	MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; OPTICAL DEPTH; CIRCULATION; EVOLUTION; SURVEYOR; IMPACT; MODEL; TIDES	A new physical hypothesis predicts that a weak coupling of the orbital and rotational motions of extended bodies may give rise to a modulation of circulatory flows within their atmospheres. Driven cycles of intensification and relaxation of large-scale circulatory flows are predicted, with the phasing of these changes linked directly to the rate of change of the orbital angular momentum, dL/dt, with respect to inertial frames. We test the hypothesis that global-scale dust storms (GDS) on Mars may occur when periods of circulatory intensification (associated with positive and negative extrema of the dL/dt waveform) coincide with the southern summer dust storm season on Mars. The orbit-spin coupling hypothesis additionally predicts that the intervening 'transitional' periods, which are characterized by the disappearance and subsequent sign change of dL/dt, may be unfavorable for the occurrence of GDS, when they occur during the southern summer dust storm season. These hypotheses are strongly supported by comparisons between calculated dynamical time series of dL/dt and historic observations. All of the nine known global-scale dust storms on Mars took place during Mars years when circulatory intensification during the dust storm season is 'retrodicted' under the orbit-spin coupling hypothesis. None of the historic global-scale dust storms of our catalog occurred during transitional intervals. Orbit-spin coupling appears to play an important role in the excitation of the interannual variability of the atmospheric circulation of Mars.

Pre-discovery observations and observations from the NEOWISE space telescope suggest that the nucleus is large, with a radius of R-N similar to 9 km, assuming an albedo of 0.025. Our photometric data follows the comet from r - 8.9 to 4.8 au as it moved into solar conjunction in 2016 July. Our sublimation model shows that activity began near r - 8.8 au (true anomaly, TA = -139 degrees) in early 2015, driven by CO2 sublimation, which peaked in 2016 April at r - 5.1 au (TA = -127 degrees). Appreciable water sublimation began around r - 5.0 au. Our sublimation model is consistent with an active water sublimation area of 1% of the surface (equivalent to 10.2 km(2)), and an active surface area for CO2 sublimation of 0.029% (0.3 km2). The CO2 production rate at r - 4.66 au as measured by NEOWISE is (8.4 +/- 2) x 10(25) s(-1). If CO2-ice had been present on the surface, dust dragged from the surface by sublimation would have been observed much farther out-as far as 20 au. Our thermal models suggest that the CO2 ice was present at a depth of 0.4 m. The comet came out of solar conjunction in 2016 December. and, unless it brightens significantly, is unlikely to have water production rates much higher than a few x10(28) s(-1).

The Rafita asteroid family	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						celestial mechanics; minor planets, asteroids: general	SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; MASSIVE ASTEROIDS; CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; PHASE-II; BELT; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; ORIGIN	The Rafita asteroid family is an S-type group located in the middle main belt, on the righthand side of the 3J:-1A mean-motion resonance. The proximity of this resonance to the family left-hand side in the semimajor axis caused many former family members to be lost. As a consequence, the family shape in the (a, 1/ D) domain is quite asymmetrical, with a preponderance of objects on the right-hand side of the distribution. The Rafita family is also characterized by a leptokurtic distribution in inclination, which allows the use of methods of family age estimation recently introduced for other leptokurtic families such as Astrid, Hansa, Gallia and Barcelona. In this work, we propose a new method based on the behaviour of an asymmetry coefficient function of the distribution in the (a, 1/ D) plane to date incomplete asteroid families such as Rafita. By monitoring the time behaviour of this coefficient for asteroids simulating the initial conditions at the time of the family formation, we were able to estimate that the Rafita family should have an age of 490 +/- 200 Myr, in good agreement with results from independent methods such as Monte Carlo simulations of Yarkovsky and YORP dynamical induced evolution and the time behaviour of the kurtosis of the sin (i) distribution. Asteroids from the Rafita family can reach orbits similar to 8 per cent of the currently known near-Earth objects. During the final 10 Myr of the simulation, similar or equal to 1 per cent of the simulated objects are present in NEO space, and thus would be comparable to objects in the present-day NEO population.

An Earth-mass Planet in a 1 au Orbit around an Ultracool Dwarf	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						binaries: general; Galaxy: bulge; gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems	BROWN DWARF; GALACTIC BULGE; MICROLENSING EVENTS; SUPER-EARTH; STARS; PHOTOMETRY; DISCOVERY; COMPANION; PARALLAX; NEPTUNE	We combine Spitzer and ground-based Korea Microlensing Telescope Network microlensing observations to identify and precisely measure an Earth-mass (1.43(-0.32)(+0.45)M(circle plus)) planet OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb at 1.16(-0.13)(+0.16) au orbiting a 0.078(-0.012)(+0.016)M(circle dot) ultracool dwarf. This is the lowest-mass microlensing planet to date. At 3.91(-0.46)(+0.42)kpc, it is the third consecutive case among the Spitzer "Galactic distribution" planets toward the Galactic bulge that lies in the Galactic disk as opposed to the bulge itself, hinting at a skewed distribution of planets. Together with previous microlensing discoveries, the seven Earth-size planets orbiting the ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1, and the detection of disks around young brown dwarfs, OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb suggests that such planets might be common around ultracool dwarfs. It therefore sheds light on the formation of both ultracool dwarfs and planetary systems at the limit of low-mass protoplanetary disks.	[Shvartzvald, Y.; Bryden, G.; Henderson, C.

Aerosol optical data retrieved by lidars and sun-photometer measurements, are applied to Saharan dust events observed simultaneously at the two EARLINET/AERONET sites of Barcelona and Granada during the periods ofJune-September of 2012 and 2013. For this purpose, elastic lidar profiles and sun-photometer columnar retrievals are analyzed together with satellite observations and dust forecast models. Granada presents more than twice Saharan dust outbreaks compared to Barcelona. The scenarios favoring the Saharan dust outbreaks are identified in both places. The mineral dust originating in the Sahara region and arriving at both stations is usually transport wither over the Atlas Mountains or through an Atlantic pathway. Analyses of dust events affecting both stations reveal how differences in the transport process lead to differences in the aerosol optical properties measured at each station. Mean dust related Angstrom exponent is 1.8 times higher in Barcelona than in Granada. This difference is a result of the additional contribution of anthropogenic aerosol, mainly in the aerosol fine mode, during the transport of the mineral dust plume over the Iberian Peninsula.

Controlling superstructural ordering in the clathrate-I Ba8M16P30 (M = Cu, Zn) through the formation of metal-metal bonds	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							CATIONIC CLATHRATE; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LATTICE; PHASE	Order-disorder-order phase transitions in the clathrate-I Ba8Cu16P30 were induced and controlled by aliovalent substitutions of Zn into the framework. Unaltered Ba8Cu16P30 crystallizes in an ordered orthorhombic (Pbcn) clathrate-I superstructure that maintains complete segregation of metal and phosphorus atoms over 23 different crystallographic positions in the clathrate framework. The driving force for the formation of this Pbcn superstructure is the avoidance of Cu-Cu bonds. This superstructure is preserved upon aliovalent substitution of Zn for Cu in Ba8Cu16-xZnxP30 with 0 < x < 1.6 (10% Zn/M-total), but vanishes at greater substitution concentrations. Higher Zn concentrations (up to 35% Zn/M-total) resulted in the additional substitution of Zn for P in Ba8M16+yP30 -y (M = Cu, Zn) with 0 <= y <= 1. This causes the formation of Cu-Zn bonds in the framework, leading to a collapse of the orthorhombic superstructure into the more common cubic subcell of clathrate-I (Pm (3) over barn). In the resulting cubic phases, each clathrate framework position is jointly occupied by three different elements: Cu, Zn, and P. Detailed structural characterization of the Ba-Cu-Zn-P clathrates-I via single crystal X-ray diffraction, joint synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffractions, pair distribution function analysis, electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy, along with elemental analysis, indicates that local ordering is present in the cubic clathrate framework, suggesting the evolution of Cu-Zn bonds. For the compounds with the highest Zn content, a disorder-order transformation is detected due to the formation of another superstructure with trigonal symmetry and Cu-Zn bonds in the clathrate-I framework. It is shown that small changes in the composition, synthesis, and crystal structure have significant impacts on the structural and transport properties of Zn-substituted Ba8Cu16P30.

In particular, for the Atacama Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA), this technical advancement allows the combination of two previously defined bands, 2 (67-90 GHz) and 3 (84-116 GHz), into a single ultra-broadband 2+ 3 (67-116 GHz) receiver. With this purpose, we present the design, implementation, and characterization of LNAs suitable for operation in this new ALMA band 2+ 3, and also a different set of LNAs for ALMA band 2.

In the non-blocking state, the electromagnetic wave can pass freely through theMEMSreconfigurable surface, while in the blocking state, the electric field lines of the TE10 mode are short-circuited that blocks the wave propagation through a WM-380 ( WR-1.5) waveguide. A detailed design parameter study is carried out to determine the best combination of the number of horizontal bars and vertical columns of the MEMS-reconfigurable surface for achieving a low insertion loss in the non-blocking state and a high isolation in the blocking state for the 500-750 GHz band. Two different switch concepts relying either on an ohmic-contact or a capacitive-contact between the contact cantilevers have been implemented. Themeasurements of the switch prototypes show a superior RF performance of the capacitive-contact switch. The measured isolation of the capacitivecontact switch designed with an 8 mu m contact overlap is 19-24 dB and the measured insertion loss in the non-blocking state is 2.53 dB from500 to 750 GHz including a 400 mu m long micromachined waveguide section. By measuring reference chips, it is shown that the MEMS-reconfigurable surface contributes only to 0.5-1 dB of the insertion loss, while the rest is attributed to the limited sidewall metal thickness and to the surface roughness of the 400 mu m long micromachined waveguide section. Finally, reliability measurements in an uncontrolled laboratory environment on a comb-drive actuator with an actuation voltage of 28 V showed no degradation in the functioning of the actuator over one hundred million cycles. The actuator was also kept in the actuated state for ten days and showed no sign of failure or deterioration.

The CALPHAD method pioneered by Kaufman has enabled the development of thermodynamic, atomic mobility, and molar volume databases of individual phases in the full space of temperature, composition, and sometimes pressure for technologically important multicomponent engineering materials, along with sophisticated computational tools for using the databases. In this article, our recent efforts will be presented in terms of developing new computational tools for high-throughput modeling and uncertainty quantification based on high-throughput, first-principles calculations and the CALPHAD method along with their potential propagations to downstream ICME modeling and simulations.

Three issues are examined: the uncertainty level in the OS freshwater budget in atmospheric reanalyses, the uncertainty structure and association with the global ocean wet/ dry zones, and the potential of salinity in ascribing the uncertainty in E-P. The products agree on the global mean pattern but differ considerably in magnitude. The OS freshwater budgets are 129 +/- 10 (8%) cmyr(-1) for E, 118 +/- 11 (9%) cmyr(-1) for P, and 11 +/- 4 (36%) cmyr(-1) for E-P, where the mean and error represent the ensemble mean and one standard deviation of the ensemble spread. The E -P uncertainty exceeds the uncertainty in E and P by a factor of 4 or more. The large uncertainty is attributed to P in the tropical wet zone. Most reanalyses tend to produce a wider tropical rainband when compared to satellite products, with the exception of two recent reanalyses that implement an observation-based correction for the model-generated P over land. The disparity in the width and the extent of seasonal migrations of the tropical wet zone causes a large spread in P, implying that the tropical moist physics and the realism of tropical rainfall remain a key challenge. Satellite salinity appears feasible to evaluate the fidelity of E - P variability in three tropical areas, where the uncertainty diagnosis has a global indication.

Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover Megaripple Crossings up to Sol 710 in Gale Crater	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article							DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD; SIMULATIONS	After landing in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover traveled across regolith-covered, rock-strewn plains that transitioned into terrains that have been variably eroded, with valleys partially filled with windblown sands, and intervening plateaus capped by well-cemented sandstones that have been fractured and shaped by wind into outcrops with numerous sharp rock surfaces. Wheel punctures and tears caused by sharp rocks while traversing the plateaus led to directing the rover to traverse in valleys where sands would cushion wheel loads. This required driving across a megaripple (windblown, sand-sized deposit covered by coarser grains) that straddles a narrow gap and several extensive megaripple deposits that accumulated in low portions of valleys. Traverses across megaripple deposits led to mobility difficulties, with sinkage values up to approximately 30% of the 0.50 m wheel diameter, resultant high compaction resistances, and rover-based slip up to 77%. Analysis of imaging and engineering data collected during traverses across megaripples for the first 710 sols (Mars days) of the mission, laboratory-based single-wheel soil experiments, full-scale rover tests at the Dumont Dunes, Mojave Desert, California, and numerical simulations show that a combination of material properties and megaripple geometries explain the high wheel sinkage and slip events. Extensive megaripple deposits have subsequently been avoided and instead traverses have been implemented across terrains covered with regolith or thin windblown sand covers and megaripples separated by bedrock exposures.

However, deconvolving the compositional signal in spectra is complicated by the nonuniqueness of the inverse problem. Trade-offs between mineral abundances and grain sizes in setting reflectance, instrument noise, and systematic errors in the forward model are potential sources of uncertainty, which are often unquantified. Here we adopt a Bayesian implementation of the Hapke model to determine sets of acceptable-fit mineral assemblages, as opposed to single best fit solutions. We quantify errors and uncertainties in mineral abundances and grain sizes that arise from instrument noise, compositional end members, optical constants, and systematic forward model errors for two suites of ternary mixtures (olivine-enstatite-anorthite and olivine-nontronite-basaltic glass) in a series of six experiments in the visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) wavelength range. We show that grain sizes are generally poorly constrained from VSWIR spectroscopy. Abundance and grain size trade-offs lead to typical abundance errors of 1wt % (occasionally up to similar to 5wt %), while similar to 3% noise in the data increases errors by up to similar to 2wt %. Systematic errors further increase inaccuracies by a factor of 4. Finally, phases with low spectral contrast or inaccurate optical constants can further increase errors. Overall, typical errors in abundance are <10%, but sometimes significantly increase for specific mixtures, prone to abundance/grain-size trade-offs that lead to high unmixing uncertainties. These results highlight the need for probabilistic approaches to remote determination of planetary surface composition.	[Lapotre, M. G. A.; Ehlmann, B.

This paper summarizes recommended practices for the design, calibration, and operation of pendulum thrust stands, which are widely recognized as the best approach for measuring micronewton- to millinewton-level thrust and micronewton-per-second-level impulse bits. The fundamentals of pendulum thrust stand operation are reviewed, along with the implementation of hanging pendulum, inverted pendulum, and torsional balance configurations. The methods of calibration and recommendations for calibration processes are presented. Sources of error are identified, and methods for data processing and uncertainty analysis are discussed. This review is intended to be the first step toward a recommended practices document to help the community produce high-quality thrust measurements.

Climate change typologies and audience segmentation among Corn Belt farmers	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						adaptation; audience segmentation; climate change; farmer typology; social networks	PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES; POLICY	Development of natural resource user typologies has been viewed as a potentially effective means of improving the effectiveness of natural resource management engagement strategies. Prior research on Corn Belt farmers' perspectives on climate change employed a latent class analysis (LCA) that created a six-class typology-the Concerned, Uneasy, Uncertain, Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached-to develop a better understanding of farmer perspectives on climate change and inform more effective climate adaptation and mitigation outreach strategies. The LCA employed 34 variables that are generally unobservable- beliefs about climate change, experience with extreme weather, perceived risks of climate change, and attitudes toward climate action-to identify types. The research reported in this paper builds on this typology of Corn Belt farmers by exploring 33 measures of observable farm enterprise characteristics, land management practices, and farmer demographics to assess whether variations in these observable characteristics between the six farmer classes display systematic patterns that might be sufficiently distinctive to guide audience segmentation strategies. While analyses detected some statistically significant differences, there were few systematic, meaningful observable patterns of difference between groups of farmers with differing perspectives on climate change. In other words, farmers who believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring, that it poses risks to agriculture, and that adaptive action should be taken, may look very much like farmers who deny the existence of climate change and do not support action. The overall implication of this finding is that climate change engagement efforts by Extension and other agricultural advisors should use caution when looking to observable characteristics to facilitate audience segmentation. Additional analyses indicated that the farmer types that tended to be more concerned about climate change and supportive of adaptive action (e.g., Concerned and Uneasy) reported that they were more influenced by key private and public sector actors in agricultural social networks. On the other hand, farmers who were not concerned about climate change or supportive of adaptation (e. g., the Unconcerned, Confident, and Detached groups, comprising between one-third and one-half of respondents) were less integrated into agricultural networks. This suggests that Extension and other agricultural advisors should expand outreach efforts to farmers who are not already within their spheres of influence.	[Arbuckle, J. G.; Morton, L.

The pristine interior of comet 67P revealed by the combined Aswan outburst and cliff collapse	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION; SHAPE MODEL; H2O ICE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; SURFACE; OSIRIS; BOULDERS; NUCLEUS; SYSTEM; CAMERA	Outbursts occur commonly on comets(1) with different frequencies and scales(2,3). Despite multiple observations suggesting various triggering processes(4,5), the driving mechanism of such outbursts is still poorly understood. Landslides have been invoked(6) to explain some outbursts on comet 103P/Hartley (2), although the process required a pre-existing dust layer on the verge of failure. The Rosetta mission observed several outbursts from its target comet 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko, which were attributed to dust generated by the crumbling of materials from collapsing cliffs(7,8). However, none of the aforementioned works included definitive evidence that landslides occur on comets. Amongst the many features observed by Rosetta on the nucleus of the comet, one peculiar fracture, 70 m long and 1 m wide, was identified on images obtained in September 2014 at the edge of a cliff named Aswan(9). On 10 July 2015, the Rosetta Navigation Camera captured a large plume of dust that could be traced back to an area encompassing the Aswan escarpment(7). Five days later, the OSIRIS camera observed a fresh, sharp and bright edge on the Aswan cliff. Here we report the first unambiguous link between an outburst and a cliff collapse on a comet. We establish a new dust-plume formation mechanism that does not necessarily require the breakup of pressurized crust or the presence of supervolatile material, as suggested by previous studies(7). Moreover, the collapse revealed the fresh icy interior of the comet, which is characterized by an albedo > 0.4, and provided the opportunity to study how the crumbling wall settled down to form a new talus.

Geomorphological evidence for ground ice on dwarf planet Ceres	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							ROCK GLACIERS; WATER; CREEP; DIFFERENTIATION	Five decades of observations of Ceres suggest that the dwarf planet has a composition similar to carbonaceous meteorites and may have an ice-rich outer shell protected by a silicate layer. NASA's Dawn spacecraft has detected ubiquitous clays, carbonates and other products of aqueous alteration across the surface of Ceres, but surprisingly it has directly observed water ice in only a few areas. Here we use Dawn Framing Camera observations to analyse lobate morphologies on Ceres' surface and we infer the presence of ice in the upper few kilometres of Ceres. We identify three distinct lobate morphologies that we interpret as surface flows: thick tongue-shaped, furrowed flows on steep slopes; thin, spatulate flows on shallow slopes; and cuspate sheeted flows that appear fluidized. The shapes and aspect ratios of these flows are different from those of dry landslides-including those on ice-poor Vesta-but are morphologically similar to ice-rich flows on other bodies, indicating the involvement of ice. Based on the geomorphology and poleward increase in prevalence of these flows, we suggest that the shallow subsurface of Ceres is comprised of mixtures of silicates and ice, and that ice is most abundant near the poles.

Radars are considered the best available technology for observing the spatial distribution of precipitation either from the ground since the 1980s or from space since 1998. This study, for the first time ever, compares and evaluates the only three existing spaceborne precipitation radars, i.e., the Ku-band precipitation radar (PR), the W-band Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), and the Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The three radars are matched up globally and intercompared in the only period which they coexist: 2014-2015. In addition, for the first time ever, TRMM PR and GPM DPR are evaluated against hourly rain gauge data in Mainland China. Results show that DPR and PR agree with each other and correlate very well with gauges in Mainland China. However, both show limited performance in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole. DPR improves light precipitation detectability, when compared with PR, whereas CPR performs best for light precipitation and snowfall. DPR snowfall has the advantage of higher sampling rates than CPR; however, its accuracy needs to be improved further. The future development of spaceborne radars is also discussed in two complementary categories: (1) multifrequency radar instruments on a single platform and (2) constellations of many small cube radar satellites, for improving global precipitation estimation. This comprehensive intercomparison of PR, CPR, and DPR sheds light on spaceborne radar precipitation retrieval and future radar design.

The pelagic habitat analysis module for ecosystem-based fisheries science and management	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Bigeye Tuna; decision support system; ecological modeling; ecosystem-based fisheries management; GIS; satellite remote sensed data; Skipjack Tuna; spatial analysis; thresher shark; Tropical Tuna; Yellowfin Tuna	STOCK ASSESSMENT; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS	We have developed a set of tools that operate within an aquatic geographic information system to improve the accessibility, and usability of remote-sensed satellite and computer-modeled oceanographic data for marine science and ecosystem-based management. The tools form the Pelagic Habitat Analysis Module (PHAM), which can be applied as a modeling platform, an investigative aid in scientific research, or utilized as a decision support system for marine ecological management. Applications include fisheries, marine biology, physical and biological oceanography, and marine spatial management. The GIS provides a home for diverse data types and automated tools for downloading remote sensed and global circulation model data. Within the GIS environment, PHAM provides a framework for seamless interactive four-dimensional visualization, for matching between disparate data types, for flexible statistic or mechanistic model development, and for dynamic application of user developed models for habitat, density, and probability predictions. Here we describe PHAM in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management, and present results from case study projects which guided development. In the first, an analysis of the purse seine fishery for tropical tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean revealed oceanographic drivers of the catch distribution and the influence of climate-driven circulation patterns on the location of fishing grounds. To support management of the Common Thresher Shark (Alopias vulpinus) in the California Current Ecosystem, a simple empirical habitat utilization model was developed and used to dynamically predict the seasonal range expansion of common thresher shark based on oceanographic conditions.

The puzzling detection of x-rays from Pluto by Chandra	ICARUS			English	Article						Pluto, atmosphere; Solar wind; Interplanetary medium; Spectroscopy	SOLAR-WIND; EMISSION; DISCOVERY; ESCAPE; SYSTEM; ATMOSPHERE; ABOARD	Using Chandra ACIS-S, we have obtained low-resolution imaging X-ray spectrophotometry of the Pluto system in support of the New Horizons flyby on 14 July 2015. Observations were obtained in a trial "seed" campaign conducted in one visit on 24 Feb 2014, and a follow-up campaign conducted soon after the New Horizons flyby that consisted of 3 visits spanning 26 Jul to 03 Aug 2015. In a total of 174 ksec of on-target time, in the 0.31 to 0.60 keV passband, we measured 8 total photons in a co-moving 11 x 11 pixel(2) box (the 90% flux aperture determined by observations of fixed background sources in the field) measuring similar to 121,000 x 121,000 km(2) (or similar to 100 x 100 R-pluto) at Pluto. No photons were detected from 0.60 to 1.0 keV in this box during the same exposures. Allowing for background, we find a net signal of 6.8 counts and a statistical noise level of 1.2 counts, for a detection of Pluto in this passband at > 99.95% confidence. The Pluto photons do not have the spectral shape of the background, are coincident with a 90% flux aperture co-moving with Pluto, and are not confused with any background source, so we consider them as sourced from the Pluto system. The mean 0.31- 0.60 keV X-ray power from Pluto is 200 (+200)/-100 MW, in the middle range of X-ray power levels seen for other known Solar System emission sources: auroral precipitation, solar X-ray scattering, and charge exchange (CXE) between solar wind (SW) ions and atmospheric neutrals. We eliminate auroral effects as a source, as Pluto has no known magnetic field and the New Horizons Alice UV spectrometer detected no airglow from Pluto during the flyby. Nano scale atmospheric haze particles could lead to enhanced resonant scattering of solar X-rays from Pluto, but the energy signature of the detected photons does not match the solar spectrum and estimates of Pluto's scattered X-ray emission are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude below the 3.9 +/- 0.7 x 10(-5) cps found in our observations. Charge-exchange-driven emission from hydrogenic and heliogenic SW carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO) ions can produce the energy signature seen, and the 6 x 10(25) neutral gas escape rate from Pluto deduced from New Horizons' data (Gladstone et al. 2016) can support the similar to 3.0 (+3.0)/-1.5 x 10(24) X-ray photon* emission rate required by our observations. Using the solar wind proton density and speed measured by the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument in the vicinity of Pluto at the time of the photon emissions, we find a factor of 40 (+40)/-20 lower SW minor ions flowing planarly into an 11 x 11 pixel(2), 90% flux box centered on Pluto than are needed to support the observed emission rate. Hence, the SW must be somehow significantly focused and enhanced within 60,000 km (projected) of Pluto for this mechanism to work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Lisse, C.

Inflight radiometric calibration of New Horizons' Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC)	ICARUS			English	Article						Image processing; Pluto, surface; Charon		We discuss two semi-independent calibration techniques used to determine the inflight radiometric calibration for the New Horizons' Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC). The first calibration technique compares the measured number of counts (DN) observed from a number of well calibrated stars to those predicted using the component-level calibration. The ratio of these values provides a multiplicative factor that allows a conversation between the preflight calibration to the more accurate inflight one, for each detector. The second calibration technique is a channel-wise relative radiometric calibration for MVIC's blue, near-infrared and methane color channels using Hubble and New Horizons observations of Charon and scaling from the red channel stellar calibration. Both calibration techniques produce very similar results (better than 7% agreement), providing strong validation for the techniques used. Since the stellar calibration described here can be performed without a color target in the field of view and covers all of MVIC's detectors, this calibration was used to provide the radiometric keyword values delivered by the New Horizons project to the Planetary Data System (PDS). These keyword values allow each observation to be converted from counts to physical units; a description of how these keyword values were generated is included. Finally, mitigation techniques adopted for the gain drift observed in the near-infrared detector and one of the panchromatic framing cameras are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Excluding this system, multiple Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) have been observed for only 20 years from Earth, and the KBO size distribution is unconstrained except among the largest objects. Because small KBOs will remain beyond the capabilities of ground-based observatories for the foreseeable future, one of the best ways to constrain the small KBO population is to examine the craters they have made on the Pluto-Charon system. The first step to understanding the crater population is to map it. In this work, we describe the steps undertaken to produce a robust crater database of impact features on Pluto, Charon, and their two largest moons, Nix and Hydra. These include an examination of different types of images and image processing, and we present an analysis of variability among the crater mapping team, where crater diameters were found to average +/- 10% uncertainty across all sizes measured (similar to 0.5-300 km). We also present a few basic analyses of the crater databases, finding that Pluto's craters' differential size-frequency distribution across the encounter hemisphere has a power-law slope of approximately -3.1 +/- 0.1 over diameters D approximate to 15-200 km, and Charon's has a slope of -3.0 +/- 0.2 over diameters D 10-120 km; it is significantly shallower on both bodies at smaller diameters. We also better quantify evidence of resurfacing evidenced by Pluto's craters in contrast with Charon's. With this work, we are also releasing our database of potential and probable impact craters: 5287 on Pluto, 2287 on Charon, 35 on Nix, and 6 on Hydra. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Global albedos of Pluto and Charon from LORRI New Horizons observations	ICARUS			English	Article						Pluto; Charon; Surfaces; New Horizons, LORRI; Kuiper belt	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; VOYAGER PHOTOMETRY; SURFACE; ENCELADUS; GANYMEDE; SPECTRA; IAPETUS; TRITON; BRIGHT; MODEL	The exploration of the Pluto-Charon system by the New Horizons spacecraft represents the first opportunity to understand the distribution of albedo and other photometric properties of the surfaces of objects in the Solar System's "Third Zone" of distant ice-rich bodies. Images of the entire illuminated surface of Pluto and Charon obtained by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) camera provide a global map of Pluto that reveals surface albedo variegations larger than any other Solar System world except for Saturn's moon Iapetus. Normal reflectances on Pluto range from 0.08-1.0, and the low-albedo areas of Pluto are darker than any region of Charon. Charon exhibits a much blander surface with normal reflectances ranging from 0.20-0.73. Pluto's albedo features are well-correlated with geologic features, although some exogenous low-albedo dust may be responsible for features seen to the west of the area informally named Tombaugh Regio. The albedo patterns of both Pluto and Charon are latitudinally organized, with the exception of Tombaugh Regio, with darker regions concentrated at the Pluto's equator and Charon's northern pole. The phase curve of Pluto is similar to that of Triton, the large moon of Neptune believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), while Charon's is similar to that of the Moon. Preliminary Bond albedos are 0.25 +/- 0.03 for Charon and 0.72 +/- 0.07 for Pluto. Maps of an approximation to the Bond albedo for both Pluto and Charon are presented for the first time. Our work shows a connection between very high albedo (near unity) and planetary activity, a result that suggests the KBO Eris may be currently active. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Buratti, B.

Measurements of UV radiation made by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station in combination with atmospheric opacities retrieved from the Mastcam instrument are used for the calculations. Our results indicate that the dust effective radius varies significantly with season, ranging from similar to 0.6 mu m during the low opacity season (L-s=60 degrees-140 degrees) to similar to 2 mu m during the high opacity season (L-s=180 degrees-360 degrees). Our results suggest that Gale Crater is affected by dust events of high aerosol content originated at various distances from it. Our results improve the accuracy of estimations of ultraviolet radiation fluxes at the Martian surface. Moreover, our results have important implications because the lifetime of suspended dust and its ability to nucleate clouds are affected by particle size.

Bed elevation of Jakobshavn Isbr ae, West Greenland, from high-resolution airborne gravity and other data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							OUTLET GLACIERS; ACCELERATION; RETREAT; BENEATH	Jakobshavn Isbr ae, West Greenland, which holds a 0.6 m sea level volume equivalent, has been speeding up and retreating since the late 1990s. Interpretation of its retreat has been hindered by difficulties in measuring its ice thickness with airborne radar depth sounders. Here we employ high-resolution, helicopter-borne gravity data from 2012 to reconstruct its bed elevation within 50 km of the ocean margin using a three-dimensional inversion constrained by fjord bathymetry data offshore and a mass conservation algorithm inland. We find the glacier trough to be asymmetric and several 100 m deeper than estimated previously in the lower part. From 1996 to 2016, the grounding line migrated at 0.6 km/yr from 700 m to 1100 m depth. Upstream, the bed drops to 1600 m over 10 km then slowly climbs to 1200 m depth in 40 km. Jakobshavn Isbr ae will continue to retreat along a retrograde slope for decades to come.

Global observations of 2day wave coupling to the diurnal tide in a high-altitude forecast-assimilation system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						Waves	MIGRATING SOLAR TIDES; LOWER THERMOSPHERE; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; PLANETARY-WAVES; 2-DAY WAVE; MESOSPHERE; VARIABILITY; RESOLUTION; WINDS	We examine wave components in a high-altitude forecast-assimilation system that arise from nonlinear interaction between the diurnal tide and the westward traveling quasi 2day wave. The process yields a westward traveling sum wave with zonal wave number 4 and a period of 16h, and an eastward traveling difference wave with zonal wave number 2 and a period of 2days. While the eastward 2day wave has been reported in satellite temperatures, the westward 16h wave lies outside the Nyquist limits of resolution of twice daily local time satellite sampling. Hourly output from a high-altitude forecast-assimilation model is used to diagnose the nonlinear quadriad. A steady state primitive equation model forced by tide-2day wave advection is used to intepret the nonlinear wave products. The westward 16h wave maximizes in the midlatitude winter mesosphere and behaves like an inertia-gravity wave. The nonlinearly generated component of the eastward 2day wave maximizes at high latitudes in the lower thermosphere, and only weakly penetrates to low latitudes. The 16h and the eastward 2day waves are of comparable amplitude and alias to the same apparent frequency when viewed from a satellite perspective.	[Lieberman, R. S.; Riggin, D.

Using large eddy simulations to reveal the size, strength, and phase of updraft and downdraft cores of an Arctic mixed-phase stratocumulus cloud	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						Arctic; mixed-phase clouds; LES; subgrid-scale turbulence; stratocumulus	COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; PART I; TURBULENCE; SHEBA; ICE; PARAMETERIZATION; PRECIPITATION; FORMULATION; INVERSION; HUMIDITY	Three-dimensional large eddy simulations (LES) are used to analyze a springtime Arctic mixed-phase stratocumulus observed on 26 April 2008 during the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign. Two subgrid-scale turbulence parameterizations are compared. The first scheme is a 1.5-order turbulent kinetic energy (1.5-TKE) parameterization that has been previously applied to boundary layer cloud simulations. The second scheme, Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (CLUBB), provides higher-order turbulent closure with scale awareness. The simulations, in comparisons with observations, show that both schemes produce the liquid profiles within measurement variability but underpredict ice water mass and overpredict ice number concentration. The simulation using CLUBB underpredicted liquid water path more than the simulation using the 1.5-TKE scheme, so the turbulent length scale and horizontal grid box size were increased to increase liquid water path and reduce dissipative energy. The LES simulations show this stratocumulus cloud to maintain a closed cellular structure, similar to observations. The updraft and downdraft cores self-organize into a larger meso--scale convective pattern with the 1.5-TKE scheme, but the cores remain more isotropic with the CLUBB scheme. Additionally, the cores are often composed of liquid and ice instead of exclusively containing one or the other. These results provide insight into traditionally unresolved and unmeasurable aspects of an Arctic mixed-phase cloud. From analysis, this cloud's updraft and downdraft cores appear smaller than other closed-cell stratocumulus such as midlatitude stratocumulus and Arctic autumnal mixed-phase stratocumulus due to the weaker downdrafts and lower precipitation rates. Plain Language Summary Low-lying clouds in the Arctic are ubiquitous and important to understand for the near-surface energy balance. These clouds are difficult to measure because of the challenging environment in which they reside. High-resolution models are tools that help fill in knowledge gaps about these clouds. In this work, we compare two different ways to represent fine motion within the cloud and see how the macrophysical properties of the cloud are affected. We found that one representation creates a more energetic cloud, and this type of cloud would exist longer than the other. We also are led to believe in these simulations that these clouds have different internal motions when compared to similar-looking clouds formed at lower latitudes or formed in a different season in the Arctic.

A modeling study of secondary organic aerosol formation from sesquiterpenes using the STOCHEM global chemistry and transport model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						biogenic emissions; sesquiterpenes; secondary organic aerosol; STOCHEM-CRI model; preindustrial scenario	INTERMEDIATES CRI MECHANISM; PURE COMPONENT PROPERTIES; BETA-CARYOPHYLLENE; SOA FORMATION; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; PART 3; GAS; PRODUCTS; PHOTOOXIDATION; EMISSIONS	Sesquiterpenes are one of the precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) which can be an important global sources of organic aerosol (OA). Updating the chemistry scheme in the global chemistry transport model by incorporating an oxidation mechanism for -caryophyllene (representing all sesquiterpenes), adding global sesquiterpene emissions of 29Tg/yr, and revising global monoterpene emissions up to 162Tg/yr [Guenther et al., 2012] led to an increase of SOA burden by 95% and SOA production rate by 106% relative to the base case described in Utembe et al. [2011]. Including the emissions of sesquiterpenes resulted in increase of SOA burden of 0.11Tg and SOA production rate of 12.9Tg/yr relative to the base case. The highest concentrations of sesquiterpene-derived SOA (by up to 1.2g/m(3)) were found over central Africa and South America, the regions having high levels of biogenic emissions with significant biomass burning. In the updated model simulation, the multigeneration oxidation products from sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes transported above the boundary layer and condensed to the aerosol phase at higher altitude led to an increase of OA by up to 30% over the tropics and northern midlatitude to higher altitude. The model evaluation showed an underestimation of model OA mostly for the campaigns dominated by regional anthropogenic pollution. The increase of SOA production from sesquiterpenes reduced the discrepancies between modeled and observed OA concentrations over the remote and rural areas. The increase of SOA concentrations by up to 200% from preindustrial to present scenarios was found over the tropical oceans.	[Khan, M. A. H.; Jenkin, M. E.; Foulds, A.; Shallcross, D.

We compare these new products to aircraft profiles and remote surface flask measurements and find that the seasonal and year-to-year variations in the new partial column mixing ratios significantly improve upon the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) and GOSAT (ACOS-GOSAT) initial guess and/or a priori, with distinct patterns in the LMT and U seasonal cycles that match validation data. For land monthly averages, we find errors of 1.9, 0.7, and 0.8 ppm for retrieved GOSAT LMT, U, and X CO2; for ocean monthly averages, we find errors of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.5 ppm for retrieved GOSAT LMT, U, and X CO2. In the southern hemispheric biomass burning season, the new partial columns show similar patterns to MODIS fire maps and MOPITT multispectral CO for both vertical levels, despite a flat ACOS-GOSAT prior, and a CO-CO2 emission factor comparable to published values. The difference of LMT and U, useful for evaluation of model transport error, has also been validated with a monthly average error of 0.8 (1.4) ppm for ocean (land). LMT is more locally influenced than U, meaning that local fluxes can now be better separated from CO2 transported from far away.

Tuneable superradiant thermal emitter assembly	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							COUPLED-MODE THEORY; PHOTONIC CRYSTALS; RADIATION; EMISSION; RESONANCE; LIGHT; BAND	Superradiance is a signature effect in quantum photonics that explains the collective enhancement of emission power by a factor of N-2 when N emitters are placed in subwavelength proximity. Although the effect is inherently transient, successful attempts have been made to sustain it in the steady-state regime. Until recently, the effects of superradiance were not considered to be applicable to thermal emitters due to their intrinsic incoherent nature. Novel nanophotonic thermal emitters display favorable coherent characteristics that enable them to obey principles of superradiance. However, published analytical work on conventional superradiant thermal emitter assemblies shows an anomalous power scaling of 1/N, and therefore increasing the number of thermal emitters leads to a degeneration of power at resonance. This phenomenon immediately renders the effect of thermal superradiance futile since it cannot outperform noncoupled emitters in the steady-state regime. We propose an alternative assembly of thermal emitters with specific features that improves the power scaling while maintaining the effects of superradiance. In essence, we show that our emitter assembly achieves superior power delivery over conventional noncoupled emitter systems at resonance. Additionally, this assembly has the ability to be tuned to operate at specific resonant frequencies, which is a vital requirement for applications such as photothermal cancer therapy.

Currently, there are four MIPAS ozone data products, including the operational Level-2 ozone product processed at ESA, with the scientific prototype processor being operated at IFAC Florence, and three independent research products developed by the Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara (ISAC-CNR)/ University of Bologna, Oxford University, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology-Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research/Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (KIT-IMK/IAA). Here we present a dataset of ozone vertical profiles obtained by merging ozone retrievals from four independent Level-2 MIPAS processors. We also discuss the advantages and the shortcomings of this merged product. As the four processors retrieve ozone in different parts of the spectra (microwindows), the source measurements can be considered as nearly independent with respect to measurement noise. Hence, the information content of the merged product is greater and the precision is better than those of any parent (source) dataset. The merging is performed on a profile per profile basis. Parent ozone profiles are weighted based on the corresponding error covariance matrices; the error correlations between different profile levels are taken into account. The intercorrelations between the processors' errors are evaluated statistically and are used in the merging. The height range of the merged product is 20-55 km, and error covariance matrices are provided as diagnostics. Validation of the merged dataset is performed by comparison with ozone profiles from ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder). Even though the merging is not supposed to remove the biases of the parent datasets, around the ozone volume mixing ratio peak the merged product is found to have a smaller (up to 0.1 ppmv) bias with respect to ACE-FTS than any of the parent datasets. The bias with respect to MLS is of the order of 0.15 ppmv at 20-30 km height and up to 0.45 ppmv at larger altitudes. The agreement between the merged data MIPAS dataset with ACE-FTS is better than that with MLS. This is, however, the case for all parent processors as well.

Real-Time Detection of Tsunami Ionospheric Disturbances with a Stand-Alone GNSS Receiver: A Preliminary Feasibility Demonstration	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INTERNAL GRAVITY-WAVES; TOTAL ELECTRON-CONTENT; GPS MEASUREMENTS; EARTHQUAKE; ENVIRONMENT; SEISMOLOGY; RUNUP	It is well known that tsunamis can produce gravity waves that propagate up to the ionosphere generating disturbed electron densities in the E and F regions. These ionospheric disturbances can be studied in detail using ionospheric total electron content (TEC) measurements collected by continuously operating ground-based receivers from the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Here, we present results using a new approach, named VARION (Variometric Approach for Real-Time Ionosphere Observation), and estimate slant TEC (sTEC) variations in a real-time scenario. Using the VARION algorithm we compute TEC variations at 56 GPS receivers in Hawaii as induced by the 2012 Haida Gwaii tsunami event. We observe TEC perturbations with amplitudes of up to 0.25 TEC units and traveling ionospheric perturbations (TIDs) moving away from the earthquake epicenter at an approximate speed of 316 m/s. We perform a wavelet analysis to analyze localized variations of power in the TEC time series and we find perturbation periods consistent with a tsunami typical deep ocean period. Finally, we present comparisons with the real-time tsunami MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) model produced by the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research and we observe variations in TEC that correlate in time and space with the tsunami waves.

Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching "atlantification" of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.

Often detected at z > 2, they usually display high X-and gamma-ray luminosities, larger-than-average jet powers, and black hole masses greater than or similar to 10(9)M(circle dot) In the present work, we perform a multiwavelength study of three high-redshift blazars: 3FGL J0325.5+2223 (z = 2.06), 3FGL J0449.0+1121 (z = 2.15), and 3FGL J0453.2-2808 (z = 2.56), analyzing quasi-simultaneous data from GROND, Swift-UVOT and XRT, Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and Fermi-LAT. Our main focus is on the hard X-ray band recently unveiled by NuSTAR (3-79 keV) where these objects show a hard spectrum that enables us to constrain the inverse Compton (IC) peak and the jet power. We found that all three targets resemble the most powerful blazars, with the synchrotron peak located in the submillimeter range and the IC peak in the MeV range, and therefore belong to the MeV blazar class. Using a simple one-zone leptonic emission model to reproduce the spectral energy distributions, we conclude that a simple combination of synchrotron and accretion disk emission reproduces the infrared-optical spectra, while the X-ray to gamma-ray part is well reproduced by the IC scattering of low-energy photons supplied by the broad-line region. The black hole masses for each of the three sources are calculated to be greater than or similar to 4 x 10(8) M-circle dot. The three studied sources have jet power at the level of, or beyond, the accretion luminosity.	[Marcotulli, L.; Paliya, V. S.; Ajello, M.; Kaur, A.; Hartmann, D.

These observations are used to determine the physical conditions of the line-emitting gas, which we use to study the transition from atomic to molecular gas and from C+ to C-0 to CO in their low-metallicity environments. We trace gas with molecular fractions in the range 0.1 < f(H-2) < 1, between those in the diffuse H-2 gas detected by UV absorption (f(H-2) < 0.2) and well-shielded regions in which hydrogen is essentially completely molecular. The C-0 and CO column densities are only measurable in regions with molecular fractions f(H-2) > 0.45 in both the LMC and the. SMC. Ionized carbon is the dominant gas-phase form of this element that is associated with molecular gas, with C-0 and CO representing a small fraction, implying that most (89% in the LMC and 77% in the SMC) of the molecular gas in our sample is CO-dark H-2. The mean X-CO conversion factors in our LMC and SMC sample are larger than the value typically found in the Milky Way. When applying a correction based on the filling factor of the CO emission, we find that the values of X-CO in the LMC and SMC are closer to that in the Milky Way. The observed [C II] intensity in our sample represents about 1% of the total far-infrared intensity from the lines of sight. observed in both Magellanic clouds.

Extreme Variability in a Broad Absorption Line Quasar	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; quasars: individual (CRTS J084133.15+200525.8)	BLACK-HOLE BINARY; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; C IV; MIDINFRARED SELECTION; TIME VARIABILITY; SI IV; SKY; SDSS; EMISSION; GALAXIES	CRTS. J084133.15+200525.8 is an optically bright quasar at z = 2.345 that has shown extreme spectral variability over the past decade. Photometrically, the source had a visual magnitude of V similar to 17.3 between 2002 and 2008. Then, over the following five years, the source slowly brightened by approximately one magnitude, to V similar to 16.2. Only similar to 1 in 10,000 quasars show such extreme variability, as quantified by the extreme parameters derived for this quasar assuming a damped random walk model. A combination of archival and newly acquired spectra reveal the source to be an iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasar with extreme changes in its absorption spectrum. Some absorption features completely disappear over the 9 years of optical spectra, while other features remain essentially unchanged. We report the first definitive redshift for this source, based on the detection of broad Ha in a Keck/MOSFIRE spectrum. Absorption systems separated by several 1000 km s(-1) in velocity show coordinated weakening in the depths of their troughs as the continuum flux increases. We interpret the broad absorption line variability to be due to changes in photoionization, rather than due to motion of material along our line of sight. This source highlights one sort of rare transition object that astronomy will now be finding through dedicated time-domain surveys.

The Broadband Spectral Variability of Holmberg IX X-1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						black hole physics; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual (Holmberg IX X-1)	X-RAY SOURCE; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; MASS BLACK-HOLES; NGC 1313 X-1; ULTRALUMINOUS STATE; ACCRETION DISKS; NUSTAR; CALIBRATION; ABSORPTION	We present results from four new broadband X-ray observations of the extreme ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1 (L-X > 10(40) erg s(-1)), performed by Suzaku and NuSTAR in coordination. Combined with the archival data, we now have broadband observations of this remarkable source from six separate epochs. Two of these new observations probe lower fluxes than seen previously, allowing us to extend our knowledge of the broadband spectral variability exhibited. The spectra are well fit by two thermal blackbody components that. dominate the emission below 10 keV, as well as a steep ( Gamma similar to 3.5) power-law tail that. dominates above similar to 15 keV. Remarkably, while the 0.3-10.0 keV flux varies by a factor of similar to 3 between all these epochs, the 15-40 keV flux varies by only similar to 20%. Although the spectral variability is strongest in the similar to 1-10 keV band, both of the thermal components are required to vary when all epochs are considered. We also revisit the search for iron absorption features by. leveraging the high-energy NuSTAR data to improve our sensitivity to extreme velocity outflows in light of the ultra-fast outflow recently detected in NGC 1313 X-1. Iron absorption from a similar outflow along our line of sight can be ruled out in this case. We discuss these results in the context of super-Eddington accretion models that invoke a funnel-like geometry for the inner flow, and propose a scenario in which we have an almost face-on view of a funnel that expands to larger radii with increasing flux, resulting in an increasing degree of geometrical collimation for the emission from intermediate-temperature regions.

Living on a Flare: Relativistic Reflection in V404 Cyg Observed by NuSTAR during Its Summer 2015 Outburst	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						black hole physics; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual (V404 Cyg)	BLACK-HOLE SPIN; X-RAY BINARIES; MICROQUASAR XTE J1550-564; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; ACCRETION-DISK; GRS 1915+105; RADIO-EMISSION; GS 2023+338	We present first results from a series of NuSTAR observations of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg obtained during its summer 2015 outburst, primarily focusing on observations during the height of this outburst activity. The NuSTAR data show extreme variability in both the flux and spectral properties of the source. This is partly driven by strong and variable line-of-sight absorption, similar to previous outbursts. The latter stages of this observation are dominated by strong flares, reaching luminosities close to Eddington. During these flares, the central source appears to be relatively unobscured and the data show clear evidence for a strong contribution from relativistic reflection, providing a means to probe the geometry of the innermost accretion flow. Based on the flare properties, analogies with other Galactic black hole binaries, and also the simultaneous onset of radio activity, we argue that this intense X-ray flaring is related to transient jet activity during which the ejected plasma is the primary source of illumination for the accretion disk. If this is the case, then our reflection modeling implies that these jets are launched in close proximity to the black hole (as close as a few gravitational radii), consistent with expectations for jet launching models that tap either the spin of the central black hole, or the very innermost accretion disk. Our analysis also allows us to place the first constraints on the black hole spin for this source, which we find to be a* > 0.92 (99% statistical uncertainty, based on an idealized lamp-post geometry).

Intercomparability of X-CO2 and X-CH4 from the United States TCCON sites	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							INSTRUMENTAL LINE-SHAPE; ACOS-GOSAT; CO2; CALIBRATION; CH4; RETRIEVAL; SPECTROMETERS; SPECTRA	The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) has become the standard for long-term columnaveraged measurements of CO2 and CH4. Here, we use a pair of portable spectrometers to test for intra-network bias among the four currently operating TCCON sites in the United States (US). A previous analytical error analysis has suggested that the maximum 2 sigma site-to-site relative (absolute) bias of TCCON should be less than 0.2% (0.8 ppm) in X-CO2 and 0.4% (7 ppb) in X-CH4. We find here experimentally that the 95% confidence intervals for maximum pairwise site-to-site bias among the four US TCCON sites are 0.05-0.14% for X-CO2 and 0.08-0.24% for X-CH4. This is close to the limit of the bias we can detect using this methodology.

Separating decadal global water cycle variability from sea level rise	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							OCEAN SALINITIES; TRENDS; INTENSIFICATION; OSCILLATION; AUSTRALIA; RAINFALL; INSIGHTS	Under a warming climate, amplification of the water cycle and changes in precipitation patterns over land are expected to occur, subsequently impacting the terrestrial water balance. On global scales, such changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) will be reflected in the water contained in the ocean and can manifest as global sea level variations. Naturally occurring climate-driven TWS variability can temporarily obscure the long-term trend in sea level rise, in addition to modulating the impacts of sea level rise through natural periodic undulation in regional and global sea level. The internal variability of the global water cycle, therefore, confounds both the detection and attribution of sea level rise. Here, we use a suite of observations to quantify and map the contribution of TWS variability to sea level variability on decadal timescales. In particular, we find that decadal sea level variability centered in the Pacific Ocean is closely tied to low frequency variability of TWS in key areas across the globe. The unambiguous identification and clean separation of this component of variability is the missing step in uncovering the anthropogenic trend in sea level and understanding the potential for low-frequency modulation of future TWS impacts including flooding and drought.

Active Cryovolcanism on Europa?	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						planets and satellites: general	SUBSURFACE OCEAN; WATER VOLCANISM; PLUME; ORIGIN	Evidence for plumes of water on Europa has previously been found using the Hubble Space Telescope using two different observing techniques. Roth et al. found line emission from the dissociation products of water. Sparks et al. found evidence for off-limb continuum absorption as Europa transited Jupiter. Here, we present a new transit observation of Europa that shows a second event at the same location as a previous plume candidate from Sparks et al., raising the possibility of a consistently active source of erupting material on Europa. This conclusion is bolstered by comparison with a nighttime thermal image from the Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer that shows a thermal anomaly at the same location, within the uncertainties. The anomaly has the highest observed brightness temperature on the Europa nightside. If heat flow from a subsurface liquid water reservoir causes the thermal anomaly, its depth is approximate to 1.8-2 km, under simple modeling assumptions, consistent with scenarios in which a liquid water reservoir has formed within a thick ice shell. Models that favor thin regions within the ice shell that connect directly to the ocean, however, cannot be excluded, nor modifications to surface thermal inertia by subsurface activity. Alternatively, vapor deposition surrounding an active vent could increase the thermal inertia of the surface and cause the thermal anomaly. This candidate plume region may offer a promising location for an initial characterization of Europa's internal water and ice and for seeking evidence of Europa's habitability.	[Sparks, W.

In the first year, using Spitzer/IRAC, we searched 190 nearby galaxies with cadence baselines of one month and six months. We discovered over 1958 variables and 43 transients. Here, we describe the survey design and highlight 14 unusual infrared transients with no optical counterparts to deep limits, which we refer to as SPRITEs (eSPecially Red Intermediate-luminosity Transient Events). SPRITEs are in the infrared luminosity gap between novae and supernovae, with [4.5] absolute magnitudes between -11 and -14 (Vega-mag) and [3.6]-[4.5] colors between 0.3 mag and 1.6 mag. The photometric evolution of SPRITEs is diverse, ranging from < 0.1 mag yr(-1) to > 7 mag yr(-1). SPRITEs occur in star-forming galaxies. We present an indepth study of one of them, SPIRITS 14ajc in Messier 83, which shows shock-excited molecular hydrogen emission. This shock may have been triggered by the dynamic decay of a non-hierarchical system of massive stars that led to either the formation of a binary or a protostellar merger.

Development and assessment of a higher-spatial-resolution (4.4 km) MISR aerosol optical depth product using AERONET-DRAGON data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER MISR; MODIS; RETRIEVALS; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; LAND	Since early 2000, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite has been acquiring data that have been used to produce aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particle property retrievals at 17.6 km spatial resolution. Capitalizing on the capabilities provided by multi-angle viewing, the current operational (Version 22) MISR algorithm performs well, with about 75% of MISR AOD retrievals globally falling within 0.05 or 20% x AOD of paired validation data from the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This paper describes the development and assessment of a prototype version of a higher-spatial-resolution 4.4 km MISR aerosol optical depth product compared against multiple AERONET Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observations Network (DRAGON) deployments around the globe. In comparisons with AERONET-DRAGON AODs, the 4.4 km resolution retrievals show improved correlation (r = 0.9595), smaller RMSE (0.0768), reduced bias (-0.0208), and a larger fraction within the expected error envelope (80.92 %) relative to the Version 22 MISR retrievals.

A significant decline in this resource has a direct connection to streamflow, with substantial economic and societal impacts. Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 10-20% loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the region's snowpack. Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone. A further loss of up to 60% is projected within the next 30 years. Uncertainties in loss estimates depend on the size and the rate of response to continued anthropogenic forcing and the magnitude and phasing of internal decadal variability. The projected losses have serious implications for the hydropower, municipal and agricultural sectors in the region.

A large airborne survey of Earth's visible-infrared spectral dimensionality	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY	The intrinsic spectral dimensionality indicates the observable degrees of freedom in Earth's solar-reflected light field, quantifying the diversity of spectral content accessible by visible and infrared remote sensing. The solar-reflected regime spans the 0.38-2.5 mu m interval, and is captured by a wide range of current and planned instruments on both airborne and orbital platforms. To date there has been no systematic study of its spectral dimensionality as a function of space, time, and land cover. Here we report a multi-site, multi-year statistical survey by NASA's "Classic" Airborne Visible Near InfraRed Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C). AVIRIS-C measured large regions of California, USA, spanning wide latitudinal and elevation gradients containing all canonical MODIS land cover types. The spectral uniformity of the AVIRIS-C design enabled consistent in-scene assessment of measurement noise across acquisitions. The estimated dimensionality as a function of cover type ranged from the low 20s to the high 40s, and was approximately 50 for the combined dataset. This result indicates the high diversity of physical processes distinguishable by imaging spectrometers like AVIRIS-C for one region of the Earth.

The galaxy shear measurement uses data from the CFHTLenS survey, and the microwave background shear measurement uses data from the Planck satellite. The ratio of shears from these cross-correlations provides a purely geometric distance measurement across the longest possible cosmological lever arm. This is because the matter distribution around the halos, including uncertainties in galaxy bias and systematic errors such as miscentering, cancels in the ratio for halos in thin redshift slices. We measure this distance ratio in three different redshift slices of the constant mass (CMASS) sample and combine them to obtain a 17% measurement of the distance ratio, r = 0.390(-0.062)(+0.070), at an effective redshift of z = 0.53. This is consistent with the predicted ratio from the Planck best-fit cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant cosmology of r = 0.419.

Aseismic slip and seismogenic coupling in the Marmara Sea: What can we learn from onland geodesy?

A strong controversy remains over whether Marmara fault segments are locked or are releasing strain aseismically. Using a Bayesian approach, we propose a preliminary probabilistic interseismic model constrained by published GPS data sets. The posterior mean model show that Ganos and Cinarcik segments are locked while creep is detected in the central portion of Marmara fault. Our analysis, however, reveals that creeping segments are associated with large model uncertainties, which mainly results from the sparsity of current geodetic observations. We then discuss how the GPS network can be improved to attain more reliable assessment of interseismic slip rates. With this purpose, we implement a network optimization procedure to identify the most favorable distribution of stations measuring strain accumulation in the Marmara Sea.

We show how the scaling of precipitation extremes is highly sensitive to spatial and temporal averaging: while instantaneous grid point extreme precipitation scales more strongly than the percentage increase (approximate to 7%K-1) predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship, extremes for zonally and temporally averaged precipitation follow a slight sub-CC scaling, in agreement with results from Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models. The scaling depends crucially on the employed convection parameterization. This is particularly true when grid point instantaneous extremes are considered. These results highlight how understanding the response of precipitation extremes to warming requires consideration of dynamic changes in addition to the thermodynamic response. Changes in grid-scale precipitation, unlike those in convective-scale precipitation, scale linearly with the resolved flow. Hence, dynamic changes include changes in both large-scale and convective-scale motions.

This study evaluates a nested LES method that uses the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and, specifically, tests whether the nested LES approach is useful for studying deep convection during a real-world case. The method was applied on 2 September 2013, a day of continental convection that occurred during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS) campaign. Mesoscale WRF output (1.35km grid length) was used to drive a nested LES with 450m grid spacing, which then drove a 150m domain. Results reveal that the 450m nested LES reasonably simulates observed reflectivity distributions and aircraft-observed in-cloud vertical velocities during the study period. However, when examining convective updrafts, reducing the grid spacing to 150m worsened results. We find that the simulated updrafts in the 150m run become too diluted by entrainment, thereby generating updrafts that are weaker than observed. Lastly, the 450m simulation is combined with observations to study the processes forcing strong midlevel cloud/updraft edge downdrafts that were observed on 2 September. Results suggest that these strong downdrafts are forced by evaporative cooling due to mixing and by perturbation pressure forces acting to restore mass continuity around neighboring updrafts. We conclude that the WRF nested LES approach, with further development and evaluation, could potentially provide an effective method for studying deep convection in real-world cases.
