Yarkovsky effect detection and updated impact hazard assessment for near-Earth asteroid (410777) 2009 FD	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: general; celestial mechanics; astrometry		Aims. Near-Earth asteroid (410777) 2009 FD is a potentially hazardous asteroid with possible (though unlikely) impacts on Earth at the end of the twenty-second century. The astrometry collected during the 2019 apparition provides information on the trajectory of (410777) by constraining the Yarkovsky effect, which is the main source of uncertainty for future predictions, and improving the impact hazard assessment. Methods. We included the Yarkovsky effect in the force model and estimated its magnitude from the fit to the optical and radar astrometric data of (410777). We performed the hazard assessment for (410777) over 200 years using two independent approaches: the NEODyS group adopted a generalisation of the Line Of Variations method in a seven-dimensional space, and the JPL team used the Multi-Layer Clustered Sampling technique. Results. We obtain a 4 sigma detection of the Yarkovsky effect acting on (410777), which corresponds to a semimajor axis drift of (3.8 +/- 0.9) x 10(-3) au Myr(-1). In the hazard results of both teams, the main impact possibility in 2185 is ruled out and the only remaining one is in 2190, but with a probability lower than 10(-8).

Physical model of near-Earth asteroid (1917) Cuyo from ground-based optical and thermal-IR observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: Cuyo; methods: observational; radiation mechanisms: thermal; techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic; methods: data analysis	PHOTOMETRIC-OBSERVATIONS; LIGHTCURVE INVERSION; OPTIMIZATION METHODS; ROTATIONAL BREAKUP; SPIN-UP; YARKOVSKY; SPECTROSCOPY; SPECTROGRAPH; DISRUPTION; RESOLUTION	Context. The near-Earth asteroid (1917) Cuyo was subject to radar and light curve observations during a close approach in 1989, and observed up until 2008. It was selected as one of our ESO Large Programme targets, aimed at observational detections of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect through long-term light curve monitoring and physical modelling of near Earth asteroids. Aims. We aim to constrain the physical properties of Cuyo: shape, spin-state, and spectroscopic and thermo-physical properties of the surface. Methods. We acquired photometric light curves of Cuyo spanning the period between 2010 and 2013, which we combined with published light curves from 1989 to 2008. Our thermal-infrared observations were obtained in 2011. Rotationally resolved optical spectroscopy data were acquired in 2011 and combined with all available published spectra to investigate any surface material variegation. Results. We developed a convex light curve-inversion shape of Cuyo that suggests the presence of an equatorial ridge, typical for an evolved system close to shedding mass due to fast rotation. We determine limits of YORP strength through light curve based spin-state modelling, including both negative and positive acceleration values, between -0.7 x 10(-8) and 1.7 x 10(-8) rad day(-2). Thermo-physical modelling with the ATPM provides constraints on the geometric albedo, p(V) = 0.24 +/- 0.07, the effective diameter, D-eff = 3.15 +/- 0.081cm, the thermal inertia, = 44 +/- 9 +/- J m(-2) s(-1/2) K-1, and a roughness fraction of 0.52 +/- 0.26. This enabled a YORP strength prediction of v = (-6.39 +/- 0.96) x 10(-10) rad day(-2). We also see evidence of surface compositional variation. Conclusions. The low value of YORP predicted by means of thermo-physical analysis, consistent with the results of the light curve study, might be due to the self-limiting properties of rotational YORP, possibly involving movement of sub-surface and surface material. This may also be consistent with the surface compositional variation that we see. The physical model of Cuyo can be used to investigate cohesive forces as a way to explain why some targets survive rotation rates faster than the fission limit.	[Rozek, A.; Lowry, S. C.; Duddy, S.

Correct characterization of intensive aerosol optical properties, particularly in conditions where absorbing aerosol is present, is a crucial factor in quantifying these effects. The southeast Atlantic Ocean (SEA), with seasonal biomass burning smoke plumes overlying and mixing with a persistent stratocumulus cloud deck, offers an excellent natural laboratory to make the observations necessary to understand the complexities of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. The first field deployment of the NASA ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) campaign was conducted in September of 2016 out of Walvis Bay, Namibia. Data collected during ORACLES-2016 are used to derive aerosol properties from an unprecedented number of simultaneous measurement techniques over this region. Here, we present results from six of the eight independent instruments or instrument combinations, all applied to measure or retrieve aerosol absorption and single-scattering albedo. Most but not all of the biomass burning aerosol was located in the free troposphere, in relative humidities typically ranging up to 60 %. We present the single-scattering albedo (SSA), absorbing and total aerosol optical depth (AAOD and AOD), and absorption, scattering, and extinction Angstrom exponents (AAE, SAE, and EAE, respectively) for specific case studies looking at near-coincident and near-colocated measurements from multiple instruments, and SSAs for the broader campaign average over the month-long deployment. For the case studies, we find that SSA agrees within the measurement uncertainties between multiple instruments, though, over all cases, there is no strong correlation between values reported by one instrument and another. We also find that agreement between the instruments is more robust at higher aerosol loading (AOD(400) > 0.4). The campaign-wide average and range shows differences in the values measured by each instrument. We find the ORACLES-2016 campaign-average SSA at 500 nm (SSA(500)) to be between 0.85 and 0.88, depending on the instrument considered (4STAR, AirMSPI, or in situ measurements), with the interquartile ranges for all instruments between 0.83 and 0.89. This is consistent with previous September values reported over the region (between 0.84 and 0.90 for SSA at 550nm). The results suggest that the differences observed in the campaign-average values may be dominated by instrument-specific spatial sampling differences and the natural physical variability in aerosol conditions over the SEA, rather than fundamental methodological differences.

The Fukang pallasite: Characterization and implications for the history of the Main-group parent body	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article							COOLING RATES; MONOCLINIC TRIDYMITE; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SHOCK METAMORPHISM; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; OLIVINE; METEORITES; IRON; MINERALOGY; GEOCHEMISTRY	We report the results of a study of the Fukang pallasite that includes measurements of bulk composition, mineral chemistry, mineral structure, and petrology. Fukang is a Main-group pallasite that consists of semiangular olivine grains (Fo 86.3) embedded in an Fe-Ni matrix with 9-10 wt% Ni and low-Ir (45 ppb). Olivine grains sometimes occur in large clusters up to 11 cm across. The Fe-Ni phase is primarily kamacite with accessory taenite and plessite. Minor phases include schreibersite, chromite, merrillite, troilite, and low-Ca pyroxene. We describe a variety of silicate inclusions enclosed in olivine that contain phases rarely or not previously reported in Main-group pallasites, including clinopyroxene (augite), tridymite, K-rich felsic glass, and an unknown Ca-Cr silicate. Pressure constraints determined from tridymite (GPa), two-pyroxene barometry (0.39 +/- 0.07 GPa), and geophysical calculations that assume pallasite formation at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), provide an upper estimate on the size of the Main-group parent body from which Fukang originated. We conclude that Fukang originated at the CMB of a large differentiated planetesimal 400-680 km in radius.

Alfvenic Fluctuations Associated With Jupiter's Auroral Emissions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WAVE CURRENT SYSTEM; ELECTRON ACCELERATION; MAGNETIC-FIELD; IO; TURBULENCE; MAGNETOSPHERE; MODEL; MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS; WAKE	The Alfven wave mode transmits field-aligned currents and large-scale turbulence throughout Jupiter's magnetosphere. Magnetometer data from the Juno spacecraft have provided the first observations of Alfvenic fluctuations along the polar magnetic flux tubes connected to Jupiter's main auroral oval and the Jovian satellites. Transverse magnetic field perturbations associated with Io are observed up to similar to 90 degrees away from main Io footprint, supporting the presence of extended Alfvenic wave activity throughout the Io footprint tail. Additional broadband fluctuations measured equatorward of the statistical auroral oval are composed of incompressible magnetic turbulence that maps to Jupiter's equatorial plasma sheet at radial distances within similar to 20 R-J. These fluctuations exhibit a k(parallel to) power spectrum consistent with strong magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. This turbulence can generate up to similar to 100 mW/m(2) of Poynting flux to power the Jovian aurora in regions connected to the inner magnetosphere's central plasma sheet. Plain Language Summary Here we provide the first direct observations of magnetic turbulence near Jupiter's poles. The locations and power of these turbulent fluctuations provide new constraints for modeling the particle acceleration that leads to the generation of Jupiter's aurora. We find that this turbulence provides sufficient energy to produce the aurora at Jupiter, as well as emission associated with Jupiter's moon Io. Constraints on turbulent auroral heating at Jupiter are relevant for analogous processes at other giant magnetospheres such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.	[Gershman, Daniel J.; Connerney, John E.

When Will Spaceborne Cloud Radar Detect Upward Shifts in Cloud Heights?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						upward shifts in cloud heights; W-band cloud radar; future climate; CESM1	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CALIBRATION; FEEDBACKS; MISSION; MODEL	Cloud feedbacks remain the largest source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. Simulations robustly project an increase in cloud height, which is supported by some observational evidence. However, how much of this increasing trend is due to climate warming and how much is due to multiyear natural variability still remains unclear because of the brevity of existing observational records. Here we estimate when the signal will become detectable at 95% confidence by existing radar technology. We use output from a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 Community Earth System Model version 1 simulation in a Monte Carlo analysis to determine (1) what is the first year at which changes in the altitude of high cloud can be confidently estimated if we continue to fly W-band cloud radar, (2) what radar sensitivity is required to detect those changes, and (3) at what latitude will we first detect these changes? In Community Earth System Model version 1 a cloud radar record would be able to confidently detect upward shifts in cloud height over 20-60 degrees N before 2030 for a radar with a sensitivity of -15dBZ and stable calibration errors of 0.25dBZ. Furthermore, vertical resolution could be degraded to 1.6km with little effect on detection year. Results are more sensitive to the magnitude of calibration errors than to the minimum detectable echo. Our earlier midlatitude detection contrasts with a previous lidar-based analysis, which may be due to radar detecting different parts of the clouds and our use of simulations that account for changing geographical patterns of forced warming through time.

Experimental and computational studies of Criegee intermediate reactions with NH3 and CH3NH2 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c8cp06810k	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							GAS-PHASE REACTIONS; MASTER EQUATION; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; RATE COEFFICIENTS; POTENTIAL SOURCE; KINETICS; CH2OO; ACID; AMINES; HUMIDITY	Ammonia and amines are emitted into the troposphere by various natural and anthropogenic sources, where they have a significant role in aerosol formation. Here, we explore the significance of their removal by reaction with Criegee intermediates, which are produced in the troposphere by ozonolysis of alkenes. Rate coefficients for the reactions of two representative Criegee intermediates, formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) and acetone oxide ((CH3)(2)COO) with NH3 and CH3NH2 were measured using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Temperature-dependent rate coefficients, k(CH2OO + NH3) = (3.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(-20)T(2) exp(1011 +/- 48/T) cm(3) s(-1) and k(CH2OO + CH3NH2) = (5 +/- 2) x 10(-19)T(2) exp(1384 +/- 96/T) cm(3) s(-1) were obtained in the 240 to 320 K range. Both the reactions of CH2OO were found to be independent of pressure in the 10 to 100 Torr (N-2) range, and average rate coefficients k(CH2OO + NH3) = (8.4 +/- 1.2) x 10(-14) cm(3) s(-1) and k(CH2OO + CH3NH2) = (5.6 +/- 0.4) x 10(-12) cm(3) s(-1) were deduced at 293 K. An upper limit of <= 2.7 x 10(-15) cm(3) s(-1) was estimated for the rate coefficient of the (CH3)(2)COO + NH3 reaction. Complementary measurements were performed with mass spectrometry using synchrotron radiation photoionization giving k(CH2OO + CH3NH2) = (4.3 +/- 0.5) x 10(-12) cm(3) s(-1) at 298 K and 4 Torr (He). Photoionization mass spectra indicated production of NH2CH2OOH and CH3N(H)CH2OOH functionalized organic hydroperoxide adducts from CH2OO + NH3 and CH2OO + CH3NH2 reactions, respectively. Ab initio calculations performed at the CCSD(T)(F12*)/cc-pVQZ-F12//CCSD(T)(F12*)/cc-pVDZ-F12 level of theory predicted pre-reactive complex formation, consistent with previous studies. Master equation simulations of the experimental data using the ab initio computed structures identified submerged barrier heights of -2.1 +/- 0.1 kJ mol(-1) and -22.4 +/- 0.2 kJ mol(-1) for the CH2OO + NH3 and CH2OO + CH3NH2 reactions, respectively. The reactions of NH3 and CH3NH2 with CH2OO are not expected to compete with its removal by reaction with (H2O)(2) in the troposphere. Similarly, losses of NH3 and CH3NH2 by reaction with Criegee intermediates will be insignificant compared with reactions with OH radicals.

Iceberg topography and volume classification using TanDEM-X interferometry	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							SEA-ICE; IMPACT; PENETRATION; RESOLUTION; ANTARCTICA; IMAGES; DEPTH; FJORD; OCEAN; LAND	Icebergs in polar regions affect water salinity, alter marine habitats, and impose serious hazards on maritime operations and navigation. These impacts mainly depend on the iceberg volume, which remains an elusive parameter to measure. We investigate the capability of TanDEM-X bistatic single-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to derive iceberg subaerial morphology and infer total volume. We cross-verify InSAR results with Operation IceBridge (OIB) data acquired near Wordie Bay, Antarctica, as part of the OIB/TanDEM-X Antarctic Science Campaign (OTASC). While icebergs are typically classified according to size based on length or maximum height, we develop a new volumetric classification approach for applications where iceberg volume is relevant. For icebergs with heights exceeding 5 m, we find iceberg volumes derived from TanDEM-X and OIB data match within 7 %. We also derive a range of possible iceberg keel depths relevant to grounding and potential impacts on subsea installations. These results suggest that TanDEM-X could pave the way for future single-pass interferometric systems for scientific and operational iceberg mapping and classification based on iceberg volume and keel depth.

Extraterrestrial path planning is challenging due to the combination of terrain roughness and severe limitation in computational resources. Path planning on cluttered and/or uneven terrains requires repeated safety checks on all the candidate paths at a small interval. Predicting the future rover state requires simulating the vehicle settling on the terrain, which involves an inverse-kinematics problem with iterative nonlinear optimization under geometric constraints. However, such expensive computation is intractable for slow spacecraft computers, such as RAD750, which is used by the Curiosity Mars rover and upcoming Mars 2020 rover. We propose the approximate clearance evaluation (ACE) algorithm, which obtains conservative bounds on vehicle clearance, attitude, and suspension angles without iterative computation. It obtains those bounds by estimating the lowest and highest heights that each wheel may reach given the underlying terrain, and calculating the worst-case vehicle configuration associated with those extreme wheel heights. The bounds are guaranteed to be conservative, hence ensuring vehicle safety during autonomous navigation. ACE is planned to be used as part of the new onboard path planner of the Mars 2020 rover. This paper describes the algorithm in detail and validates our claim of conservatism and fast computation through experiments.

However; most samples used as test images have been solid or adhered to a surface, making it easy to determine focal planes and correct for chromatic aberration. In this study we apply 3-wavelength off-axis DHM to swimming protozoa containing distinct spectral features such as chlorophyll and carotenoids. We reconstruct the holograms into amplitude and phase images using the angular spectrum method. Methods for noise subtraction, chromatic aberration correction, and image registration are presented for both amplitude and phase. Approaches to phase unwrapping are evaluated and compared to expected results from simulated holograms. The algorithms used are implemented in plug-ins using the open source Fiji platform and are available for use, significantly expanding the open-source software available for DHM.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) provides the total column water vapor, while the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor under certain conditions. As a byproduct of this algorithm, we also store cloud top information of the MODIS pixels used, a proxy for the inversion height, as well as the sea surface temperature and total column water vapor from the AMSR measurements. Hence, the AMSR-MODIS dataset provides several of the variables associated with the boundary layer thermodynamic structure. Comparisons against radiosondes and GPS radio occultation (GPSRO) data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. We explore the annual cycle of the number of observations as a proxy for stratus cloud amount, in well-known stratus regions; we then exploit the 16 years of AMSR-MODIS synergy to study for the first time the annual variations of the boundary layer water vapor in comparison to the sea surface temperature and the boundary layer cloud top height (equivalent to the inversion height) climatologies, and lastly we explore the climatological behavior of these variables on stratocumulus-to-cumulus transitions.

The algorithm comprises three steps: preprocesses, radiance fitting, and postprocesses. The preprocesses include a wavelength calibration, as well as interpolation and convolution of absorption cross sections; radiance fitting is conducted using a non-linear fitting method referred to as basic optical absorption spectroscopy (BOAS); and postprocesses include air mass factor calculations and bias corrections. In this study, several sensitivity tests are conducted to examine the retrieval uncertainties using the GEMS HCHO algorithm. We evaluate the algorithm with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 1B irradiance/radiance data by comparing our retrieved HCHO column densities with OMI HCHO products of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (OMH-CHO) and of the Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables project (OMI QA4ECV). Results show that OMI HCHO slant columns retrieved using the GEMS algorithm are in good agreement with OMHCHO, with correlation coefficients of 0.77-0.91 and regression slopes of 0.94-1.04 for March, June, September, and December 2005. Spatial distributions of HCHO slant columns from the GEMS algorithm are consistent with the OMI QA4ECV products, but relatively poorer correlation coefficients of 0.52-0.76 are found compared to those against the OMHCHO products. Also, we compare the satellite results with ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations. OMI GEMS HCHO vertical columns are 9 %-25 % lower than those of MAX-DOAS at Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP) in France, Bremen in Germany, and Xi-anghe in China. We find that the OMI GEMS retrievals have less bias than the OMHCHO and OMI QA4ECV products at OHP and Bremen in comparison with MAX-DOAS.

Spatial Statistical Downscaling for Constructing High-Resolution Nature Runs in Global Observing System Simulation Experiments	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						Basis functions; Change of support; Conditional simulation; Nonstationary covariance function; Observing system simulation experiment; Statistical downscaling	GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODELS; DATA FUSION; ASSIMILATION; CALIBRATION; OUTPUT; INTERPOLATION; PRECIPITATION; SELECTION; SPACE	Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) have been widely used as a rigorous and cost-effective way to guide development of new observing systems, and to evaluate the performance of new data assimilation algorithms. Nature runs (NRs), which are output from deterministic models, play an essential role in building OSSE systems for global atmospheric processes because they are used both to create synthetic observations at high spatial resolution, and to represent the "true" atmosphere against which the forecasts are verified. However, most NRs are generated at resolutions coarser than actual observations from satellite instruments or predictions from data assimilation algorithms. Our goal is to develop a principled statistical downscaling framework to construct high-resolution NRs via conditional simulation from coarse-resolution numerical model output. We use nonstationary spatial covariance function models that have basis function representations to capture spatial variability. This approach not only explicitly addresses the change-of-support problem, but also allows fast computation with large volumes of numerical model output. We also propose a data-driven algorithm to select the required basis functions adaptively, in order to increase the flexibility of our nonstationary covariance function models. In this article we demonstrate these techniques by downscaling a coarse-resolution physical numerical model output at a native resolution of of global surface concentrations to 655,362 equal-area hexagons.

Morphological and geological features of Drake Passage, Antarctica, from a new digital bathymetric model	JOURNAL OF MAPS			English	Article						Bathymetry; seafloor; Drake Passage; Scotia-Arc; Antarctica	SHACKLETON FRACTURE-ZONE; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; SCOTIA SEA; PLATE BOUNDARY; MANTLE FLOW; RIDGE; OCEAN; ARC; PACIFIC; MARGIN	The Drake Passage is an oceanic gateway of about 850 km width located between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula that connects the southeastern Pacific Ocean with the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It is an important gateway for mantle flow, oceanographic water masses, and migrations of biota. This sector developed within the framework of the geodynamic evolution of the Scotia Arc, including continental fragmentation processes and oceanic crust creation, since the oblique divergence of the South American plate to the north and the Antarctic plate to the south started in the Eocene. As a consequence of its complex tectonic evolution and subsequent submarine processes, as sedimentary infill and erosion mainly controlled by bottom currents and active tectonics, this region shows a varied physiography. We present a detailed map of the bathymetry and geological setting of the Drake Passage that is mainly founded on a new compilation of precise multibeam bathymetric data obtained on 120 cruises between 1992 and 2015, resulting in a new Digital Bathymetric Model with 200 x 200 m cell spacing. The map covers an area of 1,465,000 km(2) between parallels 52 degrees S and 63 degrees S and meridians 70 degrees W and 50 degrees W at scale 1:1,600,000 allowing the identification of the main seafloor features. In addition, the map includes useful geological information related to magnetism, seismicity and tectonics. This work constitutes an international cooperative effort and is part of the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean project, under the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research umbrella.

Pseudo true-color imagery from Google Earth and broadband satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 allowed for detection of the various beds, but retrievals particularly in the deeper Vierra bed proved unreliable over time due to variable image quality and environmental conditions. Calibrated water-leaving reflectance spectrum from airborne hyperspectral imagery at 1-m resolution from the Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) revealed the extent of both shallow and deep eelgrass beds using the HOPE semi-analytical inversion model. The model was able to reveal subtle differences in spectral shape, even when remote sensing reflectance over the Vierra bed was not visibly distinguishable. Empirical methods exploiting the red edge of reflectance to differentiate submerged vegetation only retrieved the extent of shallow alongshore beds. The HOPE model also accurately retrieved the water column absorption properties, chlorophyll-a, and bathymetry but underestimated the particulate backscattering and suspended matter when benthic reflectance was represented as a horizontal eelgrass leaf. More accurate water column backscattering could be achieved by the use of a darker bottom spectrum representing an eelgrass canopy. These results illustrate how high quality atmospherically-corrected hyperspectral imagery can be used to map eelgrass beds, even in regions prone to sediment resuspension, and to quantify bathymetry and water quality.

VARION is a real-time Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS)-based algorithm that can be used to detect various ionospheric disturbances associated with natural hazards, such as tsunamis and earthquakes. A noise reduction algorithm was applied to the VARION-GEO solutions to remove the satellite-dependent noise term. Our analysis showed that the interactions of the exhaust plume with the ionospheric plasma depleted the total electron content (TEC) to a level comparable with nighttime TEC values. During this event, the geometry of the satellite-receiver link is such that GEO satellites measured the depleted plasma hole before any GPS satellites. We estimated that the ionosphere relaxed back to a pre-perturbed state after about 3 h, and the hole propagated with a mean speed of about 600 m/s over a region of 700 km in radius. We conclude that the VARION-GEO approach can provide important ionospheric TEC real-time measurements, which are not affected by the motion of the ionospheric pierce points (IPPs). Furthermore, the VARION-GEO measurements experience a steady noise level throughout the entire observation period, making this technique particularly useful to augment and enhance the capabilities of well-established GNSS-based ionosphere remote sensing techniques and future ionospheric-based early warning systems.

We used a nontransparent negative photoresist that allows patterning selectively (vertically) the paper, creating systems of two or three layers, including channels. To demonstrate the capabilities of this methodology, we designed, fabricated, and tested a six-level diluter. The performance of the device was also simulated using a simple numerical model implemented in the program PETSc-FEM. The resulting mu PAD is small (1.6 cm x 2.2 cm), inexpensive, requires low volumes of sample (5 mu L), and is able to perform mixing and dilution in 2 min.

The data were obtained on 271 nights between 2013 August and the end of 2018, and include nearly 1000 detections of over 75 unique hot spots. The 100 observations obtained between 2013 and 2015 have been previously published in de Kleer & de Pater the observations since the start of 2016 are presented here for the first time, and the analysis is updated to include the full five-year data set. These data provide insight into the global properties of Io's volcanism. Several new hot spots and bright eruptions have been detected, and the preference for bright eruptions to occur on Io's trailing hemisphere noted in the 2013-2015 data is strengthened by the larger data set and remains unexplained. The program overlapped in time with Sprint-A/EXCEED and Juno observations of the Jovian system, and correlations with transient phenomena seen in other components of the system have the potential to inform our understanding of the impact of Io's volcanism on Jupiter and its neutral/plasma environment.

The planetary signal, which is characterized by a short (similar to 1 day) "bump" on the rising side of the lensing light curve, was densely covered by ground-based surveys. We find that the signal can be explained by a bright source that fully envelops the planetary caustic, i.e., a "Hollywood" geometry. Combined with the source proper motion measured from Gaia, the Spitzer satellite parallax measurement makes it possible to precisely constrain the lens physical parameters. The preferred solution, in which the planet perturbs the minor image due to lensing by the host, yields a Uranus-mass planet with a mass of M-p = 13.9 +/- 1.6 M-circle plus orbiting a mid M-dwarf with a mass of M-h = 0.23 +/- 0.03 M-circle dot. There is also a second possible solution that is substantially disfavored but cannot be ruled out, for which the planet perturbs the major image. The latter solution yields M-p = 1.2 +/- 0.2 M-circle plus and M-h = 0.15 +/- 0.02 M-circle dot. By combining the microlensing and Gaia data together with a Galactic model, we find in either case that the lens lies on the near side of the Galactic bulge at a distance D-L similar to 6 +/- 1 kpc. Future adaptive optics observations may decisively resolve the major image/minor image degeneracy.

A Global Inventory of Ice-Related Morphological Features on Dwarf Planet Ceres: Implications for the Evolution and Current State of the Cryosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Ceres; geomorphology; ice; cryosphere	SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; CENTRAL PIT; GROUND ICE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; IMPACT CRATERS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; NEAR-SURFACE; WATER ICE	We present a comprehensive global catalog of the geomorphological features with clear or potential relevance to subsurface ice identified during the Dawn spacecraft's primary and first extended missions at Ceres. We define eight broad feature classes and describe analyses supporting their genetic links to subsurface ice. These classes include relaxed craters; central pit craters; large domes; small mounds; lobate landslides and ejecta; pitted materials; depressions and scarps; and fractures, grooves, and channels. Features in all classes are widely distributed on the dwarf planet, consistent with multiple lines of observational evidence that ice is a key component of Ceres' crust. Independent analyses of multiple feature types suggest rheological and compositional layering may be common in the upper similar to 10 km of the crust. Clustering of features indicates that ice concentration is heterogeneous on nearly all length scales, from similar to 1 km to hundreds of kilometers. Impacts are likely the key driver of heterogeneity, causing progressive devolatilization of the low latitude and midlatitude crust on billion-year timescales but also producing localized enhancements in near surface ice content via excavation of deep ice-rich material and possible facilitation of cryomagmatic and cryovolcanic activity. Impacts and landslides may be the dominant mechanism for ice loss on modern Ceres. Our analysis suggests specific locations where future high-resolution imaging can be used to probe (1) current volatile loss rates and (2) the history of putative cryomagmatic and cryovolcanic features. The Cerean cryosphere and its unique morphology promise to be a rich subject of ongoing research for years to come.	[Sizemore, H. G.; Berman, D. C.; Crown, D. A.; Mest, S.

Juno-UVS Observation of the Io Footprint During Solar Eclipse	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Io; UV-aurorae; Jupiter; Io footprint; Io atmosphere; Juno	DUSK ELECTRIC-FIELD; WAVE CURRENT SYSTEM; PLASMA INTERACTION; HST/STIS OBSERVATIONS; ATMOSPHERE; ULTRAVIOLET; EMISSION; JUPITER; SO2; SUBLIMATION	The two main ultraviolet-signatures resulting from the Io-magnetosphere interaction are the local auroras on Io's atmosphere, and the Io footprints on Jupiter. We study here how Io's daily eclipses affect the footprint. Previous observations showed that its atmosphere collapses in eclipse. While remote observers can observe Io's local auroras briefly when Io disappears behind Jupiter, Juno is able to follow the Io footprint in the unlit hemisphere. Theoretical models of the variability of the energy flux fed into the Alfven wings, ultimately powering the footprints, are not sufficiently constrained by observations. For the first time, we use observations of Io's footprint from the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) on Juno recorded as Io went into eclipse. We benchmark the trend of the footprint brightness using observations by UVS taken over Io's complete orbit and find that the footprint emitted power variation with Jupiter's rotation shows fairly consistent trends with previous observations. Two exploitable data sets provided measurements when Io was simultaneously in eclipse. No statistically significant changes were recorded as Io left and moved into eclipse, respectively, suggesting either that (i) Io's atmospheric densities within and outside eclipse are large enough to produce a saturated plasma interaction, that is, in the saturated state, changes in Io's atmospheric properties to first order do not control the total Alfvenic energy flux, (ii) the atmospheric collapse during the Juno observations was less than previously observed, or (iii) additional processes of the Alfven wings in addition to the Poynting flux generated at Io control the footprint luminosity.

The material is ionized and then distributed by Jupiter's magnetic field into a torus around Jupiter called the Io plasma torus. This plasma affects radio signals as they propagate from the Juno spacecraft to Earth during the spacecraft's perijove passes. During Perijoves 3, 6, and 8 we determine the total electron content in the Io plasma torus using two-way tracking data from Juno. We find that the location of the torus is displaced from predictions that use the VIP4 offset tilted dipole approximation. The displacements are consistent with those found in ground-based observations. The peak total electron content and scale height are found for two different regions of the torus, the cold inner torus and a warmer torus beyond 5.5 R-J. Properties of the cold torus vary appreciably with System III longitude, but properties of the torus beyond 5.5 R-J do not.

Investigation of Mass-/Charge-Dependent Escape of Energetic Ions Across the Magnetopauses of Earth and Jupiter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						magnetopause; upstream ions; planetary magnetospheres; Earth magnetosphere; Jupiter magnetosphere; energetic particles	BOW SHOCK; PARTICLE ESCAPE; UPSTREAM; MAGNETOSHEATH; MAGNETOSPHERE; ELECTRON; OXYGEN; RECONNECTION; EVENTS; ORIGIN	We present a continuing investigation of mass-/charge-dependent interactions between energetic ions (greater than tens of kiloelectron volts) and planetary magnetopauses and of the escape of the ions across the boundary. Previous studies at Earth using Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data are refined and advanced showing profound behavior differences between light (H, He) and singly charged heavy ions (O+). We highlight a distinctive feature of oxygen ions: an angular distribution bifurcation providing clear indication of entrainment along the magnetopause in Speiser-like orbits during relatively stable magnetic conditions. This signature, interpreted using a simple kinetic model, suggests that these ions tend to be carried substantial distances along the boundary (even with boundary-normal magnetic fields) in a fashion that impedes their full dayside escape. While large fluctuations and waves can likely sometimes disrupt the observed ordering, the following picture emerges. Energetic particles with gyroradii much smaller than the magnetopause thickness (e.g., electrons and absent boundary-normal magnetic fields) and ions with gyroradii much larger than the thickness (e.g., O+) are impeded from fully escaping across the boundary. However, energetic ions with intermediate-sized gyroradii commensurate with the thickness (e.g., H+, He++, and O6+) can be effectively scattered within the boundary causing them to escape much more readily, with and without boundary-normal fields. This picture is supported by observations from the Juno spacecraft at the near-dawn meridian side of Jupiter's magnetopause. There it is observed that energetic electrons and heavy ions are more strongly contained by the magnetopause than are the energetic protons and helium ions.	[Mauk, B. H.; Cohen, I. J.; Haggerty, D.

This unusual resistance of SAFR-032 is of particular concern in the context of planetary protection and calls for development of novel disinfection techniques to prevent extraterrestrial contamination. Previously, spores of SAFR-032 were exposed for 18 months to a variety of space conditions on board the International Space Station to investigate their resistance to Mars-like conditions and space travel. Here, proteomic characterization of vegetative SAFR-032 cells from space-surviving spores is presented in comparison to a ground control. Vegetative cells of the first passage were processed and subjected to quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags. Approximately 60% of all proteins encoded by SAFR-032 were identified, and 301 proteins were differentially expressed among the strains. We found that proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion had lower abundance than those of the ground control. For three proteins, we showed that the expected metabolic activities were decreased, as expected with direct enzymatic assays. This was consistent with a decrease of ATP production in the space-surviving strains. The same space-surviving strains showed increased abundance of proteins related to survival, growth advantage, and stress response. Such alterations in the proteomes provide insights into possible molecular mechanisms of B. pumilus SAFR-032 to adapt to and resist extreme extraterrestrial environments. IMPORTANCE Spore-forming bacteria are well known for their resistance to harsh environments and are of concern for spreading contamination to extraterrestrial bodies during future life detection missions. Bacillus pumilus has been regularly isolated from spacecraft-associated surfaces and exhibited unusual resistance to ultraviolet light and other sterilization techniques. A better understanding of the mechanisms of microbial survival and enhanced resistance is essential for developing novel disinfection protocols for the purpose of planetary protection. While genomic analyses did not reveal the unique characteristics that explain elevated UV resistance of space-exposed B. pumilus, the proteomics study presented here provided intriguing insight on key metabolic changes. The observed proteomics aberrations reveal a complex biological phenomenon that plays a role in bacterial survival and adaptation under long-term exposure to outer space. This adaptive ability of microorganisms needs to be considered by those tasked with eliminating forward contamination.

It will use the technique of radar interferometry to measure sea surface height over a 120-km-wide swath with a 20-km gap around the satellite's nadir track. The oceanographic objectives of the mission are to study ocean circulation at scales down to 15 km. To prepare for the evaluation of the mission's performance, we are undertaking a series of studies to explore the efficacy of an assimilative high-resolution modeling system for estimating the state of the ocean based on independent observations from both spaceborne and in situ measurements. The system is based on the heritage of a multiscale approach to data assimilation by the Regional Ocean Modeling System. Observing System Simulation Experiments were first conducted in the setup of an identical twin experiment to assess the system's performance near the calibration/validation site of SWOT off the coast of California. The system was applied to a nested model domain with 1-km resolution. Simulated satellite observations of SSH, sea surface temperature, salinity, in situ observations of upper ocean temperature, and salinity by profiling floats and a dedicated notional array of station-keeping gliders were assimilated by the system. The results indicate that such an observing system can accurately estimate the state of the ocean, and in particular SSH for the evaluation of SWOT performance.

Statistical Mapping of Freshwater Origin and Fate Signatures as Land/Ocean "Regions of Influence" in the Gulf of Mexico	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						land; sea exchanges; river plume; sea surface salinity; river; Gulf of Mexico	SEA-SURFACE SALINITY; MISSISSIPPI RIVER PLUME; VARIABILITY; NITROGEN; SHELF; DISCHARGE; DELIVERY; HYPOXIA; MATTER; SMOS	Here we present an observation-based study of the coupled land-ocean regions of influence for the transformation of precipitation over land into coastal river plume structure in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). First, we locate the regions on land for which precipitation and runoff generation have the strongest relationship with local river discharge. Then we map, on average, the apparent unique contribution of individual river discharge forcing to specific features of river plume structure across the GoM. To this end, we employ a spatial-temporal lagged correlation analysis that relates satellite-based precipitation, soil moisture, and sea surface salinity observations to in situ river discharge for the three primary freshwater input sources for the GoM. On land, we find a likely source region for the northeastern GoM in the southeastern Mississippi basin at 16-day lead time, a likely source region for the northeastern GoM in the Mobile Bay basin at 3-day lead time and a likely source region for the Central GoM from the Texas basin region at 4-day lead time. In the ocean, we find statistically significant regions of distinct contribution for each of the three sources of freshwater on plume structure at lag times from weeks to several months. Though a statistical approach is limited in its interpretability, this result advances progress toward a predictive framework for mapping of the impacts of hydrological flood events from land into the ocean using observations alone.

Sustained Nonphotochemical Quenching Shapes the Seasonal Pattern of Solar-Induced Fluorescence at a High-Elevation Evergreen Forest	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						solar-induced fluorescence; CLM; land surface model; Niwot Ridge; nonphotochemical quenching	INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; PHOTOCHEMICAL REFLECTANCE INDEX; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; UNITED-STATES; CO2 ASSIMILATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON STOCKS; WARM-SEASON; SCOTS PINE; DIEL CYCLE	Traditional methods of carbon monitoring in mountainous regions are challenged by complex terrain. Recently, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has been found to be an indicator of gross primary production (GPP), and the increased availability of remotely sensed SIF provides an opportunity to estimate GPP across the Western United States. Although the empirical linkage between SIF and GPP is strong, the current mechanistic understanding of this linkage is incomplete and depends upon changes in leaf biochemical processes in which absorbed sunlight leads to photochemistry, heat (via nonphotochemical quenching [NPQ]), fluorescence, or tissue damage. An improved mechanistic understanding is necessary to leverage SIF observations to improve representation of ecosystem processes within land surface models. Here we included an improved fluorescence model within the Community Land Model, Version 4.5 (CLM 4.5), to simulate seasonal changes in SIF at a subalpine forest in Colorado. We found that when the model accounted for sustained NPQ, this provided a larger seasonal change in fluorescence yield leading to simulated SIF that more closely resembled the observed seasonal pattern (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 [GOME-2] satellite platform and a tower-mounted spectrometer system). We found that an acclimation model based on mean air temperature was a useful predictor for sustained NPQ. Although light intensity was not an important factor for this analysis, it should be considered before applying the sustained NPQ and SIF to other cold climate evergreen biomes. More leaf-level fluorescence measurements are necessary to better understand the seasonal relationship between sustained and reversible components of NPQ and to what extent that influences SIF.

Widespread Initiation, Reactivation, and Acceleration of Landslides in the Northern California Coast Ranges due to Extreme Rainfall	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						landslides; precipitation; climate; InSAR; California	SLOW-MOVING LANDSLIDES; PORE-PRESSURE FEEDBACK; SANTA-CLARA-VALLEY; TRIGGERED LANDSLIDES; ALOS/PALSAR IMAGERY; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; SEASONAL MOVEMENT; CREEK LANDSLIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEDIMENT FLUX	Episodically to continuously active slow-moving landslides are driven by precipitation. Climate change, which is altering both the frequency and magnitude of precipitation worldwide, is therefore predicted to have a major impact on landslides. Here we examine the behavior of hundreds of slow-moving landslides in northern California in response to large changes in annual precipitation that occurred between 2016 and 2018. We quantify the landslide displacement using repeat-pass radar interferometry and pixel offset tracking techniques on a novel data set from the airborne NASA/JPL Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar. We found that 312 landslides were moving due to extreme rainfall during 2017, compared to 119 during 2016, which was the final year of a historic multiyear drought. However, with a return to below to average rainfall in 2018, only 146 landslides remained in motion. The increased number of landslides during 2017 was primarily accommodated by landslides that were smaller than the landslides that remained active between 2016 and 2018. Furthermore, by examining a subset of 51 landslides, we found that 49 had increased velocities during 2017 when compared to 2016. Our results show that slow-moving landslides are sensitive to large changes in annual precipitation, particularly the smaller and thinner landslides that likely experience larger basal pore-water pressure changes. Based on climate model predictions for the next century in California, which include increases in average annual precipitation and increases in the frequency of dry-to-wet extremes, we hypothesize that there will be an overall increase in landslide activity.

Insights Into Permafrost and Seasonal Active-Layer Dynamics From Ambient Seismic Noise Monitoring	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						ambient seismic noise; permafrost; active layer; velocity variations; seismic interferometry	VELOCITY CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALASKA; TOMOGRAPHY; CARBON; HEAT; THERMOKARST; TEMPERATURE; THICKNESS; VOLCANO	Widespread permafrost thaw in response to changing climate conditions has the potential to dramatically impact ecosystems, infrastructure, and the global carbon budget. Ambient seismic noise techniques allow passive subsurface monitoring that could provide new insights into permafrost vulnerability and active-layer processes. Using nearly 2 years of continuous seismic data recorded near Fairbanks, Alaska, we measured relative velocity variations that showed a clear seasonal cycle reflecting active-layer freeze and thaw. Relative to January 2014, velocities increased up to 3% through late spring, decreased to -8% by late August, and then gradually returned to the initial values by the following winter. Velocities responded rapidly (over similar to 2 to 7 days) to discrete hydrologic events and temperature forcing and indicated that spring snowmelt and infiltration events from summer rainfall were particularly influential in propagating thaw across the site. Velocity increases during the fall zero-curtain captured the refreezing process and incremental ice formation. Looking across multiple frequency bands (3-30 Hz), negative relative velocities began at higher frequencies earlier in the summer and then shifted lower when active-layer thaw deepened, suggesting a potential relationship between frequency and thaw depth; however, this response was dependent on interstation distance. Bayesian tomography returned 2-D time-lapse images identifying zones of greatest velocity reduction concentrated in the western side of the array, providing insight into the spatial variability of thaw progression, soil moisture, and drainage. This study demonstrates the potential of passive sei(s)mic monitoring as a new tool for studying site-scale active-layer and permafrost thaw processes at high temporal and spatial resolution.

The Deposition and Alteration History of the Northeast Syrtis Major Layered Sulfates	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						structural modeling; sulfate; diagenesis; sedimentary rocks; depositional mechanism; erosion	NILI FOSSAE REGION; MERIDIANI-PLANUM; MARS IMPLICATIONS; VALLES-MARINERIS; ISIDIS PLANITIA; JEZERO CRATER; FLUID-FLOW; SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS; GEOLOGICAL HISTORY; POLYGONAL FAULTS	Ancient stratigraphy on Isidis Basin's western margin records the history of water on early Mars. Noachian units are overlain by layered, basaltic composition sedimentary rocks that are enriched in polyhydrated sulfates and capped by more resistant units. The layered sulfates-uniquely exposed at northeast Syrtis Major-comprise a sedimentary sequence up to 600 m thick that has undergone a multistage history of deposition, alteration, and erosion. Siliciclastic sediments enriched in polyhydrated sulfates are bedded at meter scale and were deposited on slopes up to 10 degrees, embaying and thinning against preexisting Noachian highlands around the Isidis Basin rim. The layered sulfates were modified by volume loss fracturing during diagenesis. Resultant fractures hosted channelized flow and jarosite mineral precipitation to form resistant ridges upon erosion. The structural form of the layered sulfates is consistent with packages of sediment fallen from either atmospheric or aqueous suspension; coupling with substantial diagenetic volume loss may favor deepwater basin sedimentation. After formation, the layered sulfates were capped by a "smooth capping unit" and then eroded to form paleovalleys. Hesperian Syrtis Major lavas were channelized by this paleotopography, capping it in some places and filling it in others. Later fluvial features and phyllosilicate-bearing lacustrine deposits, sharing a regional base level of similar to -2,300 m, were superimposed on the sulfate-lava stratigraphy. The layered sulfates suggest surface bodies of water and active groundwater upwelling during the Noachian-Hesperian transition. The northeast Syrtis Major stratigraphy records at least four distinct phases of surface and subsurface aqueous activity spanning from late Noachian to early Amazonian time.	[Quinn, D.

Fluidized Appearing Ejecta on Ceres: Implications for the Mechanical Properties, Frictional Properties, and Composition of its Shallow Subsurface	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Ceres; Dawn; ground ice; ejecta; fluidization; impact cratering	IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION; IMPACT CRATERS; GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; RAMPART CRATERS; GROUND ICE; MORPHOLOGY; DENSITY; EMPLACEMENT; VOLATILES; WATER	Several ejecta deposits on Ceres display morphological characteristics not commonly associated with dry ballistic emplacement. We characterized 30 examples of fluidized appearing ejecta (FAE) on Ceres and identified two distinct morphological populations: cuspate/lobate FAE and channelized FAE. The cuspate/lobate FAE typically display one or more of the following characteristics: well-defined margins, a sheeted or layered appearance, arcuate or cuspate terminal lobes, and occasional mass concentrations at their distal margins. The channelized FAE typically display a morphology dominated by topographically focused channelized flows and arcuate terminal lobes but lack the well-defined margins common among their cuspate/lobate counterparts. Although Cerean FAE are holistically distinct from rampart/layered ejecta craters on Mars, Ganymede, and other icy solar system objects, many of their aforementioned morphological characteristics are commonly found among these other examples of fluidized ejecta. The formation of Martian and icy satellite fluidized ejecta has been widely attributed to the mobilization of near-surface volatiles, namely, water ice. The documented Cerean FAE are observed between absolute latitudes of 70 degrees, with a slight enrichment in the midlatitudes of the southern hemisphere. We test the hypothesis that the morphologies and mobilities of Cerean FAE can be explained via impacting into a low-cohesion ice-silicate target material, followed by material sliding on a low-friction partially icy substrate. We do this by comparing the observed Cerean FAE to a kinematic-dynamic sliding ejecta emplacement model. We find that a mechanically weak, H2O-rich near-surface layer is consistent with the range of ejecta mobilities and morphologies observed in this investigation.	[Hughson, Kynan H. G.; Russell, C.

Effects of the MY34/2018 Global Dust Storm as Measured by MSL REMS in Gale Crater	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Global Dust Storm; Martian atmosphere; REMS instrument; Mars Science Laboratory	AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; WATER-VAPOR; THERMAL TIDES; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; SURFACE PRESSURE; MARS YEARS; CYCLE; MODEL; TEMPERATURES	The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument is on board NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover. REMS has been measuring surface pressure, air, and ground brightness temperature, relative humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiance since MSL's landing in 2012. In Mars Year (MY) 34 (2018) a global dust storm reached Gale Crater at L-s similar to 190 degrees. REMS offers a unique opportunity to better understand the impact of a global dust storm on local environmental conditions, which complements previous observations by the Viking landers and Mars Exploration Rovers. All atmospheric variables measured by REMS are strongly affected albeit at different times. During the onset phase, the daily maximum UV radiation decreased by 90% between sols 2075 (opacity similar to 1) and 2085 (opacity similar to 8.5). The diurnal range in ground and air temperatures decreased by 35 and 56 K, respectively, with also a diurnal-average decrease of similar to 2 and 4 K respectively. The maximum relative humidity, which occurs right before sunrise, decreased to below 5%, compared with prestorm values of up to 29%, due to the warmer air temperatures at night, while the inferred water vapor abundance suggests an increase during the storm. Between sols 2085 and 2130, the typical nighttime stable inversion layer was absent near the surface as ground temperatures remained warmer than near-surface air temperatures. Finally, the frequency domain behavior of the diurnal pressure cycle shows a strong increase in the strength of the semidiurnal and terdiurnal modes peaking after the local opacity maximum, also suggesting differences in the dust abundance inside and outside Gale.

Cassini UVIS Detection of Saturn's North Polar Hexagon in the Grand Finale Orbits	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Saturn; hexagon; aurora; ultraviolet; haze; Cassini	IMAGING SPECTROGRAPH; HAZE FORMATION; AURORA; ATMOSPHERE; JUPITER; MORPHOLOGY; CHEMISTRY; ELECTRONS; DIAGNOSIS; BENZENE	Cassini's final orbits in 2016 and 2017 provided unprecedented spatial resolution of Saturn's polar regions from near-polar spacecraft viewing geometries. Long-wavelength channels of Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph instrument detected Saturn's UV-dark north polar hexagon near 180 nm at planetocentric latitudes near 75 degrees N. The dark polar hexagon is surrounded by a larger, less UV-dark collar poleward of planetocentric latitude 65 degrees N associated with the dark north polar region seen in ground-based images. The hexagon is closely surrounded by the main arc of Saturn's UV aurora. The UV-dark material was locally darkest on one occasion (23 January 2017) at the boundary of the hexagon; in most Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph images the dark material more uniformly fills the hexagon. The observed UV-dark stratospheric material may be a hydrocarbon haze produced by auroral ion-neutral chemistry at submicrobar pressure levels. Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph polar observations are sensitive to UV-absorbing haze particles at pressures lower than about 10-20 mbar.	[Pryor, W.

Landslide behaviors can be enigmatic in natural landscapes and therefore require high-quality observations of their kinematics to improve our ability to predict landslide behavior. Here we use geodetic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations to characterize the geometry and the spatio-temporal deformation of the slow-moving, deep-seated Monroe landslide in northern California between 2007 and 2017. InSAR phase discontinuities show that the landslide is bounded by discrete strike-slip faults at the lateral margins and segregated into distinct kinematic elements by normal and thrust faults. We find that the Monroe landslide has been moving consistently, with a maximum rate of about 0.7 m/year in the narrowest longitudinal center of the transport zone. The thickest landslide mass is estimated to be in a zone located between subsiding and the uplifting kinematic elements at the lower transport zone. The timing and magnitude of the landslide displacement are modulated by the intensity and duration of precipitation, as well as the antecedent water content of the landslide mass. In addition, we use a one-dimensional pore-water pressure diffusion model to estimate the rainfall-modulated pore-water pressure changes and hydraulic diffusivity. We find hydraulic diffusivity values between 6.8+2.9-2.0x10-5 m(2)/s, which agrees with ground-based measurements in this region. Displacement measurements on the hillslopes obtained from geodetic InSAR observations allow us to characterize the mobility, depth, and hydraulic diffusivity of slow-moving landslides.

Multicomponent Satellite Assessment of Drought Severity in the Contiguous United States From 2002 to 2017 Using AMSR-E and AMSR2	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							MICROWAVE SCANNING RADIOMETER; SOIL-MOISTURE; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; WATER STORAGE; FLASH DROUGHTS; HIGH-PLAINS; INDEX; DEFICIT; CLASSIFICATION; ASSIMILATION	The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 sensors (AMSR) have provided multifrequency microwave measurements of the global terrestrial water cycle since 2002. A new AMSR surface wetness index (ASWI) was developed by analyzing the near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), surface volumetric soil moisture (VSM), and land surface fractional open water (FW) time series from an established AMSR Land Parameter Data Record (LPDR). The ASWI allows for multicomponent and independent satellite assessments of near-surface drought conditions by exploiting the weighted anomalies of VPD, VSM, and FW. Comparisons between ASWI and more traditional drought metrics, including the Palmer moisture anomaly index (PDSI-Z) and the U.S. Drought Monitor, showed generally consistent classifications of drought severity for three major droughts over the Contiguous United States since 2002. The AWSI showed moderate (0.3 <= R <= 0.7 for 56% of area) to strong (R > 0.7 for 29% of area) correlations with the PDSI-Z during the summer months (June-August) from 2002 to 2017. ASWI and PDSI-Z differences were attributed to AMSR retrieval uncertainties and the different aspects of drought represented by the indices. Comparisons between ASWI and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment drought severity index (GRACE-DSI) showed strong correspondence (R = 0.61) in regions where possible long-term total water storage changes occurred. The sole reliance of the ASWI on satellite microwave remote sensing and continuing AMSR2 operations enables effective global monitoring of drought conditions while providing new information on the atmosphere, soil, and surface water components of drought. Plain Language Summary Extreme hydrologic events affect the economy, environment, and society. The anomalies of the water cycle components are associated with drought events. Considering the capability of multifrequency microwave remote sensing in observing multiple water cycle components, this study developed a new surface wetness index by analyzing near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, volumetric soil moisture, and land surface water inundation time series from an established satellite data record. The new index showed consistent assessment of major drought events relative to traditional drought monitors while providing enhanced information on the water cycle components of drought. A combined analysis of the index with satellite total water storage measurements provides complementary information on the different aspects of droughts, including relatively dynamic surface water changes and slower evolving groundwater conditions. The index enables independent and continuous satellite assessment of global drought conditions.	[Du, J.; Kimball, J. S.; Jones, L.

Comparing Aerial Lidar Observations With Terrestrial Lidar and Snow-Probe Transects From NASA's 2017 SnowEx Campaign	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SOUTHERN SIERRA-NEVADA; DEPTH DISTRIBUTION; SCANNING LIDAR; VEGETATION; FOREST; ACCUMULATION; ELEVATION; ACCURACY; ERRORS	NASA's 2017 SnowEx field campaign at Grand Mesa, CO, generated Airborne Laser Scans (ALS), Terrestrial Laser Scans (TLS), and snow-probe transects, which allowed for a comparison between snow depth measurement techniques. At six locations, comparisons between gridded ALS and TLS observations, at 1-m resolution, had a median snow depth difference of 5 cm, root-mean-square difference of 16 cm, mean-absolute difference of 10 cm, and 3-cm difference in standard deviation. ALS generally had greater but similar snow depth values to TLS, and results were not sensitive to the gridded cell size between 0.5 and 5 m. The greatest disagreements were where snow-off TLS scans had shrubs and high incidence angles, leading to deeper snow depths (>10 cm) from ALS than TLS. The low vegetation and oblique angles caused occlusion in the TLS data and thus produced higher snow-off bare Earth models relative to the ALS. Furthermore, in subcanopy areas where both ALS and TLS data existed, snow depth differences were comparable to differences in the open. Meanwhile, median values from 52 snow-probe transects and near-coincident ALS data had a mean difference of 6 cm, root-mean-square difference of 8 cm, mean-absolute difference of 7 cm, and a mean difference in the standard deviation of 1 cm. Snow depth probes had greater but similar snow depth values to ALS. Therefore, based on comparisons with TLS and snow depth probes, ALS captured snow depth magnitude with better than or equal agreement to what has been reported in previous studies and showed the ability to capture high-resolution spatial variability.

Retrieval of Chemical Abundances in Titan's Upper Atmosphere From Cassini UVIS Observations With Pointing Motion	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							PHOTOABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; VUV; REGION; THERMOSPHERE; MESOSPHERE; EUV; HCN	Cassini/Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) Far-UV observations of stellar occultations at Titan are well suited for probing its atmospheric composition and structure. However, due to instrument pointing motion, only 5 out of tens of observations have been analyzed. We present an innovative retrieval method that corrects for the effect of pointing motion by forward modeling the Cassini/UVIS instrument response function with the pointing motion value obtained from the SPICE C-kernel along the spectral dimension. To illustrate the methodology, an occultation observation made during flyby T52 is analyzed, when the Cassini spacecraft had insufficient attitude control. A high-resolution stellar model and an instrument response simulator that includes the position of the point source on the detector are used for the analysis of the pointing motion. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to retrieve the line-of-sight abundance profiles of eleven species (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, HCN, C4H2, C6N2, C6H6, haze, HC3N, and C2N2) in the spectral vector fitting process. We obtain tight constraints on all of the species aside from C2H6, C2N2, and C6N2, for which we only retrieved upper limits. This is the first time that the T52 occultation was used to derive abundances of major hydrocarbon and nitrile species in Titan's upper and middle atmosphere, as pointing motion prohibited prior analysis. With this new method, nearly all of the occultations obtained over the entire Cassini mission could yield reliable profiles of atmospheric composition, allowing exploration of Titan's upper atmosphere over seasons, latitudes, and longitudes.

Simulation of Remote Sensing of Clouds and Humidity From Space using a Combined Platform of Radar and Multifrequency Microwave Radiometers	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES; ICE; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEM; INSTRUMENT; GHZ	This study presents a simulated simultaneous retrieval of mass mean cloud ice particle effective diameter, ice water content, water vapor, and temperature profiles using a combination of a 94-GHz cloud radar and multifrequency (118, 183, 240, 310, 380, 664, and 850 GHz) millimeter- and submillimeter-wave radiometers from a space platform. The retrieval capabilities and uncertainties of the combined radar and microwave radiometers are quantified. We show that this combined active and passive remote sensing approach with SmallSat technologies addresses a gap in the current state-of-the-art remote sensing measurements of ice cloud properties, especially deriving vertical profiles of ice cloud particle sizes in the atmosphere together with the ambient thermodynamic conditions. Therefore, this new approach can serve as a plausible candidate for future missions that target cloud and precipitation processes to improve weather forecasts and climate predictions.

The results show good agreement between model and Microwave Limb Sounder observations. We also investigate the anomalous period 2015-2016, when the QBO winds deviated significantly from their climatological values.

Effects of Improved O-17 Correction on Interlaboratory Agreement in Clumped Isotope Calibrations, Estimates of Mineral-Specific Offsets, and Temperature Dependence of Acid Digestion Fractionation	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						clumped isotopes; stable isotopes; calibration; standardization	MULTIPLY SUBSTITUTED ISOTOPOLOGUES; CARBONATE FORMATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CAVE SPELEOTHEMS; DELTA(47) VALUES; C-13-O-18 BONDS; REFERENCE FRAME; STABLE-ISOTOPE; WATER CORALS; CO2	The clumped isotopic composition of carbonate-derived CO2 (denoted Delta(47)) is a function of carbonate formation temperature and in natural samples can act as a recorder of paleoclimate, burial, or diagenetic conditions. The absolute abundance of heavy isotopes in the universal standards VPDB and VSMOW (defined by four parameters: R-VPDB(13), R-VSMOW(17), R-VSMOW(18), and lambda) impact calculated Delta(47) values. Here, we investigate whether use of updated and more accurate values for these parameters can remove observed interlaboratory differences in the measured T-Delta(47) relationship. Using the updated parameters, we reprocess 14 published calibration data sets measured in 11 different laboratories, representing many mineralogies, bulk compositions, sample types, reaction temperatures, and sample preparation and analysis methods. Exploiting this large composite data set (n = 1,253 sample replicates), we investigate the possibility for a universal clumped isotope calibration. We find that applying updated parameters improves the T-Delta(47) relationship (reduces residuals) within most labs and improves overall agreement but does not eliminate all interlaboratory differences. We reaffirm earlier findings that different mineralogies do not require different calibration equations and that cleaning procedures, method of pressure baseline correction, and mass spectrometer type do not affect interlaboratory agreement. We also present new estimates of the temperature dependence of the acid digestion fractionation for Delta(47) (Delta*(25-X)), based on combining reprocessed data from four studies, and new theoretical equilibrium values to be used in calculation of the empirical transfer function. Overall, we have ruled out a number of possible causes of interlaboratory disagreement in the T-Delta(47) relationship, but many more remain to be investigated. Plain Language Summary Measured stable and clumped isotope values are fundamentally tied to established compositions of international standard materials. When these standard compositions are updated, it impacts previously published isotope measurements such as those used to define the clumped isotope calibration relationship (the foundation for use of this isotopic proxy as a paleothermometer, recorder of burial history or past diagenetic conditions). Here we reprocess 14 published clumped isotope calibration studies using updated international standard compositions and identical data processing procedures to see if these changes would eliminate previously observed interlaboratory discrepancies in clumped isotope calibration relationships. We find that this update tightens the clumped isotope calibration relationship within most laboratories and improves overall agreement between laboratories but does not eliminate all interlaboratory differences. We also propose best practices for data processing and dissemination going forward. This study makes progress toward resolving discrepancies in clumped isotope calibration relationships between laboratories by eliminating a number of possible causes and moves the clumped isotope community closer toward our ultimate goal of applying this powerful new proxy routinely to exciting science questions.

The Climate Data Toolbox for MATLAB	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article							OSCILLATION; TRENDS; MODE	Climate science is highly interdisciplinary by nature, so understanding interactions between Earth processes inherently warrants the use of analytical software that can operate across the disciplines of Earth science. Toward this end, we present the Climate Data Toolbox for MATLAB, which contains more than 100 functions that span the major climate-related disciplines of Earth science. The toolbox enables streamlined, entirely scriptable workflows that are intuitive to write and easy to share. Included are functions to evaluate uncertainty, perform matrix operations, calculate climate indices, and generate common data displays. Documentation is presented pedagogically, with thorough explanations of how each function works and tutorials showing how the toolbox can be used to replicate results of published studies. As a well-tested, well-documented platform for interdisciplinary collaborations, the Climate Data Toolbox for MATLAB aims to reduce time spent writing low-level code, let researchers focus on physics rather than coding and encourage more efficacious code sharing. Plain Language Summary This article describes a collection of computer code that has recently been released to help scientists analyze many types of Earth science data. The code in this toolbox makes it easy to investigate things like global warming, El Nino, or other major climate-related processes such as how winds affect ocean circulation. Although the toolbox was designed to be used by expert climate scientists, its instruction manual is well written, and beginners may be able to learn a great deal about coding and Earth science, simply by following along with the provided examples. The toolbox is intended to help scientists save time, help them ensure their analysis is accurate, and make it easy for other scientists to repeat the results of previous studies.

Optical remote sensing is often employed to map total suspended solids (TSS), though algorithms typically have limited transferability in space and time due to variability in water constituent compositions, mixtures, and inherent optical properties. This study used in situ spectral reflectances and their first derivatives to compare empirical algorithms for estimating TSS using hyperspectral and multispectral data. These algorithms were applied to imagery collected by NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) over coastal Louisiana, USA, and validated with a multiyear in situ dataset. The best performing models were then applied to independent spectroscopic data collected in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada, and the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary, USA, to assess their robustness and transferability. A derivative-based partial least squares regression (PLSR) model applied to simulated AVIRIS-NG data showed the most accurate TSS retrievals (R-2 = 0.83) in these contrasting deltaic environments. These results highlight the potential for a more broadly applicable generalized algorithm employing imaging spectroscopy for estimating suspended solids.

This study presents a new multi-variant regression model to estimate LFM in the Mediterranean ecosystem of Southern California, USA, using the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band radiometer soil moisture (SMAP SM) from April 2015 to December 2018 over 12 chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) LFM sites. The two-month lag between SMAP SM and LFM was utilized either as steps to synchronize the SMAP SM to the LFM series or as the leading time window to calculate the accumulative SMAP SM. Cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs) were also employed to address the impact from heat. Models were constructed separately for the green-up and brown-down periods. An inverse exponential weight function was applied in the calculation of accumulative SMAP SM to address the different contribution to the LFM between the earlier and present SMAP SM. The model using the weighted accumulative SMAP SM and CGDDs yielded the best results and outperformed the reference model using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Visible Atmospherically Resistance Index. Our study provides a new way to empirically estimate the LFM in chaparral areas and extends the application of SMAP SM in the study of wildfire risk.

A deep space mission equipped with a modest telescope and coronagraph, traveling to the focal area of the SGL that begins at similar to 548 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, offers an opportunity for direct megapixel imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy of a habitable Earth-like exoplanet.

Consistency of cosmic microwave background temperature measurements in three frequency bands in the 2500-square-degree SPT-SZ survey	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						CMBR experiments; cosmological parameters from CMBR		We present an internal consistency test of South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy using three-band data from the SPT-SZ survey. These measurements are made from observations of similar to 2500 deg(2) of sky in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We combine the information from these three bands into six semi-independent estimates of the CMB power spectrum (three single-frequency power spectra and three cross-frequency spectra) over the multipole range 650 < l < 3000. We subtract an estimate of foreground power from each power spectrum and evaluate the consistency among the resulting CMB-only spectra. We determine that the six foreground-cleaned power spectra are consistent with the null hypothesis, in which the six cleaned spectra contain only CMB power and noise. A fit of the data to this model results in a chi(2) value of 236.3 for 235 degrees of freedom, and the probability to exceed this chi(2) value is 46%.	[Mocanu, L. M.; Crawford, T. M.; Benson, B.

The aircraft based soil moisture data provided by the passive/active microwave sensor PALS (Passive and Active L-band System) has a nominal spatial resolution of 1600 m. However, this resolution is not compatible with agricultural, meteorological and hydrological studies that require high spatial resolutions and this issue can be solved by soil moisture disaggregation. The soil moisture disaggregation algorithm integrates radiometer soil moisture retrievals and high-resolution radar observations and it can provide soil moisture estimates at a finer scale than the radiometer data alone. In this study, a change detection algorithm was used for disaggregation of coarse resolution passive microwave soil moisture retrievals with radar backscatter coefficients obtained from the higher spatial resolution UAVSAR (Unmanned Air Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) at crop field scale. The accuracy of the disaggregated change in soil moisture was evaluated using ground based soil moisture measurements collected during SMAPVEX12 campaign. The results showed that soil moisture spatial variabilities were better characterized by the disaggregated change in soil moisture estimates at 5 m/800 m resolution as well as a good agreement between disaggregated estimates and in situ measurements. It also showed that VWC (Vegetation Water Content) did not have a big impact on disaggregation algorithm performance, with R-2 of the disaggregated results ranging 0.628-0.794. The 5 m and 800 m resolution disaggregated soil moisture did no show significant difference in statistical performance variables.

Here, we analyzed a severe summer drought affecting the US Northern Plains region in 2017. We examined the spatial pattern and seasonal progression of vegetation productivity and water use in the region using satellite-based estimates of field-scale (30 m) cropland evapotranspiration (ET), county level annual crop production statistics, and GOME-2 satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). The cropland ET record shows strong potential to track seasonal cropland water demands spatially, with strong correspondence to regional climate variables in the Northern Plains. The GOME-2 SIF record shows significant but limited correlations with finer scale climate variability due to the coarse sensor footprint, but captured an anomalous regional productivity decline coincident with drought related decreases in crop production and ET. The drought contributed to an overall 25% reduction in cropland ET, 6% decrease in crop production, and 11% reduction in SIF productivity over the region from April to September in 2017 relative to the longer (2008-2017) satellite record. More severely impacted agricultural areas indicated by the US Drought Monitor exceptional drought (D4) category represented 11% of the region and showed much larger anomalous ET (20%-81%) and productivity (11%-73%) declines. The regional pattern of drought impacts indicated more severe productivity and ET reductions in the north central and southern counties with extensive agriculture, and less impact in the western counties of the Northern Plains. This study provides a multiscale assessment of drought related impacts on regional productivity and ET over a crop intensive region, emphasizing the use of global satellite observations capable of informing regional to global scale water and food security assessments.

Random spatial fluctuations of the beam can be induced by atmospheric as well as mechanical phenomena. In order to control a compensator for driving the beam to the center of the detector, we must be able to infer the location of the centroid with only rudimentary spatial information (the number of photons that have hit each quadrant of the detector). We close this control loop by making a reduction to the task of signal intensity reconstruction via an inverse problem, proving non-asymptotic estimation error bounds for the previously published method and novel simplification, and presenting two novel estimation schemes that empirically perform better in near-and medium-range deep space settings. Our centroid estimation method is the first procedure in the literature proved to be consistent.

To simulate a Euclid-like and a WEIRST-like survey, we place galaxies into a large-volume dark matter halo lightconc by sampling a library of luminosity-dependent halo occupation distributions (HMO, which is constructed using a physically motivated galaxy formation model. We calibrate the dust attenuation in the lightcones such that they are able to reproduce the 1-101 luminosity function or the HU cumulative number counts. The angle-averaged galaxy correlation function is computed for each survey in redshift slices of width A z = 0.2. In each redshift bin the linear bias can be fitted with a single, scale-independent value that increases with increasing redshift. Fitting for the evolution of linear bias with redshift, we rind that our Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys are both consistent within error with the relation b(z) = 0.7z 0.7. Our bias forecasts are consistent with bias measurements from the IliZELS survey. We rind that the Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys yield linear biases that are broadly consistent within error, most likely due to the IIOD for the WFIRST-like survey having a steeper power-law slope towards larger halo masses.

Separating extended disc features from the protoplanet in PDS 70 using VLT/SINFONI	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: image processing planet disc interactions protoplanetary discs stars: individual: PDS 70.	INTEGRAL FIELD SPECTROSCOPY; ACCRETION RATES; PLANET; CONTRAST; COMPANION; SINFONI; STARS	Transition discs are prime targets to look for protoplanets and study planet disc interactions. We present VLF/SINFONE observations of PDS 70, a transition disc with a recently claimed embedded protoplanet. We take advantage of the angular and spectral diversity present in our data for an optimal PSF modelling and subtraction using principal component analysis (PCA). We report the redetection of PDS 7() b, both the front and far side of the outer disc edge, and the detection of several extended features in the annular gap. We compare spectral differential imaging applied before (PCA-SARI), and after (PCA-ASDI) angular differential imaging. Our tests suggest that PCA-SADI better recovers extended features, while PCA-ASDI is more sensitive to point sources. We adapted the negative fake companion (NEGFC) technique to infer the astrometry of the companion, and derived r = 193.5 4.9 mas and PA =158.7' 3.0. We used both NEGFC and ANDROMEDA to infer the K-band spectro-photometry of the protoplanet, and found results consistent with recent VLF/SPHERE observations, except for their 2018/02 epoch measurement in the K2 filter. Finally, we derived an upper limit of /1;//, < 1.26 x 10-7 [D114h1 [ MT yr I for the accretion rate of the companion based on an uP adaptation of PCA-SADI/PCA-ASDI around the Dry line (assuming no extinction).

Simulating White Light Images of Coronal Structures for WISPR/Parker Solar Probe: Effects of the Near-Sun Elliptical Orbit	SOLAR PHYSICS			English	Article						Corona; Solar wind	WIND; TRACKING	The three-to-five-month elliptical orbit of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), approaching within 10 solar radii of the Sun, will allow the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) to view the corona with unprecedented spatial resolution from multiple viewpoints. WISPR has a wide fixed angular field of view, extending from 13.5 degrees to 108 degrees from the Sun and approximately 50 degrees in the transverse direction, but the physical extent of the imaged coronal region varies directly with the distance of the spacecraft from the Sun. In a solar encounter period of approximately 10 days around perihelion, PSP covers over 100-200 degrees of heliographic longitude and the distance from the Sun varies by a factor of two to five. In this paper, we use synthetic white-light images to study the effects of the rapid elliptical orbit on the images that can be anticipated for WISPR's observations. We find that sequences of images can help identify coronal density features that will be sampled by in-situ instruments. We also find that the multiple viewpoints, provided by the rapid motion near perihelion, can be used to obtain three-dimensional information on the coronal density features.

The advantage of remote sensing is that it provides wall-to-wall observations including in regions where in situ monitoring is challenging. This paper reviews how satellite observations of the biosphere have helped improve our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle. First, it details how remotely sensed information of the land surface has provided new means to monitor vegetation dynamics and estimate carbon fluxes and stocks. Second, we present examples of studies which have used satellite products to evaluate and improve simulations from global vegetation models. Third, we focus on model data integration approaches ranging from bottom-up extrapolation of single variables to carbon cycle data assimilation system able to ingest multiple types of observations. Finally, we present an overview of upcoming satellite missions which are likely to further improve our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle and its response to climate change and extremes.

These missions are dependent on accurate and representative in situ datasets for the training of their algorithms and product validation. However, long-term ground-based forest-monitoring systems are limited, especially in the tropics, and to be useful for validation, such ground-based observation systems need to be regularly revisited andmaintained at least over the lifetime of the planned missions. Here we propose a strategy for a coordinated and global network of in situ data that would benefit biomass remote sensing missions. We propose to build upon existing networks of long-term tropical forest monitoring.To produce accurate ground-based biomass estimates, strict data quality must be guaranteed to users. It is more rewarding to invest ground resources at sites where there currently isassurance of a long-term commitment locally and where a core set of data is already available. We call these supersites'. Long-term funding for such an inter-agency endeavour remains an important challenge, and we here provide costing estimates to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders. One critical requirement is to ensure in situ data availability over the lifetime of remote sensing missions. To this end, consistent guidelines for supersite selection and management are proposed within the Forest Observation System, long-term funding should be assured, andprincipal investigators of the sites should be activelyinvolved.

However, forest biomass is never directly measured; thus, upscaling it from trees to stand or larger scales (e.g., countries, regions) relies on a series of statistical models that may propagate large errors. Here, we review the main steps usually adopted in forest aboveground biomass mapping, highlighting the major challenges and perspectives. We show that there is room for improvement along the scaling-up chain from field data collection to satellite-based large-scale mapping, which should lead to the adoption of effective practices to better control the propagation of errors. We specifically illustrate how the increasing use of emerging technologies to collect massive amounts of high-quality data may significantly improve the accuracy of forest carbon maps. Furthermore, we discuss how sources of spatially structured biases that directly propagate into remote sensing models need to be better identified and accounted for when extrapolating forest carbon estimates, e.g., through a stratification design. We finally discuss the increasing realism of 3D simulated stands, which, through radiative transfer modelling, may contribute to a better understanding of remote sensing signals and open avenues for the direct calibration of large-scale products, thereby circumventing several current difficulties.

Largely because of these mission datasets, the number of available biomass products is expected to greatly increase over the coming decade. Despite the recognized importance of biomass mapping for a wide range of science, policy and management applications, there remains no community accepted standard for satellite-based biomass map validation. The Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) is developing a protocol to fill this need in advance of the next generation of biomass-relevant satellites, and this paper presents a review of biomass validation practices from a CEOS perspective. We outline the wide range of anticipated user requirements for product accuracy assessment and provide recommendations for the validation of biomass products. These recommendations include the collection of new, high-quality in situ data and the use of airborne lidar biomass maps as tools toward transparent multi-resolution validation. Adoption of community-vetted validation standards and practices will facilitate the uptake of the next generation of biomass products.

Assessment of CALIOP and MODIS aerosol products over Iran to explore air quality	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						CALIPSO; Aerosol; Dust; VFM; MODIS DBOD; MODIS AOD; PM10	LEVEL PM10 CONCENTRATION; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; OPTICAL DEPTH; CALIPSO LIDAR; SATELLITE; CLOUD; PM2.5; EXTINCTION; REGRESSION; RETRIEVAL	Monitoring air quality is crucial for Middle East countries such as Iran, where dust and polluted aerosol sources heavily influence local air quality. The use of active satellite remote sensing techniques is therefore considered in monitoring air quality. This study presents an initial assessment of NASA's Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol data over Tabriz and Mashhad cities in the north-western and north-eastern regions of Iran. We examined the Cloud and Aerosol Discrimination (CAD) score values, extinction coefficient, and the CALIOP Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) data product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Depth (DBOD) at wavelength of 0.55 mu m. The ground-based PM10 measurements were analyzed for different time periods, seasons, and years from 2005 to 2016. We investigated the profiles of the particle backscatter and extinction coefficient, as well as information about the determined feature types (e.g., clouds or aerosols) and aerosol subtypes (e.g., dust, and smoke) from the VFM data product in 2months of August 2009 and July 2013, which were statistically selected from 2009 to 2016. Evaluation of the comparison of the relative humidity, temperature, and their inversion shows that the performance of the CALIOP in the detection of aerosols in mid-troposphere (around 5.0km) is better than cloud detection. Additionally, the correlations of the PM10 concentration, MODIS AOD, and MODIS DBOD were investigated for January 2005 to December 2014. The overall analyses show that monthly ground-based PM10 concentration measurements reveal better correlation (r=0.65 and 0.67 for Tabriz and Mashhad, respectively) with monthly MODIS-DBOD than MODIS-AOD for different seasons. The observed differences in the investigation of the CALIPSO dataset with the actual measured values and the overall correlation results show that the cloud and aerosol discrimination algorithm should be modified and calibrated based on local measurements of relative humidity, temperature, and their inversions, MODIS-DBOD, and ground-based PM10 for the Iran region.

Planar low-energy asteroid and comet transit analysis using isolating blocks	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Asteroid; Comet; Isolating block; Transit	QUASI-PERIODIC MAPS; PARAMETERIZATION METHOD; INVARIANT TORI; COMPUTATION; ORBITS; JUPITER; CAPTURE; POINTS; RESONANCE; DYNAMICS	Asteroids and comets often capture and sometimes transit near a planet by traveling through the L1 and L2 libration point gateways, and these regions are therefore key to understanding the mechanism by which captures, transits, and some potential impacts of these bodies occur. Isolating blocks have recently been used to provide a theoretically rigorous method for computing the invariant manifolds of libration point periodic orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP), and for an appropriate energy range, they can allow us to compute all possible transit trajectories at a particular Jacobi constant in the CRTBP. In this study, both L1 and L2 isolating blocks are found for the Sun-Earth and Sun-Jupiter CRTBP systems to rigorously compute trajectories transiting near the Earth and Jupiter in the low-energy regime common for asteroids and comets. The characteristics of these transit trajectories are explored, and individual trajectory solutions are analyzed in more detail. The transit trajectories are also characterized using their orbital elements and compared to known comets and asteroids.

Combined with mineralogical speciation modeling and mineralogical observations, isotopically low CAS isotope values suggest mixing from three isotopically characterized sulfate pools: two isotopically higher sulfate pools, one with the composition of Miocene seawater sulfate and a second isotopically evolved porewater modified by sulfate reducing microbes (SRM), and a third isotopically lower porewater sulfate pool resulting from the oxidation of H2S (produced by SRM) by sulfide oxidizing bacteria (SOB). High carbonate delta C-13 and diagenetic dolomite validates prior claims of methanogenesis. Differences in mineralogy are consistent with differences in isotope ratios (e.g. higher delta C-13 in dolomites), suggesting products from a vertical distribution of oxic to anoxic redox environments and associated ecosystems are preserved. These mineralogical and isotopic fluctuations repeat in various facies changes, suggesting that redox environments fluctuated over time. This interpretation is supported by prior sedimentologic analysis which interpreted that deposition of the phosphatic interval of the Monterey Formation was influenced by gravity-deposition processes promoted by tectonic activity. Gravity-deposition would serve to transport more oxygenated waters to the deep-water depositional environment and support microbially-mediated sulfide oxidation at depth, whereby H2S generated by SRM in the absence of sufficient iron could diffuse upward to a more oxygenated zone. Near the suboxic-oxic boundary, H2S oxidation would decrease porewater pH slightly and inhibit the preservation of carbonate minerals and promote precipitation of phosphate. Increasing depth in sediments generates successively more reducing conditions, promoting sulfate reduction, which may have been coupled with the anaerobic oxidation of methane and carbonate mineral precipitation. The most reducing conditions would support methanogenesis and dolomite production after consumption of the majority of sulfate.

We particularly focus on the BAO scale precision that can be achieved by future spectroscopy-based, kinematic weak lensing (KWL) surveys in comparison to the traditional photometry-based weak lensing surveys. We simulate cosmic shear tomography data of such surveys with a few simple assumptions to focus on the BAO information, extract the spatial power spectrum, and constrain the recovered BAO feature. Due to the small shape noise and the shape of the lensing kernel, we find that a Dark Energy Task Force Stage IV version of such KWL survey can detect the BAO feature in dark matter by 3 sigma and measure the BAO scale at the precision level of 4 per cent, while it will be difficult to detect the feature in photometry-based weak lensing surveys. With a more optimistic assumption, a KWL-Stage IV could achieve a similar to 2 per cent BAO scale measurement with 4.9 sigma confidence. A built-in spectroscopic galaxy survey within such KWL survey will allow cross-correlation between galaxies and cosmic shear, which will tighten the constraint beyond the lower limit we present in this paper and therefore possibly allow a detection of the BAO scale bias between galaxies and dark matter.

Foreground separation is made possible by their intrinsic spectral smoothness, making them distinguishable from spectrally complex cosmological signal even though they are similar to 5 orders of magnitude brighter. Precisely calibrated radio interferometers are essential to maintaining the smoothness and thus separability of the foregrounds. One powerful calibration strategy is to use redundant measurements between pairs of antennas with the same physical separation in order to solve for each antenna's spectral response without reference to a sky model. This strategy is being employed by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a large radio telescope in South Africa that is now observing while being built out to 350 14-m dishes. However, the deviations from perfect redundancy inherent in any real radio telescope complicate the calibration problem. Using simulations of HERA, we show how calibration with antenna-to-antenna variations in dish construction and placement generally leads to spectral structure in otherwise smooth foregrounds that significantly reduces the number of cosmological modes available to a 21 cm measurement. However, we also show that this effect can be largely eliminated by a modified redundant-baseline calibration strategy that relies predominantly on short baselines.

DES Collaboration; SPT Collaboration	Cosmological lensing ratios with DES Y1, SPT, and Planck	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; cosmological parameters; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	DARK ENERGY SURVEY; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; MATTER; CALIBRATION	Correlations between tracers of the matter density field and gravitational lensing are sensitive to the evolution of the matter power spectrum and the expansion rate across cosmic time. Appropriately defined ratios of such correlation functions, on the other hand, depend only on the angular diameter distances to the tracer objects and to the gravitational lensing source planes. Because of their simple cosmological dependence, such ratios can exploit available signal-to-noise ratio down to small angular scales, even where directly modelling the correlation functions is difficult. We present a measurement of lensing ratios using galaxy position and lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, and CMB lensing data from the South Pole Telescope and Planck, obtaining the highest precision lensing ratio measurements to date. Relative to the concordance Lambda CDM model, we find a best-fitting lensing ratio amplitude of A = 1.1 +/- 0.1. We use the ratio measurements to generate cosmological constraints, focusing on the curvature parameter. We demonstrate that photometrically selected galaxies can be used to measure lensing ratios, and argue that future lensing ratio measurements with data from a combination of LSST and Stage-4 CMB experiments can be used to place interesting cosmological constraints, even after considering the systematic uncertainties associated with photometric redshift and galaxy shear estimation.

A brightening of Jupiter's auroral 7.8-mu m CH4 emission during a solar-wind compression	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							COOLED MIDINFRARED CAMERA; STRATOSPHERE; SPECTROMETER; TEMPERATURE; ABUNDANCES; ATMOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; NORTHERN; VOYAGER; REGIONS	Enhanced mid-infrared emission from CH4 and other stratospheric hydrocarbons has been observed coincident with Jupiter's ultraviolet auroral emission(1-3). This suggests that auroral processes and the neutral stratosphere of Jupiter are coupled; however, the exact nature of this coupling is unknown. Here we present a time series of Subaru-COMICS images of Jupiter measured at a wavelength of 7.80 mu m on 11-14 January, 4-5 February and 17-20 May 2017. These data show that both the morphology and magnitude of the auroral CH4 emission vary on daily timescales in relation to external solar-wind conditions. The southern auroral CH4 emission increased in brightness temperature by about 3.8 K between 15:50 UT, 11 January and 12:57 UT, 12 January, during a predicted solar-wind compression. During the same compression, the northern auroral emission exhibited a duskside brightening, which mimics the morphology observed in the ultraviolet auroral emission during periods of enhanced solar-wind pressure(4,5). These results suggest that changes in external solar-wind conditions perturb the Jovian magnetosphere in such a way that energetic particles are accelerated into the planet's atmosphere, deposit their energy as deep as the neutral stratosphere, and modify the thermal structure, the abundance of CH4 or the population of energy states of CH4. We also find that the northern and southern auroral CH4 emission evolved independently between the January, February and May images, as has been observed at X-ray wavelengths over shorter timescales(6) and at mid-infrared wavelengths over longer timescales(7).

A corridor of exposed ice-rich bedrock across Titan's tropical region	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							CASSINI RADAR OBSERVATIONS; SURFACE-COMPOSITION; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; VIMS; TOPOGRAPHY; SAR; ATMOSPHERE; ORIGIN; LAKES; DUNE	Global maps of Titan show great diversity in terrain types, but their associations with specific compositions on a large scale are obscured by Titan's thick atmosphere, which shrouds the weak spectral features. Here we develop a principal component analysis (PCA) that enables the identification of subtle spectral features. The PCA was applied to over 13,000 Cassini/VIMS spectra that cover half of Titan's globe, focused on tropical latitudes. Our analysis detected an ice-rich linear feature of bedrock, which extends a length equivalent to 40 per cent of Titan's circumference. This corridor is puzzling because it does not correlate with topography or measurements of the subsurface. Ice-rich terrains in other areas of Titan occur only in local regions excavated by craters or exposed by erosion, suggesting that cryovolcanism, if active, is currently not widespread. We also find evidence for a diversity of organic sediments, formed by the photolysis of Titan's past atmospheres, which remain to be investigated, perhaps using a similar approach.

The changing temperature of the nucleus of comet 67P induced by morphological and seasonal effects	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							WATER ICE; THERMAL PHYSICS; DUST MANTLE; SURFACE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; ASTEROIDS; ROUGHNESS; SYSTEM	Knowledge of the surface temperature distribution on a comet's nucleus and its temporal evolution at different timescales is key to constraining its thermophysical properties and understanding the physical processes that take place at and below the surface. Here we report on time-resolved maps of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko retrieved on the basis of infrared data acquired by the Visible InfraRed and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) onboard the Rosetta orbiter in 2014, over a roughly two-month period in the pre-perihelion phase at heliocentric distances between 3.62 and 3.31 au from the Sun. We find that at a spatial resolution <= 15 m per pixel, the measured temperatures point out the major effect that self-heating, due to the complex shape of the nucleus, has on the diurnal temperature variation. The bilobate nucleus of comet 67P also induces daytime shadowing effects, which result in large thermal gradients. Over longer periods, VIRTIS-derived temperature values reveal seasonal changes driven by decreasing heliocentric distance combined with an increasing abundance of ice within the uppermost centimetre-thick layer, which implies the possibility of having a largely pristine nucleus interior already in the shallow subsurface.

Applied reflectance- and radiance-based approaches critically rely on accurate estimates of surface irradiance. Accurate retrievals of surface irradiance are, however, nontrivial and often error-prone, thus causing inaccurate estimates of vegetation information. We analyze the irradiance field surrounding an isolated tree using the 3-D radiative transfer model DART in high spatial (25 cm) and spectral (1 nm, 350-2500 nm) resolution. We validate modeled irradiance with in situ measurements and quantify the impact of erroneous surface irradiance estimates on the retrieval of vegetation indices. We observe the irradiance gradients in the cast shadows of <560% in the blue spectral range, while this gradient decreases with increasing wavelength and becomes negligible in the near infrared (NIR). Furthermore, we quantify a vegetation-induced decrease in the irradiance of <6% in the visible spectral region and an increase of <7% in the NIR outside the cast shadow. Commonly employed vegetation indices are also affected by such brightening or darkening effects. Outside the cast shadow, indices sensitive to the relative content of chlorophyll (CHL) and carotenoids (CAR) show an overestimation of <14%. The photochemical reflectance index shows an underestimation of <5%. This paper provides first quantitative insight in high spatial and spectral resolution, on the impact of vegetation on its surrounding irradiance field. Findings highlight important implications for vegetation assessments and provide the fundamental base to advance retrievals of vegetation traits and functioning from imaging spectroscopy data.

Since 2009, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and Japan's Greenhouse gasses Observing SATellite teams have conducted annual campaigns at Railroad Valley, NV, USA, for this purpose. These sensors pose special challenges due to their large footprint sizes and view angles. OCO-2 sweeps the playa surface during a targeted overpass of the test site, and records data at a number of viewing angles. The smallest of these is selected for processing, thereby minimizing the off-nadir correction. Surface reflectances at nadir are recorded by the field team, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product is used to provide the small, off-nadir correction. Another MODIS product, the Level 1B top-of-atmosphere radiance product, is used to validate the results and to provide input into the OCO-2 calibration uncertainty estimate. From 11 experiments, the ratio of radiances reported by the OCO-2 Level 1B data product to those from the field campaigns is 1.01, 1.04, and 1.01 for the three OCO-2 spectral bands. These analyses validate the data product absolute calibration, to within the 5% requirement. The need for executing these experiments will be of continued importance to OCO-3. This sensor has an on-hoard calibrator that provides a dark signal and lamps for response trends but does not have the on-board solar-diffuser present on OCO-2, and thus cannot track degradations relative to the Sun.

In this study we analyze daily precipitation indices and compare multiple gridded observational and reanalysis products with regional climate models (RCMs) from the North American component of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) multimodel ensemble. In the context of model evaluation, observational product differences across the contiguous United States (CONUS) are also deemed nontrivial for some indices, especially for annual counts of consecutive wet days and for heavy precipitation indices. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to directly include this observational spread into the model evaluation procedure, enabling visualization and interpretation of model differences relative to a "cloud" of observational uncertainty. Applying MDS to the evaluation of NA-CORDEX RCMs reveals situations of added value from dynamical downscaling, situations of degraded performance from dynamical downscaling, and the sensitivity of model performance to model resolution. On precipitation days, higher-resolution RCMs typically simulate higher mean and extreme precipitation rates than their lower-resolution pairs, sometimes improving model fidelity with observations. These results document the model spread and biases in daily precipitation extremes across the full NA-CORDEX model ensemble. The often-large divergence between in situ observations, satellite data, and reanalysis, shown here for CONUS, is especially relevant for data-sparse regions of the globe where satellite and reanalysis products are extensively relied upon. This highlights the need to carefully consider multiple observational products when evaluating climate models.

J	Matheou, G; Teixeira, J				Matheou, Georgios; Teixeira, Joao			Sensitivity to Physical and Numerical Aspects of Large-Eddy Simulation of Stratocumulus	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article						Boundary layer; Clouds; Stratiform clouds; Large eddy simulations; Model evaluation; performance	CLOUD-TOP ENTRAINMENT; MARINE STRATOCUMULUS; DRIVEN ENTRAINMENT; TURBULENCE; RESOLUTION; CONVECTION; CHEMISTRY; DYNAMICS	A series of numerical experiments where both physical and numerical model parameters are varied with respect to a reference setup is used to investigate the physics of a stratocumulus cloud and the performance of a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. The simulations show a delicate balance of physical processes with some sensitivities amplified by numerical model features. A strong feedback between cloud liquid, cloud-top radiative cooling, and turbulence leads to slow grid convergence of the turbulent fluxes. For a methodology that diagnoses cloud liquid from conserved variables, small errors in the total water amount result in large liquid water errors, which are amplified by the cloud-top radiative cooling leading to large variations of buoyancy forcing. In contrast, when the liquid-radiation-buoyancy feedback is not present in simulations without radiation, the turbulence structure of the boundary layer remains essentially identical for grid resolutions between 20 and 1.25 m. The present runs suggest that the buoyancy reversal instability significantly enhances the entrainment rate. Even though cloud-top radiative cooling is regarded as a key attribute of stratocumulus, the present simulations suggest that surface fluxes and surface shear significantly contribute to the total turbulent kinetic energy. Turbulence spectra exhibit inertial range scaling away from the confinement effects of the surface and inversion. Fine grid resolution LESs agree with observations, especially with respect to cloud liquid and vertical velocity variance, and exhibit grid convergence without any model tuning or ad hoc model choices.

In preparation for the data analysis, in July 2017, the marsquake service initiated a blind test in which participants were asked to detect and characterize seismicity embedded in a one Earth year long synthetic data set of continuous waveforms. Synthetic data were computed for a single station, mimicking the streams that will be available from InSight as well as the expected tectonic and impact seismicity, and noise conditions on Mars (Clinton et al., 2017). In total, 84 teams from 20 countries registered for the blind test and 11 of them submitted their results in early 2018. The collection of documentations, methods, ideas, and codes submitted by the participants exceeds 100 pages. The teams proposed well established as well as novel methods to tackle the challenging target of building a global seismicity catalog using a single station. This article summarizes the performance of the teams and highlights the most successful contributions.

Using the Gaia-measured distance and broadband photometry, we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with the TESS transits from three sectors, the corresponding stellar parameters yield planet radii ranging from 0.8 R-circle plus to 1.6 R-circle plus. All three planets have short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data Validation Report and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false-positive sources. These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright (V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near-resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will be observed in four more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information on the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional planets in the system.

J	Sherwood, B				Sherwood, Brent			Principles for a practical Moon base	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article								NASA planning for the human space flight frontier is coming into alignment with the goals of other planetary-capable national space agencies and independent commercial actors. US Space Policy Directive 1 made this shift explicit: "the United States will lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization". The stage is now set for public and private American investment in a wide range of lunar activities. Assumptions about Moon base architectures and operations are likely to drive the invention of requirements that will in turn govern development of systems, commercial-services purchase agreements, and priorities for technology investment. Yet some fundamental architecture-shaping lessons already captured in the literature are not clearly being used as drivers, and remain absent from typical treatments of lunar base concepts. A prime example is general failure to recognize that most of the time (i.e., before and between intermittent human occupancy), a Moon base must be robotic: most of the activity, most of the time, must be implemented by robot agents rather than astronauts. This paper reviews key findings of a seminal robotic-base design-operations analysis commissioned by NASA in 1989. It discusses implications of these lessons for today's Moon Village and SPD-1 paradigms: exploration by multiple actors; public-private partnership development and operations; cislunar infrastructure; production-quantity exploitation of volatile resources near the poles to bootstrap further space activities; autonomy capability that was frontier in 1989 but now routine within terrestrial industry. It outlines new work underway to close these gaps; and articulates conclusions that can guide future work.

Wide band Ocean Altimetry Using Ku-Band and K-Band Satellite Signals of Opportunity: Proof of Concept	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Coastal altimetry; oceanography; signals of opportunity (SoOp); wideband signal	DYNAMICS; PARIS	A proof-of-concept experiment has demonstrated that wideband (400 MHz) signals of opportunity (SoOp) transmitted in K- and Ku-hands from geostationary satellites can be used for coastal altimetry. An essential finding from this experiment is that the full broadcast spectrum consisting of multiple digital channels can be processed as a single wideband signal source. An established error model for Global Navigation Satellite System interferometric altimetry was shown to accurately represent the sea surface height (SSH) retrievals when evaluated using the full bandwidth. This experiment was conducted over a 72-h period at Platform Harvest off the Pacific Coast. Colocated tide gauge and LiDAR measurements were used as in situ data. Two anomalies were observed in the experiment: 1) multiple peaks in the cross correlation waveform from one polarization of Ku-band frequency and 2) decrease in signal-to-noise ratio from loss of a data channel. When the instances of multiple peaks were eliminated and the equivalent bandwidth recomputed using only the active channels, SSH error from these cases agreed well with the model prediction. Application of SoOp wideband altimetry will, therefore, require a monitoring capability to identify changes in the transmission spectrum, total power, and waveform shape, for quality control and setting an appropriate observation error covariance. Measurement precision from a satellite receiver is predicted to be between 4 and 6 cm using the error model. SoOp altimetry with these signals may improve coastal measurements and increase the sampling and revisit rate through the use of a constellation of small satellites.

Slurry extrusion on Ceres from a convective mud-bearing mantle	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							GRAVITY-FIELD; SUSPENSIONS; RHEOLOGY; STABILITY; ORIGIN; FLOW	Ceres is a 940-km-diameter dwarf planet that is predominantly composed of silicates and water ice. In Ceres' partially differentiated interior, extrusive processes have led to the emplacement on its surface of domes with heights of kilometres. Here we report the analysis of a gravity anomaly detected by the Dawn spacecraft, which is associated with the geologically recent dome Ahuna Mons. By modelling the anomaly with a mass concentration method, we determine that the subsurface structure includes a regional mantle uplift, which we interpret as a plume. This structure is the probable source of fluids forming Ahuna Mons and, together with constraints from the dome's morphology, indicates a rheological regime corresponding to a slurry of brine and solid particles. We propose that the properties of such a solid-liquid mixture can explain the viscous relaxation and the mineralogy of the dome. The presence of a plume and of slurry material indicate recent convection in a mud-bearing mantle. The inferred slurry extrusion on Ceres differs from the water-dominated cryovolcanism of icy satellites, and so reveals compositional and rheological diversity in extrusive phenomena on planetary surfaces.

Although less known than magmatic eruptions, gas-driven eruptions expel fragments of preexisting rocks, volcanic gases, and steam, causing substantial casualties. The destructive potential of these eruptions lies in the difficulty in identifying clear warning signals. Some gas-driven eruptions have been preceded by some physicochemical changes, but these were extremely short-term (from minutes to hours), and no long-term trends have been clearly evidenced so far. Here, we show that unheralded gas-driven eruptions can be forecast in the long term using seismic signals recorded at nearby active craters. In particular, we have found that the most recent gas-driven eruptions at Kawah Ijen (Indonesia) and Ruapehu and Tongariro (New Zealand) volcanoes were all preceded by a systematic relative increase in lower-frequency (4.5-8 Hz) seismic amplitude compared to higher frequencies (8-16 Hz) over time scales of months to years. We show that this precursory activity reflects significant increases in seismic attenuation affecting preferentially high-frequency travelling waves; this probably results from the accumulation of volatiles in the shallow crust, which increases pore pressure in small-scale rock heterogeneities and eventually leads to gas-driven eruptions. Our results highlight the feasibility of better constraining the onset and the end of an unrest episode, which is of paramount importance for agencies in charge of volcano monitoring.

Management and reduction of human-induced disturbances on ecosystems can mitigate the effects of climate change and enhance the ecosystem recovery process. Here, we investigate coupled human and climate effects on the wetland ecosystem of the lower Helmand basin from 1977 to 2014. Using time series climate-variable data and land-use changes from Landsat time series imagery, we compared changes in ecosystem status between the upstream and downstream regions. Results show that despite a strong and prolonged drought in the region, the upstream region of the lower Helmand basin remained dominated by agriculture, causing severe water stress on the Hamoun wetlands downstream. The loss of available water in wetlands was followed by large-scale land abandonment in rural areas, migration to the cities, and increasing unemployment and economic hardship. Our results suggest that unsustainable land-use policies in the upstream region, combined with synergistic effects of human activities and climate in lower Helmand basin, have exacerbated the effects of water stress on local inhabitants in the downstream region.

Space radiation impact on smallsats during maximum and minimum solar activity	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Energetic particles; Galactic cosmic rays; TID; DDD; SEE; COTS	PROTON; PARTICLES; ORBIT; MODEL	The trend towards the development of small satellites, or smallsats, has been increasing over the last few years. However, the harsh space radiation environment in which these smallsats operate provides a challenge to their survivability as their desired mission lengths increase from a few months to several years also. Smallsats typically use commercial off the shelf components (COTS) that are built for ground operations, not space use. Therefore, they may be more susceptible to the hazards of space radiation than traditional spacecraft which are typically designed to withstand the high radiation levels of space. The present paper provides a targeted assessment of representative COTS components using up to date models of the space radiation environment and its effects on smallsats in a polar Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This orbit will be assumed to be sun synchronous (98.5 degrees inclination) and at an altitude of 800 km. We employed the new Solar Accumulated and Peak Proton and Heavy Ion Radiation Environment (SAPPHIRE) model which has been released recently in 2018, ISO-15390 GCR model, and AP8/AE8 models to estimate the space radiation environment for solar particles, galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), and trapped protons and electrons respectively. The basic damage effects that can be produced in materials and electronics in this orbit due to their exposure to the space radiation are evaluated. These effects are the Total Ionizing Dose (TID), Displacement Damage Dose (DDD), and Single Event Effects (SEE) as represented by Single Event Upsets (SEUs). SEU is evaluated for different COTS components which are believed to be representative of an optimum blend of capability and cost-effectiveness for the next generation of smallsats, including 20 nm Xilinx Kintex Ultra Scale FPGA Configuration RAM (XCKU040), 90-nm SRAM, and MLC NAND flash memory (MT29F128G08CBECBH6). For comparative purposes, the analyses are performed for both maximum and minimum solar activity. Based on these comparisons, we find as expected that the space radiation environment parameters vary with solar activity. The fluence of trapped electrons and solar protons at solar maximum are higher than those at solar minimum in contrast to the trapped protons and galactic cosmic rays at low altitudes. On the other hand, TID, DDD, and SEE all show higher values during maximum solar activity than during minimum solar activity. The use of shielding material for small satellites is mandatory for this orbit as observed TID, DDD, and SEES levels that can be reached are potentially of concern to designers. However, using Al shielding thickness of at least 1.5 mm can reduce the radiation effects to acceptable levels, for both maximum and minimum solar activity for missions of moderate (similar to 3 years) duration.

DES Collaboration	Identification of RR Lyrae Stars in Multiband, Sparsely Sampled Data from the Dark Energy Survey Using Template Fitting and Random Forest Classification	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; galaxy: halo; galaxy: structure; methods: statistical; stars: variables: RR Lyrae	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; MILKY-WAY SATELLITE; STELLAR EVOLUTION DATABASE; PERIOD-LUMINOSITY RELATION; VARIABLE-STARS; DWARF GALAXY; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; GLOBULAR-CLUSTER; HALO STRUCTURE; DISCOVERY	Many studies have shown that RR Lyrae variable stars (RRL) are powerful stellar tracers of Galactic halo structure and satellite galaxies. The Dark Energy Survey (DES), with its deep and wide coverage (g similar to 23.5 mag in a single exposure; over 5000 deg(2)) provides a rich opportunity to search for substructures out to the edge of the Milky Way halo. However, the sparse and unevenly sampled multiband light curves from the DES wide-field survey (a median of four observations in each of grizY over the first three years) pose a challenge for traditional techniques used to detect RRL. We present an empirically motivated and computationally efficient template-fitting method to identify these variable stars using three years of DES data. When tested on DES light curves of previously classified objects in SDSS stripe 82, our algorithm recovers 89% of RRL periods to within 1% of their true value with 85% purity and 76% completeness. Using this method, we identify 5783 RRL candidates, similar to 28% of which are previously undiscovered. This method will be useful for identifying RRL in other sparse multiband data sets.

This subsample includes six detected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these detections and our contrast curves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar companions with respect to their mass, semimajor axis, and host stellar mass. We uncover a strong correlation between planet occurrence rate and host star mass, with stars M-* > 1.5 M-circle dot more likely to host planets with masses between 2 and 13M(Jup) and semimajor axes of 3-100 au at 99.92% confidence. We fit a double power-law model in planet mass (m) and semimajor axis (a) for planet populations around high-mass stars (M-* > 1.5 M-circle dot) of the form d(2)N/(dm da) proportional to m(alpha) a(beta), finding alpha = -2.4 +/- 0.8 and beta = -2.0 +/- 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate of 9(-4)(+5)% between 5-13M(Jup )and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate is obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with 0.81(-0.5)(+0.8)% of stars hosting a brown dwarf companion between 13-80M(Jup) and 10-100 au. Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed differently in mass and semimajor axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a bottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semimajor axes, brown dwarfs exhibit just the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of shortperiod giant planets from the radial velocity method, our results are consistent with a peak in occurrence of giant planets between similar to 1 and 10 au. We discuss how these trends, including the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to formation of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown dwarfs by gravitational instability.

We give a brief background introduction to the subject of disk turbulence followed by a terse pedagogical review of the phenomenology of hydrodynamic turbulence. The equations governing the dynamics of cold astrophysical disks are given and basic flow states are described. We discuss the Solberg-Holland conditions required for stability, and the three recently identified turbulence-generating mechanisms that are possibly active in protoplanetary disk Ohmic zones: (i) the vertical shear instability, (ii) the convective overstability, and (iii) the zombie vortex instability. We summarize the properties of these processes, identify their limitations, and discuss where and under what conditions these processes are active in protoplanetary disk Ohmic zones.

Cultivation and characterization of the bacterial assemblage of epsomic Basque Lake, BC	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Astrobiology; Epsomite; Extremophiles; Halotolerance; Mars; Salinotolerance	GREAT SALT PLAINS; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; SALINE LAKES; HALOPHILIC BACTERIA; WATER ACTIVITY; LIFE; HALOBACTERIUM; SASKATCHEWAN; GROWTH; SPECIFICITY	Athalassohaline waters that are rich in divalent ions are good analogues for the chemical environments of Mars and the ocean worlds. Sulfate salts, along with chlorides, are important in Mars regolith with Ca, Fe, Mg, and Na counterions. Certain lakes in the Pacific Northwest are saturated with MgSO4 as epsomite. Here we report on the microbial community of Basque Lake, BC, a group of playas that is saturated with MgSO4. More than 60 bacterial isolates were obtained from Basque Lake soils by enrichment culture and repetitive streak-plating using media containing 10% (1.7M) NaCl or 50% (2M) MgSO4. Most of the isolates (75%) were Gram-positive, motile, and produced endospores. Isolates related to Marinococcus halophilus and Virgibacillus marismortui dominated the collection. Halomonas and Salinivibrio were Gram-negative genera found at Basque Lake. Nearly all of the Basque Lake isolates grew at 50% MgSO4, with 65% growing at 60% MgSO4. Several isolates could grow in saturated (67%) MgSO4 (a(w)=0.90). All of the isolates grew at 10% NaCl with 70% growing at 20% salinity (3.5M NaCl; a(w)=0.82). Basque Lake isolates grew better at basic pH than acidic pH, with 80% growing at pH 9 and 30% growing at pH 10. Only 20% of the isolates grew at pH 5. Numerical taxonomy dendrograms based on 44 phenetic characteristics showed a strong correspondence to phylogenetic trees constructed from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences from direct DNA extracts of Basque Lake soils recovered predominantly Proteobacteria (60%), Firmicutes (11%), and unclassified bacteria (27%). Microbes capable of growth under the extreme chemical conditions of Mars are a particular concern for forward planetary protection should they contaminate a spacecraft.

Based on a prototype originally developed by Waszczak et al. (2017) for the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), the predecessor of ZTF, ZStreak features an improved machine-learning model that can cope with the 10x data rate increment between PTF and ZTF. Since its first discovery on 2018 February 5 (2018 CL), ZTF/ZStreak has discovered 45 confirmed new NEAs over a total of 232 observable nights until 2018 December 31. Most of the discoveries are small NEAs, with diameters less than similar to 100. m. By analyzing the discovery circumstances, we find that objects having the first to last detection time interval under 2. hr are at risk of being lost. We will further improve real-time follow-up capabilities, and work on suppressing false positives using deep learning.

It is well positioned in the development of time-domain astronomy, offering operations at 10% of the scale and style of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) with a single 1-m class survey telescope. The public surveys will cover the observable northern sky every three nights in g and r filters and the visible Galactic plane every night in g and r. Alerts generated by these surveys are sent in real time to brokers. A consortium of universities that provided funding ("partnership") are undertaking several boutique surveys. The combination of these surveys producing one million alerts per night allows for exploration of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena brighter than r similar to 20.5 on timescales of minutes to years. We describe the primary science objectives driving ZTF, including the physics of supernovae and relativistic explosions, multi-messenger astrophysics, supernova cosmology, active galactic nuclei, and tidal disruption events, stellar variability, and solar system objects.

Method for validating a first principles theory of the lambda transition in liquid helium 4	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						Liquid helium 4; Superfluid; Lambda transition; Critical fluctuations; Specific heat; First principles theory	QUANTIZED VORTICES	This paper explains how a first principles theory for critical fluctuations consisting of isothermal fourth sound waves in bulk liquid He II can be tested experimentally. The first principles theory is able to predict the detailed behavior of isothermal fourth sound wave signals very near the lambda transition. Experimental detection of the predicted signals would validate this theory to a high degree of confidence and thereby provide a new paradigm for understanding the physical mechanism responsible for critical properties in liquid helium 4. Theoretical and experimental results that support the predictions of this theory are presented. The method of detection rests on formulas derived here for the time-dependent density-density correlation function and associated pressure fluctuations in superfluid He II that is in thermodynamic equilibrium near the lambda transition temperature. Plots of predicted signals are presented and experimental apparatus that uses an electron-tunneling sensor that can detect the pressure fluctuations is described. Some implications of how validation of this first principles theory would impact general understanding of critical fluctuations and lambda transitions are discussed.	[Jackson, H.

Geological evaluation of the MSRAD field site by a human field party: Implications for rover-based exploration operations and for the future human exploration of Mars	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							MORRISON FORMATION; TAPHONOMY	This paper reports on a one day field validation exercise that took place in the context of the 2016 Canadian Space Agency-led Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment. Here, a "human" field team using traditional geological methods was given the same objective as the rover-based remote science operations team: to select the sample within the site with highest total organic carbon content as a proxy for signs of life. While the exercise, by design, was limited in operations time, a comprehensive data set was assembled related to decision-making, comprising detailed daily reports and logs produced by the remote science operations team, and a continuous voice recording and GPS track for the field team. Summaries of these data are tabulated in this report. These data enabled a direct comparison of the data developed by each team, and the decisions they took, leading to an assessment of both accuracy (effectiveness of task completion) and efficiency (time for task completion). This paper reports: (1) the surprising speed (15 min) at which the field team established basic stratigraphic relationships, (2) the relative effectiveness with which the field team identified and visually tracked indistinct bedding features, and (3) challenges related to assessing scientific success in a geological field setting, highlighted by differences in the stratigraphic sections produced by the two teams, and the detection of a 'marker' bed by the field team and not by the remote science team. As primary conclusions, we note that (1) this exercise has demonstrated higher efficiency a factor of around 50 times for a human team compared to a remotely operated rover - for scientific discovery tasks conducted across a relatively simple, gently undulating, 200 m x 200 m terrain, and (2) the results broadly support the concept of walkabout as an effective strategy for robotic planetary exploration (Yingst et al., 2018, and references therein) with a specific finding related to mapping stratigraphic relationships. We also discuss the value and shortcomings of this validation approach and provide lessons learned and recommendations for the design of future analogue mission exercises.

We employ new data products - the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) derived largely from Landsat and a Dense Sampling Method (DSM) product based on QuikSCAT - in combination with data from the 1999 and 2009 censuses of Vietnam. Unlike past studies, we examine horizontal and volumetric changes in urban form and pay particular attention to the role of migration in locations experiencing those different types of change. We find these two types of urban change occur at different rates and in different localities, with the highest rates of horizontal change occurring to the north of administrative Saigon. In contrast, we find the highest rates of volumetric change in the areas north of the central districts but mostly within administrative Saigon. In-migration is strongly associated with horizontal change, whereas increases in population density appears to drive volumetric change, controlling for other factors. Positive volumetric change is associated with necessary amenities of modern urban living, often in high-rise buildings found in dense population centers like Saigon: the increasing presence in households of computers, air conditioners, piped water, and gas fuel. Use of these new integrated data hold promise to shed new light on both the built-environment and social dimensions of urbanization in low- and middle-income settings.

Interior properties of the inner saturnian moons from space astrometry data	ICARUS			English	Article							GRAVITY-FIELD; SATELLITES; ORBITS; CATALOG; PHOBOS; SYSTEM	During the thirteen years in orbit around Saturn before its final plunge, the Cassini spacecraft provided more than ten thousand astrometric measurements. Such large amounts of accurate data enable the search for extremely faint signals in the orbitalmotion of the saturnian moons. Among these, the detection of the dynamical feedback of the rotation of the inner moons of Saturn on their respective orbits becomes possible. Using all the currently available astrometric data associated with Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus and Epimetheus, we first provide a detailed analysis of the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) data, with special emphasis on their statistical behavior and sources of bias. Then, we give updated estimates of the moons' averaged densities and try to infer more details about their interior properties by estimating the physical librations for Prometheus, Pandora, Epimetheus and Janus from anomalies in their apsidal precession. Our results are compatible with a homogeneous interior for Janus and Epimetheus, within the uncertainty of the measurements. On the other hand, we found some inconsistency for Pandora and Prometheus, which might result from a dynamical mismodeling of Saturn's gravity field. Last, we show how the synergistic introduction of libration measurements directly derived from imaging should allow the moons' moments of inertia to be better constrained.	[Lainey, V; Park, R.

While nearly all NEOs of diameter > 1 km, capable of causing a global climatic disaster, have been discovered and have negligible chance of impacting in the near future, we are far from completion in our effort to detect and characterize smaller objects. In an effort to test our preparedness to respond to a potential NEO impact threat, we conducted a community-led global planetary defense exercise with support from the NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office. The target of our exercise was 2012 TC4, the similar to 10 m diameter asteroid that made a close pass by the Earth on 2017 October 12 at a distance of about 50,000 km. The goal of the TC4 observing campaign was to recover, track, and characterize 2012 TC4 as a hypothetical impactor in order to exercise the global planetary defense system involving observations, modeling, prediction, and communication. We made three attempts with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 2017 July 27, 31 and on 2017 August 5 and recovered 2012 TC4 within its ephemeris uncertainty at 2.2 arcmin from the nominal prediction. At visual magnitude V = 27, the recovery of 2012 TC4 is the faintest NEA detection thus far. If an impact during the 2017 close approach had been possible based on the 2012 astrometric data, these recovery observations would have been sufficient to confirm or rule out the impact. The first automatic detection by a survey (Pan-STARRS1) was on September 25, which is the earliest that 2012 TC4 would have been discovered in survey mode, if it had not been discovered in 2012. We characterized 2012 TC4 using photometry, spectroscopy and radar techniques. Based on photometric observations, we determined a rotation period of 12.2 min with an amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes. An additional lower amplitude period was detected, indicating that 2012 TC4 was in a state of non-principal axis rotation. The combined visible and near-infrared spectrum puts it in the taxonomic X-class. Radar images at 1.875 m resolution placed only a few range pixels on the asteroid, reveal an angular, asymmetric, and elongated shape, and establish that 2012 TC4 is less than 20 m on its long axis. We estimate a circular polarization ratio of 0.57 + -0.08 that is relatively high among NEAs observed to date by radar. We also performed a probabilistic impact risk assessment exercise for hypothetical impactors based on the 2012 TC4 observing campaign. This exercise was performed as part of ongoing efforts to advance effective impact risk models and assessment processes for planetary defense. The 2012 TC4 close approach provided a valuable opportunity to test the application of these methods using realistically evolving observational data to define the modeling inputs. To this end, risk assessments were calculated at several epochs before and during the close approach, incorporating new information about 2012 TC4 as it became available. Two size ranges were assessed-one smaller size range (H = 26.7) similar to the actual 2012 TC4, and one larger size range (H = 21.9) to produce a greater-damage scenario for risk assessment. Across the epochs, we found that only irons caused significant damage for smaller size. For the larger size case, however, hydrous stones caused the greatest damage, anhydrous stones caused the least damage, and irons caused moderate damage. We note that the extent of damage depends on composition in different size regimes and, after astrometry, size is the most important physical property to determine for an incoming object.

Evidence for recent and ancient faulting at Mare Frigoris and implications for lunar tectonic evolution	ICARUS			English	Article						Tectonics; Moon; Geophysics; Scarp; Ridge; Graben; Mare; Frigoris	WRINKLE RIDGES; MOON; REGOLITH; FEATURES; BASINS; SCARPS; ORIGIN; MODEL; RATES; AGES	Nearside basin-related extensional tectonism on the Moon was thought to have ended by about 3.6 billion years ago and mare basin-localized contractional deformation ended by about 1.2 billion years ago. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) high resolution (50-200 cm/pixel) images show the Moon's surface in unprecedented detail and have enabled us to find many previously unidentified tectonic landforms, forcing a reassessment of our views of tectonism in the maria. The morphology and stratigraphic relationships of these newly identified populations of tectonic landforms imply a more complex and longer-lasting history of deformation. We selected Mare Frigoris as an ideal location to perform a mapping survey where excellent imaging conditions, abundant tectonic landforms, and restricted mascon allow us to unravel the mare's tectonic evolution. Similar to previous surveys, we find that tectonism in the eastern portion of Mare Frigoris was controlled by ancient mascon induced flexure. In the western portion, however, we identify a parallel set of ancient compressional wrinkle ridges across the mare that is inconsistent with an origin by mare basin-centric mascon flexure or influence from the Mare Imbrium mascon. Instead, our results imply an ancient, regional, non-isotropic stress field over western Mare Frigoris. We also identify young wrinkle ridges and show that they have likely been active within the last 1 billion years, and some ridges as recently as within 40 million years. Finally, we identify a 300 km long series of lobate scarps coincident with one of the shallow moonquakes recorded during Apollo and use geodetic strain from the mapped global population of young lobate scarps to predict a level of seismicity consistent with the shallow moonquakes recorded during Apollo. In tandem with similarly young lobate scarps and small graben, as well as recorded shallow moonquakes, these young wrinkle ridges imply that some tectonism in and around Mare Frigoris has occurred in the geologically recent past and likely still continues today.

In its most general form, this problem can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The solution policy of a POMDP can be implicitly encoded as a value function. In partially observable settings, the value function is typically learned via forward simulation of the system evolution. Focusing on accurate and long-range risk assessment, we propose a novel method, where the value function is learned in different phases via a bi-directional search in belief space. A backward value learning process provides a long-range and risk-aware base policy. A forward value learning process ensures local optimality and updates the policy via forward simulations. We consider a class of scalable and continuous-space rover navigation problems to assess the safety, scalability, and optimality of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm in evaluating long-range risk/safety of the planner while addressing continuous problems with long planning horizons.

ETS in Cascadia subduction zone occurs semiregularly and shows intriguing spatio-temporal variability reportedly associated with frictional properties and stress conditions. Yet the origin of complex ETS behaviors remains largely unknown. Here we develop a laboratory-based rate-and-state asperity-in-matrix subduction fault model, supported by geological observations of exhumed fault with heterogeneous frictional properties and pore pressure variation, to reproduce all ETS variability in good agreement with observations. Our results show that differential pore pressure plays a crucial role in affecting fault behaviors. Regions of asperities with decreased pore pressure tend to have increased tremor. Our study suggests that ETS variability can be used to probe otherwise enigmatic fault zone properties.

Ice Thickness and Bed Elevation of the Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Patagonian Icefields; airborne gravity; radar depth sounder; ice thickness; bedrock topography; ice volume	OPERATION ICEBRIDGE; MASS-BALANCE; GLACIER; BATHYMETRY; GREENLAND; ANTARCTICA; DYNAMICS; GRAVITY; RETREAT; BENEATH	The Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields are the largest ice masses in the Southern Hemisphere outside Antarctica, but their ice volume and bed topography are poorly known. Here, we combine airborne gravity data collected in 2012 and 2016, with radar data from the Warm Ice Experiment Sounder and Centro de Estudios Cientificos's to map bed elevation and ice thickness in great detail. We perform a 3-D inversion of the gravity data constrained by radar-derived thickness and fjord bathymetry to infer bed elevation at 500-m spacing, with a precision of about 60 m. We detect deep glacial valleys with ice thickness exceeding 1,400 m and sectors below sea level on the western branch of Glaciar Pio XI, Occidental, between San Rafael and Colonia, and near Fitz Roy. We calculate an ice volume of 4,756 +/- 923km(3) for Northern Patagonia Icefield and Southern Patagonia Icefield, or 40 times the volume of glaciers in the European Alps. Plain Language Summary Traditional techniques of radar depth sounding fail to resolve thick, temperate ice masses due to poor penetration of the radar signals into snow and ice and extensive scattering due to water content. We combine sparse airborne radar sounding and bathymetry data with novel high-resolution, high-precision airborne gravity data to infer the bed topography of the Patagonia Icefields of South America. The results reveal the full range of deep ice thickness on the plateau, portions of the icefields grounded below sea level, and the total volume content of the Patagonia Icefields. The results are critical to constrain the details of the past, present, and future evolution of this glaciated region in a warmer climate.

It can be estimated using the cloud radiative kernel (CRK) method or adjustment method. This study, for the first time, examines the contributions of each spectral band to the longwave (LW) cloud radiative feedbacks (CRFs). Simulations of three warming scenarios are analyzed, including +2 K sea surface temperature, 2 x CO2, and 4 x CO2 experiments. While the LW broadband CRFs derived from the CRK and adjustment methods agree with each other, they disagree on the relative contributions from the far-infrared and window bands. The CRK method provides a consistent band-by-band decomposition of LW CRF for different warming scenarios. The simulated and observed short-term broadband CRFs for the 2003-2013 period are similar to the long-term counterparts, but their band-by-band decompositions are different, which can be further related to the cloud fraction changes in respective simulations and observation.

We apply the CGAN to generating two-dimensional cloud vertical structures that would be observed by the CloudSat satellite-based radar, using only the collocated Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer measurements as input. The CGAN is usually able to generate reasonable guesses of the cloud structure and can infer complex structures such as multilayer clouds from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data. This network, which is formulated probabilistically, also estimates the uncertainty of its own predictions. We examine the statistics of the generated data and analyze the response of the network to each input parameter. The success of the CGAN in solving this problem suggests that generative adversarial networks are applicable to a wide range of problems in atmospheric science, a field characterized by complex spatial structures and observational uncertainties.

This wildfire event was driven by dry and strong offshore Santa Ana winds, which played a critical role in fire formation and air pollutant transport. By utilizing fire emissions derived from the high-resolution (375 x 375 m(2)) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fire detections, the simulated magnitude and temporal evolution of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations agree reasonably well with surface observations (normalized mean bias = 4.0%). Meanwhile, the model could generally capture the spatial pattern of aerosol optical depth from satellite observations. Sensitivity tests reveal that using a high spatial resolution for fire emissions and a reasonable treatment of plume rise (a fair split between emissions injected at surface and those lifted to upper levels) is important for achieving decent PM2.5 simulation results. Biases in PM2.5 simulation are relatively large (about 50%) during the period with the strongest Santa Ana wind, due to a possible underestimation of burning area and uncertainty in wind field variation. The 2017 December fire event increases the 14-day averaged PM2.5 concentrations by up to 231.2 mu g/m(3) over the downwind regions, which substantially exceeds the U.S. air quality standards, potentially leading to adverse health impacts. The human exposure to fire-induced PM2.5 accounts for 14-42% of the annual total PM2.5 exposure in areas impacted by the fire plumes.

Revisiting the pulsational characteristics of the exoplanet host star beta Pictoris	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						asteroseismology; stars: individual: beta Pictoris; stars: interiors; stars: variables: delta Scuti; stars: magnetic field	MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; DELTA-SCUTI STARS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; NEARBY STARS; AP STARS; DISCOVERY; GRAVITY; AGE; ASTEROSEISMOLOGY; SPECTROSCOPY	Context. Exoplanet properties crucially depend on the parameters of their host stars: more accurate stellar parameters yield more accurate exoplanet characteristics. When the exoplanet host star shows pulsations, asteroseismology can be used for an improved description of the stellar parameters. Aims. We aim to revisit the pulsational properties of beta Pic and identify its pulsation modes from normalized amplitudes in five different passbands. We also investigate the potential presence of a magnetic field. Methods. We conducted a frequency analysis using three seasons of BRITE-Constellation observations in the two BRITE filters, the about 620-day-long bRing light curve, and the nearly 8-year-long SMEI photometric time series. We calculated normalized amplitudes using all passbands and including previously published values obtained from ASTEP observations. We investigated the magnetic properties of beta Pic using spectropo-larimetric observations conducted with the HARPSpol instrument. Using 2D rotating models, we fit the normalized amplitudes and frequencies through Monte Carlo Markov chains. Results. We identify 15 pulsation frequencies in the range from 34 to 55 d(-1), where two, F13 at 53.6917 d(-1) and F11 at 50.4921 d(-1), display clear amplitude variability. We use the normalized amplitudes in up to five passbands to identify the modes as three l = 1, six l = 2; and six l = 3 modes. beta Pic is shown to be non-magnetic with an upper limit of the possible undetected dipolar field of 300 Gauss. Conclusions. Multiple fits to the frequencies and normalized amplitudes are obtained, including one with a near equator-on inclination for beta Pic, which corresponds to our expectations based on the orbital inclination of beta Pic b and the orientation of the circumstellar disk. This solution leads to a rotation rate of 27% of the Keplerian breakup velocity, a radius of 1.497 +/- 0.025 R-circle dot, and a mass of 1.797 +/- 0.035 M-circle dot. The similar to 2% errors in radius and mass do not account for uncertainties in the models and a potentially erroneous mode-identification.

Constraints on HD 113337 fundamental parameters and planetary system Combining long-base visible interferometry, disc imaging, and high-contrast imaging	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						techniques: interferometric; techniques: high angular resolution; stars: individual: HD113337; planetary systems stars; fundamental parameters	STARS; MASS; DWARFS; LINE	Context. HD 113337 is a main-sequence F6V field star more massive than the Sun. This star hosts one confirmed giant planet and possibly a second candidate, detected by radial velocities (RVs). The star also hosts a cold debris disc detected through the presence of an infrared excess, making it an interesting system to explore. Aims. We aim to bring new constraints on the star's fundamental parameters, debris disc properties, and planetary companion(s) by combining complementary techniques. Methods. We used the VEGA interferometer on the CHARA array to measure the angular diameter of HD 113337. We derived its linear radius using the parallax from the Gaia Second Data Release. We computed the bolometric flux to derive its effective temperature and luminosity, and we estimated its mass and age using evolutionary tracks. Then, we used Herschel images to partially resolve the outer debris disc and estimate its extension and inclination. Next, we acquired high-contrast images of HD 113337 with the LBTI to probe the similar to 10-80 au separation range. Finally, we combined the deduced contrast maps with previous RVs of the star using the MESS2 software to bring upper mass limits on possible companions at all separations up to 80 au. We took advantage of the constraints on the age and inclination brought by fundamental parameter analysis and disc imaging, respectively, for this analysis. Results. We derive a limb-darkened angular diameter of 0.386 +/- 0.009 mas that converts into a linear radius of 1.50 +/- 0.04 R-circle dot for HD 113337. The fundamental parameter analysis leads to an effective temperature of 6774 +/- 125 K and to two possible age solutions: one young within 14-21 Myr and one old within 0.8-1.7 Gyr. We partially resolve the known outer debris disc and model its emission. Our best solution corresponds to a radius of 85 +/- 20 au, an extension of 30 +/- 20 au, and an inclination within 10-30 degrees for the outer disc. The combination of imaging contrast limits, published RV, and age and inclination solutions allows us to derive a first possible estimation of the true masses of the planetary companions: similar to 7(-2)(+4) M-Jup for HD 113337 b (confirmed companion) and similar to 16(-3)(+10) M-Jup for HD 113337 c (candidate companion). We also constrain possible additional companions at larger separations.

Here we present a comprehensive view of the temporal evolution of chlorine in the lowermost stratosphere over the course of the studied winter. We utilize two-dimensional vertical cross sections of ozone (O-3) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2), measured by the airborne limb imager GLORIA (Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere) during the POLSTRACC/GW-LCYCLE II/GWEX/SALSA campaigns, to investigate the tropopause region in detail. Observations from three long-distance flights in January, February, and March 2016 are discussed. ClONO2 volume mixing ratios up to 1100 pptv were measured at 380 K potential temperature in mesoscale structures. Similar mesoscale structures are also visible in O-3 measurements. Both trace gas measurements are applied to evaluate simulation results from the chemistry transport model CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere) and the chemistry-climate model EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). These comparisons show agreement within the expected performance of these models. Satellite measurements from Aura/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) and SCISAT/ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment - Fourier Transform Spectrometer) provide an overview over the whole winter and information about the stratospheric situation above the flight altitude. Time series of these satellite measurements reveal unusually low hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ClONO2 at 380 K from the beginning of January to the end of February 2016, while chlorine monoxide (ClO) is strongly enhanced. In March 2016, unusually rapid chlorine deactivation into HCl is observed instead of deactivation into ClONO2, the more typical pathway for deactivation in the Arctic. Chlorine deactivation observed in the satellite time series is well reproduced by CLaMS. Sensitivity simulations with CLaMS demonstrate the influence of low abundances of O-3 and reactive nitrogen (NOy) due to ozone depletion and sedimentation of NOy-containing particles, respectively. On the basis of the different altitude and time ranges of these effects, we conclude that the substantial chlorine deactivation into HCl at 380 K arose as a result of very low ozone abundances together with low temperatures. Additionally, CLaMS estimates ozone depletion of at least 0.4 ppmv at 380 K and 1.75 ppmv at 490 K, which is comparable to other extremely cold Arctic winters. We have used CLaMS trajectories to analyze the history of enhanced ClONO2 measured by GLORIA. In February, most of the enhanced ClONO2 is traced back to chlorine deactivation that had occurred within the past few days prior to the GLORIA measurement. In March, after the final warming, air masses in which chlorine has previously been deactivated into ClONO2 have been transported in the remnants of the polar vortex towards the location of measurement for at least 11 d.

Galaxy cluster detection in the wide photometric survey, performance and algorithm selection	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						methods: numerical; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; INFRARED LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; K-BAND PROPERTIES; VLT DEEP SURVEY; RADIAL-DISTRIBUTION; CANDIDATE CATALOG; STAR-FORMATION; RED-SEQUENCE; DARK ENERGY; APPLES A(2)	Galaxy cluster counts in bins of mass and redshift have been shown to be a competitive probe to test cosmological models. This method requires an efficient blind detection of clusters from surveys with a well-known selection function and robust mass estimates, which is particularly challenging at high redshift. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15 000 deg(2) of the sky, avoiding contamination by light from our Galaxy and our solar system in the optical and near-infrared bands, down to magnitude 24 in the H-band. The resulting data will make it possible to detect a large number of galaxy clusters spanning a wide-range of masses up to redshift similar to 2 and possibly higher. This paper presents the final results of the Euclid Cluster Finder Challenge (CFC), fourth in a series of similar challenges. The objective of these challenges was to select the cluster detection algorithms that best meet the requirements of the Euclid mission. The final CFC included six independent detection algorithms, based on different techniques, such as photometric redshift tomography, optimal filtering, hierarchical approach, wavelet and friend-of-friends algorithms. These algorithms were blindly applied to a mock galaxy catalog with representative Euclid-like properties. The relative performance of the algorithms was assessed by matching the resulting detections to known clusters in the simulations down to masses of M-200 similar to 10(13.25) M-circle dot. Several matching procedures were tested, thus making it possible to estimate the associated systematic effects on completeness to <3%. All the tested algorithms are very competitive in terms of performance, with three of them reaching >80% completeness for a mean purity of 80% down to masses of 10(14) M-circle dot and up to redshift z = 2. Based on these results, two algorithms were selected to be implemented in the Euclid pipeline, the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) code, based on matched filtering, and the PZWav code, based on an adaptive wavelet approach.

Synthesis and Characterization of Vacancy-Doped Neodymium Telluride for Thermoelectric Applications	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS; WAVE PAW CODE; TRANSPORT; BAND	Thermoelectric materials exhibit a voltage under an applied thermal gradient and are the heart of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which are the main power system for space missions such as Voyager I, Voyager II, and the Mars Curiosity rover. However, materials currently in use enable only modest thermal-to-electrical conversion efficiencies near 6.5% at the system level, warranting the development of material systems with improved thermoelectric performance. Previous work has demonstrated large thermoelectric figures of merit for lanthanum telluride (La3-xTe4), a high-temperature n-type material, achieving a peak zT value of 1.1 at 1275 K at an optimum cation vacancy concentration. Here, we present an investigation of the thermoelectric properties of neodymium telluride (La3-xTe4), another rare-earth telluride La3,Te4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted a significant increase in the Seebeck coefficient over La3_xTe4 at equivalent vacancy concentrations because of an increased density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level from the 4f electrons of Nd. The high-temperature electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity were measured for La3-xTe4 at various carrier concentrations. These measurements were compared to La3-xTe4 in order to elucidate the impact of the four 4f electrons of Nd on the transport properties of La3-xTe4. A zT of 1.2 was achieved at 1273 K for Nd2.78Te4i which is a 10% improvement over that of La2.74Te4.

The selection of species analyzed allowed for the effect of structural isomerism, specifically positional isomerism, and stereoisomerism, specifically geometric isomerism, on solid state vapor pressure to be investigated. In addition, the effect of varying the number of carboxylic acid groups present within a molecule's structure and of varying alkyl chain length was assessed. The solid state vapor pressures were converted to subcooled liquid vapor pressures using experimental heat of fusion and melting point values. The resulting subcooled liquid vapor pressures were found to be up to 7 orders of magnitude lower than the vapor pressures estimated from models. Some of this variation between experimentally determined subcooled liquid vapor pressures and predicted vapor pressures, which use group contribution methods, can be attributed to the effects of isomerism which are largely not taken into account in models. Whilst these techniques might have both structural and parametric uncertainties, of the compound classes tested, a general inverse relationship between melting point and solid state vapor pressure was observed. Within each compound class the variations in vapor pressure can be attributed to the number and size of functional groups present and the relative positions of those functional groups to each other both positionally and geometrically. These two factors impact upon both the molecules' dipole moments and upon their ability to interact both intramolecularly and intermolecularly via hydrogen bonding, thus explaining the differences in observed vapor pressure. Partitioning calculations using a range of condensed mass loadings show that whilst using vapor pressure values derived from models would put most of the compounds in the vapor phase, using the experimental values obtained here would mean a significant fraction of the organic molecules would be in the condensed phase. This could have a significant impact upon the formation and nature of atmospheric aerosol, and comparisons with ambient data obtained from other mass spectrometry techniques during bonfire night in Manchester in 2016 are made in an attempt to assess this potential atmospheric importance.

Evidence for low density holes in Jupiter's ionosphere	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							VOYAGER-1	Intense electromagnetic impulses induced by Jupiter's lightning have been recognised to produce both low-frequency dispersed whistler emissions and non-dispersed radio pulses. Here we report the discovery of electromagnetic pulses associated with Jovian lightning. Detected by the Juno Waves instrument during its polar perijove passes, the dispersed millisecond pulses called Jupiter dispersed pulses (JDPs) provide evidence of low density holes in Jupiter's ionosphere. 445 of these JDP emissions have been observed in snapshots of electric field waveforms. Assuming that the maximum delay occurs in the vicinity of the free space ordinary mode cutoff frequency, we estimate the characteristic plasma densities (5.1 to 250 cm(-3)) and lengths (0.6 km to 1.3 x 10(5) km) of plasma irregularities along the line of propagation from lightning to Juno. These irregularities show a direct link to low plasma density holes with <= 250 cm(-3) in the nightside ionosphere.

Probing ISM Structure in Trumpler 14 and Carina I Using the Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory 2	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: kinematics and dynamics; ISM: structure; photon-dominated region (PDR); stars: formation; surveys; H II regions	31 MOLECULAR-COMPLEX; INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS; OPEN CLUSTERS; C-I; REGIONS; NEBULA; GAS; EMISSION; PHOTOEVAPORATION; RADIATION	We present observations of the Trumpler 14/Carina I region carried out using the Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory 2. The Trumpler 14/Carina I region is in the western part of the Carina Nebula Complex (CNC), which is one of the most extreme star-forming regions in the Milky Way. We observed Trumpler 14/Carina I in the 58 mu m transition of [C II] with a spatial resolution of 48 '' and a velocity resolution of 0.17 km s(-1). The observations cover a 0 degrees.25 by 0 degrees.28 area with central position l = 297 degrees.34, b = -0 degrees.60. The kinematics show that bright [C II] structures are spatially and spectrally correlated with the surfaces of CO clouds, tracing the photodissociation region (PDR) and ionization front of each molecular cloud. Along seven lines of sight (LOSs) that traverse Tr 14 into the dark ridge to the southwest, we find that the [C II] luminosity from the H II region is 3.7 times that from the PDR. In the same LOS, we find in the PDRs an average ratio of 1 : 4.1 : 5.6 for the mass in atomic gas : dark CO gas : molecular gas traced by CO. Comparing multiple gas tracers, including H I 21 cm, [C II], CO, and radio recombination lines, we find that the H II regions of the CNC are well described as H II regions with one side freely expanding toward us, consistent with the Champagne model of ionized gas evolution. The dispersal of the GMC in this region is dominated by EUV photoevaporation; the dispersal timescale is 20-30 Myr.

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are a promising location for the formation of these sBHBs, as well as binaries of other compact objects, because of powerful torques exerted by the gas disk. These gas torques cause orbiting compact objects to migrate toward regions in the disk where inward and outward torques cancel, known as migration traps. We simulate the migration of stellar mass black holes in an example of a model AGN disk, using an augmented N-body code that includes analytic approximations to migration torques, stochastic gravitational forces exerted by turbulent density fluctuations in the disk, and inclination and eccentricity dampening produced by passages through the gas disk, in addition to the standard gravitational forces between objects. We find that sBHBs form rapidly in our model disk as stellar-mass black holes migrate toward the migration trap. These sBHBs are likely to subsequently merge on short timescales. The process continues, leading to the build-up of a population of over-massive stellar-mass black holes. The formation of sBHBs in AGN disks could contribute significantly to the sBHB merger rate inferred by LIGO.	[Secunda, Amy; Bellovary, Jillian; Mac Low, Mordecai-Mark; Ford, K. E.

The B-Star Exoplanet Abundance Study: a co-moving 16-25 M-Jup companion to the young binary system HIP 79098	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						brown dwarfs; stars: early-type; planets and satellites: detection	BROWN DWARF DESERT; LOW-MASS STARS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; ROTATIONAL VELOCITIES; POPULATION; PLANETS; SPECTROSCOPY; MEMBERS; NAOS; 1ST	Wide low-mass substellar companions are known to be very rare among low-mass stars, but appear to become increasingly common with increasing stellar mass. However, B-type stars, which are the most massive stars within similar to 150 pc of the Sun, have not yet been examined to the same extent as AFGKM-type stars in that regard. In order to address this issue, we launched the ongoing B-star Exoplanet Abundance Study (BEAST) to examine the frequency and properties of planets, brown dwarfs, and disks around B-type stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) association; we also analyzed archival data of B-type stars in Sco-Cen. During this process, we identified a candidate substellar companion to the B9-type spectroscopic binary HIP 79098 AB, which we refer to as HIP 79098 (AB)b. The candidate had been previously reported in the literature, but was classified as a background contaminant on the basis of its peculiar colors. Here we demonstrate that the colors of HIP 79098 (AB)b are consistent with several recently discovered young and low-mass brown dwarfs, including other companions to stars in Sco-Cen. Furthermore, we show unambiguous common proper motion over a 15-yr baseline, robustly identifying HIP 79098 (AB)b as a bona fide substellar circumbinary companion at a 345 +/- 6 AU projected separation to the B9-type stellar pair. With a model-dependent mass of 16-25 M-Jup yielding a mass ratio of <1%, HIP 79098 (AB)b joins a growing number of substellar companions with planet-like mass ratios around massive stars. Our observations underline the importance of common proper motion analysis in the identification of physical companionship, and imply that additional companions could potentially remain hidden in the archives of purely photometric surveys.

Spectroscopic transit search: a self-calibrating method for detecting planets around bright stars	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						methods: observational; techniques: spectroscopic; stars: individual: beta Pictoris; stars: variables: delta Scuti; planets and satellites: detection	STELLAR; PULSATIONS; PROJECT	Aims. We aim to search for transiting exoplanets around the star beta Pictoris using high-resolution spectroscopy and Doppler imaging that removes the need for standard star observations. These data were obtained on the VLT with UVES during the course of an observing campaign throughout 2017 that monitored the Hill sphere transit of the exoplanet beta Pictoris b. Methods. We utilized line profile tomography as a method for the discovery of transiting exoplanets. By measuring the exoplanet distortion of the stellar line profile, we removed the need for reference star measurements. We demonstrated the method with white noise simulations, and then looked at the case of beta Pictoris, which is a delta Scuti pulsator. We describe a method to remove the stellar pulsations and perform a search for any transiting exoplanets in the resultant data set. We injected fake planet transits with varying orbital periods and planet radii into the spectra and determined the recovery fraction. Results. In the photon noise limited case we can recover planets down to a Neptune radius with an similar to 80% success rate, using an 8 m telescope with a R similar to 100 000 spectrograph and 20 min of observations per night. The pulsations of p Pictoris limit our sensitivity to Jupiter-sized planets, but a pulsation removal algorithm improves this limit to Saturn-sized planets. We present two planet candidates, but argue that their signals are most likely caused by other phenomena. Conclusions. We have demonstrated a method for searching for transiting exoplanets that (i) does not require ancillary calibration observations, (ii) can work on any star whose rotational broadening can be resolved with a high spectral dispersion spectrograph, and (iii) provides the lowest limits so far on the radii of transiting Jupiter-sized exoplanets around beta Pictoris with orbital periods from 15 days to 200 days with >50% coverage.

Given (i) the multitude of atmospheric and oceanic constituents at any given moment that each exhibits a large variety of physical and chemical properties and (ii) the diversity of light-matter interactions (scattering, absorption, and emission), tackling all outstanding RT aspects related to interpreting and/or simulating light reflected by atmosphere-ocean systems becomes impossible. Instead, we focus on both theoretical and experimental studies of RT topics important to the science threshold and goal questions of the PACE mission and the measurement capabilities of its instruments. We differentiate between (a) forward (FWD) RT studies that focus mainly on sensitivity to influencing variables and/or simulating data sets, and (b) inverse (INV) RT studies that also involve the retrieval of atmosphere and ocean parameters. Our topics cover (1) the ocean (i.e., water body): absorption and elastic/inelastic scattering by pure water (FWD RT) and models for scattering and absorption by particulates (FWD RT and INV RT); (2) the air-water interface: variations in ocean surface refractive index (INV RT) and in whitecap reflectance (INV RT); (3) the atmosphere: polarimetric and/or hyperspectral remote sensing of aerosols (INV RT) and of gases (FWD RT); and (4) atmosphere-ocean systems: benchmark comparisons, impact of the Earth's sphericity and adjacency effects on space-borne observations, and scattering in the ultraviolet regime (FWD RT). We provide for each topic a summary of past relevant (heritage) work, followed by a discussion (for unresolved questions) and RT updates.

First stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa and upcoming events between 2019 and 2021	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						methods: observational; techniques: photometric; occultations; planets and satellites: individual: Europa	MUTUAL APPROXIMATIONS; SATELLITES; JUPITER; SHAPE; ATMOSPHERE; ECLIPSES; PLUTO; JUICE; SIZE; RING	Context. Bright stellar positions are now known with an uncertainty below 1 mas thanks to Gaia DR2. Between 2019-2020, the Galactic plane will be the background of Jupiter. The dense stellar background will lead to an increase in the number of occultations, while the Gaia DR2 catalogue will reduce the prediction uncertainties for the shadow path. Aims. We observed a stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa (J2) and propose a campaign for observing stellar occultations for all Galilean moons. Methods. During a predicted period of time, we measured the light flux of the occulted star and the object to determine the time when the flux dropped with respect to one or more reference stars, and the time that it rose again for each observational station. The chords obtained from these observations allowed us to determine apparent sizes, oblatness, and positions with kilometre accuracy. Results. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by the Galilean moon Europa observed on 2017 March 31. The apparent fitted ellipse presents an equivalent radius of 1561.2 +/- 3.6 km and oblatenesses 0.0010 +/- 0.0028. A very precise Europa position was determined with an uncertainty of 0.8 mas. We also present prospects for a campaign to observe the future events that will occur between 2019 and 2021 for all Galilean moons. Conclusions. Stellar occultation is a suitable technique for obtaining physical parameters and highly accurate positions of bright satellites close to their primary. A number of successful events can render the 3D shapes of the Galilean moons with high accuracy. We encourage the observational community (amateurs included) to observe the future predicted events.

Raised Rims Around Titan's Sharp-Edged Depressions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Titan; geomorphology; lakes; hydrology	CASSINI SAR; SURFACE; DISSOLUTION; LAKES	We perform a systematic survey of Titan's sharp-edged depressions (SEDs) using a combination of Cassini synthetic aperture radar images and delay-Doppler processed altimetry. We identify a characteristic bright-dark pattern around 172 SEDs that correlates with elevated features only resolved with the highest resolution topographic data. We find that similar to 75% of Titan's SEDs have elevated (similar to 100m) rim features, with a preference toward larger SEDs. The differences in the distribution of SED rim presence between the north and south are slight, but the data weakly suggest that northern SEDs may be more likely to have a rim. The pattern we identify in synthetic aperture radar images is similar to quasi-specular increases in backscatter seen on Titan's dunes. We show that this bright-dark pattern occurs due to elevated local slopes oriented perpendicular to the radar. In general, rims occur on most of Titan's SEDs, an observation that will aid in developing and testing SED formation models.	[Birch, S. P. D.; Hayes, A. G.; Poggiali, V.; Lunine, J.

Fresh Submarine Groundwater Discharge to the Near-Global Coast	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; WATER DISCHARGE; CLIMATE; QUALITY; VULNERABILITY; PATTERNS; AQUIFER; DRIVEN; FLUXES; OCEAN	The flow of fresh groundwater to the ocean through the coast (fresh submarine groundwater discharge or fresh SGD) plays an important role in global biogeochemical cycles and coastal water quality. In addition to delivering dissolved elements from land to sea, fresh SGD forms a natural barrier against salinization of coastal aquifers. Here we estimate groundwater discharge rates through the near-global coast (60 degrees N to 60 degrees S) at high resolution using a water budget approach. We find that tropical coasts export more than 56% of all fresh SGD, while midlatitude arid regions export only 10%. Fresh SGD rates from tectonically active margins (coastlines along tectonic plate boundaries) are also significantly greater than passive margins, where most field studies have been focused. Active margins combine rapid uplift and weathering with high rates of fresh SGD and may therefore host exceptionally large groundwater-borne solute fluxes to the coast.

Detachments form expansive dome structures with corrugated surfaces known as oceanic core complexes (OCCs), and often transition to multiple regularly-spaced normal faults that form abyssal hills parallel to the spreading axis. Previous studies have attributed these changes to along-axis gradients in lithospheric strength or magma supply. However, despite the recognition that magma supply can influence fault style and seafloor morphology, the mechanics controlling the transition from oceanic detachment faults to abyssal hill faults and the relationship to along-axis variations in magma supply remain poorly understood. This study investigates this issue using two complementary modeling approaches. The first consists of semi analytical, two-dimensional (2-D) cross-axis models designed to address the fundamental mechanical controls on the longevity of normal faults. These 2-D model sections are juxtaposed in the along-axis direction to examine the response of the plan-view pattern of faults to along-axis variations in magmatic accretion in the absence of along-axis mechanical coupling. The second approach uses three-dimensional (3-D), time-dependent numerical models that simulate faulting and magma intrusion in a visco-elastoplastic continuum. The primary variable studied through both approaches is the along-axis gradient in the fraction M of seafloor spreading that is accommodated by magmatism. The 2-D and 3-D results predict different abyssal hill spacing and orientation, however the plan-view geometry of self-emerging detachment faults predicted by the 3-D numerical models are well explained by the juxtaposed 2-D models. This indicates a first-order control by cross-axis effects of changing values of M. These models are also shown to explain the along-axis extent and plan-view curvature of the well-developed 13 degrees 20'N and Mt. Dent OCCs (Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Cayman Rise) in terms of quantifiable along-axis gradients in magma emplacement rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To meet this objective it will carry, for the first time in space, a fully polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Three main products will be provided: global maps of both AGB and forest height, with a spatial resolution of 200 m, and maps of severe forest disturbance at 50 m resolution (where "global" is to be understood as subject to Space Object tracking radar restrictions). After launch in 2022, there will be a 3-month commissioning phase, followed by a 14-month phase during which there will be global coverage by SAR tomography. In the succeeding interferometric phase, global polarimetric interferometry Pol-InSAR coverage will be achieved every 7 months up to the end of the 5-year mission. Both Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR will be used to eliminate scattering from the ground (both direct and double bounce backscatter) in forests. In dense tropical forests AGB can then be estimated from the remaining volume scattering using non-linear inversion of a backscattering model. Airborne campaigns in the tropics also indicate that AGB is highly correlated with the backscatter from around 30 m above the ground, as measured by tomography. In contrast, double bounce scattering appears to carry important information about the AGB of boreal forests, so ground cancellation may not be appropriate and the best approach for such forests remains to be finalized. Several methods to exploit these new data in carbon cycle calculations have already been demonstrated. In addition, major mutual gains will be made by combining BIOMASS data with data from other missions that will measure forest biomass, structure, height and change, including the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar deployed on the International Space Station after its launch in December 2018, and the NASA-ISRO NISAR L- and S-band SAR, due for launch in 2022. More generally, space-based measurements of biomass are a core component of a carbon cycle observation and modelling strategy developed by the Group on Earth Observations. Secondary objectives of the mission include imaging of sub-surface geological structures in arid environments, generation of a true Digital Terrain Model without biases caused by forest cover, and measurement of glacier and icesheet velocities. In addition, the operations needed for ionospheric correction of the data will allow very sensitive estimates of ionospheric Total Electron Content and its changes along the dawn-dusk orbit of the mission.

The experiment featured airborne Passive Active L-band System (PALS) flights over each domain with intensive ground measurements and dense networks of SM monitoring stations. With two intensive observation periods separated in time (May 28 June 20 and July 14 August 16), the flights captured both early-season/low vegetation and later-season/high-vegetation conditions. The comparison of the PALS brightness temperature (TB) measurements to the SMAP TB observed over the sites resulted in root mean square difference (RMSD) of 2.8 K and 4.0 K for vertical and horizontal polarizations, respectively. The subsequent SM analysis resealed the PALS TB with the SMAP TB to allow equitable comparisons between the SM retrievals from the two instruments. The PALS SM retrieval algorithm used the SM sampled by the ground teams during the overpass days for tuning, and was parameterized by a high-resolution vegetation water content product calibrated using vegetation samples collected during the experiment. The tuning process was not able to find a satisfactory result with a temporally constant set of parameters in the single channel algorithm for the two intensive observation periods of the experiment. This result indicated that the rapid change in the vegetation structure during the growth stages and likely variation in the surface roughness conditions were not compatible with rigid parameterization over the entire period. However, using seasonally variable parameters we found that it was possible to retrieve soil moisture with satisfactory accuracy. Comparative analysis with the SMAP SM product included aggregation of the PALS SM to the SMAP pixel-scale. The RMSD between the PALS SM and the aggregated manual field samples was < 0.04 m(3)/m(3) with Pearson correlation > 0.85 for both sites. The comparison between different in situ sources indicated that the soil moisture network measurements were not the source of the large biases observed for SMAP over the sites reported in earlier studies. Therefore, the results suggested the rapidly growing vegetation and the early-season surface condition changes not captured by the SMAP algorithm caused the SMAP retrieval errors. In addition, the significant deviations of the vegetation water content used by the SMAP product from the calibrated vegetation water content obtained during the experiment compounds the problem.

Measurement and implications of Saturn's gravity field and ring mass	SCIENCE			English	Article							JUPITERS DEEP; ZONAL WINDS; DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION; GRAVITATIONAL-FIELD; DENSITY WAVES; LONG-TERM; B-RINGS; EVOLUTION; INTERIOR; CONSTRAINTS	The interior structure of Saturn, the depth of its winds, and the mass and age of its rings constrain its formation and evolution. In the final phase of the Cassini mission, the spacecraft dived between the planet and its innermost ring, at altitudes of 2600 to 3900 kilometers above the cloud tops. During six of these crossings, a radio link with Earth was monitored to determine the gravitational field of the planet and the mass of its rings. We find that Saturn's gravity deviates from theoretical expectations and requires differential rotation of the atmosphere extending to a depth of at least 9000 kilometers. The total mass of the rings is (1.54 +/- 0.49) x 10(19) kilograms (0.41 +/- 0.13 times that of the moon Mimas), indicating that the rings may have formed 10(7) to 10(8) years ago.

Close Cassini flybys of Saturn's ring moons Pan, Daphnis, Atlas, Pandora, and Epimetheus	SCIENCE			English	Article							GENERATED DUST CLOUDS; IMAGING SCIENCE; INNER SATELLITES; ICE; MAGNETOSPHERE; SYSTEM; IRRADIATION; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; GROOVES	Saturn's main ring system is associated with a set of small moons that either are embedded within it or interact with the rings to alter their shape and composition. Five close flybys of the moons Pan, Daphnis, Atlas, Pandora, and Epimetheus were performed between December 2016 and April 2017 during the ring-grazing orbits of the Cassini mission. Data on the moons' morphology, structure, particle environment, and composition were returned, along with images in the ultraviolet and thermal infrared. We find that the optical properties of the moons' surfaces are determined by two competing processes: contamination by a red material formed in Saturn's main ring system and accretion of bright icy particles or water vapor from volcanic plumes originating on the moon Enceladus.

We present close-range remote-sensing observations of the main rings from the Cassini spacecraft. We find detailed sculpting of the rings by embedded masses, and banded texture belts throughout the rings. Saturn-orbiting streams of material impact the F ring. There are fine-scaled correlations among optical depth, spectral properties, and temperature in the B ring, but anticorrelations within strong density waves in the A ring. There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C ring, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these ring structures.

Temperature Dependence of the Reaction of Chlorine Atoms with CH3OH and CH3CHO	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							RATE CONSTANTS; CL ATOMS; CH3C(O)O-2+HO2 REACTION; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; PHOTOCHEMICAL DATA; HYDROXYL RADICALS; RATE COEFFICIENTS; GASEOUS N2O5; KINETICS; METHANOL	Rate constants of the reactions Cl + CH3OH -> CH2OH + HCl (k(1)) and Cl + CH3CHO -> CH3C(O) + HCl (k(3)) were measured at 100 Torr over the temperature range 230.3-297.1 K. Radical chemistry was initiated by pulsed laser photolysis of Cl-2 in mixtures of CH3OH and CH3CHO in a flow reactor. Heterodyne near-IR wavelength modulation spectroscopy was used to directly detect HO2 produced from the subsequent reaction of CH2OH with O-2 in real time to determine the rate of reaction of Cl with CH3OH. The rate of Cl + CH3CHO was measured relative to that of the Cl + CH3OH reaction. Secondary chemistry, including that of the adducts HO2 center dot CH3OH and HO2 center dot CH3CHO, was taken into account. The Arrhenius expressions were found to be k(1)(T) = 5.02(-1.5)(+1.8) X 10(-1)1 exp[(20 +/- 88)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k(3)(T) = 6.38(-2.0)(+2.4) X 10(-11) exp[(56 +/- 90)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (2 sigma uncertainties). The average values of the rate constants over this temperature range were k(1) = (5.45 +/- 0.37) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k(3) = (8.00 +/- 1.27) X 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (2 sigma uncertainties), consistent with current literature values.

Global distribution of methane emissions, emission trends, and OH concentrations and trends inferred from an inversion of GOSAT satellite data for 2010-2015	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; FOSSIL-FUEL; TANSO-FTS; INVENTORY; INCREASE; MODEL; CH4; SCIAMACHY; HYDROXYL	We use 2010-2015 observations of atmospheric methane columns from the GOSAT satellite instrument in a global inverse analysis to improve estimates of methane emissions and their trends over the period, as well as the global concentration of tropospheric OH (the hydroxyl radical, methane's main sink) and its trend. Our inversion solves the Bayesian optimization problem analytically including closed-form characterization of errors. This allows us to (1) quantify the information content from the inversion towards optimizing methane emissions and its trends, (2) diagnose error correlations between constraints on emissions and OH concentrations, and (3) generate a large ensemble of solutions testing different assumptions in the inversion. We show how the analytical approach can be used, even when prior error standard deviation distributions are lognormal. Inversion results show large overestimates of Chinese coal emissions and Middle East oil and gas emissions in the EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory but little error in the United States where we use a new gridded version of the EPA national greenhouse gas inventory as prior estimate. Oil and gas emissions in the EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory show large differences with national totals reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and our inversion is generally more consistent with the UNFCCC data. The observed 2010-2015 growth in atmospheric methane is attributed mostly to an increase in emissions from India, China, and areas with large tropical wetlands. The contribution from OH trends is small in comparison. We find that the inversion provides strong independent constraints on global methane emissions (546 Tg a(-1)) and global mean OH concentrations (atmospheric methane lifetime against oxidation by tropospheric OH of 10.8 +/- 0.4 years), indicating that satellite observations of atmospheric methane could provide a proxy for OH concentrations in the future.

ANITA Collaboration	Constraints on the ultrahigh-energy cosmic neutrino flux from the fourth flight of ANITA	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							RAYS; CHARGE; LIMIT	The ANtarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) NASA long-duration balloon payload completed its fourth flight in December 2016, after 28 days of flight time. ANITA is sensitive to impulsive broadband radio emission from interactions of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos in polar ice (Askaryan emission). We present the results of two separate blind analyses searching for signals from Askaryan emission in the data from the fourth flight of ANITA. The more sensitive analysis, with a better expected limit, has a background estimate of 0.64(-0.45)(+0.69) and an analysis efficiency of 82 +/- 2%. The second analysis has a background estimate of 0.34(-0.16)(+0.66) and an analysis efficiency of 71 +/- 6%. Each analysis found one event in the signal region, consistent with the background estimate for each analysis. The resulting limit further tightens the constraints on the diffuse flux of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos at energies above 10(19.5) eV.	[Gorham, P. W.; Fox, B.

Impacts of household sources on air pollution at village and regional scales in India	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ORGANIC AEROSOL FORMATION; PARTICULATE MATTER; EMISSION INVENTORIES; CARBON EMISSIONS; BLACK CARBON; EAST-ASIA; COOKING; QUALITY; OZONE; COOKSTOVES	Approximately 3 billion people worldwide cook with solid fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and agricultural residues. These fuels, also used for residential heating, are often combusted in inefficient devices, producing carbonaceous emissions. Between 2.6 and 3.8 million premature deaths occur as a result of exposure to fine particulate matter from the resulting household air pollution (Health Effects Institute, 2018a; World Health Organization, 2018). Household air pollution also contributes to ambient air pollution; the magnitude of this contribution is uncertain. Here, we simulate the distribution of the two major health-damaging outdoor air pollutants (PM2.5 and O-3) using state-of-the-science emissions databases and atmospheric chemical transport models to estimate the impact of household combustion on ambient air quality in India. The present study focuses on New Delhi and the SOMAARTH Demographic, Development, and Environmental Surveillance Site (DDESS) in the Palwal District of Haryana, located about 80 km south of New Delhi. The DDESS covers an approximate population of 200 000 within 52 villages. The emissions inventory used in the present study was prepared based on a national inventory in India (Sharma et al., 2015, 2016), an updated residential sector inventory prepared at the University of Illinois, updated cookstove emissions factors from Fleming et al. (2018b), and PM2.5 speciation from cooking fires from Jayarathne et al. (2018). Simulation of regional air quality was carried out using the US Environmental Protection Agency Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) in conjunction with the Weather Research and Forecasting modeling system (WRF) to simulate the meteorological inputs for CMAQ, and the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to generate concentrations on the boundary of the computational domain. Comparisons between observed and simulated O-3 and PM2.5 levels are carried out to assess overall airborne levels and to estimate the contribution of household cooking emissions. Observed and predicted ozone levels over New Delhi during September 2015, December 2015, and September 2016 routinely exceeded the 8 h Indian standard of 100 mu g m(-3), and, on occasion, exceeded 180 mu g m(-3). PM2.5 levels are predicted over the SOMAARTH headquarters (September 2015 and September 2016), Bajada Pahari (a village in the surveillance site; September 2015, December 2015, and September 2016), and New Delhi (September 2015, December 2015, and September 2016). The predicted fractional impact of residential emissions on anthropogenic PM2.5 levels varies from about 0.27 in SOMAARTH HQ and Bajada Pahari to about 0.10 in New Delhi. The predicted secondary organic portion of PM2.5 produced by household emissions ranges from 16% to 80 %. Predicted levels of secondary organic PM2.5 during the periods studied at the four locations averaged about 30 mu g m(-3), representing approximately 30% and 20% of total PM2.5 levels in the rural and urban stations, respectively.

Recent advances in remote sensing allow the detection of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission from vegetation, which has been empirically linked to GPP at large spatial scales. This is particularly important in evergreen forests, where traditional remote-sensing techniques and terrestrial biosphere models fail to reproduce the seasonality of GPP. Here, we examined the mechanistic relationship between SIF retrieved from a canopy spectrometer system and GPP at a winter-dormant conifer forest, which has little seasonal variation in canopy structure, needle chlorophyll content, and absorbed light. Both SIF and GPP track each other in a consistent, dynamic fashion in response to environmental conditions. SIF and GPP are well correlated (R-2 = 0.62-0.92) with an invariant slope over hourly to weekly timescales. Large seasonal variations in SIF yield capture changes in photoprotective pigments and photosystem II operating efficiency associated with winter acclimation, highlighting its unique ability to precisely track the seasonality of photosynthesis. Our results underscore the potential of new satellite-based SIF products (TROPOMI, OCO-2) as proxies for the timing and magnitude of GPP in evergreen forests at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.

We do not find a significant difference in mean f(star) between the two selection methods; though, we do find an unexpectedly large range in f(star) for the SZ-selected clusters. In addition, we measure the luminosity function of the MaDCoWS clusters and find m* = 19.41 +/- 0.07, similar to other studies of clusters at or near our redshift range. Finally, we present SZ detections and masses for seven MaDCoWS clusters and new spectroscopic redshifts for five MaDCoWS clusters. One of these new clusters, MOO J1521+0452 at z = 1.31, is the most distant MaDCoWS cluster confirmed to date.

Of the 50 G0-M3 Upper Sco members with disks in our sample, only seven host a stellar companion within 2 '' and brighter than K = 15, compared to 35 of 75 members without disks. This matches a trend seen in the 1-2 Myr old Taurus region, where systems with a stellar companion within 40 au have a lower fraction of infrared-identified disks than those without such companions, indicating shorter disk lifetimes in close multiple systems. However, the fractions of disk systems with a stellar companion within 40 au match in Upper Sco and Taurus. Additionally, we see no difference in the millimeter brightnesses of disks in Upper Sco systems with and without companions, in contrast to Taurus where systems with a companion within 300 au are significantly fainter than wider and single systems. These results suggest that the effects of stellar companions on disk lifetimes occur within the first 1-2 Myr of disk evolution, after which companions play little further role. By contrast, disks around single stars lose the millimeter-sized dust grains in their outer regions between ages of 1-2 Myr and 5-11 Myr. The end result of small dust disk sizes and faint millimeter luminosities is the same whether the disk has been truncated by a companion or has evolved through internal processes.

The companion is detected in 14 years of precise radial velocity (RV) data, and in high-resolution imaging observations. RVs of HD 159062 from 2003 to 2018 reveal an acceleration of -13.3 +/- 0.12 m s(-1 )yr(-1), indicating that it hosts a companion with a long-period orbit. Subsequent imaging observations with the ShaneAO system on the Lick Observatory 3 m Shane telescope, the PHARO AO system on the Palomar Observatory 5 m telescope, and the NIRC2 AO system at the Keck II 10 m telescope reveal a faint companion 2 ''.7 from the primary star. We performed relative photometry, finding Delta J = 10.09 +/- 0.38 mag, Delta K-S = 10.06 +/- 0.22 mag, and Delta L' = 9.67 +/- 0.08 mag for the companion from these observations. Analysis of the radial velocities, astrometry, and photometry reveals that the combined data set can only be reconciled for the scenario where HD 159062 B is a white dwarf. A full Bayesian analysis of the RV and imaging data to obtain the cooling age, mass, and orbital parameters of the white dwarf indicates that the companion is an old M-B = 0.65(-0.04)(+0.12)M(circle dot) white dwarf with an orbital period of P = 250(-7)(6)(+130) yr, and a cooling age of tau = 8.2(-0.5)(+0.3) Gyr.

Fundamentals of Nuclear Star Clusters over Seven Decades in Galaxy Mass	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: individual (Virgo); galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: photometry; galaxies: star clusters: general; globular clusters: general	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; GIANT GLOBULAR-CLUSTER; COMPACT DWARF GALAXIES; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SPIRAL GALAXIES; FORNAX CLUSTER; OMEGA-CENTAURI; STELLAR POPULATION; FORMATION EFFICIENCIES; BRIGHTNESS PROFILES	Using deep, high-resolution optical imaging from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey, we study the properties of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in a sample of nearly 400 quiescent galaxies in the core of Virgo with stellar masses 10(5) less than or similar to M-*/M-circle dot less than or similar to 10(12). The nucleation fraction reaches a peak value f(n) approximate to 90% for M-* approximate to 10(9) M-circle dot galaxies and declines for both higher and lower masses, but nuclei populate galaxies as small as M-* approximate to 5 x 10(5) M-circle dot. Comparison with literature data for nearby groups and clusters shows that at the low-mass end nucleation is more frequent in denser environments. The NSC mass function peaks at M-NSC approximate to 7 x 10(5) M-circle dot, a factor 3-4 times larger than the turnover mass for globular clusters (GCs). We find a nonlinear relation between the stellar masses of NSCs and those of their host galaxies, with a mean nucleus-to-galaxy mass ratio that drops to M-NSC/M-* approximate to 3.6 x 10(-3) for M-* approximate to 5 x 10(9) M-circle dot galaxies. Nuclei in both more and less massive galaxies are much more prominent: M-NSC proportional to M-*(0.46) at the low-mass end, where nuclei are nearly 50% as massive as their hosts. We measure an intrinsic scatter in NSC masses at a fixed galaxy stellar mass of 0.4 dex, which we interpret as evidence that the process of NSC growth is significantly stochastic. At low galaxy masses we find a close connection between NSCs and GC systems, including very similar occupation distributions and comparable total masses. We discuss these results in the context of current dissipative and dissipationless models of NSC formation.

ZTF18aalrxas: A Type IIb Supernova from a Very Extended Low-mass Progenitor	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual (ZTF18aalrxas)	BOLOMETRIC LIGHT CURVES; CIRCUMSTELLAR INTERACTION; EVOLUTION; SPECTROSCOPY; PARAMETERS; TELESCOPE; EMISSION; SPECTRA; COMPACT; 2013DF	We investigate ZTF18aalrxas, a double-peaked Type IIb core-collapse supernova (SN) discovered during science validation of the Zwicky Transient Facility. ZTF18aalrxas was discovered while the optical emission was still rising toward the initial cooling peak (0.7 mag over 2 days). Our observations consist of multi-band (ultraviolet and optical) light curves (LCs), and optical spectra spanning from approximate to 0.7 to approximate to 480 days past the explosion. We use a Monte-Carlo based non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model that simultaneously reproduces both the Ni-56-powered bolometric LC and our nebular spectrum. This model is used to constrain the synthesized radioactive nickel mass (0.17 M-circle dot) and the total ejecta mass (1.7 M-circle dot) of the SN. The cooling emission is modeled using semi-analytical extended envelope models to constrain the progenitor radius (790-1050 R-circle dot) at the time of explosion. Our nebular spectrum shows signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), and this spectrum is modeled and analyzed to constrain the amount of ejected oxygen (0.3-0.5 M-circle dot) and the total hydrogen mass (approximate to 0.15 M-circle dot) in the envelope of the progenitor. The oxygen mass of ZTF18aalrxas is consistent with a low (12-13 M-circle dot) zero-age main-sequence mass progenitor. The LCs and spectra of ZTF18aalrxas are not consistent with massive single-star SN Type IIb progenitor models. The presence of an extended hydrogen envelope of low mass, the presence of a dense CSM, the derived ejecta mass, and the late-time oxygen emission can all be explained in a binary model scenario.

Slowdown in Antarctic mass loss from solid Earth and sea-level feedbacks	SCIENCE			English	Article							ICE-SHEET; THWAITES GLACIER; WEST ANTARCTICA; BED TOPOGRAPHY; PINE ISLAND; RETREAT; COLLAPSE; SENSITIVITIES; CONSISTENT; CRYOSPHERE	Geodetic investigations of crustal motions in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica and models of ice-sheet evolution in the past 10,000 years have recently highlighted the stabilizing role of solid-Earth uplift on polar ice sheets. One critical aspect, however, that has not been assessed is the impact of short-wavelength uplift generated by the solid-Earth response to unloading over short time scales close to ice-sheet grounding lines (areas where the ice becomes afloat). Here, we present a new global simulation of Antarctic evolution at high spatiotemporal resolution that captures all solid Earth processes that affect ice sheets and show a projected negative feedback in grounding line migration of 38% for Thwaites Glacier 350 years in the future, or 26.8% reduction in corresponding sea-level contribution.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: Constraints on extended cosmological models from galaxy clustering and weak lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; SDSS; GRAVITY; DES; NUCLEOSYNTHESIS; NEUTRINOS; EFFICIENT; GEOMETRY; LAMBDA	We present constraints on extensions of the minimal cosmological models dominated by dark matter and dark energy, Lambda CDM and wCDM, by using a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing from the first-year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1) in combination with external data. We consider four extensions of the minimal dark energy-dominated scenarios: (1) nonzero curvature Omega(k), (2) number of relativistic species N-eff different from the standard value of 3.046, (3) time-varying equation-of-state of dark energy described by the parameters w(0) and w(a) (alternatively quoted by the values at the pivot redshift, w(p), and w(a)), and (4) modified gravity described by the parameters is mu(0) and Sigma(0) that modify the metric potentials. We also consider external information from Planck cosmic microwave background measurements; baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from SDSS, 6dF, and BOSS; redshift-space distortion measurements from BOSS; and type Ia supernova information from the Pantheon compilation of datasets. Constraints on curvature and the number of relativistic species are dominated by the external data; when these are combined with DES Y1, we find Omega(k) = 0.0020(-0.0032)(+0.0037) at the 68% confidence level, and the upper limit N-eff < 3.28(3.55) at 68% (95%) confidence, assuming a hard prior N-eff > 3.0. For the time-varying equation-of-state, we find the pivot value (w(p), w(a)) = (-0.91(-0.23)(+0.19), -0.57(-1.11)(+0.93)) at pivot redshift z(p )= 0.27 from DES alone, and (w(p), w(a)) = (-1.01(-0.04)(+0.04), -0.28(-0.48)(+0.37)) at z(p) = 0.20 from DES Y1 combined with external data; in either case we find no evidence for the temporal variation of the equation of state. For modified gravity, we find the present-day value of the relevant parameters to be Sigma(0) = 0.43(-)(0.29)(+0.28) from DES Y1 alone, and (Sigma(0), mu(0)) = (0.06(-0.07)(+0.08), -0.11(-0.46)(+0.42)) from DES Y1 combined with external data. These modified-gravity constraints are consistent with predictions from general relativity.	[Abbott, T. M. C.; Walker, A.

Constraining the parameters of GW150914 and GW170104 with numerical relativity surrogates	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Gravitational-wave (GW) detectors have begun to observe coalescences of heavy black hole binaries (M greater than or similar to 50 M-circle dot) at a consistent pace for the past few years. Accurate models of gravitational waveforms are essential for unbiased and precise estimation of source parameters, such as masses and spins of component black holes. Recently developed surrogate models based on high-accuracy numerical relativity (NR) simulations provide ideal models for constraining physical parameters describing these heavy black hole merger events. In this paper, we first demonstrate the viability of these multi-modal surrogate models as reliable parameter estimation tools. We show that within a fully Bayesian framework, NR surrogates can help extract additional information from GW observations that is inaccessible to traditional models. We demonstrate this by analyzing a set of synthetic signals with NR surrogate templates and comparing against contemporary approximate models. We then consider the case of two of the earliest binary black holes detected by the LIGO observatories, GW150914 and GW170104. We reanalyze their data with the generically precessing NR-based surrogate model and freely provide the resulting posterior samples as supplemental material. We find that our refined analysis is able to extract information from sub-dominant GW harmonics in data, and therefore better resolve the degeneracy in measuring source luminosity distance and orbital inclination for both events. Our analysis estimates the sources of both events to be 20%-25% further away than was previously estimated. Our analysis also constrains their orbital orientations more tightly around face-on or face-off configurations than before. Additionally, for GW150914 we constrain the effective inspiral spin chi(eff )more tightly around zero. This work is one of the first to unambiguously extract sub-dominant GW mode information from real events. It is also a first step toward eliminating the approximations used in semi-analytic waveform models from GW parameter estimation. It strongly motivates that NR surrogates be extended to cover more of the binary black hole parameter space.

Isotropic non-Gaussian g(NL)-like toy models that reproduce cosmic microwave background anomalies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; inflation	HEMISPHERICAL POWER ASYMMETRY; SKY; BISPECTRUM	Context. Based on recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), claims of statistical anomalies in the properties of the CMB fluctuations have been made. Although the statistical significance of the anomalies remains only at the similar to 2-3 sigma significance level, the fact that there are many different anomalies, several of which support a possible deviation from statistical isotropy, has motivated a search for models that provide a common mechanism to generate them. Aims. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether these anomalies could originate from non-Gaussian cosmological models, and to determine what properties these models should have. Methods. We present a simple isotropic, non-Gaussian class of toy models that can reproduce six of the most extensively studied anomalies. We compare the presence of anomalies found in simulated maps generated from the toy models and from a standard model with Gaussian fluctuations. Results. We show that the following anomalies, as found in the Planck data, commonly occur in the toy model maps: (1) large-scale hemispherical asymmetry (large-scale dipolar modulation), (2) small-scale hemispherical asymmetry (alignment of the spatial distribution of CMB power over all scales l = [2, 1500]), (3) a strongly non-Gaussian hot or cold spot, (4) a low power spectrum amplitude for l < 30, including specifically (5) a low quadrupole and an unusual alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole, and (6) parity asymmetry of the lowest multipoles. We note that this class of toy model resembles models of primordial non-Gaussianity characterised by strongly scale-dependent g(NL)-like trispectra.	[Hansen, F.

Global satellite-driven estimates of heterotrophic respiration	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							CARBON USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; PLANT RESPIRATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CYCLE; CLIMATE; DYNAMICS	While heterotrophic respiration (R-h) makes up about a quarter of gross global terrestrial carbon fluxes, it remains among the least-observed carbon fluxes, particularly outside the midlatitudes. In situ measurements collected in the Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) number only a few hundred worldwide. Similarly, only a single data-driven wall-to-wall estimate of annual average heterotrophic respiration exists, based on bottom-up upscaling of SRDB measurements using an assumed functional form to account for climate variability. In this study, we exploit recent advances in remote sensing of terrestrial carbon fluxes to estimate global variations in heterotrophic respiration in a top-down fashion at monthly temporal resolution and 4 degrees x 5 degrees spatial resolution. We combine net ecosystem productivity estimates from atmospheric inversions of the NASA Carbon Monitoring System-Flux (CMS-Flux) with an optimally scaled gross primary productivity dataset based on satellite-observed solar-induced fluorescence variations to estimate total ecosystem respiration as a residual of the terrestrial carbon balance. The ecosystem respiration is then separated into autotrophic and heterotrophic components based on a spatially varying carbon use efficiency retrieved in a model-data fusion framework (the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework, CARDAMOM). The resulting dataset is independent of any assumptions about how heterotrophic respiration responds to climate or substrate variations. It estimates an annual average global average heterotrophic respiration flux of 43.6 +/- 19.3 PgC yr(-1). Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses showed that the top-down R-h are more sensitive to the choice of input gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) datasets than to the assumption of a static carbon use efficiency (CUE) value, with the possible exception of the wet tropics. These top-down estimates are compared to bottom-up estimates of annual heterotrophic respiration, using new uncertainty estimates that partially account for sampling and model errors. Top-down heterotrophic respiration estimates are higher than those from bottom-up upscaling everywhere except at high latitudes and are 30% greater overall (43.6 Pg Cyr(-1) vs. 33.4 Pg Cyr(--1)). The uncertainty ranges of both methods are comparable, except poleward of 45 degrees N, where bottom-up uncertainties are greater. The ratio of top-down heterotrophic to total ecosystem respiration varies seasonally by as much as 0.6 depending on season and climate, illustrating the importance of studying the drivers of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration separately, and thus the importance of data-driven estimates of R-h such as those estimated here.

Modeling the Response of the Langtang Glacier and the Hintereisferner to a Changing Climate Since the Little Ice Age	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						ice flow modeling; shallow ice approximation; little ice age; climate change; Langtang Glacier; Hintereisferner	DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIERS; TEMPERATURE LAPSE RATES; OTZTAL ALPS AUSTRIA; MASS-BALANCE; AIR-TEMPERATURE; 21ST-CENTURY EVOLUTION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; 20-1ST CENTURY; MOUNT EVEREST; NEPAL	This study aims at developing and applying a spatially-distributed coupled glacier mass balance and ice-flow model to attribute the response of glaciers to natural and anthropogenic climate change. We focus on two glaciers with contrasting surface characteristics: a debris-covered glacier (Langtang Glacier in Nepal) and a clean-ice glacier (Hintereisferner in Austria). The model is applied from the end of the Little Ice Age (1850) to the present-day (2016) and is forced with four bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the historical experiment of the CMIP5 archive. The selected GCMs represent region-specific warm-dry, warm-wet, cold-dry, and cold-wet climate conditions. To isolate the effects of anthropogenic climate change on glacier mass balance and flow runs from these GCMs with and without further anthropogenic forcing after 1970 until 2016 are selected. The outcomes indicate that both glaciers experience the largest reduction in area and volume under warm climate conditions, whereas area and volume reductions are smaller under cold climate conditions. Simultaneously with changes in glacier area and volume, surface velocities generally decrease over time. Without further anthropogenic forcing the results reveal a 3% (9%) smaller decline in glacier area (volume) for the debris-covered glacier and a 18% (39%) smaller decline in glacier area (volume) for the clean-ice glacier. The difference in the magnitude between the two glaciers can mainly be attributed to differences in the response time of the glaciers, where the clean-ice glacier shows a much faster response to climate change. We conclude that the response of the two glaciers can mainly be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and that the impact is larger on the clean-ice glacier. The outcomes show that the model performs well under different climate conditions and that the developed approach can be used for regional-scale glacio-hydrological modeling.

Here, we provide a large data set of ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) levels observed (for 11 666 and 10 681 h, respectively) over oceans. The data set is derived from observations made during 24 research cruise legs of R/V Mirai during 2012 to 2017, in the Southern, Indian, Pacific, and Arctic oceans, covering the region from 67 degrees S to 75 degrees N. The data are suitable for critical evaluation of the over-ocean distribution of ozone derived from global atmospheric chemistry models. We first give an overview of the statistics in the data set and highlight key features in terms of geographical distribution and air mass type. We then use the data set to evaluate ozone mixing ratio fields from the tropospheric chemistry reanalysis version 2 (TCR-2), produced by assimilating a suite of satellite observations of multiple species into a global atmospheric chemistry model, namely CHASER. For long-range transport of polluted air masses from continents to the oceans, during which the effects of forest fires and fossil fuel combustion were recognized, TCR-2 gave an excellent performance in reproducing the observed temporal variations and photochemical buildup of O-3 when assessed from Delta O-3/Delta CO ratios. For clean marine conditions with low and stable CO mixing ratios, two focused analyses were performed. The first was in the Arctic (> 70 degrees N) in September every year from 2013 to 2016; TCR-2 underpredicted O-3 levels by 6.7 ppbv (21 %) on average. The observed vertical profiles from O-3 soundings from R/V Mirai during September 2014 had less steep vertical gradients at low altitudes (> 850 hPa) than those obtained by TCR-2. This suggests the possibility of a more efficient descent of the O-3-rich air from above than assumed in the models. For TCR-2 (CHASER), dry deposition on the Arctic ocean surface might also have been overestimated. In the second analysis, over the western Pacific equatorial region (125-165 degrees E, 10 degrees S to 25 degrees N), the observed O-3 level more frequently decreased to less than 10 ppbv in comparison to that obtained with TCR-2 and also those obtained in most of the Atmospheric Chemistry Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) model runs for the decade from 2000. These results imply loss processes that are unaccounted for in the models. We found that the model's positive bias positively correlated with the daytime residence times of air masses over a particular grid, namely 165-180 degrees E and 1530 degrees N; an additional loss rate of 0.25 ppbvh(-1) in the grid best explained the gap. Halogen chemistry, which is commonly omitted from currently used models, might be active in this region and could have contributed to additional losses. Our open data set covering wide ocean regions is complementary to the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report data set, which basically comprises ground-based observations and enables a fully global study of the behavior of O-3.

We apply this methodology to obtain a detailed 15-year survey of the Morandi bridge (Polcevera Viaduct) in the form of relative displacements across the structure prior to its collapse on August 14th 2018. We generated a displacement map for the structure from space-based SAR measurements acquired by the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed and the European constellation Sentinel-1A/B over the period 2009-2018. Historical satellite datasets include Envisat data spanning 2003-2011. The map reveals that the bridge was undergoing an increased magnitude of deformations over time prior to its collapse.

Specifically, we use the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) model driven with Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) information and Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) products. We discuss the results from our comparison of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite East (GOES-E) with the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (MOD11) products, as well as several independent sources of ground observations, for daytime and nighttime independently. Based on a six-year record at instantaneous time scale (2004-2009), most LST estimates are within one std from the mean observed value and the bias is under 1% of the mean. It was also shown that at several ground sites, the diurnal cycle of LST, as averaged over six years, is consistent with a similar record generated from satellite observations. Since the evaluation of the GOES-E LST estimates occurred at every hour, day and night, the data are well suited to address outstanding issues related to the temporal variability of LST, specifically, the diurnal cycle and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, which are not well represented in LST retrievals form Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.

Modeling and Evaluation of Robust Whole-Hand Caging Manipulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Caging; dexterous manipulation; open loop; whole-hand manipulation	COMPLIANT; GRASPS; ROBOT	Human in-hand dexterity can be highly fluid and unstructured, with multiple phalanxes breaking and re-establishing contact during any given task. In contrast, prevailing research in robotic manipulation has focused on highly structured well-controlled motions, where contact points are carefully characterized. Maintaining grasp stability by satisfying traditional closure conditions during complex within-hand manipulation motions can be difficult, even with highly articulated end effectors. However, simple grippers can still achieve an effective range of in-hand manipulation tasks without strict closure conditions, as long as the object can be bounded locally relative to the hand frame. The end effector can be considered as a tool to limit the range of possible object poses. In particular, the energy of the hand-object system can be used to determine an attractor region toward which the hand drives the object. This can be combined with a sparse sampling of the configuration space to find a set of manipulation primitives that can reliably constrain the object inside the hand workspace even without feedback, a strategy proposed as whole-hand caging manipulation. In this paper, experimental results with a planar underactuated gripper are presented to validate this manipulation strategy, and it is shown that even though contacts are regularly broken and reformed, the object can be reliably manipulated within the hand workspace without ejection, and challenging movements such as sliding and gaiting can be reliably performed.

To address this, we disentangle simultaneous drivers of fluorescence spectra by coupling active and passive fluorescence measurements with photosynthesis. We show empirical and mechanistic evidence for where, why, and to what extent leaf fluorescence spectra change. Three distinct components explain more than 95% of the variance in leaf fluorescence spectra under both steady-state and changing illumination conditions. A single spectral shape of fluorescence explains 84% of the variance across a wide range of species. The magnitude of this shape responds to absorbed light and photosynthetic up/down regulation; meanwhile, chlorophyll concentration and nonphotochemical quenching control 9% and 3% of the remaining spectral variance, respectively. The spectral shape of fluorescence is remarkably stable where most current satellite retrievals occur (far-red, >740nm), and dynamic downregulation of photosynthesis reduces fluorescence magnitude similarly across the 670- to 850-nm range. We conduct an exploratory analysis of hourly red and far-red canopy SIF in soybean, which shows a subtle change in red:far-red fluorescence coincident with photosynthetic downregulation but is overshadowed by longer-term changes in canopy chlorophyll and structure. Based on our leaf and canopy analysis, caution should be taken when attributing large changes in the spectral shape of remotely sensed SIF to plant stress, particularly if data acquisition is temporally sparse. Ultimately, changes in SIF magnitude at wavelengths greater than 740 nm alone may prove sufficient for tracking photosynthetic dynamics. Plain Language Summary Satellite remote sensing provides a global picture of photosynthetic activity-allowing us to see when, where, and how much CO2 plants are assimilating. To do this, satellites measure a small emission of energy from the plants called chlorophyll fluorescence. However, this measurement is typically made across a narrow wavelength range, while the emission spectrum (650-850 nm) is quite dynamic. We show where, why, and to what extent leaf fluorescence spectra change across a diverse range of species and conditions, ultimately informing canopy remote sensing measurements. Results suggest that wavelengths currently used by satellites are stable enough to track the downregulation of photosynthesis resulting from stress, while spectral shape changes respond more strongly to dynamics in canopy structure and chlorophyll concentration.

Due to gas production measurable subsidence and seismicity has been detected across this region, attributed to the deformations induced by reservoir pore pressure depletion. We investigate the surface displacement history using a principal component analysis-based inversion method to combine a diverse set of optical leveling, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and Global Positioning System data to better constrain reservoir compaction and subsidence history. The generated compaction model is then used in combination with prior pressure depletion models to determine a reservoir uniaxial compressibility. The best fitting model of uniaxial compressibility is time independent but spatially variable. The absence of evidence for any significant time delay between changes in depletion and compaction rates supports an instantaneous poroelastic reservoir response. The absence of nonlinear yielding at the largest compaction strains suggests that anelastic deformations are a minor part of reservoir compaction.

After the SMAP L1B_TB data product version 3 was released in 2016, the radiometer has been undergoing further calibration and validation with the goal of reducing both the bias in the cold-sky measurements and calibration drift in the global ocean measurements experienced during eclipse seasons in data product version 3. The post-launch calibration algorithm has been upgraded by using new estimates of the reflector emissivity as well as using multiple scenes to calibrate the radiometer internal reference sources and antenna gain simultaneously. In addition, a correction offset is applied to the ocean roughness model for horizontal polarization based on nadir observations. Test and validation results show that the goal is achieved (e.g., biases are removed and the calibration stability achieved for data release version 4 is 0.1 K (rms) over both the global ocean and CS).

Degradation of Endeavour Crater Based on Orbital and Rover-Based Observations in Combination With Landscape Evolution Modeling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							MERIDIANI-PLANUM; INTERPLANETARY CRUISE; BURNS FORMATION; MARS-EXPRESS; DEPOSITS; IMPACT; EXPLORATION; EROSION; SYSTEM; CAMERA	Exploration of Endeavour crater's Shoemaker formation rim rocks by the Opportunity rover, combined with extensive observations from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters, provides unique and quantitative insights into the processes that have degraded this 22-km diameter Noachian age impact crater. These insights are informed by comparisons between Endeavour and the relatively young, and morphologically fresh appearing, 19-km diameter Bopolu crater located 65km to the southwest. Analyses of rover and orbiter data, combined with landscape evolution modeling using Bopolu topography as a starting point, demonstrate that significant weathering and fluvial degradation of Endeavour occurred during the Noachian Period, with similar to 0.3km of vertical rim removal, similar to 0.9-km backwasting of the rim, and deposition of similar to 0.5km of fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine sediments on the crater floor, sourced from rim erosion. Pediments formed on external rim segments, with characteristic thin regolith covers over graded bedrock. Late Noachian to Early Hesperian age Grasberg formation draping sediments, and Burns formation sulfate-rich sandstones, subsequently embayed all but high standing Shoemaker formation rocks. Burns formation strata accumulated in the crater interior up to a depth of similar to 0.8km. Subsequent wind erosion of the interior deposits is indicated by an interior mound and moat, together with yardangs carved into Shoemaker formation rocks, and graded topographic profiles from Grasberg and Burns formation rocks up and through the interior rim Shoemaker formation outcrops. Up to similar to 0.4km of Burns formation rocks were exhumed from within the crater by wind erosion to produce the mound and moat. Plain Language Summary The Opportunity Rover explored the rim of the Noachian age Endeavour crater from 2010 to 2018. Only small segments of its rim are exposed above a regional sulfate-bearing sandstone unit called the Burns formation. By studying the morphology of these rim segments with orbital data sets and observations from Opportunity, the history of the degradation of the crater was identified. The nearby Bopolu crater is similar in size to Endeavour but is younger and fresher. Simulating the erosion of Bopolu to create a crater rim that looks similar to Endeavour's current rim shows that Endeavour experienced a late Noachian period of fluvial erosion in an arid environment. Erosion lowered the crater rim by similar to 0.3km, routing similar to 0.5-km thick section of sediment into the crater interior, where a very shallow lake was likely present. Endeavour was then partially buried by Grasberg and Burns formation rocks. Since then, regional winds coming from the east have excavated some of the interior sandstone unit in Endeavour and carved into the interior rim, including Perseverance Valley.	[Hughes, M.

Landslides on Ceres: Inferences Into Ice Content and Layering in the Upper Crust	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Ceres; landslides; ground ice; surface processes	WATER ICE; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; VALLES MARINERIS; ROCK AVALANCHES; SHEAR-STRENGTH; STRAIN-RATE; FRICTION; MOBILITY; FLUIDIZATION; TEMPERATURE	We analyze landslides on Ceres using several quantitative approaches to constrain the composition and structure of the top few kilometers of Ceres' crust. We focus on a subset of archetypal landslides classified morphologically as thick, steep-snouted type 1 (T1) flows and thin spatulate type 2 (T2) flows (Schmidt et al., 2017, ) to explore the landslides' mechanical properties. Our results confirm earlier observations showing that T1 landslides are typically found poleward of 70 degrees latitude and T2 mostly equatorward of 70 degrees latitude. Measurements of landslide drop height and runout length imply effective friction coefficients lower than common friction coefficients in any of Ceres' identified or suggested non-ice surface materials, including saturated clays. Our measurements of the volume and area of landslide scars suggest that T1 landslides can fail to greater depths than T2 for a given scar area, consistent with depth-limited failure in T2 landslides. These results are consistent with a layer of lower shear strength material overlying a stronger layer in Ceres' outer shell at low to middle latitudes and a single layer without an overlying weak layer at polar latitudes. Combining these observations with known constraints on Ceres' near-surface composition, we propose that Ceres' crust at low to middle latitudes consists of a topmost layer with an ice content in excess of the spectral and elemental detection depths, thins out at high latitudes, and overlies a stronger and more ice-rich layer. Plan Language Summary We use landslides on Ceres to explore the possible ice content and distribution in the upper few kilometers of Ceres. The landslides used here are a subset of the best examples of the main types of landslides identified in earlier work. We confirm that type 1 landslides are only common poleward of 70 degrees latitude and type 2 landslides are commonly equatorward of 70 degrees latitude. Friction coefficients estimated from the landslide drop height and runout length span a range suggestive of ice. Volume and area measurements of the landslide failure scar are consistent with a weak layer overlying a stronger layer at latitudes where type 2 landslides are common and a single layer in the case of type 1 landslides, located primarily in polar latitudes. We propose that the weak layer suggested at middle and low latitudes thins out at the poles and that the stronger layer has higher ice content.	[Chilton, H. T.; Schmidt, B.

The Solar and Interplanetary Causes of Superstorms (Minimum Dst <=-250 nT) During the Space Age	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							MAJOR MAGNETIC STORMS; INTERACTION REGIONS; APRIL 2000; INTENSE; FIELD; SUPERINTENSE; DEPENDENCE; UPSTREAM; WEATHER; ORIGIN	A comprehensive study of all superstorms (minimum Dst <= -250 nT) occurring during the space age (after 1957) and their interplanetary and solar causes has been performed. Most superstorms were driven solely by the sheath preceding an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or by a combination of the sheath and an ICME magnetic cloud. Only one superstorm was driven solely by a magnetic cloud. There were two superstorms caused by "compound events" with two ICMEs. No superstorms in this study were induced by corotating interaction regions. For the interplanetary shocks antisunward of the ICMEs, the shock normal angles were almost all quasi-perpendicular. Quasi-perpendicular shocks theoretically cause greater sheath magnetic field intensities than do quasi-parallel shocks. Larger shock normal angles statistically corresponded to greater superstorm intensities. Ninety percent of the superstorms occurred either near solar maximum or during the declining phase, 8% of the superstorms occurred during the ascending phase, and 2% of the superstorms occurred during solar minimum. Fifty-four percent of the superstorms were associated with X-class solar flares, 36% were associated with M-class flares, and 5% with C-class flares. All solar flares related to superstorms occurred in active regions, indicating the importance of active regions to superstorms. Most flares were located in the central meridian or slightly west of it as expected. Two superstorms were caused by limb flares, one on the west limb (confirmed) and the other on the east limb (unconfirmed). The confirmed event was a sheath event led by a Mach 4.1 shock.

ESPEI uses a linear fitting strategy to parameterize Gibbs energy functions of single phases based on their thermochemical data and refines the model parameters using phase equilibrium data through Bayesian parameter estimation within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo machine learning approach. In this paper, the methodologies employed in ESPEI are discussed in detail and demonstrated for the Cu-Mg system down to 0 K using unary descriptions based on segmented regression. The model parameter uncertainties are quantified and propagated to the Gibbs energy functions.

Our findings are based on survey data collected from 1041 ARSET participants from 117 countries who attended ARSET trainings between 2013 and 2016. To assess the impact of the ARSET program, we analyzed changes in three metrics. Results show that 83% of all respondents increased their knowledge of remote-sensing data products at least moderately, 79% increased their ability to access data, and 73% increased their ability to make decisions. We also examined how respondents are using remote-sensing data across 40 specific work tasks ranging from research to decision support applications. More than 50% of respondents reported an increase in data use for all except two of the tasks. ARSET will use these findings, together with participant data on future training needs, to set future directions for the program.

The Bank of America Chicago Marathon (Chicago, Illinois USA) is one of the largest marathons in the world, and with the improvement of technology, the use of historical patient and event data, in conjunction with environmental conditions, can provide organizers and public safety officials a way to plan based on injury patterns and patient demands for care by predicting the placement and timing of needed medical support and resources.Problem:During large-scale events, disaster planning and preparedness between event organizers, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and local, state, and federal agencies is critical to ensure participant and public safety.Methods:This study looked at the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, a significant endurance event, and took a unique approach of reviewing digital runner data retrospectively over a five-year period to establish patterns of medical demand geographically, temporally, and by the presenting diagnoses. Most medical complaints were musculoskeletal in nature; however, there were life-threatening conditions such as hyperthermia and cardiac incidents that highlight the need for detailed planning, coordination, and communication to ensure a safe and secure event.Conclusions:The Chicago Marathon is one of the largest marathons in the world, and this study identified an equal number of participants requiring care on-course and at the finish line. Most medical complaints were musculoskeletal in nature; however, there were life-threatening conditions such as hyperthermia and cardiac incidents that highlight the need for detailed planning, multi-disciplined coordination, and communication to ensure a safe and secure event. As technology has evolved, the use, analysis, and implementation of historical digital data with various environmental conditions can provide organizers and public safety officials a map to plan injury patterns and patient demands by predicting the placement and timing of needed medical support, personnel, and resources.

At the middle to low latitudes, the East Asian monsoon region has higher productivity than forests in Europe-Africa and North America, but its estimate by current generation of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) has seldom been systematically evaluated. Here, we developed a traceability framework to evaluate the simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) by 15 TBMs in the East Asian monsoon region. The framework links GPP to net primary productivity, biomass, leaf area and back to GPP via incorporating multiple vegetation functional properties of carbon-use efficiency (CUE), vegetation C turnover time (tau(veg)), leaf C fraction (F-leaf), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area index (LAI)-level photosynthesis (P-LAI), respectively. We then applied a relative importance algorithm to attribute intermodel variation at each node. The results showed that large intermodel variation in GPP over 1901-2010 were mainly propagated from their different representation of vegetation functional properties. For example, SLA explained 77% of the intermodel difference in leaf area, which contributed 90% to the simulated GPP differences. In addition, the models simulated higher CUE (18.1 21.3%), tau(veg) (18.2 26.9%), and SLA (27.436.5%) than observations, leading to the overestimation of simulated GPP across the East Asian monsoon region. These results suggest the large uncertainty of current TBMs in simulating GPP is largely propagated from their poor representation of the vegetation functional properties and call for a better understanding of the covariations between plant functional properties in terrestrial ecosystems.

MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; hydrodynamics; planets and satellites: formation; planet-disc interactions; protoplanetary discs; stars: individual: MWC 758 (HD 36112)	ROSSBY-WAVE INSTABILITY; LOPSIDED TRANSITION DISCS; THIN ACCRETION DISKS; HYDRODYNAMICAL SIMULATIONS; VORTEX; GAS; PARTICLES; STABILITY	Resolved ALMA and VLA observations indicate the existence of two dust traps in the protoplanetary disc MWC 758. By means of two-dimensional gas+dust hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with three-dimensional dust radiative transfer calculations, we show that the spirals in scattered light, the eccentric, asymmetric ring and the crescent-shaped structure in the (sub) millimetre can all be caused by two giant planets: a 1.5-Jupiter mass planet at 35 au (inside the spirals) and a 5-Jupiter mass planet at 140 au (outside the spirals). The outer planet forms a dust-trapping vortex at the inner edge of its gap (at similar to 85 au), and the continuum emission of this dust trap reproduces the ALMA and VLA observations well. The outer planet triggers several spiral arms that are similar to those observed in polarized scattered light. The inner planet also forms a vortex at the outer edge of its gap (at similar to 50 au), but it decays faster than the vortex induced by the outer planet, as a result of the disc's turbulent viscosity. The vortex decay can explain the eccentric inner ring seen with ALMA as well as the low signal and larger azimuthal spread of this dust trap in VLA observations. Finding the thermal and kinematic signatures of both giant planets could verify the proposed scenario.

J	Castillo-Rogez, J; Vernazza, P; Walsh, K				Castillo-Rogez, Julie; Vernazza, Pierre; Walsh, Kevin			Geophysical evidence that Saturn's Moon Phoebe originated from a C-type asteroid reservoir	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Kuiper belt: general; minor planets, asteroids: general; planets and satellites: interiors	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; TROJAN ASTEROIDS; PARENT BODIES; BELT; SATELLITES; DENSITY; EVOLUTION; WATER; SHAPE	Saturn's Moon Phoebe has been suggested to originate from the Kuiper Belt. However, its density is twice that of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) in the same size class, which challenges that relationship. Since the internal evolution of mid-sized planetesimals (100-300 km in diameter) is primarily driven by the amount of accreted short-lived radioisotopes, it is possible to constrain the relative times of formation of these bodies based on their bulk porosity content, hence their densities. From modelling the thermal evolution of KBOs, we infer a difference in formation timing between these bodies and Phoebe. This confirms prior suggestions for a delayed accretion timeframe with increasing distance from the Sun. This geophysical finding combined with spectral observations suggests Phoebe formed in the same region as C-type asteroids and support recent dynamical models for a C-type body reservoir between the orbits of the giant planets. On the other hand, the similarly low densities of mid-sized D-type asteroids, Trojan asteroids, and KBOs add to the growing evidence that these objects shared a common reservoir near or beyond the orbit of Neptune and were heat starved overall.

DES Collaboration	First cosmological results using Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey: measurement of the Hubble constant	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmological parameters; cosmology: observations; distance scale	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; REDSHIFT; GALAXIES; PROJECT; PHOTOMETRY; SAMPLE; LIGHT; H-0	We present an improved measurement of the Hubble constant (H-0) using the 'inverse distance ladder' method, which adds the information from 207 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) at redshift 0.018 < z < 0.85 to existing distance measurements of 122 low-redshift (z < 0.07) SNe Ia (Low-z) and measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Whereas traditional measurements of H-0 with SNe Ia use a distance ladder of parallax and Cepheid variable stars, the inverse distance ladder relies on absolute distance measurements from the BAOs to calibrate the intrinsic magnitude of the SNe Ia. We find H-0 = 67.8 +/- 1.3 km s(-1) Mpc(-1) (statistical and systematic uncertainties, 68 per cent confidence). Our measurement makes minimal assumptions about the underlying cosmological model, and our analysis was blinded to reduce confirmation bias. We examine possible systematic uncertainties and all are below the statistical uncertainties. Our H-0 value is consistent with estimates derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background assuming a Lambda CDM universe.	[Macaulay, E.; Nichol, R.

However, the present radial mass distribution across the rings is not well understood. The most prominent structure, visible from Earth, is the Cassini Division, a 4500 km-wide gap that separates the massive inner B ring and the outer A ring. Though early models of the formation of the Cassini Division suggested that the resonant interaction of ring particles with the external satellite Mimas (Lindblad resonance 2: 1) could open a significant gap (slightly narrower than the observed Cassini Division) in 5 billion years, we investigate here an alternative scenario involvingmuch shorter time-scales based on the newconstraints on the age of the rings. In this article, we present a numerical model of satellite-ring interactions that can explain the formation of the Cassini Division by the orbital migration of Mimas and the different densities of the current A and B rings. Such a scenario implies that the Cassini Division could have opened in the last 4-11 million years and that it might disappear in the next 40 million years from now.

Possible histories of Mimas and Enceladus	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; celestial mechanics; planets and satellites: individual: Saturn	ICY SATELLITES; SOUTH-POLE; EVOLUTION; TETHYS; CONSTRAINTS; LIBRATIONS; DYNAMICS; INTERIOR; ATLASES; ORBITS	This study is a companion paper to Baillie et al., in which we showed that a past episode of inward migration of Mimas could have created the Cassini Division. We here investigate the possible causes of this inward migration. We suggest two scenarios: one based on a past intense heating of Mimas, and another one on a past intense heating of Enceladus, which would have itself driven an inward migration of Mimas due to a mean-motion resonance. These two scenarios are challenged with numerical modelling of the orbital motion of the satellites, and energy budget, which are confronted to our present knowledge of the interior of Mimas and Enceladus. We show that a past hot Mimas requires an eccentricity of 0.22, while a past hot Enceladus would have needed an eccentricity of 0.25. While the scenario of a past hot Mimas preserves the stability of the mid-sized satellites of Saturn, it threatens Janus and Epimetheus and is inconsistent with the observations of impact basins at the surface of Mimas. However, a past hot Enceladus which would have almost fully melted could be consistent with its differentiated interior, but would probably not have preserved the stability of Tethys, given the high eccentricity required. Both of these scenarios would have challenged the stability of Aegaeon, Methone, Pallene, and Anthe, and implied that the Cassini Division would be younger than 10 Myr.

DES Collaboration	First cosmology results using Type IA supernovae from the dark energy survey: effects of chromatic corrections to supernova photometry on measurements of cosmological parameters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: photometric; supernovae: general; dark energy; cosmology: observations	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; LIGHT CURVES; DISCOVERIES; CONSTRAINTS; SYSTEM	Calibration uncertainties have been the leading systematic uncertainty in recent analyses using Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure cosmological parameters. To improve the calibration, we present the application of spectral energy distribution-dependent 'chromatic corrections' to the SN light-curve photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). These corrections depend on the combined atmospheric and instrumental transmission function for each exposure, and they affect photometry at the 0.01mag (1 per cent) level, comparable to systematic uncertainties in calibration and photometry. Fitting our combined DES and low-z SN Ia sample with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors for the cosmological parameters Omega(m) (the fraction of the critical density of the universe comprised of matter) and w (the dark energy equation of state parameter), we compare those parameters before and after applying the corrections. We find the change in w and Omega(m) due to not including chromatic corrections is -0.002 and 0.000, respectively, for the DES-SN3YR sample with BAO and CMB priors, consistent with a larger DES-SN3YR-like simulation, which has a w-change of 0.0005 with an uncertainty of 0.008 and an Omega(m) change of 0.000 with an uncertainty of 0.002. However, when considering samples on individual CCDs we find large redshift-dependent biases (similar to 0.02 in distance modulus) for SN distances.

Enhanced North American carbon uptake associated with El Nino	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CO2; DIOXIDE; EXCHANGE; CYCLE; PRECIPITATION; SENSITIVITY; SURFACE; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; INVERSIONS	Long-term atmospheric CO2 mole fraction and delta(CO2)-C-13 observations over North America document persistent responses to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. We estimate these responses corresponded to 0.61 (0.45 to 0.79) PgC year(-1) more North American carbon uptake during El Nino than during La Nina between 2007 and 2015, partially offsetting increases of net tropical biosphere-to-atmosphere carbon flux around El Nino. Anomalies in derived North American net ecosystem exchange (NEE) display strong but opposite correlations with surface air temperature between seasons, while their correlation with water availability was more constant throughout the year, such that water availability is the dominant control on annual NEE variability over North America. These results suggest that increased water availability and favorable temperature conditions (warmer spring and cooler summer) caused enhanced carbon uptake over North America near and during El Nino.

Sodium chloride on the surface of Europa	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SULFURIC-ACID; GALILEAN SATELLITES; COLOR-CENTERS; SALTS; OCEAN; SUBSURFACE; HYDRATE; SPECTRA	The potential habitability of Europa's subsurface ocean depends on its chemical composition, which may be reflected in that of Europa's geologically young surface. Investigations using Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer data led to the prevailing view that Europa's endogenous units are rich in sulfate salts. However, recent ground-based infrared observations have suggested that, while regions experiencing sulfur radiolysis may contain sulfate salts, Europa's more pristine endogenous material may reflect a chloride-dominated composition. Chlorides have no identifying irradiation, like that experienced on the surface of Europa. Using spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we present the detection of a 450-nm absorption indicative of irradiated sodium chloride on the surface. The feature correlates with geologically disrupted chaos terrain, suggesting an interior source. The presence of endogenous sodium chloride on the surface of Europa has important implications for our understanding of its subsurface chemistry.

Design of a Two-Wheeled Rover With Sprawl Ability and Metal Brush Traction	JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							ADHESION	PUFFER ("pop-up flat-folding explorer robot") is an expendable, two-wheeled NASA/JPL rover that is meant to explore the less-accessible regions of Mars. This paper presents the UC Berkeley prototype of PUFFER that was used to inform the mechanical design of the folding chassis for the ensuing NASA/JPL version. PUFFER is so named because it can fold itself to fit into tight spaces; its chassis consists of a 3-D linkage that can vary the sprawl angle of its wheels. This ability to sprawl, besides letting multiple PUFFERs fit into a parent rover, improves PUFFER's slope-climbing ability by allowing it to lower its center of mass. To further improve slope climbing, each wheel is fitted out with nitinol brushes that serve to enhance ground traction. Together, these two features allow the Berkeley prototype of PUFFER to climb 47 deg rock inclines that have a surface roughness of about half its folded height. Other qualities of PUFFER are that it has a collapsible tail, is able to flip itself over, and requires only three actuators.

To precisely estimate the vertical and longitudinal displacements, we used the InSAR time-series technique with multi-track stacks of Sentinel-1 SAR dataset and a single-track stack of COSMO-SkyMed SAR data over two extradosed bridge cases; Kimdaejung and Muyoung bridges between 2013 and 2017. The vertical and longitudinal displacements are estimated using multi-track Sentinel-1 SAR data and orientation angle of bridges, and we converted the displacements into thermal dilation and long-term vertical deflection. From COSMO-SkyMed data, we calculated the horizontal thermal dilation and long-term vertical deflection assuming that they dominantly contribute to the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively. This assumption appeared reasonable based on the comparison with calculations from Sentinel-1 data. The deflection patterns exhibit downward movements at the mid-spans between towers. The results reveal that both bridges have been suffering long-term deflection over the observation period. Thus, this study verifies the potential to monitor the long-term deflection and implies that the bridges need to be monitored periodically.

The freeze-thaw (FT) retrieval from satellite microwave remote sensing detects landscape changes between frozen and non-frozen conditions due to the strong dependence of surface microwave emissions on liquid water abundance. We conducted an assessment of the latest version (R16) of the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 3 FT (L3_FT) global product. The L3_FT product provides a global FT classification with 3-day mean temporal fidelity derived using SMAP L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave brightness temperature (Tb) retrievals. The R16 product uses both normalized polarization ratio (NPR) and single channel vertically-polarized Tb (FT-SCV) algorithms to obtain FT retrievals over land areas where frozen temperatures are a significant ecological constraint. The L3_FT product is generated in a standard global grid with similar grid cell resolution (36-km) as the SMAP radiometer footprint. An enhanced 9-km global grid L3_FT product is also produced from optimally interpolated SMAP Tb retrievals. The resulting L3_FT products span a larger domain and longer period (2015-present) than earlier product releases. The L3_FT 36-km results showed a respective global mean annual FT classification accuracy of approximately 78 and 90 percent for descending (AM) and ascending (PM) orbit observations in relation to independent surface air temperature-based FT estimates from 5000 global weather stations. The FT accuracy was lower in areas with greater terrain complexity, open water and vegetation cover; where the combined land cover factors explained 29-53% of the variability in the SMAP FT global accuracy. The L3_FT 9-km product showed an apparent enhancement of FT spatial patterns, but with 4% lower accuracy than the 36-km product; the lower 9-km accuracy was attributed to stronger degradation from land cover heterogeneity, particularly in coastal areas, and artifact noise introduced from the spatial interpolation of SMAP Tb retrievals. Selected regional applications indicated product utility in capturing anomalous frost events over Australia and seasonal thaw and spring onset patterns over Alaska. Overall, the L3_FT global accuracy meets or exceeds the FT product science requirements established by the mission, while enabling studies of dynamic FT and water mobility constraints influencing hydrological and ecosystem processes, and global water-carbon-energy cycle linkages.

This paper presents a technique for decomposing the sea surface height (SSH) field of the multimodal multidirectional internal tide. The technique consists of two steps: first, different baroclinic modes are decomposed by two-dimensional (2D) spatial filtering, utilizing their different horizontal wavelengths; second, multidirectional waves in each mode are decomposed by 2D plane wave analysis. The decomposition technique is demonstrated using the M-2 internal tide field simulated by the MITgcm. This paper focuses on a region lying off the U.S. West Coast ranging 20 degrees-50 degrees N, 220 degrees-245 degrees E. The lowest three baroclinic modes are separately resolved from the internal tide field; each mode is further decomposed into five waves of arbitrary propagation directions in the horizontal. The decomposed fields yield unprecedented details on the internal tide's generation and propagation, which cannot be observed in the harmonically fitted field. The results reveal that the mode-1 M-2 internal tide in the study region is dominantly from the Hawaiian Ridge to the west but also generated locally at the Mendocino Ridge and continental slope. The mode-2 and mode-3 M-2 internal tides are generated at isolated seamounts, as well as at the Mendocino Ridge and continental slope. The Mendocino Ridge radiates both southbound and northbound M-2 internal tides for all three modes. Their propagation distances decrease with increasing mode number: mode-1 waves can travel over 2000 km, while mode-3 waves can only be tracked for 300 km. The decomposition technique may be extended to other tidal constituents and to the global ocean.

The results indicate that the distribution of SSS variance is highly inhomogeneous in both space and time. The seasonal signal is largest in the core of the Eastern Pacific Fresh Pool and in the Gulf of Panama. The interannual signal is highest in a relatively narrow zonal band along approximately 5 degrees N, while the intraseasonal signal appears to be a dominant mode of variability in the zonally stretched near-equatorial region. Located right in the middle of a hotspot of high SSS variance, the SPURS-2 site appears to be at the crossroads of many different processes that shape the distribution of SSS in the eastern tropical Pacific and beyond.

Multiscale Simulation, Data Assimilation, and Forecasting in Support of the SPURS-2 Field Campaign	OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; SALINITY PROCESSES; SURFACE	A multiscale simulation, data assimilation, forecasting system was developed in support of the SPURS-2 (Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study 2) field campaign. Before the field campaign, a multiyear simulation was produced for characterizing variabilities in upper-ocean salinity, eddy activity, and other parameters and for illustrating major processes that control the region's upper-ocean salinity at different spatial and temporal scales. This simulation assisted in formulating sampling plans. During the field experiment, the system integrated SPURS-2 measurements with those from routine operational observing networks, including Argo floats and satellite surface temperatures, salinities, and heights, and provided real-time skillful daily forecasts of ocean conditions. Forecast reports were prepared to summarize oceanic conditions and multiscale features and were delivered to the SPURS-2 chief scientist and other SPURS-2 investigators through the SPURS-2 Information System. After the field experiment, the data assimilation system was used to produce a reanalysis product to help quantify contributions of different processes to salinity variability in the region.

Jeffrey			The Thermoelectric Properties of Bismuth Telluride	ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						bismuth telluride; electronic structures; thermoelectrics; transport modeling	QUALITY SINGLE-CRYSTALS; HAAS-VAN-ALPHEN; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; DE-HAAS; TOPOLOGICAL-INSULATOR; BAND-STRUCTURE; VALENCE-BAND; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES	Bismuth telluride is the working material for most Peltier cooling devices and thermoelectric generators. This is because Bi2Te3 (or more precisely its alloys with Sb2Te3 for p-type and Bi2Se3 for n-type material) has the highest thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, of any material around room temperature. Since thermoelectric technology will be greatly enhanced by improving Bi2Te3 or finding a superior material, this review aims to identify and quantify the key material properties that make Bi2Te3 such a good thermoelectric. The large zT can be traced to the high band degeneracy, low effective mass, high carrier mobility, and relatively low lattice thermal conductivity, which all contribute to its remarkably high thermoelectric quality factor. Using literature data augmented with newer results, these material parameters are quantified, giving clear insight into the tailoring of the electronic band structure of Bi2Te3 by alloying, or reducing thermal conductivity by nanostructuring. For example, this analysis clearly shows that the minority carrier excitation across the small bandgap significantly limits the thermoelectric performance of Bi2Te3, even at room temperature, showing that larger bandgap alloys are needed for higher temperature operation. Such effective material parameters can also be used for benchmarking future improvements in Bi2Te3 or new replacement materials.	[Witting, Ian T.; Chasapis, Thomas C.; Peters, Matthew; Snyder, G.

The cryosphere of other planetary bodies may therefore also serve as an accessible location to search for signs of life. The Wireline Analysis Tool for the Subsurface Observation of Northern ice sheets (WATSON) is a compact deep-UV fluorescence spectrometer for nondestructive ice borehole analysis and spatial mapping of organics and microbes, intended to address the heterogeneity and low bulk densities of organics and microbial cells in ice. WATSON can be either operated standalone or integrated into a wireline drilling system. We present an overview of the WATSON instrument and results from laboratory experiments intended to determine (i) the sensitivity of WATSON to organic material in a water ice matrix and (ii) the ability to detect organic material under various thicknesses of ice. The results of these experiments show that in bubbled ice the instrument has a depth of penetration of 10 mm and a detection limit of fewer than 300 cells. WATSON incorporates a scanning system that can map the distribution of organics and microbes over a 75 by 25 mm area. WATSON demonstrates a sensitive fluorescence mapping technique for organic and microbial detection in icy environments including terrestrial glaciers and ice sheets, and planetary surfaces including Europa, Enceladus, or the martian polar caps.

Aerobic respiration is essential for the development of complex multicellular life; thus the presence of abundant O-2 is an important metric for planetary habitability. O-2 on Earth is supplied by oxygenic photosynthesis, but it is becoming more widely understood that abiotic processes may supply meaningful amounts of O-2 on other worlds. The modern atmosphere and rock record of Mars suggest a history of relatively high O-2 as a result of photochemical processes, potentially overlapping with the range of O-2 concentrations used by biology. Europa may have accumulated high O-2 concentrations in its subsurface ocean due to the radiolysis of water ice at its surface. Recent modeling efforts suggest that coexisting water and O-2 may be common on exoplanets, with confirmation from measurements of exoplanet atmospheres potentially coming soon. In all these cases, O-2 accumulates through abiotic processes-independent of water-oxidizing photosynthesis. We hypothesize that abiogenic O-2 may enhance the habitability of some planetary environments, allowing highly energetic aerobic respiration and potentially even the development of complex multicellular life which depends on it, without the need to first evolve oxygenic photosynthesis. This hypothesis is testable with further exploration and life-detection efforts on O-2-rich worlds such as Mars and Europa, and comparison to O-2-poor worlds such as Enceladus. This hypothesis further suggests a new dimension to planetary habitability: "Follow the Oxygen," in which environments with opportunities for energy-rich metabolisms such as aerobic respiration are preferentially targeted for investigation and life detection.

In recent work we have shown that while increasing temperature from 15 K to 40 K we observe a 14 meV blue shift of the photoluminescence peak energy and a decrease in minority carrier lifetime. We have hypothesized this effect is due to carrier localization caused by macro-scale fluctuations in layer thickness or alloy composition. Here we study the spatial variation of this effect over the surface of a sample, demonstrating significant variation with position. We discuss implications of this for the carrier localization hypothesis.

Four statistics are calculated from CloudSat rainfall rate estimates within each 4 km x 6 km T-b pixel sampled by both sensors: the probability of rainfall, the mean rain rate, the mean rate when raining, and the maximum rain rate. Observations with overlying cold clouds are removed from the analysis. To account for confounding variables that modify T-b, curves are fit to the mean relationships between T-b and these four statistics within bins of constant column-integrated water vapor from AMSR-E, and sea surface temperature and wind speed from reanalysis grids. The coefficients that define these curves are then applied to all available AMSR-E T-b retrievals to estimate rain rate throughout the eastern subtropical oceans. A preliminary analysis shows strong agreement between AMSR-E rain rates and the CloudSat training dataset. Comparison with an existing microwave precipitation product shows that the new statistical product has an improved sensitivity to light rain. A climatology for the year 2007 shows that precipitation rates tend to be heavier where the sea surface is warmer and that rain is most frequent where stratocumulus transitions to trade cumulus in the subtropics.

A recent field campaign has shown that this flow is hydraulically controlled and that it experiences hydraulic jumps accompanied by strong mixing and dissipation concentrated near several deep sills. By our estimates, the diapycnal density flux associated with this mixing is considerably larger than the diapycnal flux across a typical isopycnal surface extending over the abyssal North Pacific. According to historical hydrographic observations, a second source of abyssal water for the North Pacific is 2.3-2.8 Sv of the dense flow that is diverted around the Manihiki Plateau to the east, bypassing the Samoan Passage. This bypass flow is not confined to a channel and is therefore less likely to experience the strong mixing that is associated with hydraulic transitions. The partitioning of flux between the two branches of the deep flow could therefore be relevant to the distribution of Pacific abyssal mixing. To gain insight into the factors that control the partitioning between these two branches, we develop an abyssal and equator-proximal extension of the "island rule." Novel features include provisions for the presence of hydraulic jumps as well as identification of an appropriate integration circuit for an abyssal layer to the east of the island. Evaluation of the corresponding circulation integral leads to a prediction of 0.4-2.4 Sv of bypass flow. The circulation integral clearly identifies dissipation and frictional drag effects within the Samoan Passage as crucial elements in partitioning the flow.

The NRM operates both in spectroscopic (integral field spectrograph, henceforth IFS) and polarimetric configurations. NRM observations were taken between 2013 and 2016 to characterize its performance. Most observations were taken in spectroscopic mode, with the goal of obtaining precise astrometry and spectroscopy of faint companions to bright stars. We find a clear correlation between residual wavefront error measured by the adaptive optic system and the contrast sensitivity by comparing phase errors in observations of the same source, taken on different dates. We find a typical 5 sigma contrast sensitivity of (2-3) x 10(-3) at similar to lambda/D. We explore the accuracy of spectral extraction of secondary components of binary systems by recovering the signal from a simulated source injected into several data sets. We outline data reduction procedures unique to GPI's IFS and describe a newly public data pipeline used for the presented analyses. We demonstrate recovery of astrometry and spectroscopy of two known companions to HR 2690 and HD 142527. NRM+polarimetry observations achieve differential visibility precision of sigma similar to 0.4% in the best case. We discuss its limitations on Gemini-S/GPI for resolving inner regions of protoplanetary disks and prospects for future upgrades. We summarize lessons learned in observing with NRM in spectroscopic and polarimetric modes.

This accuracy can be met by using spectroscopic subsamples to calibrate the photometric redshifts for the full sample. In this work, we find the minimal number of spectra required for the WFIRST weak-lensing redshift calibration by employing the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) spectroscopic sampling technique. We use galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to build the LSST+WFIRST lensing analog sample of similar to 36,000 objects and to train the LSST+WFIRST SOM. We find that 26% of the WFIRST lensing sample consists of sources fainter than the Euclid depth in the optical, 91% of which live in color cells already occupied by brighter galaxies. We demonstrate the similarity between faint and bright galaxies as well as the feasibility of redshift measurements at different brightness levels. Our results suggest that the spectroscopic sample acquired for calibration to the Euclid depth is sufficient for calibrating the majority of the WFIRST color space. For the spectroscopic sample to fully represent the synthetic color space of WFIRST, we recommend obtaining additional spectroscopy of similar to 0.2-1.2k new sources in cells occupied by mostly faint galaxies. We argue that either the small area of the CANDELS fields and the small overall sample size or the large photometric errors might be the reason for no/fewer bright galaxies mapped to these cells. Acquiring the spectra of these sources will confirm the above findings and will enable the comprehensive calibration of the WFIRST color-redshift relation.

Uniform Clouds	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; opacity; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; polarization; radiative transfer; scattering	LOW-MASS STARS; SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION; ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE; CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIUM; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; LINEAR-POLARIZATION; SKY SURVEY; T-DWARFS; RETRIEVAL; ROTATION	Scattering processes in the atmosphere of a fast-rotating brown dwarf (BD) or self-luminous extrasolar giant planet (EGP) produce distinct polarimetric, in addition to spectrometric, signatures. An ability to unambiguously interpret these signals would improve our understanding of their atmospheric evolution, structure, and dynamics. To this end, we have incorporated molecular opacities to define the wavelength-dependent vertical structure of the atmosphere as a function of the internal energy, surface gravity, and metallicity of the BD. This allows us to use our recently developed semianalytic conics-based radiative transfer framework to generate realistic spectropolarimetric simulations. We have examined the simulated effects of the internal energy and surface gravity of BDs and of the grain size and atmospheric depth of clouds on polarized spectra in the J, H, and K near-infrared bands. We find that T-dwarf spectra can be fit more easily using cloudless atmospheres or high clouds, while fitting L-dwarf spectra requires an assumption of deep clouds. Polarimetry contains a wealth of information orthogonal to what can be obtained from photometry alone. However, under current limits of instrument sensitivity, the greatest benefits of polarimetry will apply to high clouds bearing small grains. Future work will examine the effect of gravitational darkening and disequilibrium chemistry on the spectropolarimetry of these BDs.

A First Search for Prompt Radio Emission from a Gravitational-wave Event	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitational waves; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; stars: black holes	STAR MERGER GW170817; FLUX-DENSITY SCALE; GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; REIONIZATION HISTORY; COUNTERPART; PRECURSORS	Multimessenger observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 have enabled the discovery of a diverse array of electromagnetic counterparts to compact binary mergers, including an unambiguous kilonova, a short gamma-ray burst, and a late-time radio jet. Beyond these counterparts, compact binary mergers are additionally predicted to be accompanied by prompt low-frequency radio emission. The successful observation of a prompt radio counterpart would be immensely valuable, but is made difficult by the short delay between the gravitational-wave and prompt electromagnetic signals, as well as by the poor localization of gravitational-wave sources. Here, we present the first search for prompt radio emission accompanying a gravitational-wave event, targeting the binary black hole merger GW170104 detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo during their second (O2) observing run. Using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array, we search a similar to 900 deg(2) region for transient radio emission within approximately one hour of GW170104, obtaining an upper limit of 2.5 x 10(41) erg s(-1) on its equivalent isotropic luminosity between 27 and 84 MHz. We additionally discuss plans to target binary neutron star mergers in Advanced LIGO and Virgo's upcoming O3 observing run.

General circulation models demonstrate that regional evaporation and precipitation rates of methane are likely to change with the seasons (Titan's year is 29.5 Earth years) and evolve on a geological timescale (similar to 10(5) Earth years)(2-4). Cassini observations suggest shoreline recession at a few south polar lakes during local summer(5), but similar seasonal changes have yet to be observed at the north pole where lakes are larger and more numerous(6,7). We present three 'phantom lakes' that appear to be north polar surface liquids in winter observations by Cassini RADAR but that are inconsistent with lakes in infrared images obtained up to seven years later, after vernal equinox, suggesting that the liquids were removed in between. If this were the case, the phantom lakes could be interpreted as shallow ponds, with either a pure methane composition or a regolith porous enough to remove the less volatile ethane. These phantom lakes provide observational constraints on removal timescales for surface liquids at Titan's north pole. The location, size and longevity of surface liquid reservoirs affect sediment processing(7), seasonal weather(8), climate evolution(9), and even, perhaps, their habitability(10). As solubility of the possible non-polar mixtures is generally low, short-lived lakes might be nutrient-poor(10) and thus have low astrobiological potential.

A Hard Look at NGC 5347: Revealing a Nearby Compton-thick AGN	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (NGC 5347); galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; DATA RELEASE; RAY; EMISSION; CLASSIFICATION; RESOLUTION; STELLAR; MODEL	Current measurements show that the observed fraction of Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGN) is smaller than the expected values needed to explain the cosmic X-ray background. Prior fits to the X-ray spectrum of the nearby Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC 5347 (z = 0.00792, D = 35.5 Mpc ) have alternately suggested a CT and Compton-thin source. Combining archival data from Suzaku, Chandra, and-most importantly-new data from NuSTAR, and using three distinct families of models, we show that NGC 5347 is an obscured CTAGN (N-H > 2.23 x 10(24) CM-2). Its 2-30 keV spectrum is dominated by reprocessed emission from distant material, characterized by a strong Fe K alpha line and a Compton hump. We found a large equivalent width of the Fe K alpha line (EW = 2.3 +/- 0.3 keV) and a high intrinsic-to-observed flux ratio (similar to 100). All of these observations are typical for bona fide CTAGN. We estimate a bolometric luminosity of L-bol similar or equal to 0.014 +/- 0.005 L-Edd. The Chandra image of NGC 5347 reveals the presence of extended emission dominating the soft X-ray spectrum (E < 2 keV), which coincides with the [O III] emission detected in Hubble Space Telescope images. Comparison to other CTAGN suggests that NGC 5347 is broadly consistent with the average properties of this source class. We simulated XRISM and Athena/X-IFU spectra of the source, showing the potential of these future missions in identifying CTAGN in the soft X-rays.	[Kammoun, E. S.; Miller, J.

Using a series of observations covering eight days we find that its decreasing X-ray flux is well described by either a blackbody plus power law or a two-blackbody spectral model. The 2-10 keV flux of the source varied from (1.206 +/- 0.007) x 10(-10) to (1.125 +/- 0.004) x 10(-10) erg s(-1) cm(-2), a decrease of about 7% within our observations and 44% from that measured 7-14 days after the outburst with NuSTAR. We confirm that the pulsed fraction and spin pulse phase of the neutron star are energy dependent up to at least 8 keV.

Estimates of the Precipitation Top Heights in Convective Systems Using Microwave Radiances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Convective systems; estimation; maximum precipitation height; orbital radiometers		The absence of systematic estimates of vertical transport of water by convective storms is one of the main causes of uncertainties in weather forecasting in the tropics, in severe weather forecasting, and in the climate-scale analysis and prediction of global circulation. The difficulty of providing such estimates lies in that the only instruments capable of providing such estimates at present, radiometers onboard satellites, operate at short wavelengths, and that makes difficult the retrievals. This paper describes a method capable of providing robust estimates of the maximum height of precipitation and the 3-D structure of condensed water in convective systems using a constellation of radiometers. Using hurricane Winston and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Core Observatory satellite dual precipitation radar as a reference, it is shown that the method is suitable to improve the parameterization of convection in numerical models.

Development of an On-Board Wide-Band Processor for Radio Frequency Interference Detection and Filtering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Interference; kurtosis; microwave radiometry; RFI	RADIOFREQUENCY INTERFERENCE; DETECTION ALGORITHM; RFI DETECTION; MICROWAVE; MITIGATION; PERFORMANCE; KURTOSIS; LAND	The demand for microwave spectrum for commercial and industrial use has been increasing rapidly over the last decade, putting stress on the limited spectral resources for passive microwave remote sensing. Radio frequency interference from man-made sources is expected to become worse over the coming years. At 1.4 GHz, the SMAP mission has implemented and demonstrated advanced interference detection algorithms for its microwave radiometer. This scheme will not be feasible at higher microwave frequencies (above 6 GHz) due to much larger radiometer bandwidths used and the limited downlink data volume available to implement RFI filtering algorithms in the ground processing. In this paper, we present the design, development, and test of an advanced on-board interference detection and RFI filtering digital back-end that is capable of operation for a 1 GHz-radiometer bandwidth. We describe the combined RFI detection algorithms implemented in the digital backend's firmware and the on-board RFI filtering of interference-corrupted data that will be necessary to limit downlink rate requirements for future high-frequency microwave missions.

J	Ilisei, AM; Khodadadzadeh, M; Ferro, A; Bruzzone, L				Ilisei, Ana-Maria; Khodadadzadeh, Mahdi; Ferro, Adamo; Bruzzone, Lorenzo			An Automatic Method for Subglacial Lake Detection in Ice Sheet Radar Sounder Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Automatic detection; ice sheet; radar sounder (RS); remote sensing; subglacial lakes (SLs)	THWAITES GLACIER; ATTENUATION; ANTARCTICA; BENEATH; BED; IDENTIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; CATCHMENT; INVENTORY; THICKNESS	During the past decades, radar sounder (RS) instruments have been effectively used to detect subglacial lakes (SLs). SLs appear as flat, smooth, and bright reflectors in RS radargrams. The visual interpretation has been the main approach to SL detection in radargrams. However, this approach is subjective and inappropriate for processing large amounts of radargrams. While the analysis of RS data for understanding the subglacial hydrology has recently received increased attention, the literature on the development of automatic methods specifically designed for SL detection is still limited. In order to fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel automatic technique for SL detection. The technique is made up of two steps: 1) feature extraction and 2) automatic detection. In the first step, we define and extract three families of features for discriminating between the lake and nonlake radar reflections. The features model locally the basal topography, the shape of the basal reflected waveforms, and the statistical properties of the basal signal. In the second step, we provide the features as input to a support vector machine classifier to perform the automatic SL detection. The proposed technique has been applied to radargrams acquired over two large regions in East Antarctica and Siple Coast. The obtained results, which are validated both quantitatively and qualitatively, confirm the robustness of the features and their capabilities to effectively characterize SLs. Moreover, they prove the potentiality of the method to process large amounts of radargrams and update the current SL inventory.

Soils are heterogeneous mixtures of minerals, air, water, and organic matter leading to complex manifestations of reflectance in the different parts of the visible-shortwave infrared spectra. Due to this complexity, data-driven modeling approaches are found to be most suitable for characterizing the relationships between soil spectra and the corresponding soil properties. Proposed spaceborne hyperspectral missions, such as Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, offer the possibility of repeating global spectral measurements in a 16- to 20-day revisit period. Soil attributes on the landscape vary at different rates. In particular, the soil textural attributes (percentage of sand, silt, and clay) may be assumed to remain invariant compared to chemical constituents during multiple consecutive 16-to 20-day satellite revisit period. We present a theoretical retrieval framework for assimilating repeat spaceborne soil spectral measurements into a previously developed lasso algorithm-based ensemble modeling framework for the global-scale characterization of soil textural attributes. The repeat spectral assimilation with each overpass of the satellite leads to the development of an enriched "dynamic soil spectral library" which spatially propagates the improvement in the characterization of soil textural properties globally, given the uncertain variations in other auxiliary factors, such as moisture and organic matter, affecting soil reflectance.

Using data from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey, we identify regions of high density and near-constant, almost-thermal velocity dispersion. We reveal 18 coherent structures are revealed, 12 in L1688 and 6 in B18, each of which shows a sharp "transition to coherence" in velocity dispersion around its periphery. The identification of these structures provides a chance to statistically study the coherent structures in molecular clouds. The identified coherent structures have a typical radius of 0.04 pc and a typical mass of 0.4 M-circle dot, generally smaller than previously known coherent cores identified by Goodman et al., Caselli et al., and Pineda et al. We call these structures "droplets." We find that, unlike previously known coherent cores, these structures are not virially bound by self-gravity and are instead predominantly confined by ambient pressure. The droplets have density profiles shallower than a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and they have a velocity (V-LSR) distribution consistent with the dense gas motions traced by NH3 emission. These results point to a potential formation mechanism through pressure compression and turbulent processes in the dense gas. We present a comparison with a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a star-forming region, and we speculate on the relationship of droplets with larger, gravitationally bound coherent cores, as well as on the role that droplets and other coherent structures play in the star formation process.

The traditional approach of galaxy redshift surveys is based on individual galaxy detection, typically performed by thresholding and digitizing large-scale intensity maps. By contrast, intensity mapping uses the integrated emission from all sources in a 3D pixel (or voxel) as an analog tracer of large-scale structure. In this work, we develop a formalism to quantify the performance of both approaches when measuring large-scale structures. We compute the Fisher information of an arbitrary observable, derive the optimal estimator, and study its performance as a function of source luminosity function, survey resolution, instrument sensitivity, and other survey parameters. We identify regimes where each approach is advantageous and discuss optimal strategies for different scenarios. To determine the best strategy for any given survey, we develop a metric that is easy to compute from the source luminosity function and the survey sensitivity, and we demonstrate the application with several planned intensity mapping surveys.

We find a trend of decreasing polarization fraction as a function of total intensity, which we link to depolarization effects toward higher-density regions of the cloud. We then use the polarization data at 850 mu m to infer the planeof-sky orientation of the large-scale magnetic field in Barnard 1. This magnetic field runs north-south across most of the cloud, with the exception of B 1-c, where it turns more east-west. From the dispersion of polarization angles, we calculate a turbulence correlation length of 5.0 +/- 2.'' 5 (1500 au) and a turbulent-to-total magnetic energy ratio of 0.5 +/- 0.3 inside the cloud. We combine this turbulent-to-total magnetic energy ratio with observations of NH 3 molecular lines from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey to estimate the strength of the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field through the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. With a plane-of-sky amplitude of 120 +/- 60 mu G and a criticality criterion lambda(c) = 3.0 +/- 1.5, we find that Barnard 1 is a supercritical molecular cloud with a magnetic field nearly dominated by its turbulent component.

Here we present 3171 new spectroscopic redshifts obtained in the 2016B and 2017A semesters with a combination of DEIMOS, LRIS, and MOSFIRE on the Keck telescopes.(13) The observations come from all of the Keck partners: Caltech, NASA, the University of Hawaii, and the University of California. Combined with the 1283 redshifts published in DR1, the C3R2 survey has now obtained and published 4454 high-quality galaxy redshifts. We discuss updates to the survey design and provide a catalog of photometric and spectroscopic data. Initial tests of the calibration method performance are given, indicating that the sample, once completed and combined with extensive data collected by other spectroscopic surveys, should allow us to meet the cosmology requirements for Euclid, and make significant headway toward solving the problem for WFIRST. We use the full spectroscopic sample to demonstrate that galaxy brightness is weakly correlated with redshift once a galaxy is localized in the Euclid or WFIRST color space, with potentially important implications for the spectroscopy needed to calibrate redshifts for faint WFIRST and LSST sources.

The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with a temporary broadband seismometer that was recording in the Mojave desert, California, for 86 days in 2014, and by application to the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) catalog, subsets thereof, and a catalog of stable continental regions seismicity. From the largest event observed at Goldstone alone (M-w approximate to 7.9), we estimate the Earth's global moment rate to be 1.03 x 10(22) N . m/yr, whereas an estimation based on the 10 strongest events yields a rate of 5.79 x 10(21) N . m/yr. Summation of 42 yr of Global CMT solutions results in an average of 7.61 x 10(21) N . m/yr. In general, a 2 yr interval of Global CMT solutions is sufficient to estimate the Earth's annual moment rate to within a factor of 5 or better. A series of numerical experiments with more than 560 million synthetic catalogs based on the tapered Gutenberg-Richter distribution shows that the estimation is rather insensitive against an unknown slope of the distribution, and that bias and variance of the estimator depend on the ratio between moment rate and corner moment of the size frequency distribution. Moment rates of published Mars models differ by a factor of 1000 or more. Tests with simulated catalogs show that it will be possible to reject some of these models with data returned by NASA's InSight mission after two years of nominal mission life time.

The transmitter upconverts PAM-4 modulated baseband signals through a free-running 127-GHz oscillator and single-balanced mixer, and it delivers PAM-4 modulated carrier signals to a folded-dipole antenna, which is designed on a FR408HR substrate. The receiver's low-noise amplifier provides a 10-dB gain, and the self-mixer downconverts carrier-modulated PAM-4 signals to base-band signals without the necessity of carrier synchronization. The PAM-4 modulator pre-distorts the baseband signals and corrects the non-linear characteristics of the transmitter's upconversion mixer and the receiver's downconversion self-mixer. Designed and fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the demonstrated system transfers 20 Gb/s of PAM-4 modulated data through a 1-mm air gap and consumes 79.5 mW (transmitter: 50.8 mW and receiver: 28.7 mW) of power under a 1.2-V supply, achieving a 3.98-pJ/bit energy efficiency. The communication distance is extended to 3 cm by inserting a dielectric waveguide between the same transceiver.

J	Slinskey, EA; Loikith, PC; Waliser, DE; Goodman, A				Slinskey, Emily A.; Loikith, Paul C.; Waliser, Duane E.; Goodman, Alexander			An Extreme Precipitation Categorization Scheme and its Observational Uncertainty over the Continental United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Atmosphere; North America; Extreme events; Precipitation; Climatology	ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; WEST-COAST; GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; TROPICAL CYCLONES; ANALYSIS TMPA; CLIMATE; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES; PRODUCTS	An extreme precipitation categorization scheme, used to temporally and spatially visualize and track the multiscale variability of extreme precipitation climatology, is applied over the continental United States. The scheme groups 3-day precipitation totals exceeding 100 mm into one of five precipitation categories, or "P-Cats." To demonstrate the categorization scheme and assess its observational uncertainty across a range of precipitation measurement approaches, we compare the climatology of P-Cats defined using in situ station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D); satellite-derived data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA); gridded station data from the Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM); global reanalysis from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2; and regional reanalysis from the North American Regional Reanalysis. While all datasets capture the principal spatial patterns of P-Cat climatology, results show considerable variability across the suite in frequency, spatial extent, and magnitude. Higher-resolution datasets, PRISM and TMPA, most closely resemble GHCN-D and capture a greater frequency of high-end P-Cats relative to the lower-resolution products. When all datasets are rescaled to a common coarser grid, differences persist with datasets originally constructed at a high resolution maintaining a higher frequency and magnitude of P-Cats. Results imply that dataset choice matters when applying the P-Cat scheme to track extreme precipitation over space and time. Potential future applications of the P-Cat scheme include providing a target for climate model evaluation and a basis for characterizing future change in extreme precipitation as projected by climate model simulations.

Dynamics and Variability of the Spring Dry Season in the United States Southwest as Observed in AmeriFlux and NLDAS-2 Data	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						North America; Climate records; Land surface model; Climate variability; Spring season; Ecosystem effects	NORTH-AMERICAN-MONSOON; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; WILDFIRE; TEMPERATURE; VEGETATION; PACIFIC; OSCILLATION; PATTERNS	The spring dry season occurring in an arid region of the southwestern United States, which receives both winter storm track and summer monsoon precipitation, is investigated. Bimodal precipitation and vegetation growth provide an opportunity to assess multiple climate mechanisms and their impact on hydroclimate and ecosystems. We detect multiple shifts from wet to drier conditions in the observational record and land surface model output. Focusing on the recent dry period, a shift in the late 1990s resulted in earlier and greater spring soil moisture draw down, and later and reduced spring vegetation green-up, compared to a prior wet period (1979-97). A simple soil moisture balance model shows this shift is driven by changes in winter precipitation. The recent post-1999 dry period and an earlier one from 1948 to 1966 are both related to the cool tropics phase of Pacific decadal variability, which influences winter precipitation. In agreement with other studies for the southwestern United States, we find the recent drought cannot be explained in terms of precipitation alone, but also is due to the rising influence of temperature, thus highlighting the sensitivity of this region to warming temperatures. Future changes in the spring dry season will therefore be affected by how tropical decadal variability evolves, and also by emerging trends due to human-driven warming.

NISAR is a collaborative Earth-Science mission between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which features an L-band SAR instrument and an S-band SAR instrument. The simultaneous dual-frequency radar system at peak rates will produce data at gigabit-persecond speeds, which drives the data-volume requirements. The key driving requirement for the Payload Communication Subsystem is to provide a minimum of 35 Terabits per day of radar science data to the ground. NASA's high-rate transmitter on the flight system is a software-defined radio based on the Universal Space Transponder platform, providing an offset quadrature phase shift key modulated waveform with Low-Density Parity Check encoding of the data transfer frames. Two transmitters used in a dual-polarization configuration with each transmitter providing two giga-symbols per second (Gsps) of coded data provides an aggregate rate of four Gsps. In this system, using the ISRO-provided 70-cm high-gain antenna, only 1 W of signal power is necessary on each polarization to overcome propagation losses and achieve a successful RF link. Several Near Earth Network (NEN) ground station sites (Alaska in the United States, Svalbard in Norway, and Punta Arenas in Chile) are baselined for the space-to-Earth communications link. Each ground station will also feature multiple upgrades to support NISAR's transmission starting with new Ka-band antennas, and new electronic units such as wideband downconverters and high-rate receivers. In addition, a baseband data processor called Data Acquisition Processor and Handling Network Environment (DAPHNE), newly developed by the NEN, provides data storage and connectivity to backhaul networks. With NISAR's unprecedented large volume of data (nearly 5 Petabytes over the mission duration), a cloud system enables science data processing cost reduction to the mission. The NASA downlink system described herein will be the first operational use of Gsps-class downlink rates on an Earth-Science mission.	[Kobayashi, M.

Data assimilation of observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission leads to improvements in the accuracy of hydrologic models, ultimately resulting in more reliable estimates of lumped water storage. However, the usually shallow groundwater compartment of many models presents a problem with GRACE assimilation techniques, as these satellite observations also represent changes in deeper soils and aquifers. To improve the accuracy of modeled groundwater estimates and allow the representation of WTD at finer spatial scales, we implemented a simple, yet novel approach to integrate GRACE data, by augmenting the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. First, the subsurface model structural representation was modified by incorporating an additional (fourth) soil layer of varying depth (up to 1000 m) in VIC as the bottom 'groundwater' layer. This addition allows the model to reproduce water storage variability not only in shallow soils but also in deeper groundwater, in order to allow integration of the full GRACE-observed variability. Second, a Direct Insertion scheme was developed that integrates the high temporal (daily) and spatial (similar to 6.94 km) resolution model outputs to match the GRACE resolution, performs the integration, and then disaggregates the updated model state after the assimilation step. Simulations were performed with and without Direct Insertion over the three largest river basins in California and including the Central Valley, in order to test the augmented model's ability to capture seasonal and inter-annual trends in the water table. This is the first-ever fusion of GRACE total water storage change observations with hydrologic simulations aiming at the determination of water table depth dynamics, at spatial scales potentially useful for local water management.

Quasi-Cyclic Protograph-Based Raptor-Like LDPC Codes for Short Block-Lengths	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Channel codes; iterative decoding threshold; LDPC codes; minimum distance; permanents; PBRL codes; Raptor codes; rate-compatible codes	PARITY-CHECK CODES; PUNCTURED CONVOLUTIONAL-CODES; DESIGN; CAPACITY	Protograph-based Raptor-like low-density parity-check codes (PBRL codes) are a family of easily encodable rate-compatible low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. PBRL codes have an excellent performance across all design rates. Quasi-cyclic (QC) PBRL code families permit high-speed decoder implementations. PBRL codes designed thus far, for both long and short block-lengths, have been based on optimizing the iterative decoding threshold of the protograph of the PBRL family at various design rates. This paper introduces a design method to obtain better QC PBRL code families at short block-lengths (of a few hundred bits) for low frame error rate (FER) requirements. We first select a protomatrix for the highest design rate. To add a new row to lower the rate, we keep all the previously obtained rows of the PBRL protomatrix fixed and select the new row that maximizes an upper bound on the minimum distance of any QC-LDPC code that can be obtained from the protomatrix. The new QC PBRL code families outperform the original PBRL codes at short block-lengths by providing a significantly better low-FER performance. The standard approach to computing the aforementioned upper bounds requires complexity that grows exponentially with the size of the protomatrix. However, we show that the structure of the PBRL protomatrix lets us obtain the upper bounds with complexity that grows only linearly with the size of the PBRL protomatrix. Using the complexity reduction results, we also establish an equivalence between the exhaustive search to design a new row for the PBRL protomatrix according to the new design method and an integer linear program.

Statistical diagrams of airborne precipitation radar transects, surface precipitation measurements, and particle size distributions are examined from nine cases observed during the Olympic Mountains Experiment (OLYMPEX). Although the pattern of windward enhancement and leeside diminishment of precipitation was omnipresent, the degree of modulation was largely controlled by the synoptic environment associated with the prefrontal, warm, and postfrontal sectors of midlatitude cyclones. Prefrontal sectors contained homogeneous stratiform precipitation with a slightly enhanced ice layer on the windward slopes and rapid diminishment to a near-complete rain shadow in the lee. Warm sectors contained deep, intense enhancement over both the windward slopes and high terrain and less prominent rain shadows owing to downstream spillover of ice particles generated over terrain. Surface particle size distributions in the warm sector contained a broad spectrum of sizes and concentrations of raindrops on the lower windward side where high precipitation rates were achieved from varying degrees of both liquid and ice precipitation-generating processes. Spillover precipitation was rather homogeneous in nature and lacked the undulations in particle size and concentration that occurred at the windward sites. Postfrontal precipitation transitioned from isolated convective cells over ocean to a shallow, mixed convective-stratiform composition with broader coverage and greater precipitation rates over the sloping terrain.

The retrieval of MRGs facilitated the exploration of a large collection of archived strains (similar to 500 isolates) and assisted in isolating seven related strains. The whole genome sequences (WGS) of seven ISS strains exhibited 100% identity to the 4.85x10(6)bp of four MRGs. The metagenome to phenome approach led to the description of a novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples. The phylogenomics and traditional taxonomic approaches suggested that these seven ISS strains and four MRGs were not phylogenetically affiliated to any validly described genera of the family Erwiniaceae, but belong to a novel genus with the proposed name Kalamiella. Comparative genomic analyses of Kalamiella piersonii strains and MRGs showed genes associated with carbohydrate (348 genes), amino acid (384), RNA (59), and protein (214) metabolisms; membrane transport systems (108), pathways for biosynthesis of cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, and pigments (179); as well as mechanisms for virulence, disease, and defense (50). Even though Kalamiella genome annotation and disc diffusion tests revealed multidrug resistance, the PathogenFinder algorithm predicted that K. piersonii strains are not human pathogens. This approach to isolating microbes allows for the characterization of functional pathways and their potential virulence properties that can directly affect human health. The isolation of novel strains from the ISS has broad applications in microbiology, not only because of concern for astronaut health but it might have a great potential for biotechnological relevance. The metagenome to phenome approach will help to improve our understanding of complex metabolic networks that control fundamental life processes under microgravity and in deep space.

This study aimed at comparing two forest fire probability mapping techniques, one based primarily on freely distributed EO (Earth observation) data from Landsat imagery, and another one based purely on GIS modeling. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat data was used to detect the high fire severity and probability area based on the NBR difference between pre- and post-fire conditions. The GIS-based modeling was based on a multi criterion evaluation technique, into which other attributes like anthropogenic and natural sources were also incorporated. The ability of both techniques to map forest fire probability was evaluated for a region in India, for which suitable ancillary data had been previously acquired to support a rigorous validation. Subsequently, a conceptual framework for the prediction of high fire probability zones in an area based on a newly introduced herein data fusion technique was constructed. Overall, the EO-based technique was found to be the most suitable option, since it required less computational time and resources in comparison to the GIS-based modeling approach. Furthermore, the fusion approach offered an appropriate path for developing a forest fire probability identification model for long-term pragmatic conservation of forests. The potential fusion of these two modeling approaches may provide information that can be useful to forest fire mitigation policy makers, and assist at conservation and resilience practices.

Utility and applications of rover science autonomy capabilities: Outcomes from a high-fidelity analogue mission simulation	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							MARS	The 2016 CanMars analogue mission simulated a Mars rover operation modeled very closely on NASA's Mars 2020 mission, with a comparable rover, instrument suite, and operations system. Over 28 sols of subjective mission time, the mission explored a terrestrial Mars analogue site with a remote science operations team, subject to realistic operational constraints, considering Earth-in-the-loop requirements, downlink timing and budgets, on-board resources, and instrument limitations. In that context, the mission also conducted an extensive set of experiments in employing rover science autonomy - capabilities where the rover decides for itself which data to gather, based on guidance from Earth but without complete specification of the targets. Such approaches have begun to be deployed in exploration missions, and can greatly enhance mission science return. These experiments aimed to understand under which operational circumstances, and for which kinds of observations, each of a suite of science autonomy capabilities was useful and practical. These included blind targeting of remote sensing instruments, autonomous geological scene classification and instrument targeting, visual target tracking, conditional sequencing, contingency activity lists, and precise rover return to previous positions. We present here a case study of these experiments and insights into applicability to rover mission planning.

A localized source originating from a near-subsurface methane reservoir is considered in the GCM simulations, which are performed with a modified version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, MarsWRF. The localized strength of a methane source varies with time, based on a 1-D near-subsurface diffusive transport. Time-varying surface release scenarios are also compared with an instantaneous release scenario. After release from the surface, the methane transport is investigated in the GCM as a passive scalar over time scales varying between 15 and 60 days, much shorter than the photochemical lifetime. Different emission scenarios of various duration and source intensity, as well as multiple locations with different elevation and terrain complexity are considered, to reproduce the substantial concentrations of methane (up to 50 ppb) observed in the northern hemisphere of Mars in 2003 (Mumma et al., 2009). Among the scenarios considered, the observations are reproduced best for an emission scenario of 45 sols duration, during which a total amount of about 90,000 metric tons of methane is released. The results reveal that observed Mars methane plumes in the northern hemisphere of Mars by Mumma et al. (2009) can be reproduced using a localized, time-varying methane source, consistent with a near surface methane reservoir.

We derive the particle size distribution power-law index in the comae of fragments B and C using radar cross sections and circular-polarization ratios observed at S and X bands (2.38 GHz and 8.56 GHz, respectively), and show day-to-day changes in the number of contributing particles. We test three irregular particle morphologies, but find that the particle shape plays a relatively minor role. The power-law indices from 4.0 to 4.8 and major-axis diameters up to about 30 cm provide the best fits to the radar observations, the values depending on the particle shape and the observed radial velocity. A majority of the measured particle velocities exceed the escape velocity of the nuclei.	[Virkki, A.; Harmon, J.

Data from fourteen independent sets of measurements spanning the years 1959-2016 were considered. The present analysis is based upon a revised assessment of all Type A and Type B uncertainty components for each previously reported cross-section. A consensus value for the absorption cross-section of 1.1329(35) x 10(-17) cm(2) molecule(-1) is recommended based on statistical analysis of the weighted data. This new cross-section value is 1.23% lower and its uncertainty sixfold smaller than the uncertainty of the conventionally accepted reference value reported by Hearn (1961 Proc. Phys.

ALMA survey of Class II protoplanetary disks in Corona Australis: a young region with low disk masses	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; submillimeter: ISM; planets and satellites: formation; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be; stars: formation	MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; X-RAY SOURCES; CIRCUMSTELLAR DISKS; EXTERNAL PHOTOEVAPORATION; TAURUS-AURIGA; HERBIG AE/BE; ACCRETION; CLUSTER; PROTOSTELLAR; CLASSIFICATION	Context. In recent years, the disk populations in a number of young star-forming regions have been surveyed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Understanding the disk properties and their correlation with the properties of the central star is critical to understanding planet formation. In particular, a decrease of the average measured disk dust mass with the age of the region has been observed, consistent with grain growth and disk dissipation. Aims. We aim to compare the general properties of disks and their host stars in the nearby (d = 160 pc) Corona Australis (CrA) star forming region to those of the disks and stars in other regions. Methods. We conducted high-sensitivity continuum ALMA observations of 43 Class II young stellar objects in CrA at 1.3 mm (230 GHz). The typical spatial resolution is similar to 0.3 ''. The continuum fluxes are used to estimate the dust masses of the disks, and a survival analysis is performed to estimate the average dust mass. We also obtained new VLT/X-shooter spectra for 12 of the objects in our sample for which spectral type (SpT) information was missing. Results. Twenty-four disks were detected, and stringent limits have been put on the average dust mass of the nondetections. Taking into account the upper limits, the average disk mass in CrA is 6 +/- 3 M-circle plus. This value is significantly lower than that of disks in other young (1-3 Myr) star forming regions (Lupus, Taurus, Chamaeleon I, and Ophiuchus) and appears to be consistent with the average disk mass of the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Sco. The position of the stars in our sample on the Herzsprung-Russel diagram however seems to confirm that CrA has an age similar to Lupus. Neither external photoevaporation nor a lower-than-usual stellar mass distribution can explain the low disk masses. On the other hand, a low-mass disk population could be explained if the disks were small, which could happen if the parent cloud had a low temperature or intrinsic angular momentum, or if the angular momentum of the cloud were removed by some physical mechanism such as magnetic braking. Even in detected disks, none show clear substructures or cavities. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in order to fully explain and understand the dust mass distribution of protoplanetary disks and their evolution, it may also be necessary to take into consideration the initial conditions of star- and disk-formation process. These conditions at the very beginning may potentially vary from region to region, and could play a crucial role in planet formation and evolution.	[Cazzoletti, P.; van Dishoeck, E.

Tracking Seasonal Fluctuations in Land Water Storage Using Global Models and GRACE Satellites	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							TRENDS; VALIDATION; RUNOFF; STATE	Seasonal water storage fluctuations are critical for evaluating water scarcity linked to climate forcing and human intervention. Here we compare seasonal changes in land total water storage anomalies using seven global hydrologic and land surface models (WGHM, PCR-GLOBWB, and five GLDAS models) to GRACE satellite data in 183 river basins globally. This work builds on previous analysis that focused on total water storage anomaly trends. Results show that most models underestimate seasonal water storage amplitudes in tropical and (semi)arid basins and land surface models generally overestimate amplitudes in northern basins. Some models (CLM-5.0 and PCR-GLOBWB) agree better with GRACE than others. Causes of model-GRACE discrepancies are attributed to missing storage compartments (e.g., surface water and/or groundwater) and underestimation of modeled storage capacities in tropical basins and to variations in modeled fluxes in northern basins. This study underscores the importance of considering water storage, in addition to water fluxes, to improve global models. Plain Language Summary We are relying more and more on global models to understand the water cycle, but we need to assess the reliability of model output. In this study we compare seasonal amplitudes in land total water storage from global models with those from GRACE satellite data in river basins globally. We found that seasonal amplitudes in total water storage account for more than half of the total signal, except in semiarid basins Seasonal amplitudes are highest in tropical basins and lowest in semiarid basins. Some models agree better with GRACE than others (CLM-5.0 and PCR-GLOBWB). Most models underestimate GRACE-derived seasonal amplitudes in tropical and semiarid basins but overestimate seasonal amplitudes in northern high latitude basins. The main cause of the discrepancies in tropical basins is likely insufficient storage capacity and lack of surface water inundation to accommodate the large seasonal storage variations. In northern high latitude basins, differences in snow physics and evapotranspiration increase seasonal amplitudes in water storage in newer versions of land surface models, overestimating GRACE-derived seasonal amplitudes and reducing agreement with GRACE relative to earlier versions. Reliable models of seasonal variations in water storage are critical for assessing water scarcity, estimating response to climate extremes, and managing water resources.	[Scanlon, B.

We pursue an alternative approach, in which waveforms are first represented as weighted sums over reduced bases (reduced-order modeling); we then train artificial neural networks to map gravitational-wave source parameters into basis coefficients. Statistical inference proceeds directly in coefficient space, where it is theoretically straightforward and computationally efficient. The neural networks also provide analytic waveform derivatives, which are useful for gradient-based sampling schemes. We demonstrate fast and accurate coefficient interpolation for the case of a four-dimensional binary-inspiral waveform family and discuss promising applications of our framework in parameter estimation.

J	Gonzalez, AO; Jiang, XA				Gonzalez, Alex O.; Jiang, Xianan			Distinct Propagation Characteristics of Intraseasonal Variability Over the Tropical West Pacific	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; MOIST STATIC ENERGY; COUPLED EQUATORIAL WAVES; EASTWARD PROPAGATION; VERTICAL STRUCTURE; KELVIN WAVES; SIMPLE-MODEL; MJO; CONVECTION; TEMPERATURE	Tropical intraseasonal variability, with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) as its most prominent mode, exerts extensive influences on global weather extremes. It is found that strong interannual variability of intraseasonal convection exists in the west Pacific (WP), in the form of years with strong eastward propagation (i.e., associated with the MJO) and years with strong westward propagation. Years with strong westward propagation on intraseasonal timescales are dominated by a westward propagating intraseasonal mode (WPIM), which is the second leading intraseasonal mode after the MJO over the tropical WP. Initiated over the central Pacific, the WPIM exhibits slow equatorial westward propagation (5m/s) with a period of 25days and a spatial scale of zonal wave number 3-4. Unlike the MJO, the WPIM lacks a significant tilt with height in specific humidity and vertical velocity. A strong anticorrelation is found between MJO and WPIM activity on interannual timescales over the WP. Budget analyses of the moist static energy suggest that both modes are driven by horizontal moist static energy advection and that substantial differences in winter mean large-scale moisture and zonal winds largely define their distinct propagation behaviors. The WPIM is favored, while the MJO is suppressed when mean equatorial low-level easterlies between 150 degrees E and 160 degrees W are enhanced and equatorial mean low-level moisture is reduced near the Dateline and enhanced in the off-equatorial WP (110 degrees-150 degrees E). While the WPIM bears resemblance to low-frequency equatorial Rossby waves, a more detailed analysis must be conducted to affirm if they are the same phenomenon.

Impact of light-absorbing particles on snow albedo darkening and associated radiative forcing over high-mountain Asia: high-resolution WRF-Chem modeling and new satellite observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							AEROSOL OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; BLACK CARBON DEPOSITION; BOUNDARY-LAYER DYNAMICS; TIBETAN PLATEAU; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRAIN SHAPE; ICE CORE; WATER AVAILABILITY; SEASONAL SNOW; MINERAL DUST	Light-absorbing particles (LAPs), mainly dust and black carbon, can significantly impact snowmelt and regional water availability over high-mountain Asia (HMA). In this study, for the first time, online aerosol-snow interactions are enabled and a fully coupled chemistry Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) regional model is used to simulate LAP-induced radiative forcing on snow surfaces in HMA at relatively high spatial resolution (12 km, WRF-HR) compared with previous studies. Simulated macro-and microphysical properties of the snowpack and LAP-induced snow darkening are evaluated against new spatially and temporally complete datasets of snow-covered area, grain size, and impurity-induced albedo reduction over HMA. A WRF-Chem quasi-global simulation with the same configuration as WRF-HR but a coarser spatial resolution (1 degrees, WRF-CR) is also used to illustrate the impact of spatial resolution on simulations of snow properties and aerosol distribution over HMA. Due to a more realistic representation of terrain slopes over HMA, the higher-resolution model (WRF-HR) shows significantly better performance in simulating snow area cover, duration of snow cover, snow albedo and snow grain size over HMA, as well as an evidently better atmospheric aerosol loading and mean LAP concentration in snow. However, the differences in albedo reduction from model and satellite retrievals is large during winter due to associated overestimation in simulated snow fraction. It is noteworthy that Himalayan snow cover has high magnitudes of LAP-induced snow albedo reduction (4 %-8 %) in pre-monsoon seasons (both from WRF-HR and satellite estimates), which induces a snow-mediated radiative forcing of similar to 30-50Wm(2). As a result, the Himalayas (specifically the western Himalayas) hold the most vulnerable glaciers and mountain snowpack to the LAP-induced snow darkening effect within HMA. In summary, coarse spatial resolution and absence of snow-aerosol interactions over the Himalayan cryosphere will result in significant underestimation of aerosol effects on snow melting and regional hydroclimate.

Non-Monotonic Aerosol Effect on Precipitation in Convective Clouds over Tropical Oceans	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LIQUID WATER; INVIGORATION; MICROPHYSICS; RAIN; PRODUCTS; SMOKE	Aerosol effects on convective clouds and associated precipitation constitute an important open-ended question in climate research. Previous studies have linked an increase in aerosol concentration to a delay in the onset of rain, invigorated clouds and stronger rain rates. Here, using observational data, we show that the aerosol effect on convective clouds shifts from invigoration to suppression with increasing aerosol optical depth. We explain this shift in trend (using a cloud model) as the result of a competition between two types of microphysical processes: cloud-core-based invigorating processes vs. peripheral suppressive processes. We show that the aerosol optical depth value that marks the shift between invigoration and suppression depends on the environmental thermodynamic conditions. These findings can aid in better parameterizing aerosol effects in climate models for the prediction of climate trends.

The cooling rate of Mars is related to its early thermal state and to its rheology, which determines its ability to deform and to dynamically evolve(2). Attempts to reconstruct the dynamic history of Mars and reveal its present-day structure, by combining the study of thermal evolution with surface observations, are limited by the interplay between several key quantities-including temperature, composition and rheology. Here we show that by considering Phobos (the closest satellite of Mars)-the orbital evolution of which is governed by the thermochemical history of Mars, through tidal interactions-we can gain insight into the thermal history and rheology of the planet. We investigated the long-term evolution of the main envelopes of Mars; these comprise a liquid metallic core that is overlain by a homogeneous silicate convecting mantle underneath an evolving heterogeneous lithospheric lid that includes a crust enriched in radiogenic elements. By exploiting the relationship between Mars and Phobos within an established in situ scenario for the early origin of the moons of Mars(3), we find that-initially-Mars was moderately hotter (100 to 200 kelvin) than it is today, and that its mantle sluggishly deforms in the dislocation creep regime. This corresponds to a reference viscosity of 10(22.2 +/- 0.5) pascal seconds and to a moderate to relatively weak intrinsic sensitivity of viscosity to temperature and pressure. Our approach predicts a present-day average crustal thickness of 40 +/- 25 kilometres and a surface heat flow of 20 +/- 1 milliwatts per square metre. We show that combining these predictions with data from future and ongoing space missions-such as InSight-could reduce uncertainties in Martian thermal and rheological histories, and help to uncover the origin of Phobos.

However, the development of a suitable memory remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we demonstrate the storage and reemission of single heralded 1532-nm-wavelength photons using a crystal waveguide. The photons are emitted from a photon-pair source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion and the memory is based on an atomic frequency comb of 6 GHz bandwidth, prepared through persistent spectral-hole burning of the inhomogeneously broadened absorption line of a cryogenically cooled erbium-doped lithium niobate waveguide. Despite currently limited storage time and efficiency, this demonstration represents an important step toward quantum networks that operate in the telecommunication band and the development of integrated (on-chip) quantum technology using industry-standard crystals.

In this work, we provide an overview of changes in the mass of the world's glaciers, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica, between 2002 and 2016, based on satellite gravimetry observations of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Glaciers lost mass at a rate of 199 +/- 32 Gt yr(-1) during this 14-yr period, equivalent to a cumulative sea level contribution of 8 mm. We present annual mass balances for 17 glacier regions, that show a qualitatively good agreement with published estimates from in situ observations. We find that annual mass balance varies considerably from year to year, which can in part be attributed to changes in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. These variations, combined with the relatively short observational record, hamper the detection of acceleration of glacier mass loss. Our study highlights the need for continued observations of the Earth's glacierized regions.

We detect an ordered magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky in the starless core. The magnetic field across the similar to 0.1 pc core shows a predominant northeast-southwest orientation centering between similar to 40 degrees and similar to 100 degrees, indicating that the field in the core is well aligned with the magnetic field in lower-density regions of the cloud probed by near-infrared observations and also the cloud-scale magnetic field traced by Planck observations. The polarization percentage (P) decreases with increasing total intensity (I), with a power-law index of -1.03 +/- 0.05. We estimate the plane-of-sky field strength (B-pos) using modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods based on structure function (SF), autocorrelation function (ACF), and unsharp masking (UM) analyses. We find that the estimates from the SF, ACF, and UM methods yield strengths of 103 +/- 46 mu G, 136 +/- 69 mu G, and 213 +/- 115 mu G, respectively. Our calculations suggest that the Ophiuchus C core is near magnetically critical or slightly magnetically supercritical (i.e., unstable to collapse). The total magnetic energy calculated from the SF method is comparable to the turbulent energy in Ophiuchus C, while the ACF method and the UM method only set upper limits for the total magnetic energy because of large uncertainties.

This has been taken as evidence that comets contributed a relatively small fraction of the terrestrial water. We present new sensitive spectroscopic observations of water isotopologues in the Jupiter-family comet 46P/Wirtanen carried out using the GREAT spectrometer aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The derived D/H ratio of (1.61 +/- 0.65) x 10(-4) is the same as in the Earth's oceans. Although the statistics are limited, we show that interesting trends are already becoming apparent in the existing data. A clear anti-correlation is seen between the D/H ratio and the active fraction, defined as the ratio of the active surface area to the total nucleus surface. Comets with an active fraction above 0.5 typically have D/H ratios in water consistent with the terrestrial value. These hyperactive comets, such as 46P/Wirtanen, require an additional source of water vapor in their coma, explained by the presence of subliming icy grains expelled from the nucleus. The observed correlation may suggest that hyperactive comets belong to a population of ice-rich objects that formed just outside the snow line, or in the outermost regions of the solar nebula, from water thermally reprocessed in the inner disk that was transported outward during the early disk evolution. The observed anti-correlation between the active fraction and the nucleus size seems to argue against the first interpretation, as planetesimals near the snow line are expected to undergo rapid growth. Alternatively, isotopic properties of water outgassed from the nucleus and icy grains may be different due to fractionation effects at sublimation. In this case, all comets may share the same Earth-like D/H ratio in water, with profound implications for the early solar system and the origin of Earth's oceans.

We present new near-infrared direct imaging/spectroscopy from the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system coupled with Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) integral field spectrograph and multi-epoch thermal infrared imaging from Keck/NIRC2 of LkCa 15 at high Strehl ratios. These data provide the first direct imaging look at the same wavelengths and in the same locations where previous studies identified the LkCa 15 protoplanets, and thus offer the first decisive test of their existence. The data do not reveal these planets. Instead, we resolve extended emission tracing a dust disk with a brightness and location comparable to that claimed for LkCa 15 bcd. Forward-models attributing this signal to orbiting planets are inconsistent with the combined SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2 data. An inner disk provides a more compelling explanation for the SAM detections and perhaps also the claimed H-alpha detection of LkCa 15 b. We conclude that there is currently no clear, direct evidence for multiple protoplanets orbiting LkCa 15, although the system likely contains at least one unseen Jovian companion. To identify Jovian companions around LkCa 15 from future observations, the inner disk should be detected and its effect modeled, removed, and shown to be distinguishable from planets. Protoplanet candidates identified from similar systems should likewise be clearly distinguished from disk emission through modeling.

Initial results from the New Horizons exploration of 2014 MU69, a small Kuiper Belt object	SCIENCE			English	Article							COMET 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; SHAPE; NUCLEUS; DENSITY; GALILEO; SYSTEM; PHOTODESORPTION; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; ROTATION	The Kuiper Belt is a distant region of the outer Solar System. On 1 January 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft flew close to (486958) 2014 MU69, a cold classical Kuiper Belt object approximately 30 kilometers in diameter. Such objects have never been substantially heated by the Sun and are therefore well preserved since their formation. We describe initial results from these encounter observations. MU69 is a bilobed contact binary with a flattened shape, discrete geological units, and noticeable albedo heterogeneity. However, there is little surface color or compositional heterogeneity. No evidence for satellites, rings or other dust structures, a gas coma, or solar wind interactions was detected. MU69's origin appears consistent with pebble cloud collapse followed by a low-velocity merger of its two lobes.	[Stern, S. A.; Spencer, J. R.; Olkin, C. B.; Parker, J. Wm.; Young, L. A.; Andrews, J.

While the need for sufficiently dense observations has often been discussed, density requirements depend on the question posed and interact with other choices made in the analysis. Focusing on the interaction of network density with varied meteorological information used to drive atmospheric transport, we perform geostatistical inversions of methane flux in the South Coast Air Basin, California, in 2015-2016 using transport driven by a locally tuned Weather Research and Forecasting configuration as well as by operationally available meteorological products. We find total-basin flux estimates vary by as much as a factor of two between inversions, but the spread can be greatly reduced by calibrating the estimates to account for modeled sensitivity. Using observations from the full Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project observing network, inversions driven by low-resolution generic wind fields are robustly sensitive (p<0.05) to seasonal differences in methane flux and to the increase in emissions caused by the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas leak. When the number of observing sites is reduced, the basin-wide sensitivity degrades, but flux events can be detected by testing for changes in flux variance, and even a single site can robustly detect basin-wide seasonal flux variations. Overall, an urban monitoring system using an operational methane observing network and off-the-shelf meteorology could detect many seasonal or event-driven changes in near real timeand, if calibrated to a model chosen as a transfer standard, could also quantify absolute emissions.

Our inversions use customized and validated high-fidelity meteorological output from Weather Research Forecasting and Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian model for South Coast Air Basin and innovatively employ a model resolution matrix-based metric to disentangle the spatiotemporal information content of observations as manifested through estimated fluxes. We partially track and constrain fluxes from the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak and detect closure of the Puente Hills landfill, with no prior information. Our annually aggregated fluxes and their uncertainty excluding the Aliso Canyon leak period lie within the uncertainty bounds of the fluxes reported by the previous studies. Spatially, major sources of CH4 emissions in the basin were correlated with CH4-emitting infrastructure. Temporally, our findings show large seasonal variations in CH4 fluxes with significantly higher fluxes in winter in comparison to summer months, which is consistent with natural gas demand and anticorrelated with air temperature. Overall, this is the first study that utilizes inversions to detect both enhancement (Aliso Canyon leak) and reduction (Puente Hills) in CH4 fluxes due to the unintended events and policy decisions and thereby demonstrates the utility of inverse modeling for identifying variations in fluxes at fine spatiotemporal resolution.

Uncovering the Pattern of Forced Sea Level Rise in the Satellite Altimeter Record	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							VARIABILITY; ENSO; TIME	The continuous and near-global coverage of satellite altimeters has provided an improved understanding of sea level rise on both global and regional scales. With its relatively short record, however, questions have persisted regarding how well satellite-measured trends reflect the trends associated with forced or anthropogenic forcing. Masking the forced sea level rise in the altimeter record is the presence of unaccounted-for, naturally occurring variability. Here, a combined approach using models and observations is used to attribute a portion of the satellite-measured sea level record to natural variability. The agreement between the observations and models makes clear the quality of current models and their ability to realistically capture sea level variability. This paper shows a regional trend pattern where the influence of natural variability has been reduced, providing a clearer picture of how anthropogenic forcing may impact sea level arise around the globe.

Effect of sea salt aerosol on tropospheric bromine chemistry	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MARINE BOUNDARY-LAYER; MODELING HALOGEN CHEMISTRY; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; INORGANIC BROMINE; CLOUD-WATER; IN-SITU; PACIFIC-OCEAN; OZONE LOSS; BRO; PARTICLES	Bromine radicals influence global tropospheric chemistry by depleting ozone and by oxidizing elemental mercury and reduced sulfur species. Observations typically indicate a 50 % depletion of sea salt aerosol (SSA) bromide relative to seawater composition, implying that SSA debromination could be the dominant global source of tropospheric bromine However, it has been difficult to reconcile this large source with the relatively low bromine monoxide (BrO) mixing ratios observed in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Here we present a new mechanistic description of SSA debromination in the GEOS-Chem global atmospheric chemistry model with a detailed representation of halogen (Cl, Br, and I) chemistry. We show that observed levels of SSA debromination can be reproduced in a manner consistent with observed BrO mixing ratios. Bromine radical sinks from the HOBr + S(IV) heterogeneous reactions and from ocean emission of acetaldehyde are critical in moderating tropospheric BrO levels. The resulting HBr is rapidly taken up by SSA and also deposited. Observations of SSA debromination at southern midlatitudes in summer suggest that model uptake of HBr by SSA may be too fast. The model provides a successful simulation of free-tropospheric BrO in the tropics and midlatitudes in summer, where the bromine radical sink from the HOBr + S(IV) reactions is compensated for by more efficient HOBr-driven recycling in clouds compared to previous GEOS-Chem versions. Simulated BrO in the MBL is generally much higher in winter than in summer due to a combination of greater SSA emission and slower conversion of bromine radicals to HBr. An outstanding issue in the model is the overestimate of free-tropospheric BrO in extratropical winter-spring, possibly reflecting an overestimate of the HOBr/HBr ratio under these conditions where the dominant HOBr source is hydrolysis of BrNO3.

Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021.	[Blachowicz, Adriana; Wang, Clay C.

Compositional distributions and evolutionary processes for the near-Earth object population: Results from the MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey (MITHNEOS)	ICARUS			English	Article							SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; SOLAR-SYSTEM; ORDINARY CHONDRITES; SOURCE REGIONS; PARENT BODY; REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; PYROXENE MIXTURES; ASTEROID PAIRS; FRESH SURFACES; MAIN-BELT	Advancing technology in near-infrared instrumentation and dedicated planetary telescope facilities have enabled nearly two decades of reconnoitering the spectral properties for near-Earth objects (NEOs). We report measured spectral properties for more than 1000 NEOs, representing >5% of the currently discovered population. Thermal flux detected below 2.5 mu m allows us to make albedo estimates for nearly 50 objects, including two comets. Additional spectral data are reported for more than 350 Mars-crossing asteroids. Most of these measurements were achieved through a collaboration between researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Hawaii, with full cooperation of the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. We call this project the MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey (MITHNEOS; myth-neos). While MITHNEOS has continuously released all spectral data for immediate use by the scientific community, our objectives for this paper are to: (1) detail the methods and limits of the survey data, (2) formally present a compilation of results including their taxonomic classification within a single internally consistent framework, (3) perform a preliminary analysis on the overall population characteristics with a concentration toward deducing key physical processes and identifying their source region for escaping the main belt. Augmenting our newly published measurements are the previously published results from the broad NEO community, including many results graciously shared by colleagues prior to formal publication. With this collective data set, we find the near-Earth population matches the diversity of the main-belt, with all main-belt taxonomic classes represented in our sample. Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as well as the subset of mission accessible asteroids (Delta V <= 7 km/s) both appear to be a representative mix of the overall NEO population, consistent with strong dynamical mixing for the population that interacts most closely with Earth. Mars crossers, however, are less diverse and appear to more closely match the inner belt population from where they have more recently diffused. The fractional distributions of major taxonomic classes (60% S, 20% C, 20% other) appear remarkably constant over two orders of magnitude in size (10 km to 100 m), which is eight orders of magnitude in mass, though we note unaccounted bias effects enter into our statistics below about 500 m. Given the range of surface ages, including possible refreshment by planetary encounters, we are able to identify a very specific space weathering vector tracing the transition from Q- to Sq- to S-types that follows the natural dispersion for asteroid spectra mapped into principal component space. We also are able to interpret a shock darkening vector that may account for some objects having featureless spectra. Space weathering effects for C-types are complex; these results are described separately by Lantz, Binzel, DeMeo. (2018, Icarus 302, 10-17). Independent correlation of dynamical models with taxonomic classes map the escape zones for NEOs to main-belt regions consistent with well established heliocentric compositional gradients. We push beyond taxonomy to interpret our visible plus near-infrared spectra in terms of the olivine and pyroxene mineralogy consistent with the H, L, and LL classes of ordinary chondrites meteorites. Correlating meteorite interpretations with dynamical escape region models shows a preference for LL chondrites to arrive from the v6 resonance and H chondrites to have a preferential signature from the mid-belt region (3:1 resonance). L chondrites show some preference toward the outer belt, but not at a significant level. We define a Space Weathering Parameter as a continuous variable and find evidence for step-wise changes in space weathering properties across different planet crossing zones in the inner solar system. Overall we hypothesize the relative roles of planetary encounters, YORP spin-up, and thermal cycling across the inner solar system.	[Binzel, R. P.; DeMeo, F. E.; Turtelboom, E.

Thermal alteration of labile elements in carbonaceous chondrites	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; Meteorites; OSIRIS-REx; (101955) Bennu; (3200) Phaethon; Asteroid mining; In situ resource utilization; Carbonaceous chondrites; Thermal alteration; Labile elements	TRACE-ELEMENTS; PRIMITIVE METEORITES; ABUNDANCES; CM; METAMORPHISM; VOLATILE; MISSION; ORIGIN; COMET; CONDENSATION	Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites are some of the oldest Solar System planetary materials available for study. The CI group has bulk abundances of elements similar to those of the solar photosphere. Of particular interest in carbonaceous chondrite compositions are labile elements, which vaporize and mobilize efficiently during post accretionary parent-body heating events. Thus, they can record low-temperature alteration events throughout asteroid evolution. However, the precise nature of labile-element mobilization in planetary materials is unknown. Here we characterize the thermally induced movements of the labile elements S, As, Se, Te, Cd, Sb, and Hg in carbonaceous chondrites by conducting experimental simulations of volatile-element mobilization during thermal metamorphism. This process results in appreciable loss of some elements at temperatures as low as 500 K. This work builds on previous laboratory heating experiments on primitive meteorites and shows the sensitivity of chondrite compositions to excursions in temperature. Elements such as S and Hg have the most active response to temperature across different meteorite groups. Labile element mobilization in primitive meteorites is essential for quantifying elemental fractionation that occurred on asteroids early in Solar System history. This work is relevant to maintaining a pristine sample from asteroid (101955) Bennu from the OSIRIS-REx mission and constraining the past orbital history of Bennu. Additionally, we discuss thermal effects on surface processes of near-Earth asteroids, including the thermal history of "rock comets" such as (3200) Phaethon. This work is also critical for constraining the concentrations of contaminants in vaporized water extracted from asteroid regolith as part of future in situ resource utilization for sustained robotic and human space exploration.

These icelike systems are naturally abundant on Earth and are generally expected to exist on icy celestial bodies. Carbon monoxide hydrate might be considered an important component of the carbon cycle in the solar system since CO gas is one of the predominant forms of carbon. Intriguing fundamental properties have also been reported: the CO hydrate initially forms in the sI structure (kinetically favored) and transforms into the sII structure (thermodynamically stable). Understanding and predicting the gas hydrate structural stability then become essential. The aim of this work is, thereby, to study the structural and energetic properties of the CO hydrate using density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with neutron diffraction measurements. In addition to the comparison of DFT-derived structural properties with those from experimental neutron diffraction, the originality of this work lies in the DFT-derived energy calculations performed on a complete unit cell (sI and sII) and not only by considering guest molecules confined in an isolated water cage (as usually performed for extracting the binding energies). Interestingly, an excellent agreement (within less than 1% error) is found between the measured and DFT-derived unit cell parameters by considering the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (denoted PBE) functional. Moreover, a strategy is proposed for evaluating the hydrate structural stability on the basis of potential energy analysis of the total nonbonding energies (i.e., binding energy and water substructure nonbonding energy). It is found that the sII structure is the thermodynamically stable hydrate phase. In addition, increasing the CO content in the large cages has a stabilizing effect on the sII structure, while it destabilizes the sI structure. Such findings are in agreement with the recent experimental results evidencing the structural metastability of the CO hydrate.

The influence of initial conditions on ice sheet model simulations, however, is still unclear. To better understand this influence, an initial state intercomparison exercise (initMIP) has been developed to compare, evaluate, and improve initialization procedures and estimate their impact on century-scale simulations. initMlP is the first set of experiments of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6), which is the primary Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) activity focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Following initMlP-Greenland, initMlP-Antarctica has been designed to explore uncertainties associated with model initialization and spin-up and to evaluate the impact of changes in external forcings. Starting from the state of the Antarctic ice sheet at the end of the initialization procedure, three forward experiments are each run for 100 years: a control run, a run with a surface mass balance anomaly, and a run with a basal melting anomaly beneath floating ice. This study presents the results of initMlP-Antarctica from 25 simulations performed by 16 international modeling groups. The submitted results use different initial conditions and initialization methods, as well as ice flow model parameters and reference external forcings. We find a good agreement among model responses to the surface mass balance anomaly but large variations in responses to the basal melting anomaly. These variations can be attributed to differences in the extent of ice shelves and their upstream tributaries, the numerical treatment of grounding line, and the initial ocean conditions applied, suggesting that ongoing efforts to better represent ice shelves in continental-scale models should continue.

The Cell and the Sum of Its Parts: Patterns of Complexity in Biosignatures as Revealed by Deep UV Raman Spectroscopy	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						biosignatures; deep UV Raman spectroscopy; Mars 2020; SHERLOC; spectral deconvolution	AMINO-ACID SYNTHESIS; RESONANCE RAMAN; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CROSS-SECTIONS; LIFE; MARS; SEARCH; BACTERIA; SPECTRA; IDENTIFICATION	The next NASA-led Mars mission (Mars 2020) will carry a suite of instrumentation dedicated to investigating Martian history and the in situ detection of potential biosignatures. SHERLOC, a deep UV Raman/Fluorescence spectrometer has the ability to detect and map the distribution of many organic compounds, including the aromatic molecules that are fundamental building blocks of life on Earth, at concentrations down to 1 ppm. The mere presence of organic compounds is not a biosignature: there is widespread distribution of reduced organic molecules in the Solar System. Life utilizes a select few of these molecules creating conspicuous enrichments of specific molecules that deviate from the distribution expected from purely abiotic processes. The detection of far from equilibrium concentrations of a specific subset of organic molecules, such as those uniquely enriched by biological processes, would comprise a universal biosignature independent of specific terrestrial biochemistry. The detectability and suitability of a small subset of organic molecules to adequately describe a living system is explored using the bacterium Escherichia coli as a model organism. The DUV Raman spectra of E. coli cells are dominated by the vibrational modes of the nucleobases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, and the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. We demonstrate that not only does the deep ultraviolet (DUV) Raman spectrum of E. coil reflect a distinct concentration of specific organic molecules, but that a sufficient molecular complexity is required to deconvolute the cellular spectrum. Furthermore, a linear combination of the DUV resonant compounds is insufficient to fully describe the cellular spectrum. The residual in the cellular spectrum indicates that DUV Raman spectroscopy enables differentiating between the presence of biomolecules and the complex uniquely biological organization and arrangements of these molecules in living systems. This study demonstrates the ability of DUV Raman spectroscopy to interrogate a complex biological system represented in a living cell, and differentiate between organic detection and a series of Raman features that derive from the molecular complexity inherent to life constituting a biosignature.

Geological Survey of India recorded a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite fall in Mukundpura, India, on June 6, 2017. We conducted a study to investigate the microbial community that survived the meteorite impact. 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing indicates the presence of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria in meteorite impact soil. Comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed an intriguing abundance of class Bacilli in the impact soil. Bacillus thermocopriae IR-1, a moderately thermotolerant organism, was isolated from a rock, impacted by the Mukundpura meteorite. We investigated the resilience of B. thermocopriae IR-1 to environmental stresses and impact shock in a Reddy shock tube. B. thermocopriae IR-1 survived (28.82% survival) the effect of shock waves at a peak shock pressure of 300 kPa, temperature 400 K, and Mach number of 1.47. This investigation presents the first report on the effect of impact shock on B. thermocopriae IR-1. The study is also the first report on studying the microbial diversity and isolation of bacteria from impact crater soil immediately after meteorite impact event.	[Thombre, Rebecca S.; Kulkarni, P.

We consider the heavy-element content trend of observed exoplanets, derived from improved measurements of mass and radius, and explore how this trend can be used as a tracer of their formation sites. Using gas accretion recipes obtained from hydrodynamical simulations, we confirm that the disk-limited gas accretion regime is most important for reproducing the trend. Given that such a regime is specified by two characteristic masses of planets, we compute these masses as a function of the distance (r) from the central star, and then examine how the regime appears in the mass-semimajor axis diagram. Our results show that a plausible solid accretion region emerges at r similar or equal to 0.6 au and expands with increasing r, using the conventional disk model. Given that exoplanets that possess the heavy-element content trend distribute currently near their central stars, our results imply the importance of planetary migration that would occur after solid accretion onto planets might be nearly completed at r >= 0.6 au. Self-consistent simulations would be needed to verify the predictions herein.	[Hasegawa, Yasuhiro; Vasisht, Gautam] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Hansen, Bradley M.

The SPARC water vapour assessment II: profile-to-profile comparisons of stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour data sets obtained from satellites	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							METHANE OXIDATION; SUMMER MESOSPHERE; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; TECHNICAL NOTE; VALIDATION; OZONE; RETRIEVAL; MIPAS; H2O; DEHYDRATION	Within the framework of the second SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate) water vapour assessment (WAVAS-II), profile-to-profile comparisons of stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour were performed by considering 33 data sets derived from satellite observations of 15 different instruments. These comparisons aimed to provide a picture of the typical biases and drifts in the observational database and to identify data-set-specific problems. The observational database typically exhibits the largest biases below 70 hPa, both in absolute and relative terms. The smallest biases are often found between 50 and 5 hPa. Typically, they range from 0.25 to 0.5 ppmv (5% to 10%) in this altitude region, based on the 50% percentile over the different comparison results. Higher up, the biases increase with altitude overall but this general behaviour is accompanied by considerable variations. Characteristic values vary between 0.3 and 1 ppmv (4% to 20%). Obvious data-set-specific bias issues are found for a number of data sets. In our work we performed a drift analysis for data sets overlapping for a period of at least 36 months. This assessment shows a wide range of drifts among the different data sets that are statistically significant at the 2 sigma uncertainty level. In general, the smallest drifts are found in the altitude range between about 30 and 10 hPa. Histograms considering results from all altitudes indicate the largest occurrence for drifts between 0.05 and 0.3 ppmvdecade(-1). Comparisons of our drift estimates to those derived from comparisons of zonal mean time series only exhibit statistically significant differences in slightly more than 3% of the comparisons. Hence, drift estimates from profile-to-profile and zonal mean time series comparisons are largely interchangeable. As for the biases, a number of data sets exhibit prominent drift issues. In our analyses we found that the large number of MIPAS data sets included in the assessment affects our general results as well as the bias summaries we provide for the individual data sets. This is because these data sets exhibit a relative similarity with respect to the remaining data sets, despite the fact that they are based on different measurement modes and different processors implementing different retrieval choices. Because of that, we have by default considered an aggregation of the comparison results obtained from MIPAS data sets.

The transport phenomena include land hydrology, physical oceanography, atmospheric moisture flux, and global cryospheric mass balance. The mass transport observed by the satellite system also includes solid Earth motions caused by, for example, great subduction zone earthquakes and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) processes. When coupled with altimetry, these space gravimetry data provide a powerful framework for studying climate-related changes on decadal timescales, such as ice mass loss and sea-level rise. As the changes in the latter are significant over the past two decades, there is a concomitant self-attraction and loading phenomenon generating ancillary changes in gravity, sea surface, and solid Earth deformation. These generate a finite signal in GRACE and ocean altimetry, and it may often be desirable to isolate and remove them for the purpose of understanding, for example, ocean circulation changes and post-seismic viscoelastic mantle flow, or GIA, occurring beneath the seafloor. Here we perform a systematic calculation of sea-level fingerprints of on-land water mass changes using monthly Release-06 GRACE Level-2 Stokes coefficients for the span April 2002 to August 2016, which result in a set of solutions for the time-varying geoid, sea-surface height, and vertical bedrock motion. We provide both spherical harmonic coefficients and spatial maps of these global field variables and uncertainties therein (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8UC8IR; Adhikari et al., 2019). Solutions are provided for three official GRACE data processing centers, namely the University of Texas Austin's Center for Space Research (CSR), GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ), and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), with and without rotational feedback included and in both the center-of-mass and center-of-figure reference frames. These data may be applied for either study of the fields themselves or as fundamental filter components for the analysis of ocean-circulation- and earthquake-related fields or for improving ocean tide models.

While previous studies suggested that South-China-Sea freshwaters north of the MC intruding the Indonesian Seas weaken the ITF during boreal winter, the impact of the MC water cycle on the ITF has not been investigated. Here we use ocean-atmosphere-land satellite observations to reveal the dominant contribution of the MC monsoonal water cycle to boreal winter-spring freshening in the Java Sea through local precipitation and runoff from Kalimantan, Indonesia. We further demonstrate that the freshening corresponds to a reduced southward pressure gradient that would weaken the ITF. Therefore, the MC water cycle plays a critical role regulating ITF seasonality. The findings have strong implications to longer-term variations of the ITF associated with the variability and change of Indo-Pacific climate and MC water cycle.

Effects of Oxygen-Containing Salts on the Detection of Organic Biomarkers on Mars and in Terrestrial Analog Soils	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Mars; Organics; Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Atacama; Perchlorate; Detection	ROCKNEST AEOLIAN DEPOSIT; GALE CRATER; ATACAMA DESERT; MARTIAN SOIL; PERCHLORATE; MATTER; COMBUSTION; MOLECULES; MUDSTONE; NITRATE	The detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons by Curiosity on Mars has been attributed to the presence of unidentified indigenous organic matter. Similarly, oxychlorines on Earth have been proposed to be responsible for the apparent lack of organics in the Atacama Desert. The presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) poses a unique challenge to the measurement of organic matter due to the oxidizing power of oxychlorines during commonly used pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GC-MS) methods. Here, we show that perchlorates and other oxyanion salts inhibit the detection of organic compounds but that removing these problematic species prior to pyrolysis by using an optimal sample extraction duration and suitable ratios of water to sample mass enables analysis. We have characterized leached and unleached samples containing perchlorates from the Atacama Desert and have found that after leaching, the py-GC-MS chromatograms of the dried mineral residues show identifiable biomarkers associated with indigenous cyanobacteria. Samples which were pyrolyzed without leaching showed no detectable organic matter other than background siloxane and very weak or no trace of detectable polychlorinated benzenes. Dried sample residues remaining after leaching, the mineral matrix and water-insoluble organic matter, showed a strong organic response in all cases when analyzed by py-GC-MS. These residues are most likely the product of the pyrolysis of water-insoluble organics originally present in the samples. In addition, our results imply that previous soil analyses which contained high levels of oxyanions and concluded that organics were either not present or were present at extremely low levels should be reexamined.

We calculate mass discharge, D, into the ocean directly for 107 glaciers (85% of D) and indirectly for 110 glaciers (15%) using velocity-scaled reference fluxes. The decadal mass balance switched from a mass gain of +47 +/- 21 Gt/y in 1972-1980 to a loss of 51 +/- 17 Gt/y in 1980-1990. The mass loss increased from 41 +/- 17 Gt/y in 1990-2000, to 187 +/- 17 Gt/y in 2000-2010, to 286 +/- 20 Gt/y in 2010-2018, or sixfold since the 1980s, or 80 +/- 6 Gt/y per decade, on average. The acceleration in mass loss switched from positive in 2000-2010 to negative in 2010-2018 due to a series of cold summers, which illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating short records into longer-term trends. Cumulated since 1972, the largest contributions to global sea level rise are from northwest (4.4 +/- 0.2 mm), southeast (3.0 +/- 0.3 mm), and central west (2.0 +/- 0.2 mm) Greenland, with a total 13.7 +/- 1.1 mm for the ice sheet. The mass loss is controlled at 66 +/- 8% by glacier dynamics (9.1 mm) and 34 +/- 8% by SMB (4.6 mm). Even in years of high SMB, enhanced glacier discharge has remained sufficiently high above equilibrium to maintain an annual mass loss every year since 1998.

Snowpack measurements suggest role for multi-year sea ice regions in Arctic atmospheric bromine and chlorine chemistry	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Arctic; Snow; Sea ice; Bromine; Chlorine; Halogen	OZONE DEPLETION EVENTS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; POLAR SUNRISE; HALOGEN ACTIVATION; MOLECULAR BROMINE; CL ATOM; AEROSOL; COASTAL; SPRINGTIME	As sources of reactive halogens, snowpacks in sea ice regions control the oxidative capacity of the Arctic atmosphere. However, measurements of snowpack halide concentrations remain sparse, particularly in the high Arctic, limiting our understanding of and ability to parameterize snowpack participation in tropospheric halogen chemistry. To address this gap, we measured concentrations of chloride, bromide, and sodium in snow samples collected during polar spring above remote multi-year sea ice (MYI) and first-year sea ice (FYI) north of Greenland and Alaska, as well as in the central Arctic, and compared these measurements to a larger dataset collected in the Alaskan coastal Arctic by Krnavek et al. (2012). Regardless of sea ice region, these surface snow samples generally featured lower salinities, compared to coastal snow. Surface snow in FYI regions was typically enriched in bromide and chloride compared to seawater, indicating snowpack deposition of bromine and chlorine-containing trace gases and an ability of the snowpack to participate further in bromine and chlorine activation processes. In contrast, surface snow in MYI regions was more often depleted in bromide, indicating it served as a source of bromine-containing trace gases to the atmosphere prior to sampling. Measurements at various snow depths indicate that the deposition of sea salt aerosols and halogen-containing trace gases to the snowpack surface played a larger role in determining surface snow halide concentrations compared to upward brine migration from sea ice. Calculated enrichment factors for bromide and chloride, relative to sodium, in the MYI snow samples suggests that MYI regions, in addition to FYI regions, have the potential to play an active role in Arctic boundary layer bromine and chlorine chemistry. The ability of MYI regions to participate in springtime atmospheric halogen chemistry should be considered in regional modeling of halogen activation and interpretation of satellite-based tropospheric bromine monoxide column measurements.

The associated potential ozone loss process requires low temperatures together with elevated water vapour mixing ratios. Since this ozone loss is initiated by heterogeneous chlorine activation on liquid aerosols, an increase in sulfate aerosol surface area due to a volcanic eruption or geoengineering could increase the likelihood of its occurrence. However, the chemical mechanism of this ozone loss process has not yet been analysed in sufficient detail and its sensitivity to various conditions is not yet clear. Under conditions of climate change associated with an increase in greenhouse gases, both a stratospheric cooling and an increase in water vapour convectively injected into the stratosphere are expected. Understanding the influence of low temperatures, elevated water vapour and enhanced sulfate particles on this ozone loss mechanism is a key step in estimating the impact of climate change and potential sulfate geoengineering on mid-latitude ozone. Here, we analyse the ozone loss mechanism and its sensitivity to various stratospheric conditions in detail. By conducting a box-model study with the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS), chemistry was simulated along a 7 d backward trajectory. This trajectory was calculated neglecting mixing of neighbouring air masses. Chemical simulations were initialized using measurements taken during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS) aircraft campaign (2013, Texas), which encountered an elevated water vapour mixing ratio of 10.6 ppmv at a pressure level around 100 hPa. We present a detailed analysis of the ozone loss mechanism, including the chlorine activation, chlorine-catalysed ozone loss cycles, maintenance of activated chlorine and the role of active nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx). Focussing on a realistic trajectory in a temperature range from 197 to 202 K, a threshold in water vapour of 10.6 ppmv has to be exceeded and maintained for stratospheric ozone loss to occur. We investigated the sensitivity of the water vapour threshold to temperature, sulfate content, inorganic chlorine (Cl-y), inorganic nitrogen (NOy) and inorganic bromine (Br-y). The water vapour threshold is mainly determined by the temperature and sulfate content. However, the amount of ozone loss depends on Cl-y, Br-y and the duration of the time period over which chlorine activation can be maintained. NOy affects both the potential of ozone formation and the balance between reactions yielding chlorine activation and deactivation, which determines the water vapour threshold. Our results show that in order to deplete ozone, a chlorine activation time of 24 to 36 h for conditions of the water vapour threshold with low temperatures must be maintained. A maximum ozone loss of 9 % was found for a 20 ppmv water vapour mixing ratio using North American Monsoon (NAM) tropopause standard conditions with a chemical box-model simulation along a realistic trajectory. For the same trajectory, using observed conditions (of 10.6 ppmv H2O), the occurrence of simulated ozone loss was dependent on the sulfate amount assumed. Detailed analysis of current and future possibilities is needed to assess whether enhanced water vapour conditions in the summertime mid-latitude lower stratosphere lead to significant ozone loss.

J	Kubar, TL; Jiang, JH				Kubar, Terence L.; Jiang, Jonathan H.			Net Cloud Thinning, Low-Level Cloud Diminishment, and Hadley Circulation Weakening of Precipitating Clouds with Tropical West Pacific SST Using MISR and Other Satellite and Reanalysis Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						remote sensing; tropical convection; cloud fraction; cloud radiative forcing; cloud feedbacks; precipitation	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; ANGULAR-DISTRIBUTION MODELS; RADIATIVE FLUX ESTIMATION; ENERGY SYSTEM INSTRUMENT; DEEP CONVECTION; TERRA SATELLITE; BOUNDARY-LAYER; CIRRUS CLOUDS; WATER-VAPOR; CONVERGENCE	Daily gridded Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) satellite data are used in conjunction with CERES, TRMM, and ERA-Interim reanalysis data to investigate horizontal and vertical high cloud structure, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net cloud forcing and albedo, and dynamics relationships against local SST and precipitation as a function of the mean Tropical West Pacific (TWP; 120 degrees E to 155 degrees W; 30 degrees S-30 degrees N) SST. As the TWP warms, the SST mode (similar to 29.5 degrees C) is constant, but the area of the mode grows, indicating increased kurtosis of SSTs and decreased SST gradients overall. This is associated with weaker low-level convergence and mid-tropospheric ascent (omega(500)) over the highest SSTs as the TWP warms, but also a broader area of weak ascent away from the deepest convection, albeit stronger when compared to when the mean TWP is cooler. These associated dynamics changes are collocated with less anvil and thick cloud cover over the highest SSTs and similar thin cold cloud fraction when the TWP is warmer, but broadly more anvil and cirrus clouds over lower local SSTs (SST < 27 degrees C). For all TWP SST quintiles, anvil cloud fraction, defined as clouds with tops > 9 km and TOA albedos between 0.3-0.6, is closely associated with rain rate, making it an excellent proxy for precipitation; but for a given heavier rain rate, cirrus clouds are more abundant with increasing domain-mean TWP SST. Clouds locally over SSTs between 29-30 degrees C have a much less negative net cloud forcing, up to 25 W m(-2) greater, when the TWP is warm versus cool. When the local rain rate increases, while the net cloud fraction with tops < 9 km decreases, mid-level clouds (4 km < Z(top) < 9 km) modestly increase. In contrast, combined low-level and mid-level clouds decrease as the domain-wide SST increases (-10% deg(-1)). More cirrus clouds for heavily precipitating systems exert a stronger positive TOA effect when the TWP is warmer, and anvil clouds over a higher TWP SST are less reflective and have a weaker cooling effect. For all precipitating systems, total high cloud cover increases modestly with higher TWP SST quintiles, and anvil + cirrus clouds are more expansive, suggesting more detrainment when TWP SSTs are higher. Total-domain anvil cloud fraction scales mostly with domain-mean omega(500), but cirrus clouds mostly increase with domain-mean SST, invoking an explanation other than circulation. The overall thinning and greater top-heaviness of clouds over the TWP with warming are possible TWP positive feedbacks not previously identified.

Temperature Dependence Study of the Kinetics and Product Yields of the HO2 + CH3C(O)O-2 Reaction by Direct Detection of OH and HO2 Radicals Using 2f-IR Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							PEARL RIVER DELTA; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; CH3C(O)O-2+HO2 REACTION; ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM; PHOTOCHEMICAL DATA; SELF-REACTION; OH; MECHANISM; RADICALS; C2H5O2	The HO2 + CH3C(O)O-2 reaction consists of three product channels: CH3C(O)OOH + O-2 (Ria), CH3C(O)OH + O-3 (Rib), and OH + CH3C(O)O + O-2 (Ric). The overall rate constant (k(1)) and product yields (alpha(1a), alpha(1b), and alpha(1c)) were determined over the atmospherically relevant temperature range of 230-294 K at 100 Torr in N-2. Time-resolved kinetics measurements were performed in a pulsed laser photolysis experiment in a slow flow cell by employing simultaneous infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy. HO2 and CH3C(O)O-2 were formed by Cl-atom reactions with CH3OH and CH3CHO, respectively. Heterodyne near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) was employed to selectively detect HO2 and OH radicals. Ultraviolet absorption at 225 and 250 nm was used to detect various peroxy radicals as well as ozone (03). These experimental techniques enabled direct measurements of alpha(1a), and alpha(1b) via time-resolved spectroscopic detection in the MIR and the UV, respectively. At each temperature, experiments were performed at various ratios of initial HO2 and CH3C(O)O-2 concentrations to quantify the secondary chemistry. The Arrhenius expression was found to be k(1)(T) = 1.38:16.1"73 X 10(-12) exp[(730 +/- 170)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) alpha(1a) was temperature-independent while ait, and alc decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing temperatures. These trends are consistent with the current recommendation by the IUPAC data evaluation. Hydrogen-bonded adducts of HO2 with the precursors, HO2-CH3OH and HO2 center dot CH3CHO, played a role at lower temperatures; as part of this work, rate enhancements of the HO2 self-reaction due to reactions of the adducts with HO2 were also measured.

These measurements generally rely on inversions of computationally intensive radiative transfer models (RTMs). RTMs' computational expense makes them difficult to use with high-volume imaging spectrometers, and forces approximations such as lookup table interpolation and surface-atmosphere decoupling. These compromises limit the accuracy and flexibility of the remote retrieval; dramatic speed improvements in radiative transfer models could significantly improve the utility and interpretability of remote spectroscopy for Earth science. This study demonstrates that nonparametric function approximation with neural networks can replicate radiative transfer calculations and generate accurate radiance spectra at multiple wavelengths over a diverse range of surface and atmosphere state parameters. We also demonstrate such models can act as surrogate forward models for atmospheric correction procedures. Incorporating physical knowledge into the network structure provides improved interpretability and model efficiency. We evaluate the approach in atmospheric correction of data from the PRISM airborne imaging spectrometer, and demonstrate accurate emulation of radiative transfer calculations, which run several orders of magnitude faster than first-principles models. These results are particularly amenable to iterative spectrum fitting approaches, providing analytical benefits including statistically rigorous treatment of uncertainty and the potential to recover information on spectrally broad signals.

Seasonal Sources of Whole-Lake CH4 and CO2 Emissions From Interior Alaskan Thermokarst Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						thermokarst; methane; lakes; radiocarbon; carbon dioxide; climate change	METHANE OXIDATION; DISSOLVED METHANE; STABLE-ISOTOPES; NORTHERN LAKES; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ARCTIC LAKES; WATER; FRACTIONATION; ECOSYSTEMS; EBULLITION	The lakes that form via ice-rich permafrost thaw emit CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere from previously frozen ancient permafrost sources. Despite this potential to positively feedback to climate change, lake carbon emission sources are not well understood on whole-lake scales, complicating upscaling. In this study, we used observations of radiocarbon (C-14) and stable carbon (C-13) isotopes in the summer and winter dissolved CH4 and CO2 pools, ebullition-CH4, and multiple independent mass balance approaches to characterize whole-lake emission sources and apportion annual emission pathways. Observations focused on five lakes with variable thermokarst in interior Alaska. The C-14 age of discrete ebullition-CH4 seeps ranged from 39515 to 28,240150 YBP across all study lakes; however, dissolved (CH4)-C-14 was younger than 4,730 YBP. In the primary study lake, Goldstream L., the integrated whole-lake C-14 age of ebullition-CH4, as determined by three different approaches, ranged from 3,290 to 6,740 YBP. A new dissolved-C-14-CH4-based approach to estimating ebullition C-14 age and flux showed close agreement to previous ice-bubble surveys and bubble-trap flux estimates. Differences in open water versus ice-covered dissolved gas concentrations and their C-14 and C-13 isotopes revealed the influence of winter ice trapping and forcing ebullition-CH4 into the underlying water column, where it comprised 50% of the total dissolved CH4 pool by the end of winter. Across the study lakes, we found a relationship between the whole-lake C-14 age of dissolved CH4 and CO2 and the extent of active thermokarst, representing a positive feedback system that is sensitive to climate warming. Plain Language Summary Lakes that form as a result of thawing permafrost (perennially frozen ground) can release new greenhouse gases from ancient carbon reservoirs, which further warm the atmosphere and promote more permafrost thaw. Existing observations of this phenomenon are insufficient to fully understand the impact that thaw lakes have on the current atmosphere, let alone the atmosphere of a future warmer world. In this study, we used a novel approach and made open water and ice-covered measurements of rare carbon isotopes in methane and carbon dioxide dissolved in lake water and in bubbles emitted from sediments to determine the whole-lake-scale environmental drivers that regulate gas emissions from thawing permafrost. We learned that despite highly variable carbon source ages within single lakes, the presence of winter-ice traps and mixes all lake sources proportionally into the dissolved gas pool during winter and allows the stronger greenhouse gas, methane, to be oxidized to carbon dioxide before emission to the atmosphere in spring. This study also confirmed that higher levels of permafrost thaw within a lake are related to older carbon sources fueling whole-lake gas emissions, which, if consistent with lakes across northern permafrost regions, is evidence of a potential positive feedback to further climate warming.

J	Girona, T; Caudron, C; Huber, C				Girona, Tarsilo; Caudron, Corentin; Huber, Christian			Origin of Shallow Volcanic Tremor: The Dynamics of Gas Pockets Trapped Beneath Thin Permeable Media	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							SATSUMA-IWOJIMA VOLCANO; RUAPEHU CRATER LAKE; IZU-OSHIMA VOLCANO; ARENAL VOLCANO; HARMONIC TREMOR; MASAYA VOLCANO; POROUS-MEDIA; COSTA-RICA; ACOUSTIC OBSERVATIONS; DEGASSING EXPLOSIONS	Linking volcano-seismic signals with subsurface processes is crucial to improve the forecasting of volcanic eruptions. One of the most enigmatic signals is shallow volcanic tremor, a highly periodic ground vibration that is typically sourced beneath the crater of active volcanoes, is long lasting (from minutes to years), appears during unrest periods, and frequently precedes eruptions. In this paper, we demonstrate that shallow tremor can be produced by periodic pressure oscillations emerging spontaneously beneath permeable media (e.g., fractured magma caps). These pressure oscillations are the result of three concurrent processes: (a) the transient porous flow of gases through the permeable cap; (b) the temporary accumulation of these gases beneath the cap, forming a gas pocket; and (c) the random supply of volatiles from deeper levels. For highly permeable media (>= 10(-12) m(2); realistic for shallow volcanic edifices), the pressure in subsurface gas pockets is governed by the equation of a linear oscillator; hence, under proper conditions, periodic pressure oscillations emerge during the transfer of gases from the Earth's interior to the surface. Our model is consistent with geophysical data showing that the tremor source is localized at a fixed region and can explain the main characteristics of ground vibrations, including frequency gliding, variations of seismic amplitude prior to eruptions, and the different types of tremor observed. For thin permeable caps (<100 m), we find that different eruption mechanisms (e.g., magma ascent vs. cap sealing) leave distinct footprints in the tremor properties, thus opening new perspectives to forecast the type and style of impending eruptions.

Launched in May of 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On observatory builds on the design of the original Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites, but incorporates a number of improvements based on lessons learned, and features significantly increased complexity due to the accommodation of the laser ranging interferometer. This paper provides an overview of the challenging requirements levied on the observatory, and the mission and spacecraft design necessary to meet them. As the original Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment spacecraft design has not been, to date, broadly discussed in the engineering literature, this paper further highlights original design rationales, where still applicable. As future satellite-based geodesy missions with similar constraints and challenges emerge, the implementation of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On observatory described herein can serve as a pathfinder and guide for the successful realization of these endeavors.

Multidisciplinary analysis of the Hapi region located on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; comets: individual (67P C-G)	SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS; OSIRIS; ICE; SURFACE; MANTLE; 67P	By using the Rosetta/OSIRIS-NAC data set taken in 2014 August, we focus on the neck region, called Hapi, located on 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko's Northern hemisphere. The gravitational potential and slopes of Hapi, coupled with the geological unit identification and the boulder size-frequency distributions, support the interpretation that both taluses and gravitational accumulation deposits observable onHapi are the result of multiple cliff collapses that occurred at different times. By contrast, the fine-particle deposits observable in the central part of the study area are made of aggregates coming from the Southern hemisphere and deposited during each perihelion passage. Both the consolidated terrains on the western part of Hapi, as well as the centrally aligned ridge made of boulder-like features, suggest that Hapi is in structural continuity with the onion-like structure of the main lobe of 67P. Despite the dusty blanket observable on Hapi, its terrains are characterized by water-ice-rich components that, once repeatedly and rapidly illuminated, sublimate, hence resulting in the strong jet activity observed in 2014 August.

We propagate the differences in covariances into parameter constraints related to growth rate of structure, Alcock-Paczynski distortions, and biasing. We consider seven methods in three broad categories: algorithms that solve for halo density evolution deterministically using Lagrangian trajectories (ICE-COLA, PINOCCHIO, and PEAKPATCH), methods that rely on halo assignment schemes on to dark matter overdensities calibrated with a target N-body run (HALOGEN, PATCHY), and two standard assumptions about the full density probability distribution function (Gaussian and lognormal). We benchmark their performance against a set of three hundred N-body simulations, running similar sets of approximate simulations with matched initial conditions, for each method. We find that most methods reproduce the monopole to within 5 per cent, while residuals for the quadrupole are sometimes larger and scale dependent. The variance of the multipoles is typically reproduced within 10 per cent. Overall, we find that covariances built from approximate simulations yield errors on model parameters within 10 per cent of those from the N-body-based covariance.

SCOPE: SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution - survey description and compact source catalogue	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						surveys; stars: formation; ISM: clouds; submillimetre: ISM	GOULD BELT SURVEY; STAR-FORMATION; MILKY-WAY; CLUMP IDENTIFICATION; COMPLETE SAMPLE; LEGACY SURVEY; SPIRAL ARMS; CLOUD; GAS; ATLASGAL	We present the first release of the data and compact-source catalogue for the JCMT Large Program SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE consists of 850 mu m continuum observations of 1235 Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) made with the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data are at an angular resolution of 14.4 arcsec, significantly improving upon the 353 GHz resolution of Planck at 5 arcmin, and allowing for a catalogue of 3528 compact sources in 558 PGCCs. We find that the detected PGCCs have significant sub-structure, with 61 per cent of detected PGCCs having three or more compact sources, with filamentary structure also prevalent within the sample. A detection rate of 45 per cent is found across the survey, which is 95 per cent complete to Planck column densities of N-H2 > 5 x10(21) cm(-2). By positionally associating the SCOPE compact sources with young stellar objects, the star formation efficiency, as measured by the ratio of luminosity to mass, in nearby clouds is found to be similar to that in the more distant Galactic Plane, with the column density distributions also indistinguishable from each other.

J	Woo, R				Woo, Richard			Naked eye observation of the 2017 total solar eclipse: a more complete understanding of the white-light corona	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Sun: corona; (Sun:) solar wind	MAGNETIC-FIELDS; WIND; IMAGES; SUN	The 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse offered a rare opportunity to scientifically view and capture naked eye observation of the corona. Filling this observational gap has led to a more complete understanding of the white-light corona, because it clarified and reconciled differences in the brightness distributions that are visually observed, imaged (photographed), and measured. Crucial to these new results has been the fortuitous similarity of naked eye observation of the 2017 eclipse to that of 1932. The latter was captured by the unmatched skills of artist-painter Howard Russell Butler in his recently rediscovered painting. Without this remarkable painting, it would not have been possible to either convey confirmation of the illusion or meaningfully explain the role and relevance of naked eye observation to understanding more completely the white-light corona.

The Gaia ultracool dwarf sample - II.

This sample is being used as a training set in the Gaia data processing chain of the ultracool dwarfs work package. We find 695 objects in the optical spectral range M8-T6 with accurate Gaia coordinates, proper motions, and parallaxes which we combine with published spectral types and photometry from large area optical and infrared sky surveys. We find that 100 objects are in 47 multiple systems, of which 27 systems are published and 20 are new. These will be useful benchmark systems and we discuss the requirements to produce a complete catalogue of multiple systems with an ultracool dwarf component. We examine the magnitudes in the Gaia passbands and find that the G(BP) magnitudes are unreliable and should not be used for these objects. We examine progressively redder colour-magnitude diagrams and see a notable increase in the main-sequence scatter and a bivariate main sequence for old and young objects. We provide an absolute magnitude - spectral subtype calibration for G and G(RP) passbands along with linear fits over the range M8-L8 for other passbands.	[Smart, R.

Isotopic Fractionation of Potassium by Diffusion in Methanol	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; COEFFICIENTS; SOLUBILITY; DEPENDENCE; WATER	We present the results of experiments involving the isotopic fractionation by diffusion of K+ cations in methanol at 298 K along with supporting molecular dynamic simulations. The experiments, using glass Rayleigh fractionators filled with a methanol solution of KCI, constrain the ratio of the individual diffusivities of K-41 and K-39 (D-41K/D-39K) in methanol, and so the isotopic fractionation of K+ due to diffusion in methanol, to 0.9995 +/- 0.0001. This isotopic fractionation is 25% of the fractionation resulting from K+ diffusion in water. This is consistent with published molecular dynamics simulations indicating greater hydrodynamic coupling between K+ ions and solvating methanol molecules compared to K+ ions and solvating water molecules.

Response of QIT-MS to Noble Gas Isotopic Ratios in a Simulated Venus Flyby	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						mass spectrometry; isotope ratios; noble gases	LOWER ATMOSPHERE; ATOMIC WEIGHTS; MODEL; ION; VISCOSITY; ELEMENTS; OXYGEN; STATE	The primary objective of the present study is to investigate the science return of future Venus atmosphere probe mission concepts using the Quadrupole Ion Trap (QIT) Mass Spectrometer (MS) Instrument (QIT-MS-I). We demonstrate the use of Monte-Carlo simulations in determining the optimal ion trapping conditions and focus the analysis on retrieving isotope ratios of noble gases in the model sample of the Venus atmosphere. Sampling takes place at a constant velocity of similar to 10 km/s between 112-110 km altitude and involves the use of getter pumps to remove all chemically-active species, retaining inert noble gases. The enriched sample is leaked into passively pumped vacuum chamber where it is analyzed by the QIT-MS sensor (QIT-MS-S) for 40 minutes. The simulated mass spectrum, as recorded by the QIT-MS-S, is deconvoluted using random walk algorithm to reveal relative abundances of noble gas isotopes. The required precision and accuracy of the deconvolution method is benchmarked against the a priori known model composition of the atmospheric sample.

We here analyze the spatial and temporal fluctuations of surface water flows in the floodplain of the Atrato River, Colombia, in order to evaluate their hydrological connectivity. The basin is one of the rainiest areas of the world with wetland ecosystems threatened by the expansion of agriculture and mining activities. We used 16 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radars (DInSAR) phase observations from the ALOS-PALSAR L-band instrument acquired between 2008-2010 to characterize the flow of surface water. We were able to observe water level change in vegetated wetland areas and identify flooding patterns. In the lower basin, flow patterns are conditioned by fluctuations in the levels of the main river channel, whereas in the middle basin, topography and superficial channels strongly influence the flow and connectivity. We found that the variations in water level in a station on the main channel 87 km upstream explained more than 56% of the variations in water level in the floodplain. This result shows that, despite current expansion of agriculture and mining activities, there remain significant hydrological connectivity between wetlands and the Atrato River. This study demonstrates the use of DInSAR for a spatially comprehensive monitoring of the Atrato River basin hydrology. For the first time, we identified the spatiotemporal patterns of surface water flow of the region. We recommend these observations serve as a baseline to monitor the potential impact of ongoing human activities on surface water flows across the Atrato River basin.

A unique mission: Cassini-Huygens, the Orbiter, the descent Probe and the cruise science	RIVISTA DEL NUOVO CIMENTO			English	Article							EARTH SWING-BY; GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; DOPPLER TRACKING; ROTATION PERIOD; GRAVITY-FIELD; PHYSICAL-CHARACTERISTICS; SATURNS MAGNETOSPHERE; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; TITANS STRATOSPHERE; SURFACE	The Cassini-Huygens mission has characterized the Solar System exploration scenario for more than 30 years, from when it was conceived until the completion of its long life. Its legacy is an enormous amount of high quality scientific data and astonishing images of the Saturn system and its moons, Titan first. Also, the mission has been the gymnasium where new technologies and procedures have been discussed, developed and after adopted by many other missions. Cassini-Huygens also played a great role in allowing a new generation of scientists and engineers to increase their knowledge and skills, merging the already matured experience of a generation, formed on previous missions as Voyager, with a new generation belonging to many different countries. The international scenario that allowed the realization of the mission is the other distinguishing character of this adventure, led by the partnership of three space agencies, NASA with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory first, the European Space Agency-ESA for Huygens and the Italian Space Agency-ASI. This cooperative environment allowed both ESA and ASI to enter at best in the environment of the deep-space planetary missions and also provided the opportunity for other 15 nations to have their scientist on board and contributing to the mission. A cooperative effort, well guided and harmonized by the Project Science Group, lasted till the very end of the mission when the Cassini Grand Finale was played with the last plunge into the Saturn atmosphere. Hereafter, the mission is described including some details on the technical aspects of the Cassini spacecraft, the Huygens probe, the science instruments part of their payload and the science results are summarized with a special emphasis on the Italian contribution. This paper focuses on the science results in the cruise phase, where radio science experiments testing different aspects of relativistic gravity were performed. In particular, we describe the use of the novel Cassini radio system (based on Ka band frequencies, 32-34 GHz) to test the space components of the metric in the Solar System and a search of low-frequency gravitational waves, with a set of extensive observations in 2001 and 2002. The Cassini radio signal was tracked just prior to the final plunge into Saturn's atmosphere (15 September 2017) from a new configuration of the Sardinia Radio Telescope called "Sardinia Deep Space Antenna". The Venus and Jupiter fly-bys offered the opportunity to calibrate the VIMS instrument and to carry out new science observations.

This ocean mesoscale turbulence is characterized by cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (with a 100- to 300-km size and depth scales of similar to 500-1,000 m) that capture approximatively 80% of the total kinetic energy and is now known to significantly impact the large-scale ocean circulation, the ocean's carbon storage, the air-sea interactions, and therefore the Earth climate as a whole. However, ocean mesoscale turbulence revealed by satellite observations has properties that differ from those related to classical geostrophic turbulence theories. In the last decade, a large number of theoretical and numerical studies has pointed to submesoscale surface fronts (1-50 km), not resolved by satellite altimeters, as the key suspect explaining these discrepancies. Submesoscale surface fronts have been shown to impact mesoscale eddies and the large-scale ocean circulation in counterintuitive ways, leading in particular to up-gradient fluxes. The ocean engine is now known to involve energetic scale interactions, over a much broader range of scales than expected one decade ago, from 1 to 5,000 km. New space observations with higher spatial resolution are however needed to validate and improve these recent theoretical and numerical results.

Solar Occultation FTIR Spectrometry at Mars for Trace Gas Detection: A Sensitivity Study	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; atmosphere; trace gases; FTIR spectrometer; detection limits	MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; UPPER LIMITS; ACE-FTS; METHANE; SEARCH; SPECTROSCOPY; SO2; PERFORMANCES; NITROGEN; NOMAD	A sensitivity study has been performed to estimate detection limits of various atmospheric trace gases achievable by a Mars-orbiting solar occultation Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. This was accomplished by first computing realistic limb transmittance spectra based on a model (T, P, VMR, and dust profiles) of the Mars atmosphere and adding appropriate noise and systematic errors based on assumed instrument design/configuration/performance. We then performed spectral fits to the resulting synthetic spectra to derive slant column abundances and their uncertainties. A profile retrieval was performed to infer limits of detection. This methodology was applied to a Mars-orbiting FTIR solar occultation spectrometer covering the 850-4,300 cm(-1) spectral region at 0.025-cm(-1) resolution. We conclude that most gases can be retrieved with a single-occultation sensitivity of 20-100 ppt. But this sensitivity varies considerably with the dust loading, especially for gases whose strongest absorption bands are toward higher wavenumbers where scattering is large. We conclude that for CH4, the nu(4) band centered at 1,305 cm(-1), despite being more than 2 times weaker than the nu(3) band centered at 3,015 cm(-1), offers better sensitivity due to its close spectral proximity to the dust extinction minimum. We also conclude that for the purpose of CH4 detection, a high-resolution (0.025 cm(-1)) broadband instrument would have a substantial advantage over a medium-resolution (0.15 cm(-1)) instrument, despite the latter having a much larger signal-to-noise ratio.

J	Sherwood, B; Ponce, A; Waltemathe, M				Sherwood, Brent; Ponce, Adrian; Waltemathe, Michael			Forward Contamination of Ocean Worlds: A Stakeholder Conversation	SPACE POLICY			English	Article						Planetary protection; Forward contamination; Ocean worlds; Microbial biology; COSPAR; Ethics	RISK ANALYSIS; ETHICS	A fundamental requirement for space missions designed to touch "potential habitats" is the single number 10(-4), the allowable probability of a single Earth organism contaminating the potential habitat. Many aspects of a mission that affect its complexity and cost hardware design and manufacture, assembly and test, and mission operations are driven by this value; therefore, it is important, on the threshold of an era of exploring ocean worlds, to have confidence in it Yet, despite its long pedigree and occasional reviews, we find that the current requirement lacks programmatically defensible justification. At issue are three weaknesses: (1) microbial biology, in particular the science of extremophiles, is a rapidly changing field; (2) forward contamination (FC) is both a scientific and an ethical issue, yet no ethics-based conversation is apparent within policy-setting circles; and (3) because of these 2 factors, policy-setting cannot be static. We review the history of the requirement, how the evolving understanding of biology could drive it up or down, how the FC hazard relates to risk-management practice and to the ethics profession, and how a contemporary stakeholder conversation could adapt lessons already learned by other fields.

Thermophysical Properties of the North Polar Residual Cap using Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; polar; ice; climate; thermophysics; accumulation	LAYERED DEPOSITS; WATER-ICE; FIRN DENSIFICATION; SUMMER; STRATIGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; AGE; TEMPERATURE; INERTIA; HISTORY	Using derived temperatures from thermal-infrared instruments aboard orbiting spacecraft, we constrain the thermophysical properties, in the upper few meters, of the north polar residual cap of Mars. In line with previous authors we test a homogeneous thermal model (i.e., depth-independent thermal properties), simulating water ice of varying porosity against observed temperatures. We find that high thermal inertia (>1,000Jm(-2)K(-1)s(1/2) or <40% porosity) provides the best fit for most of the residual cap. Additionally, we test the observed data against models with depth-dependent thermal properties. Models tested converge on similar solutions: we find extensive regions of low surface thermal inertia consistent with a porous layer at the surface (>40% porosity) that densifies with depth into a zero-porosity ice layer at shallow depths (<0.5m). We interpret this as evidence of recent water ice accumulation. Our results along the edge of the residual cap imply that denser (<40% porosity) ice is present at the surface and coincides with lower albedo. These results suggest that older ice is undergoing exhumation along much of the residual cap margin. The results support recent water ice accumulation having occurred over specific regions, while ablation dominates in others. Plain Language Summary The polar regions of Mars host kilometer-thick stacks of water ice that have been built up over millions of years. At the north pole today, the top of this ice deposit is interacting with the Martian atmosphere. Whether or not ice at the surface is fluffy (like snow) or dense (like an ice slab) can provide useful information about the polar ice cap and recent climate. Multiple years of surface temperature measurements have been acquired by instruments aboard spacecraft in orbit around Mars. By comparing these values with temperature simulations, we can narrow down the type of ice near the surface. Our results show that the type of ice varies across the polar cap. Some regions appear to be a snow-like surface where the polar cap may be growing. Other regions, most notably along the edge of the polar cap, show denser ice that is likely older. The nature of the ice tells us about the current climate and how these kilometer-thick ice deposits form.

Distributions of the average and variable components of FAC and electric field are the main focuses of this study, where the FAC variability is represented by the standard deviation of FAC in each magnetic latitude/magnetic local time bin and electric field variability is represented by the square root of the sum of squares of standard deviations of magnetic eastward and equatorward components of the electric field. We found that the mean patterns of the FAC and electric field are mainly contributed by the large-scale (wavelength: >= 500 km) FAC and electric field. Unlike the average, in addition to the large scale, variabilities of FAC and electric field are not negligible on mesoscale (wavelength: 100-500 km) and small scale (wavelength: 8-100 km), while the FAC variability shows a different scale dependence from the electric field variability. Specifically, for decreasing scale sizes, the FAC variability increases while the electric field variability decreases, suggesting that the strong FACs on small scale and mesoscale do not necessarily correspond to strong ionospheric electric fields on those scales. Further, FAC variabilities on large scale and mesoscale are included into the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) and the corresponding impacts on Joule heating have been assessed. It was found that, for the conditions studied here, the large-scale FAC variability may significantly increase the Joule heating (similar to 160% globally) and that the enhancement due to the mesoscale FAC variability is not negligible (similar to 36% globally).

Airborne laser scanning data can be used to characterize these individual crowns, but analytical tools developed for boreal or temperate forests may require to be adjusted before they can be applied to tropical environments. Therefore, we compared results from six different segmentation methods applied to six plots (39 ha) from a study site in French Guiana. We measured the overlap of automatically segmented crowns projection with selected crowns manually delineated on high-resolution photography. We also evaluated the goodness of fit following automatic matching with field inventory data using a model linking tree diameter to tree crown width. The different methods tested in this benchmark segmented highly different numbers of crowns having different characteristics. Segmentation methods based on the point cloud (AMS3D and Graph-Cut) globally outperformed methods based on the Canopy Height Models, especially for small crowns; the AMS3D method outperformed the other methods tested for the overlap analysis, and AMS3D and Graph-Cut performed the best for the automatic matching validation. Nevertheless, other methods based on the Canopy Height Model performed better for very large emergent crowns. The dense foliage of tropical moist forests prevents sufficient point densities in the understory to segment subcanopy trees accurately, regardless of the segmentation method.

We find that the L-band cross-polarized backscatter is far more sensitive to wind speed at extreme winds than the co-polarized backscatter and it is essential to observations of extreme winds with L-band SAR. We introduce a cyclone wind speed retrieval algorithm and apply it to the limited SMAP SAR dataset of cyclones. We show that the SMAP SAR instrument is capable of measuring extreme winds up to the category 5 (70 m/s) wind speed regime providing unique capabilities as compared to traditional scatterometers with C and Ku-band radars.

Classifying Inundation in a Tropical Wetlands Complex with GNSS-R	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GNSS bistatic radar; wetlands; inundation; monitoring; classification	SURFACE-WATER; VEGETATION; SCATTERING; SIGNALS; METHANE; CANOPY; OCEAN	The use of global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) measurements for classification of inundated wetlands is presented. With the launch of NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission, space-borne GNSS-R measurements have become available over ocean and land. CYGNSS covers latitudes between +/- 38 degrees, providing measurements over tropical ecosystems and benefiting new studies of wetland inundation dynamics. The GNSS-R signal over inundated wetlands is driven mainly by coherent scattering associated with the presence of surface water, producing strong forward scattering and a distinctive bistatic scattering signature. This paper presents a methodology used to classify inundation in tropical wetlands using observables derived from GNSS-R measurements and ancillary data. The methodology employs a multiple decision tree randomized (MDTR) algorithm for classification and wetland inundation maps derived from the phased-array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR-2) as reference for training and validation. The development of an innovative GNSS-R wetland classification methodology is aimed to advance mapping of global wetland distribution and dynamics, which is critical for improved estimates of natural methane production. The results obtained in this manuscript demonstrate the ability of GNSS-R signals to detect inundation under dense vegetation over the Pacaya-Samiria Natural Reserve, a tropical wetland complex located in the Peruvian Amazon. Classification results report an accuracy of 69% for regions of inundated vegetation, 87% for open water regions, and 99% for non-inundated areas. Misclassification of inundated vegetation, primarily as non-inundated area, is likely related to the combination of two factors: partial inundation within the GNSS-R scattering area, and signal attenuation from dense overstory vegetation, resulting in a low signal.

The flooded area is mapped using the radar backscattering difference between Sentinel-1A/B satellite acquisitions spanning the event, which provides a snapshot of standing water at the time of image acquisition. We find vast areas outside of designated flood hazard zones are overwhelmed. Furthermore, we map pre-cyclone land subsidence using multitemporal interferometric processing of large SAR datasets acquired by Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A/B satellites. We find that subsidence of up to 49 mm/yr and 34 mm/yr during the ALOS (Jul-2007-Jan-2011) and Sentinel-1A/B (Dec-2015 to Aug-2017) acquisition periods affect various parts of Houston-Galveston area. We conclude that 85% of the flooded area subsided at a rate > 5 mm/yr.

Estimates of this covariation can be used beneficially to downscale coarse-resolution brightness temperatures with high-resolution backscatter for enhanced-resolution Earth observations. In this study, a forward model of covariation for vegetated soil is derived by combining two well-established models of active and passive microwave interactions. The covariation model is inverted to obtain a single-pass observation-driven estimation of active-passive microwave covariation (beta) based on multi-channel radiometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes. A key feature of the estimation approach is that it is applicable to co-located spatial data scenes and does not rely on temporal information. We present applications of the estimation with combinations of SMAP (L-band) radiometry and both SMAP (L-band) and multi-angular Sentinel-1 (C-band) backscatter data. We first show that for the period of available SMAP L-band radiometer and radar data, the estimation approach for beta, introduced in this study, yields similar results as the statistical time-series approach originally designed for SMAP. The new single-pass approach also allows estimation of active-passive covariation where the statistical approach cannot be applied because dynamic range of brightness temperature and backscatter are too limited to allow regression. We then apply the developed estimation method to SMAP L-band radiometer and multi-angular Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data. Here, the study quantifies the effects of microwave frequency and look-angles on the covariation by applying the estimation globally and analyzing the results as a function of vegetation cover - a key determinant of the strength of the covariation.

Improving Satellite-Based Subhourly Surface Rain Estimates Using Vertical Rain Profile Information	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Precipitation; Rainfall; Remote sensing; Satellite observations	BRIGHT BAND; PRECIPITATION; ALGORITHM; GRADIENT; CLOUD; DENSE	Quantifying time-averaged rain rate, or rain accumulation, on subhourly time scales is essential for various application studies requiring rain estimates. This study proposes a novel idea to estimate subhourly time-averaged surface rain rate based on the instantaneous vertical rain profile observed from low-Earth-orbiting satellites. Instantaneous rain estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) are compared with 1-min surface rain gauges in North America and Kwajalein atoll for the warm seasons of 2005-14. Time-lagged correlation analysis between PR rain rates at various height levels and surface rain gauge data shows that the peak of the correlations tends to be delayed for PR rain at higher levels up to around 6-km altitude. PR estimates for low to middle height levels have better correlations with time-delayed surface gauge data than the PR's estimated surface rain rate product. This implies that rain estimates for lower to middle heights may have skill to estimate the eventual surface rain rate that occurs 1-30 min later. Therefore, in this study, the vertical profiles of TRMM PR instantaneous rain estimates are averaged between the surface and various heights above the surface to represent time-averaged surface rain rate. It was shown that vertically averaged PR estimates up to middle heights (4.5 km) exhibit better skill, compared to the PR estimated instantaneous surface rain product, to represent subhourly (30 min) time-averaged surface rain rate. These findings highlight the merit of additional consideration of vertical rain profiles, not only instantaneous surface rain rate, to improve subhourly surface estimates of satellite-based rain products.

Although a variety of data fusion methods have been proposed to merge different LE products for more reliable estimates, most of them have ignored the spatiotemporal consistency of LE products across different resolutions. In this paper, we apply the multiresolution tree (MRT) method to improve the accuracy and reduce the inconsistency between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LE (MOD16) product and the Landsat-based LE product at different resolutions. Eddy covariance (EC) ground measurements at five sites, MODIS and Landsat images from January 2005 to December 2005 in the north central USA, are used to evaluate the performance of the MRT method. The results show that the MRT method can improve the accuracy of the original LE products (MOD16 and Landsat), and it has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty and inconsistency of these products. The bias decreased by 38.3% on average, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased by approximately 49.2% after the MRT was applied at each scale. Further studies are still required to make the MRT method more universal on a variety of land cover types for long-time periods.

Utilizing combined deviations of precipitation and GRACE-based terrestrial water storage as a metric for drought characterization: A case study over major Indian river basins	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Drought; River basins; GRACE; Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI); Trend analysis; EOF analysis	CONTINENTAL UNITED-STATES; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; RECONCILED ESTIMATE; SUMMER MONSOON; SEVERITY INDEX; VARIABILITY; DATASET; LEVEL; VEGETATION	Drought is a recurring natural hazard that significantly affects the economy and environment of large areas worldwide. It is therefore imperative to develop techniques that enable comprehensive monitoring and assessment of drought. Here we propose a novel drought index (Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI)) that encompasses all the aspects of meteorologic, agricultural, hydrologic and human-induced drought occurrences. Critical to the proposed framework is the concept of combining deviations in precipitation and terrestrial water storage, observed by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, from climatologic (normal) conditions as a measure of drought. In order to evaluate the applicability of this new index, it is analyzed over four major river basins in India (i.e. Ganga, Krishna, Godavari and Mahanadi). The propounded drought index (CCDI) has demonstrated its ability to identify drought events and render rational quantification of its severity. Results also depict an improved understanding of holistic drought conditions compared to other available drought indices. Comparison of CCDI with commonly used drought indices highlighted some of the fundamental differences while demonstrating good correspondence with PDSI (r = 0.79) and GRACE DSI (r = 0.94). Further, it is evident that in almost all the river basins there have been at least two drought periods with intensities ranging from D1 (moderate drought) to D4 (exceptional drought). The longest drought period, extending for 36 months, from July 2002 to June 2005, is observed in the Krishna Basin. Results from this study show appreciable reliance on the potential for quantifying droughts using CCDI, which will only improve with better quantification and extended availability of terrestrial water storage observations from the recently launched GRACE-Follow On mission.

These instruments typically make use of vector vortex phase masks, and at short near-infrared wavelengths, the phase masks tend to be spatially variant liquid-crystal-polymer-based diffractive waveplates. Optical vortex coronagraphs also hold great promise as a potential means of imaging terrestrial exoplanets in nearby solar systems with space-based telescopes, for which nearly ideal vortex phase masks will be needed. Here, we briefly summarize the optical vortex coronagraph, foreseen performance requirements for terrestrial exoplanet imaging detection, the obstacles to nearly ideal diffractive-waveplate-based vortex phase masks, and recent broadband performance demonstrations.

Cosmogenic radionuclide production modeling with Geant4: Experimental benchmarking and application to nuclear spectroscopy of asteroid (16) Psyche	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Gamma-ray spectroscopy; Geant4; Cosmogenic radionuclides; Activation; Asteroid; Planetary gamma-ray spectroscopy	SOLAR MODULATION; IRON-METEORITE; CROSS-SECTIONS; NUCLIDES; METEOROIDS; SURFACE; RECORD	Measurements of gamma-ray emissions from the decay of cosmogenic radionuclides provide an opportunity to characterize the elemental composition of a terrestrial planet or asteroid surface. We report on the development of a Geant4 application which models cosmogenic radionuclide production on metal-rich surfaces. The model was benchmarked using measurements of radionuclides produced during 1 GeV proton irradiation of a target made from the Campo del Cielo iron meteorite. The gamma-ray emitting radionuclides Co-58, Co-57, Co-56, Mn-54, Mn-52, Cr-51, V-48, Sc-46 and Na-22 were observed following the irradiation. Our model reproduced the measured radionuclide production rates to within a factor of 2.5 or better. All but two of the elements (Mn-54, Sc-46) have a perfect model-to-data match within their measurement uncertainties. The benchmarked model was used to predict cosmogenic radionuclide production on a large (similar to 100-km radius) metal-rich asteroid. The results are relevant for planned gamma-ray measurements of the metallic asteroid (16) Psyche, which will be visited by the Psyche spacecraft in 2026. We found that galactic-proton-induced radionuclide decay is unlikely to be observed by the Psyche Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS), however an intense solar proton event ( > 2 x 10(6) protons cm(-2) over < 5 days) will produce measurable quantities of radioisotopes. Measurements of these radioisotopes could provide an independent method of determining the Ni-to-Fe ratio of materials at Psyche's surface. Such an analysis will require the use of radionuclide production cross sections to convert GRS-measured cosmogenic radionuclide decay rates to elemental composition information with the similar to 10% precision required for planetary geochemical studies.

I. Experimental demonstration in monochromatic light	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article								Vortex fiber nulling is a method for spectroscopically characterizing exoplanets at small angular separations, less than or similar to lambda/D, from their host star. The starlight is suppressed by creating an optical vortex in the system point spread function, which prevents the stellar field from coupling into the fundamental mode of a single-mode optical fiber. Light from the planet, on the other hand, couples into the fiber and is routed to a spectrograph. Using a prototype vortex fiber nuller (VFN) designed for monochromatic light, we demonstrate coupling fractions of 6 x 10(-5) and > 0.1 for the star and planet, respectively.

DES Collaboration	Cosmological Constraints from Multiple Probes in the Dark Energy Survey	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; SDSS; SUPERNOVA; GALAXIES; DES; BAO	The combination of multiple observational probes has long been advocated as a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, in particular dark energy. The Dark Energy Survey has measured 207 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernova light curves, the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clustering. Here we present combined results from these probes, deriving constraints on the equation of state, w, of dark energy and its energy density in the Universe. Independently of other experiments, such as those that measure the cosmic microwave background, the probes from this single photometric survey rule out a Universe with no dark energy, finding w = -0.80(-0.11)(+0.09). The geometry is shown to be consistent with a spatially flat Universe, and we obtain a constraint on the baryon density of Omega(b) = 0.069(-0.012)(+0.009) that is independent of early Universe measurements. These results demonstrate the potential power of large multiprobe photometric surveys and pave the way for order of magnitude advances in our constraints on properties of dark energy and cosmology over the next decade.

Earth Observation Imaging Spectroscopy for Terrestrial Systems: An Overview of Its History, Techniques, and Applications of Its Missions	SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Exploring the Earth's Ecosystems on a Global Scale - Requirements, Capabilities and Directions in Space borne Imaging Spectroscopy	NOV 21-25, 2016	Int Space Sci Inst, Bern, SWITZERLAND		Int Space Sci Inst	Earth observation; Satellite remote sensing; Imaging spectroscopy; Terrestrial ecosystems	CANOPY WATER-CONTENT; HYPERSPECTRAL SENSOR; FUNCTIONAL TYPES; AIRBORNE; SPECTROMETER; VEGETATION; FIRE; HYPERION; INDEX; LEAF	Imaging spectroscopy in the visible-to-shortwave infrared wavelength range (VSWIR), or nowadays more commonly known as hyperspectral imaging', for terrestrial Earth Observation remote sensing, dates back to the early 1980s when its development started with mainly airborne demonstrations. From its initial use as a research tool, imaging spectroscopy encompassing the VSWIR spectral range has gradually evolved towards operational and commercial applications. Today, it is one of the fastest growing research areas in remote sensing owing to its diagnostic power by means of discrete spectral bands that are contiguously sampled over the spectral range with which a target is observed. The main principles of imaging spectroscopy rely on the exploitation of light dispersion technologies to split the incoming light through a telescope before being projected onto detector arrays. The light dispersion can be achieved by using prism or diffractive grating optical systems, perpetually aiming for improved performances in terms of efficiency, straylight rejection, and polarization sensitivity. The sensor technique has been first used in airborne imaging spectroscopy since the early 1980s and later in spaceborne hyperspectral missions from the end of the 1990s onwards. Currently, several hyperspectral spaceborne systems are under development and in preparation to be launched within the next few years. Through hyperspectral remote sensing, physical, chemical, and biological components of the observed matter can be separated and resolved thus providing a spectral fingerprint'. The analyses of the spectral absorptions often give rise to quantitative retrievals of components of the observed target. The derived information is vital for the generation of a wide variety of new quantitative products and services in the domain of agriculture, food security, raw materials, soils, biodiversity, environmental degradation and hazards, inland and coastal waters, snow hydrology and forestry. Many of these are relevant to various international policies and conventions. Originally developed as a powerful detection and analysis tool for applications predominantly related to planetary exploration and non-renewable resources, imaging spectroscopy now covers many disciplines in atmospheric, terrestrial vegetation, cryosphere, and marine research and application fields. There is an increasing number of visible/near-infrared (VNIR) imaging spectrometers emerging also as small payloads on small satellites and cubesats, built and launched by small-medium enterprises. These are targeted to address commercial applications mainly in agriculture, resources and environmental management, and hazard observations. [GRAPHICS] .

This spectral range is also influenced by atmospheric effects including absorption from atmospheric gases and aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, and particle scattering. Globally consistent surface measurements must compensate for these atmospheric effects. This article reviews the physical and mathematical foundations of modern VSWIR atmospheric retrieval, focusing on imaging spectrometers. We assess sensitivity of the retrieval to errors in atmospheric state estimation. Finally, we describe some promising avenues of future research to support the next generation of orbital imaging spectrometers.

Diagnostic data to inform decision-making are critical for hazard management whether for emergency response, routine monitoring or assessments of potential risks. Imaging spectroscopy (IS) has unique contributions to make via the ability to provide some key quantitative diagnostic information. In this paper, we examine a selection of key case histories representing the state of the art to gain an insight into the achievements and perspectives in the use of visible to shortwave infrared IS for the detection, assessment and monitoring of a selection of significant natural and anthropogenic hazards. The selected key case studies examined provide compelling evidence for the use of theIS technology and its ability to contribute diagnostic information currently unattainable from operational spaceborne Earth observation systems. User requirements for the applications were also evaluated. The evaluation showed that the projected launch of spaceborne IS sensors in the near-, mid and longterm future, together with the increasing availability, quality and moderate cost of offtheshelf sensors, the possibilities to couple unmanned autonomous systems with miniaturized sensors, should be able to meet these requirements. The challenges and opportunities for the scientific community in the future when such data become available will then be ensuring consistency between data from different sensors, developing techniques to efficiently handle, process, integrate and deliver the large volumes of data, and most importantly translating the data to information that meets specific needs of the user community in a form that can be digested/understood by them. The latter is especially important to transforming the technology from a scientific to an operational tool. Additionally, the information must be independently validated using current trusted practices and uncertainties quantified before ISderived measurement can be integrated into operational monitoring services.

The effect was identified with the data from the E and B Experiment, which was a balloon-borne instrument designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as that from Galactic dust. The data show polarization fractions larger than 10%, while less than 3% were expected from instrumental polarization. We give evidence that the excess polarization is due to detector nonlinearity in the presence of a continuously rotating HWP. The nonlinearity couples intensity signals to polarization. We develop a map-based method to remove the excess polarization. Applying this method to the 150 (250) GHz band data, we find that 81% (92%) of the excess polarization was removed. Characterization and mitigation of this effect are important for future experiments aiming to measure the CMB B-modes with a continuously rotating HWP.

The dense and continuous coverage with the high-quality photometry data from ground-based observations combined with the space-based Spitzer observations of this long timescale event enables us to uniquely determine the masses M-1 = 0.40 +/- 0.05 M-circle dot and M-2 = 0.13 +/- 0.01 M-circle dot of the individual lens components. Because the lens-source relative parallax and the vector lens-source relative proper motion are unambiguously determined, we can likewise unambiguously predict the astrometric offset between the light centroid of the magnified images (as observed by the Gaia satellite) and the true position of the source.

We decompose the IR-to-radio spectral energy distribution (SED), sampled in 51 bands, using (i) a model comprised of two-temperature modified blackbodies and radio power laws and (ii) a semi-analytic model, which also accounts for emission from a clumpy torus. The latter is more realistic but requires a well-sampled SED, which is possible here. In the former model, we find temperatures of T-d(warm)= 296(-15)(+17) K and T-d(cold)= 110(-3)(+3) K for the warm and cold dust components, respectively. This model suggests that the cold dust component dominates the far-infrared (FIR) energy budget (66%) but contributes only 17% to the total IR luminosity. Based on the torus models, we infer an inclination angle of i = 15(-8)(+8 degrees) and the presence of silicate emission, in accordance with the Type-1 active galactic nucleus nature of APM 08279+5255. Accounting for the torus' contribution to the FIR luminosity, we find a lensing-corrected star formation rate of SFR = 3075 x (4/mu(L)) M-circle dot yr(-1). We find that the central quasar contributes 30% to the FIR luminosity but dominates the total IR luminosity (93%). The 30% correction is in contrast to the 90% reported in previous work. In addition, the IR luminosity inferred from the torus model is a factor of two higher. These differences highlight the importance of adopting physically motivated models to properly account for IR emission in high-z quasars, which is now possible with SOFIA/HAWC+.	[Leung, T. K.

This work is aimed at revealing the magnetic field morphology within a core-scale (less than or similar to 1.0 pc) hub-filament structure (HFS) located at the end of a parsec-scale filament. To investigate whether the observed polarization traces the magnetic field in the HFS, we analyze the dependence between the observed polarization fraction and total intensity using a Bayesian approach with the polarization fraction described by the Rice likelihood function, which can correctly describe the probability density function of the observed polarization fraction for low signal-to-noise ratio data. We find a power-law dependence between the polarization fraction and total intensity with an index of 0.56 in A(v) similar to 20-300 mag regions, suggesting that the dust grains in these dense regions can still be aligned with magnetic fields in the IC 5146 regions. Our polarization maps reveal a curved magnetic field, possibly dragged by the contraction along the parsec-scale filament. We further obtain a magnetic field strength of 0.5 +/- 0.2 mG toward the central hub using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, corresponding to a mass-to-flux criticality of similar to 1.3 +/- 0.4 and an Alfvenic Mach number of <0.6. These results suggest that gravity and magnetic field are currently of comparable importance in the HFS and that turbulence is less important.

This study investigates the interactions between aerosols and ice clouds by incorporating the latest ice clouds parameterization in an atmospheric general circulation model. The simulation shows a decrease in effective ice cloud crystal size corresponding to aerosol increase, referred to as the aerosol first indirect effect, which has not been comprehensively studied. Ice clouds with smaller particles reflect more shortwave radiation and absorb more infrared radiation, resulting in radiation change by 0.5-1.0W/m(2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The TOA radiation field is also influenced by cloud cover change due to aerosol-induced circulation change. Such aerosol effects on precipitation highly depend on the existence of a deep convection system: interactions between aerosols and ice clouds create dipole precipitation anomalies in the Asian monsoon regions; while in West Africa, enhanced convections are constrained by anticyclone effects at high levels and little precipitation increase is found. We also conduct an experiment to assess interactions between aerosols and liquid clouds and compare the climatic effects with that due to ice clouds. Radiation and temperature changes generated by liquid clouds are normally 1-2 times larger than those generated by ice clouds. The radiation change has a closer relationship to liquid cloud droplet size than liquid cloud cover, in contrast with what we find for ice clouds.

It captures spontaneous emission from thermally populated pure rotational states for investigating Earth/planetary atmosphere and interstellar media. Recent missions such as the heterodyne instrument for far-infrared, the microwave limb sounder, and the microwave instrument for Rosetta orbiter highlighted the wealth of scientific knowledge that can be attained by utilizing heterodyne-spectrometers. However, major challenges still remain in mission cost, instrument size, weight, and power (SWaP). Highly integrated CMOS circuits are designed to prototype a low-cost/SWaP spectrometer system and conduct challenging science missions. Within the prototype system, a 183-GHz receiver with a frequency synthesizer is designed in the 28-nm CMOS, and a back-end 6-GS/s 4096-point spectrometer processor is designed in the 65-nm CMOS. The receiver's center frequency is tunable from 180 to 200 GHz. An external InP low-noise amplifier is added at the front-end to provide the required receiver sensitivity. The demonstrated 28-nm CMOS receiver and 65-nm CMOS spectrometer consume 515 mW under 1.5/1.15-V and 1500 mW under 1 V supply, respectively. The complete system achieves 700 to 1000 K noise temperature within the interested bandwidth and RMS uncertainty improvement up to 10 s integration according to the Allan deviation measurements. The spectrometer's capability in detecting gas phase molecular compounds is verified with laboratory trials employing water (H2O) and methyl-cyanide (CH3CN).

J	Wang, JB; Fu, LL				Wang, Jinbo; Fu, Lee-Lueng			On the Long-Wavelength Validation of the SWOT KaRIn Measurement	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Altimetry; Satellite observations; Surface observations	SEA-SURFACE HEIGHT; WATER; TRANSITION; ALTIMETER; MESOSCALE	The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will measure the sea surface height (SSH) using a Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIn) over a swath off the nadir of the satellite tracks. The mission requires calibration and validation (CalVal) of the SSH wavenumber spectrum at wavelengths between 15 and 1000 km. The CalVal in the short-wavelength range (15-150 km) requires in situ observations. In the long-wavelength range (150-1000 km), the CalVal will use the onboard Jason-class nadir altimeter. Using a high-resolution global ocean simulation, this study identifies the spatial scales beyond which the nadir and off-nadir observations can be considered comparable. Our results suggest that the ocean signals at nadir can represent off-nadir ocean signals at wavelengths longer than 120 and 70 km along the midswath and the inner edge of the KaRIn grid, respectively, indicating that the nadir altimeter is able to fulfill its goal to validate the long-wavelength KaRIn measurement. The wavelength along the inner edge is limited around 70 km because the onboard nadir altimeter cannot resolve spatial scales longer than similar to 70 km. These wavelengths provide a reference point for the required spatial coverage of the SWOT SSH in situ CalVal.

J	Morales, A; Posselt, DJ; Morrison, H; He, F				Morales, Annareli; Posselt, Derek J.; Morrison, Hugh; He, Fei			Assessing the Influence of Microphysical and Environmental Parameter Perturbations on Orographic Precipitation	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article							CHANGING AMBIENT CONDITIONS; 2001 IMPROVE-2 EVENT; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PART II; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; PACIFIC-OCEAN; NEUTRAL FLOW; MODEL; MOIST	Microphysical (MP) schemes contain parameters whose values can impact the amount and location of forecasted precipitation, and sensitivity is typically explored by perturbing one parameter at a time while holding the rest constant. Although much can be learned from these "one-at-a-time" studies, the results are limited as these methods do not allow for nonlinear interactions of multiple perturbed parameters. This study applies the Morris one-at-a-time (MOAT) method, a robust statistical tool allowing for simultaneous perturbation of numerous parameters, to explore orographic precipitation sensitivity to changes in microphysical and environmental parameters within an environment characteristic of an atmospheric river. Results show parameters associated with snow fall speed coefficient A(s) and density rho(s), ice-cloud water collection efficiency (ECI), rain accretion (WRA), relative humidity, zonal wind speed, and surface potential temperature cause the largest influence on simulated precipitation. MP and environmental parameter perturbations can cause precipitation changes of similar magnitude, but results vary by location on the mountain. Different environments are also tested, with A(s) being the most influential MP parameter regardless of environment. Fewer MP parameters influence precipitation in a faster-wind-speed environment, possibly due to the stronger dynamical forcing upwind and different wave dynamics downwind, compared to a slower-wind-speed environment. Finally, perturbing MP parameters within a single scheme can result in precipitation variations of similar magnitude compared to using entirely different microphysics schemes. MOAT results presented in this study have implications for Bayesian parameter estimation methods and stochastic parameterization within ensemble forecasting.

Thanks to its large aperture size and broad wavelength coverage, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to enable a detailed investigation of exoplanet atmospheres, which could provide important constraints on the atmospheric composition obscured by clouds/haze. Here, we use four warm (less than or similar to 1000 K) planets suitable for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy, GJ 1214b, GJ 436b, HD 97658b, and Kepler-51b, as examples to explore molecular absorption features detectable by JWST even in the existence of hydrocarbon haze in the atmospheres. We simulate photochemistry, the growth of hydrocarbon haze particles, and transmission spectra for the atmospheres of these four planets. We find that among the planetary parameters considered, super-Earths with hazy, relatively hydrogenrich atmospheres are mostly expected to produce detectable molecular absorption features such as a quite prominent CH4 feature at 3.3 mu m, even for the extreme case of the most efficient production of photochemical haze. For a planet that has extremely low gravity, such as Kepler-51b, haze particles grow significantly large in the upper atmosphere due to the small sedimentation velocity, resulting in the featureless or flat transmission spectrum in a wide wavelength range. This investigation shows that, in most cases, the transmission spectra with muted features measured by Hubble Space Telescope do not preclude strong features at the longer wavelengths accessible by JWST.

DES Collaboration; LIGO Sci Collaboration; Virgo Collaboration	First Measurement of the Hubble Constant from a Dark Standard Siren using the Dark Energy Survey Galaxies and the LIGO/Virgo Binary-Black-hole Merger GW170814	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						catalogs; cosmology: observations; gravitational waves; surveys	STELLAR MASS; RESOLUTION; CATALOG	We present a multi-messenger measurement of the Hubble constant H-0 using the binary-black-hole merger GW170814 as a standard siren, combined with a photometric redshift catalog from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The luminosity distance is obtained from the gravitational wave signal detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) on 2017 August 14, and the redshift information is provided by the DES Year 3 data. Black hole mergers such as GW170814 are expected to lack bright electromagnetic emission to uniquely identify their host galaxies and build an object-by-object Hubble diagram. However, they are suitable for a statistical measurement, provided that a galaxy catalog of adequate depth and redshift completion is available. Here we present the first Hubble parameter measurement using a black hole merger. Our analysis results in H-0 = 75(-32)(+40) km s(-1) Mpc(-1) , which is consistent with both SN Ia and cosmic microwave background measurements of the Hubble constant. The quoted 68% credible region comprises 60% of the uniform prior range [20, 140] km s(-1) Mpc(-1) , and it depends on the assumed prior range. If we take a broader prior of [10, 220] km s(-1) Mpc(-1) , we find H-0 = 78(-24)(+96) km s(-1) Mpc(-1) (57% of the prior range). Although a weak constraint on the Hubble constant from a single event is expected using the dark siren method, a multifold increase in the LVC event rate is anticipated in the coming years and combinations of many sirens will lead to improved constraints on H-0.

LSST Dark Energy Sci Collaboration	Core Cosmology Library: Precision Cosmological Predictions for LSST	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						cosmology: theory; dark energy; large-scale structure of universe	MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; HALO MASS FUNCTION; LARGE-SCALE BIAS; COSMIC SHEAR; ANALYTIC MODEL; BACKGROUND ANISOTROPIES; PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; BARYONIC FEEDBACK; JOINT ANALYSIS; NEUTRINO MASS	The Core Cosmology Library (CCL) provides routines to compute basic cosmological observables to a high degree of accuracy, which have been verified with an extensive suite of validation tests. Predictions are provided for many cosmological quantities, including distances, angular power spectra, correlation functions, halo bias, and the halo mass function through state-of-the-art modeling prescriptions available in the literature. Fiducial specifications for the expected galaxy distributions for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are also included, together with the capability of computing redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. A rigorous validation procedure, based on comparisons between CCL and independent software packages, allows us to establish a well-defined numerical accuracy for each predicted quantity. As a result, predictions for correlation functions of galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear are demonstrated to be within a fraction of the expected statistical uncertainty of the observables for the models and in the range of scales of interest to LSST. CCL is an open source software package written in C, with a Python interface and publicly available at. https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. Weshow here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.

A penalty method is suggested for path inequality constraints and used to enforce a minimum radius constraint. Time variable formulations are presented for the flight time and a moving target. The latter is used to access all points along a desired periodic orbit as valid terminal states. Multiphase differential dynamic programming is applied to discontinuous initial guesses that combine segments of different periodic orbits. Numerical examples include multirevolution transfers between distant retrograde orbits, a heteroclinic transfer between planar Lyapunov orbits, and transfers between L1 and L2 halo orbits in the Earth-moon circular restricted three-body problem.

J	Matsuka, K; Scharf, D; Filipe, N; Seubert, C; Bayard, D				Matsuka, Kai; Scharf, Daniel; Filipe, Nuno; Seubert, Carl; Bayard, David			Relative Sensing, Control Precision, and Mission Delta-V Trade-Offs for Precision Formation Flying in Planetary Orbit	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							NAVIGATION; GUIDANCE; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	As control precision for Earth-orbiting formations increases, the required Delta V can quickly become infeasible. Missions have demonstrated approximately 5 m/s/yr for 10-m control (TanDEM-X), but that quickly grows to approximately 90 m/s/yr for 1.5-m control (CanX-4/5). Previous research has shown that formation reference trajectories must use high-fidelity relative orbital dynamics; otherwise, Delta V is spent rejecting modeling errors. However, even with a perfect reference trajectory, feeding back relative state estimation errors can drive Delta V. This paper presents a linear time-invariant analysis approach that quantifies the three-way trade-off between mission Delta V, control precision, and estimation error for approximately circular orbits and verifies the approach through high-fidelity simulations, including tracking an ideal reference trajectory that eliminates the Delta V cost of modeling errors. Because Linear Quadratic Regulator control is used, the resulting Delta V can be considered a lower bound on the required Delta V, assuming linear control and quadratic cost. Using reference trajectories based on simplified dynamics, such as without differential J2, would only increase Delta V. Using this analysis approach, for example, the minimum required capability of a relative sensing and estimation system could be determined given a mission concept's Delta V capability and control requirements for science.

DES Collaborations; SPT Collaborations	Weak-lensing analysis of SPT-selected galaxy clusters using Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations	MATTER HALO CONCENTRATIONS; X-RAY; SCALING RELATIONS; SHAPE MEASUREMENT; MASS CALIBRATION; CONSTRAINTS; EVOLUTION; MODEL; COSMOLOGY; IMPACT	We present weak-lensing (WL) mass constraints for a sample of massive galaxy clusters detected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). We use griz imaging data obtained from the Science Verification (SV) phase of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to fit the WL shear signal of 33 clusters in the redshift range 0.25 <= z <= 0.8 with NFW profiles and to constrain a four-parameter SPT mass-observable relation. To account for biases in WL masses, we introduce a WL mass to true mass scaling relation described by a mean bias and an intrinsic, lognormal scatter. We allow for correlated scatter within the WL and SZE mass-observable relations and use simulations to constrain priors on nuisance parameters related to bias and scatter from WL. We constrain the normalization of the zeta-M-500 relation, A(SZ) = 12.0(-6.7)(+2.6) when using a prior on the mass slope B-SZ from the latest SPT cluster cosmology analysis. Without this prior, we recover A(SZ) = 10.8(-5.2)(+2.3) and B-SZ = 1.30(-0.44)(+0.22). Results in both cases imply lower cluster masses than measured in previous work with and without WL, although the uncertainties are large. The WL derived value of B-SZ is approximate to 20 per cent lower than the value preferred by the most recent SPT cluster cosmology analysis. The method demonstrated in this work is designed to constrain cluster masses and cosmological parameters simultaneously and will form the basis for subsequent studies that employ the full SPT cluster sample together with the DES data.

DES Collaboration	First cosmology results using Type Ia supernova from the Dark Energy Survey: simulations to correct supernova distance biases	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques; cosmology; supernovae; (cosmology:) dark energy	LIGHT CURVES; CONSTRAINTS; POPULATIONS; COLOR	We describe catalogue-level simulations of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and in low-redshift samples from the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model biases from selection effects and light-curve analysis and to determine bias corrections for SN Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN Ia model, incorporates information from observations (point spread function, sky noise, zero-point), and uses summary information (e.g. detection efficiency versus signal-to-noise ratio) based on 10 000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up to 0.05 mag over the redshift ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly those with extreme red or blue colour, distance biases can reach 0.4 mag. Therefore, accurately determining bias corrections is critical for precision measurements of cosmological parameters. Files used to make these corrections are available at https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/sn.

Revisiting the HIP41378 System with K2 and Spitzer	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: detection; planets and satellites: gaseous planets		We present new observations of the multiplanet system HIP 41378, a bright star (V = 8.9, K-s = 7.7) with five known transiting planets. Previous K2 observations showed multiple transits of two Neptune-sized bodies and single transits of three larger planets (R-P = 0.33R(J), 0.47R(J), 0.88R(J)). K2 recently observed the system again in Campaign 18 (C18). We observe one new transit each of two of the larger planets d/f, giving maximal orbital periods of 1114/1084 days, as well as integer divisions of these values down to a lower limit of about 50 days. We use all available photometry to determine the eccentricity distributions of HIP 41378 d & f, finding that periods less than or similar to 300 days require non-zero eccentricity. We check for overlapping orbits of planets d and f to constrain their mutual periods, finding that short periods (P < 300 days) for planet f are disfavored. We also observe transits of planets b and c with Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), which we combine with the K2 observations to search for transit timing variations (TTVs). We find a linear ephemeris for planet b, but see a significant TTV signal for planet c. The ability to recover the two smaller planets with Spitzer shows that this fascinating system will continue to be detectable with Spitzer, CHEOPS, TESS, and other observatories, allowing us to precisely determine the periods of d and f, characterize the TTVs of planet c, recover the transits of planet e, and further enhance our view of this remarkable dynamical laboratory.

Steve: A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Supernova Cosmology	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark energy; methods: data analysis	DARK-ENERGY CONSTRAINTS; PHOTOMETRY DATA RELEASE; IA SUPERNOVAE; LIGHT CURVES; HUBBLE DIAGRAM; INFERENCE; SIMULATIONS	We present a new Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) named Steve for performing Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology fits. This advances previous works by including an improved treatment of Malmquist bias, accounting for additional sources of systematic uncertainty, and increasing numerical efficiency. Given light-curve fit parameters, redshifts, and host-galaxy masses, we fit Steve simultaneously for parameters describing cosmology, SN Ia populations, and systematic uncertainties. Selection effects are characterized using Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate its implementation by fitting realizations of SN Ia data sets where the SN Ia model closely follows that used in Steve. Next, we validate on more realistic SNANA simulations of SN Ia samples from the Dark Energy Survey and low-redshift surveys (DES Collaboration et al. 2018). These simulated data sets contain more than 60,000 SNe Ia, which we use to evaluate biases in the recovery of cosmological parameters, specifically the equation of state of dark energy, w. This is the most rigorous test of a BHM method applied to SN Ia cosmology fitting and reveals small w biases that depend on the simulated SN Ia properties, in particular the intrinsic SN Ia scatter model. This w bias is less than 0.03 on average, less than half the statistical uncertainty on w. These simulation test results are a concern for BHM cosmology fitting applications on large upcoming surveys; therefore, future development will focus on minimizing the sensitivity of Steve to the SN Ia intrinsic scatter model.

Front delineation and tracking with multiple underwater vehicles	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article						adaptive sampling; autonomous underwater vehicles; multiasset planning; ocean front tracking	OCEAN; PHYTOPLANKTON; CALIFORNIA; SYSTEM	This study describes a method for detecting and tracking ocean fronts using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Multiple vehicles, equally spaced along the expected frontal boundary, complete near parallel transects orthogonal to the front. Two different techniques are used to determine the location of the front crossing from each individual vehicle transect. The first technique uses lateral gradients to detect when a change in the observed water property occurs. The second technique uses a measure of the vertical temperature structure over a single dive to detect when the vehicle is in upwelling water. Adaptive control of the vehicles ensure they remain perpendicular to the estimated front boundary as it evolves over time. This method was demonstrated in several experiment periods totaling weeks, in and around Monterey Bay, CA, in May and June of 2017. We compare the two front detection methods, a lateral gradient front detector and an upwelling front detector using the Vertical Temperature Homogeneity Index. We introduce two metrics to evaluate the adaptive control techniques presented. We show the capability of this method for repeated sampling across a dynamic ocean front using a fleet of three types of platforms: short-range Iver AUVs, Tethys-class long-range AUVs, and Seagliders. This method extends to tracking gradients of different properties using a variety of vehicles.

But these data have not been used systematically at high spatial resolution to study changes in volcano temperatures across an entire region spanning multiple decades to understand background thermal activity and its relation to unrest and eruption. We have developed a first-of-a-kind database that uses manual analysis to identify and collect data for volcanic thermal output with 90 m/pixel spatial resolution for 330 potentially active volcanoes found in Latin America between the years 2000-2017. This database is reliant on the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor due to its high spatial resolution data, capability of detecting low-level thermal features, its accessibility and reliability compared to similar data types, and the long time series available at multiple volcanoes. A total of 88 Latin American volcanoes were found to have some type of volcanic thermal feature detected by ASTER, and here we document thermal features at 16 of these volcanoes detected from space for the first time. We have recorded these thermal features, including the temperature above background, area above background, and the timing and location of detection in the ASTER Volcanic Thermal Output Database (AVTOD). By comprehensively analyzing such a large dataset, we are able to quantitatively analyze some of the issues with these data, including 24% of all volcanoes in this study failing to meet the acquisition rates proposed by the current acquisition plan and 44.5% of all acquisitions being unusable due to interference from clouds. We provide recommendations of how to update future acquisition plans that would focus on night-time and cloud-free acquisitions. In order to confirm the validity of AVTOD it was tested against the existing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based MIROVA database. In some cases, we found a high degree of correlation between the two datasets (r(2) = 0.87). In other cases, however, correlation was limited due to the difference in spatial resolution of these two data types. By examining the maximum temperature detected by every volcano in the database we found 46 that never reach a temperature high enough to be detected by MODIS-class thermal sensors. The information in this database provides new insights about volcanic activity both on its own, and in combination with other data types, as well as a data-driven approach to improve key features in future sensors.

As scientific goals become more ambitious, the FPGA-based solutions are showing limitations, especially with restricted launch vehicle capacity and available solar power. In this paper, modern integrated circuit technology is adopted to realize two fully integrated spectrometer SoCs to support spaceborne telescopic sensing. The system specifications are derived from the scientific principles of radio-frequency spectroscopy while each component strives for a simple and reliable implementation. Realized in 65-nm CMOS technology, Design A operates at 2.6 GHz with a three-bit ADC, a 2048-point FFT with 8192-point polyphase filter bank, and a billion-count accumulator. Design B more than doubles the bandwidth, reaches 6 GS/s by interleaving the ADC. The FFT size is also quadrupled to 8192. Both designs include integrated phase locked loops and tunable clock distribution networks. Design A consumes a peak power of 650 mW and Design B consumes 1.5 W. They represent the highest level of integration among similar endeavors and achieve orders of magnitude of improvement over traditional solutions in terms of size, weight, and power consumption. Both designs are actively involved in NASA's spectroscopy missions.

High-resolution profiles recorded at the sampling frequency of 0.5 Hz are, however, available upon physical retrieval of the logger. Between 2014 and 2018, several loggers deployed on elephant seals in the Southern Ocean have been set in continuous recording mode, capturing both the ascent and descent for over 60 profiles per day during several months, opening new horizons for the physical oceanography community. Taking advantage of a new dataset made of seven such loggers, a postprocessing procedure is proposed and validated to improve the quality of all CTD-SRDL data: that is, both high-resolution profiles and compressed low-resolution ones. First, temperature and conductivity are corrected for a thermal mass effect. Then salinity spiking and density inversion are removed by adjusting salinity while leaving temperature unchanged. This method, applied here to more than 50 000 profiles, yields significant and systematic improvements in both temperature and salinity, particularly in regions of rapid temperature variation. The continuous high-resolution dataset is then used to provide updated accuracy estimates of CTD-SRDL data. For high-resolution data, accuracies are estimated to be of +/- 0.02 degrees C for temperature and +/- 0.03 g kg(-1) for salinity. For low-resolution data, transmitted data points have similar accuracies; however, reconstructed temperature profiles have a reduced accuracy associated with the vertical interpolation of +/- 0.04 degrees C and a nearly unchanged salinity accuracy of +/- 0.03 g kg(-1).

We create AIRS proximity soundings representative of the storm environment by calculating back trajectories from storm times and locations at levels throughout the troposphere, using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model forced with the 32-km North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and 12-km North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM12). The proximity soundings are calculated for severe weather events including tornadoes, hail >= 2 in. diameter, and wind gusts >65 mph (29 m s(-1)) specified in the NCEI Storm Events database. Box-and-whisker diagrams exhibit more realistic values of enhanced convective available potential energy (CAPE) and suppressed convective inhibition (CIN) relative to conventional "nearest neighbor" (NN) soundings; however, differences in lifting condensation level (LCL), level of free convection (LFC), and significant tornado parameter (STP) from the HYSPLIT-adjusted back traced soundings are more similar to NN soundings. This methodology should be extended to larger swaths of soundings, and to other operational infrared sounders, to characterize the large-scale environment in severe convective events.

Specifically, aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from a geostationary satellite can directly provide the progression and evolution of aerosol plume transport. During high pollution cases in western Korea, we found the AOD enhancement over the Yellow Sea and east-central China, at maximum > 200% over the pathway of LRTT compared to the mean condition. Particularly, high AOD in the Shandong peninsula appears coincidentally with the high AOD over South Korea in a day, revealing the strong influence of the east-central Chinese emission. Back-trajectory patterns remarkably capture the movement of high AOD bands detected by the geostationary satellite monitoring. LRTT cases through the inside of boundary layer at east-central China usually contribute to the high AOD in Korea, while air masses above the boundary layer in north China and Mongolia do not much relate to the Korean pollution, showing the importance for both the direction and height of the air-mass movement. Travel speed is another significant factor to describe the LRTT effect. Despite the large effect of LRTT to both urban and rural sites in Korea, sometimes urban sites are more affected by the domestic emission when the air-mass travels shorter than similar to 250 km per day, notifying that the effect of Korean domestic emission cannot be negligible as well. Our findings reveal that usage of geostationary satellite observations enables us to better evaluate the influence of LRTT on the local air pollution.

Bayesian inference of hydraulic properties in and around a white fir using a process-based ecohydrologic model	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Ecohydrology; Vegetation; Hydraulics; Climate; Parameter estimation; MCMC	ROOT WATER-UPTAKE; SAP FLOW; TREE; PLANT; XYLEM; CONDUCTIVITY; DROUGHT; TRANSPIRATION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM	We present a parameter estimation study of the Soil-Tree-Atmosphere Continuum (STAC) model, a process-based model that simulates water flow through an individual tree and its surrounding root zone. Parameters are estimated to optimize the model fit to observations of sap flux, stem water potential, and soil water storage made for a white fir (Abies concolor) in the Sierra Nevada, California. Bayesian inference is applied with a likelihood function that considers temporal correlation of the model errors. Key vegetation properties are estimated, such as the tree's root distribution, tolerance to drought, and hydraulic conductivity and retention functions. We find the model parameters are relatively non-identifiable when considering just soil water storage. Overall, by utilizing multiple processes (e.g. sap flow, stem water potential, and soil water storage) during the parameter estimation, we find the simulations of the soil and tree water properties to be more accurate when compared to observed data.

Most available data products only document surficial (two-dimensional) land use and land cover (LULC), yet a substantial component of urban growth occurs in the vertical dimension. Light detection and ranging (lidar) data offer the potential for monitoring three-dimensional (3D) change, but the extreme lack of systematic lidar coverage worldwide inflicts considerable gaps in both spatial and temporal coverage. Satellite scatterometer (radar) data may serve as an alternative data source for characterizing urban growth and development in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The accuracy of these radar-based datasets for estimating building volumes remains to be validated quantitatively. For nine U.S. cities, we test whether scatterometer data can be used to estimate 3D urban built-up volume. We found strong, linear correlations between the lidar-derived and radar-derived building volume estimates for all cities with r(2) values as high as 0.98 when using spatial trend analysis. Given the high expense that limits lidar data acquisition to small areas at sporadic points in time, satellite scatterometer data provide a breakthrough method for monitoring both vertical growth and horizontal expansion of cities across the world with a continuous decadal time scale.

Defining the annual cycle as strictly stationary, however, precludes the possibility of changes in its amplitude from one year to the next. In this study, we target and extract the modulated annual cycle in terrestrial water storage with a statistical analysis technique specifically suited to this application. We estimate the amplitude modulation of the annual cycle in terrestrial water storage in order to assess the drivers of strength of the seasonal water cycle from year to year and identify trends in the amplitude that are persistent over the 13-year record used here. We find that climate variability is found to be one of the dominant drivers of the strength of the annual cycle in terrestrial water storage, with El Nino-Southern Oscillation found to play a particularly significant role, as identified in previous studies.

The Influence of Weather Systems in Controlling Mass Balance in the Southern Alps of New Zealand	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							FRANZ-JOSEF-GLACIER; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; BREWSTER GLACIER; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; INTERANNUAL VARIATION; SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGY; ENERGY-BALANCE; SPLIT JET; ABLATION; VARIABILITY	The recent advance of some fast-responding glaciers in New Zealand demonstrates that regional variability in atmospheric circulation can counteract the effects of global warming. Until recently, a key challenge in quantifying how weather systems influence glaciers has been the lack of observational data from high-elevation sites in the Southern Alps. Using high-quality meteorological and glaciological observations from Brewster Glacier over four summers and two winters, a physically based mass balance model is used to resolve daily ablation and solid precipitation. Composite analysis confirms ablation is largely controlled by changes in meridional airflow, with high ablation associated with north to northwest airflow, while low ablation is associated with south to southwest airflow. The largest snowfall events in the cool season also occur during northwesterly airflow, highlighting the importance of seasonality (i.e., whether an event occurs in the ablation or accumulation period) for mass balance. Application of a synoptic weather typing approach commonly used for the New Zealand region, known broadly as Kidson weather types, revealed that three established regimes (trough, zonal, and blocking) are less effective in resolving variability in ablation and snowfall than a simple procedure that groups weather types using geostrophic flow direction. The frequency of four weather types can explain approximately 40% of the variance in mass balance over a 42-year period. This highlights that future regional variability or trends in large-scale circulation and their seasonality, superimposed on background warming, will be important in shaping glacier mass balance in the coming decades.

J	Wang, D; Giangrande, SE; Schiro, KA; Jensen, MP; Houze, RA				Wang, Die; Giangrande, Scott E.; Schiro, Kathleen A.; Jensen, Michael P.; Houze, Robert A., Jr.			The Characteristics of Tropical and Midlatitude Mesoscale Convective Systems as Revealed by Radar Wind Profilers	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							INCLUDING MASS FLUXES; SQUALL-LINE; VERTICAL VELOCITY; MICROPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS; RAINFALL CHARACTERISTICS; PERMITTING SIMULATIONS; FLORIDA CUMULONIMBUS; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; PART I	This study contrasts characteristics of mature squall-line mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) observed by extended ground-based radar wind profiler (RWP) deployments from the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program. This analysis compares the dynamical structure, precipitation, and cold pool properties associated with MCS events over RWP sites in Oklahoma, USA, (midlatitude) to those observed during a 2-year RWP deployment to Manaus, Brazil, during GoAmazon2014/5 campaign (tropical). The MCSs indicate similar convective line rainfall rates and total rainfall accumulations. However, midlatitude events suggest a larger fractional stratiform contribution to total precipitation. For both regions, convective line cold pools are associated with sharp decreases (approximately 10 K) in the surface equivalent potential temperature (theta(e)) near the time of line passage. Surface theta(e) properties for both regions suggest a modest relationship between rainfall rate and the probability of observing measurable surface rainfall. The probability of observing convective updrafts in both tropical and midlatitude MCS events is found to be similar as a function of low-level radar reflectivity. However, midlatitude MCSs are associated with more intense convective updrafts, with upward air motions (mean, maximum) peaking at higher altitude. The most pronounced contrast is the propensity for deeper and more intense downdrafts in midlatitude MCSs. An analysis based on observed downdraft properties is performed using simple mixing assumptions. For these events, the vertical gradient of theta(e) in the lower troposphere is relatively consistent between the Amazon and Oklahoma, suggesting similar mixing rates for downdrafts originating below 3 km (0.1 km(-1)). However, if downdrafts originate nearer to the level of minimum theta(e) at SGP, mixing may be occurring at rates comparable to 0.3 km(-1).

A number of different measurements of methane show evidence of transient, locally elevated methane concentrations and seasonal variations in background methane concentrations(2-5). These measurements, however, are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of the chemistry and physics of the Martian atmosphere(6,7), which-given methane's lifetime of several centuries-predicts an even, well mixed distribution of methane(1,6,8). Here we report highly sensitive measurements of the atmosphere of Mars in an attempt to detect methane, using the ACS and NOMAD instruments onboard the ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter from April to August 2018. We did not detect any methane over a range of latitudes in both hemispheres, obtaining an upper limit for methane of about 0.05 parts per billion by volume, which is 10 to 100 times lower than previously reported positive detections(2,4). We suggest that reconciliation between the present findings and the background methane concentrations found in the Gale crater(4) would require an unknown process that can rapidly remove or sequester methane from the lower atmosphere before it spreads globally.

They can cause changes in atmospheric dynamics and inflation of the atmosphere(3), primarily owing to solar heating of the dust(3). In turn, changes in atmospheric dynamics can affect the distribution of atmospheric water vapour, with potential implications for the atmospheric photochemistry and climate on Mars(4). Recent observations of the water vapour abundance in the Martian atmosphere during dust storm conditions revealed a high-altitude increase in atmospheric water vapour that was more pronounced at high northern latitudes(5,6), as well as a decrease in the water column at low latitudes(7,8). Here we present concurrent, high-resolution measurements of dust, water and semiheavy water (HDO) at the onset of a global dust storm, obtained by the NOMAD and ACS instruments onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. We report the vertical distribution of the HDO/H2O ratio (D/H) from the planetary boundary layer up to an altitude of 80 kilometres. Our findings suggest that before the onset of the dust storm, HDO abundances were reduced to levels below detectability at altitudes above 40 kilometres. This decrease in HDO coincided with the presence of water-ice clouds. During the storm, an increase in the abundance of H2O and HDO was observed at altitudes between 40 and 80 kilometres. We propose that these increased abundances may be the result of warmer temperatures during the dust storm causing stronger atmospheric circulation and preventing ice cloud formation, which may confine water vapour to lower altitudes through gravitational fall and subsequent sublimation of ice crystals(3). The observed changes in H2O and HDO abundance occurred within a few days during the development of the dust storm, suggesting a fast impact of dust storms on the Martian atmosphere.

The shape of (7) Iris as evidence of an ancient large impact?	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: 7 Iris; methods: observational; methods: numerical	COLLISIONAL HISTORY; MASS DETERMINATION; ASTEROID MASSES; DENSITY; IMAGES; CRATERS; PLANETS; OBJECTS	Context. Asteroid (7) Iris is an ideal target for disk-resolved imaging owing to its brightness (V similar to 7-8) and large angular size of 0.33 '' during its apparitions. Iris is believed to belong to the category of large unfragmented asteroids that avoided internal differentiation, implying that its current shape and topography may record the first few 100 Myr of the solar system's collisional evolution. Aims. We recovered information about the shape and surface topography of Iris from disk-resolved VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL images acquired in the frame of our ESO large program. Methods. We used the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM) shape reconstruction algorithm to model the 3D shape of Iris, using optical disk-integrated data and disk-resolved images from SPHERE and earlier AO systems as inputs. We analyzed the SPHERE images and our model to infer the asteroid's global shape and the morphology of its main craters. Results. We present the 3D shape, volume-equivalent diameter D-eq = 214 +/- 5 km, and bulk density rho = 2.7 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3) of Iris. Its shape appears to be consistent with that of an oblate spheroid with a large equatorial excavation. We identified eight putative surface features 20-40 km in diameter detected at several epochs, which we interpret as impact craters, and several additional crater candidates. Craters on Iris have depth-to-diameter ratios that are similar to those of analogous 10 km craters on Vesta. Conclusions. The bulk density of Iris is consistent with that of its meteoritic analog based on spectroscopic observations, namely LL ordinary chondrites. Considering the absence of a collisional family related to Iris and the number of large craters on its surface, we suggest that its equatorial depression may be the remnant of an ancient (at least 3 Gyr) impact. Iris's shape further opens the possibility that large planetesimals formed as almost perfect oblate spheroids. Finally, we attribute the difference in crater morphology between Iris and Vesta to their different surface gravities, and the absence of a substantial impact-induced regolith on Iris.

Revisiting the cosmic-ray induced Venusian ionization with the Atmospheric Radiation Interaction Simulator (AtRIS)	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						Sun: activity; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets; planets and satellites: atmospheres	CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; SOLAR; ENERGY; ACCELERATION; NUCLEI; LEVEL; SHOCK	Context. Cosmic ray bombardment represents a major source of ionization in planetary atmospheres. The higher the energy of the primary cosmic ray particles, the deeper they can penetrate into the atmosphere. In addition, incident high energy cosmic ray particles induce extensive secondary particle cascades ("air showers") that can contain up to several billion secondary particles per incoming primary particle. To quantify cosmic ray-induced effects on planetary atmospheres it is therefore important to accurately model the entire secondary particle cascade. This is particularly important in thick planetary atmospheres where the secondary particle cascades can develop extensively before being absorbed by the surface. Aims. Inside the Venusian atmosphere, cosmic rays are the dominant driver for the ionization below an altitude of -100 km. In this work we revisit the numerical modeling of the galactic and solar cosmic-ray induced atmospheric ionization for cosmic ray ions from Hydrogen (Z=1) to Nickel (Z= 28) and investigate the influence of strong solar energetic particle events inside the Venusian atmosphere. Methods. The Atmospheric Radiation Interaction Simulator (AtRIS), a newly developed simulation code to model the interaction of the near-(exo)planet particle and radiation field with the (exo)planetary atmosphere, was used to revisit the modeling of the altitude-dependent Venusian atmospheric ionization. Thereby, spherical geometry, the newest version of Geant4 (10.5) as well as the newest Geant4-based hadronic and electromagnetic interaction models were utilized. Results. Based on our new model approach we show that previous studies may have underestimated the galactic cosmic ray-induced atmospheric ion pair production by, amongst others, underestimating the influence of galactic cosmic ray protons above 1 TeV/nuc. Furthermore, we study the influence of 71 exceptionally strong solar particle events that were measured as Ground Level Enhancements at the Earth's surface, and show a detailed analysis of the impact of such strong events on the Venusian ionization.

Recent studies have highlighted a poor understanding particularly of C pool transit times and of whether productivity or biomass dominate these biases. The Arctic, accounting for approximately 50 % of the global soil organic C stocks, has an important role in the global C cycle. Here, we use the CARbon DAta MOdel (CARDAMOM) data-assimilation system to produce pan-Arctic terrestrial C cycle analyses for 2000-2015. This approach avoids using traditional plant functional type or steady-state assumptions. We integrate a range of data (soil organic C, leaf area index, biomass, and climate) to determine the most likely state of the high-latitude C cycle at a 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution and also to provide general guidance about the controlling biases in transit times. On average, CARDAMOM estimates regional mean rates of photosynthesis of 565 g C m(-2) yr (-1) (90 % confidence interval between the 5th and 95th percentiles: 428, 741), autotrophic respiration of 270 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (182, 397) and heterotrophic respiration of 219 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (31, 1458), suggesting a pan-Arctic sink of -67 (-287, 1160) g Cm-2 yr(-1), weaker in tundra and stronger in taiga. However, our confidence intervals remain large (and so the region could be a source of C), reflecting uncertainty assigned to the regional data products. We show a clear spatial and temporal agreement between CARDAMOM analyses and different sources of assimilated and independent data at both pan-Arctic and local scales but also identify consistent biases between CARDAMOM and validation data. The assimilation process requires clearer error quantification for leaf area index (LAI) and biomass products to resolve these biases. Mapping of vegetation C stocks and change over time and soil C ages linked to soil C stocks is required for better analytical constraint. Comparing CARDAMOM analyses to global vegetation models (GVMs) for the same period, we conclude that transit times of vegetation C are inconsistently simulated in GVMs due to a combination of uncertainties from productivity and biomass calculations. Our findings highlight that GVMs need to focus on constraining both current vegetation C stocks and net primary production to improve a process-based understanding of C cycle dynamics in the Arctic.

Mid-wavelength infrared InAsSb/InAs nBn detectors and FPAs with very low dark current density	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article								There was a significant improvement in the performance of infrared nBn detectors utilizing InAs/InAsSb absorbers culminating in the development of infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) with excellent operability (99.7%) and operating at temperature significantly higher than InSb FPAs. In this work, we demonstrated that these detectors can operate with very low dark current densities enabling their use in applications with a low-to-medium level of background illumination. We showed that single pixel photodetectors with a cut-off wavelength of 4.8 mu m and a quantum efficiency of QE(max) = 35% under backside-illumination have a dark current density of 1 x 10(-10) A/cm(2) at an operating bias of -0.1 V and temperature T = 100 K. Additionally, we compared the single pixel dark current results with measurements of the dark current in FPAs. The FPA showed excellent performance with an operability of 99.7% and was able to reach a mode dark current density of 5 x 10(-11) A/cm(2) at 80 K. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

Infrared background anisotropies encode the redshift-weighted total emission over cosmic history, including any spatially diffuse and extended contributions. The anisotropy power spectrum is dominated by undetected galaxies at small angular scales and a diffuse background of Galactic emission at large angular scales. In addition to these known sources, the infrared background also arises from intrahalo light (IHL) at z < 3 associated with tidally stripped stars during galaxy mergers. Moreover, it contains information on the very first galaxies from the epoch of reionization (EoR). The EoR signal has a spectral energy distribution (SED) that goes to zero near optical wavelengths due to Lyman absorption, while other signals have spectra that vary smoothly with frequency. Due to differences in SEDs and spatial clustering, these components may be separated in a multi-wavelength-fluctuation experiment. To study the extent to which EoR fluctuations can be separated in the presence of IHL, and extragalactic and Galactic foregrounds, we develop a maximum likelihood technique that incorporates a full covariance matrix among all the frequencies at different angular scales. We apply this technique to simulated deep imaging data over a 2 x 45 deg(2) sky area from 0.75 to 5 mu m in 9 bands and find that such a "frequency tomography" can successfully reconstruct both the amplitude and spectral shape for representative EoR, IHL, and the foreground signals.

VLA Observations of Single Pulses from the Galactic Center Magnetar	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxy: center; pulsars: individual (J1745-2900)	RADIO-EMISSION; SCATTERING; DENSITY; FIELD	We present results of a 7-12 GHz phased-array study of the Galactic center magnetar J1745-2900 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Using data from two 6.5 hr observations from 2014 September, we find that the average profile is comprised of several distinct components at these epochs and is stable over similar to day timescales and similar to GHz frequencies. Comparison with additional phased VLA data at 8.7 GHz shows significant profile changes on longer timescales. The average profile at 7-12 GHz is dominated by the jitter of relatively narrow pulses. The pulses in each of the four main profile components seen in 2014 September are uncorrelated in phase and amplitude, though there is a small but significant correlation in the occurrence of pulses in two of the profile components. Using the brightest pulses, we measure the dispersion and scattering parameters of J1745-2900. A joint fit of 38 pulses gives a 10 GHz pulse-broadening time of tau(sc,10) = 0.09 +/- 0.03 ms and a dispersion measure of DM = 1760(-1.3)(+2.4) pc cm(-3). Both of these results are consistent with previous measurements, which suggests that the scattering and dispersion measure of J1745-2900 may be stable on timescales of several years.	[Wharton, R.

Parallax Distances for 57 Pulsars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrometry; galaxies: ISM; pulsars: general; stars: neutron; techniques: high angular resolution	STAR POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PROPER MOTIONS; VLA; VELOCITIES; GUITAR; KICKS; SKY	We present the results of PSR pi, a large astrometric project targeting radio pulsars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). From our astrometric database of 60 pulsars, we have obtained parallax-based distance measurements for all but 3, with a parallax precision that is typically similar to 45 mu as and approaches 10 mu as in the best cases. Our full sample doubles the number of radio pulsars with a reliable (greater than or similar to 5 sigma) model-independent distance constraint. Importantly, many of the newly measured pulsars are well outside the solar neighborhood, and so PSR pi brings a near-tenfold increase in the number of pulsars with a reliable model-independent distance at d > 2 kpc. Our results show that both widely used Galactic electron density distribution models contain significant shortcomings, particularly at high Galactic latitudes. When comparing our results to pulsar timing, two of the four millisecond pulsars in our sample exhibit significant discrepancies in their proper motion estimates. With additional VLBI observations that extend our sample and improve the absolute positional accuracy of our reference sources, we will be able to additionally compare pulsar absolute reference positions between VLBI and timing, which will provide a much more sensitive test of the correctness of the solar system ephemerides used for pulsar timing Finally, we use our large sample to estimate the typical accuracy attainable for differential VLBA astrometry of pulsars, showing that for sufficiently bright targets observed eight times over 18 months, a parallax uncertainty of 4 mu as per arcminute of separation between the pulsar and calibrator can be expected.

Field Emitters Using Inverse Opal Structures	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						diode; field emission; inverse opal; self-assembly; triode	WORK FUNCTION MEASUREMENTS; COLLOIDAL CRYSTALS; EMISSION; ENHANCEMENT; STRENGTH; ARRAYS; TIO2	Electronics to be used in space must often perform in high temperature or radiation hard environments that render conventional solid-state technologies unable to meet mission requirements. As a result, microscale and nanoscale field emission devices are being explored as fundamental components of electronics capable of operating in these harsh environments. Wide scale implementation of these devices is hindered by the difficulty of fabricating large, mechanically stable, uniform arrays of sharp emitting tips. This work presents a scalable method to produce uniform arrays of field emitting tips. Polystyrene spheres are applied as a template for electrochemical deposition. An electrochemical etching process is developed to sharpen tips to a radius of curvature of 5-10 nm, optimizing them for field emission applications. The flexibility of the fabrication process allows for device optimization in terms of tip geometry, density, and constituent material to achieve high field enhancement factors, exceeding 100. Miniaturized field emitting diode and gated triode devices are fabricated. Finally, the electrochemically deposited material is used as a scaffold for the deposition of a refractory, low work function emitting layer, and the hybrid cathode is characterized as a field emitter at temperatures up to 300 degrees C.

ZS-DOAS measurements have the advantage of being less sensitive to clouds than direct-sun measurements. However, the presence of clouds still affects the quality of ZS-DOAS TCO. Clouds are thought to be the largest contributor to random uncertainty in ZS-DOAS TCO, but their impact on data quality still needs to be quantified. This study has two goals: (1) to investigate whether clouds have a significant impact on ZS-DOAS TCO, and (2) to develop a cloud-screening algorithm to improve ZS-DOAS measurements in the Arctic under cloudy conditions. To quantify the impact of weather, 8 years of measured and modelled TCO have been used, along with information about weather conditions at Eureka, Canada (80.05 degrees N, 86.41 degrees W). Relative to direct-sun TCO measurements by Brewer spectrophotometers and modelled TCO, a positive bias is found in ZS-DOAS TCO measured in cloudy weather, and a negative bias is found for clear conditions, with differences of up to 5% between clear and cloudy conditions. A cloud-screening algorithm is developed for high latitudes using the colour index calculated from ZS-DOAS spectra. The quality of ZS-DOAS TCO datasets is assessed using a statistical uncertainty estimation model, which suggests a 3 %-4% random uncertainty. The new cloud-screening algorithm reduces the random uncertainty by 0.6 %. If all measurements collected during cloudy conditions, as identified using the weather station observations, are removed, the random uncertainty is reduced by 1.3 %. This work demonstrates that clouds are a significant contributor to uncertainty in ZS-DOAS TCO and proposes a method that can be used to screen clouds in high-latitude spectra.

Discovery of a directly imaged disk in scattered light around the Sco-Cen member Wray 15-788	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; planets and satellites: formation; planet-disk interactions; techniques: image processing; stars: individual: Wray 15-788; stars: individual: HD 98363	BROWN DWARFS; STARS; CATALOG; DUST; ALGORITHM; SPECTRA; PLANETS; PACKAGE; TAURUS; SOLAR	Context. Protoplanetary disks are the birth environments of planetary systems. Therefore, the study of young, circumstellar environments is essential in understanding the processes taking place in planet formation and the evolution of planetary systems. Aims. We detect and characterize circumstellar disks and potential companions around solar-type, pre-main sequence stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus association (Sco-Cen). Methods. As part of our ongoing survey we carried out high-contrast imaging with VLT/SPHERE/IRDIS to obtain polarized and total intensity images of the young (11(-7)(+16) Myr old) K3IV star Wray 15-788 within the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of Sco-Cen. For the total intensity images, we remove the stellar halo via an approach based on reference star differential imaging in combination with principal component analysis. Results. Both total intensity and polarimetric data resolve a disk around the young, solar-like Sco-Cen member Wray 15-788. Modeling of the stellar spectral energy distribution suggests that this is a protoplanetary disk at a transition stage. We detect a bright outer ring at a projected separation of similar to 370 mas (approximate to 56 au), hints of inner substructures at similar to 170 mas (approximate to 28 au), and a gap in between. Within a position angle range of only 60 degrees < phi < 240 degrees, we are confident at the 5 sigma level that we detect actual scattered light flux from the outer ring of the disk; the remaining part is indistinguishable from background noise. For the detected part of the outer ring we determine a disk inclination of i = 21 degrees +/- 6 degrees and a position angle of phi = 76 degrees +/- 16 degrees. Furthermore, we find that Wray 15-788 is part of a binary system with the A2V star HD 98363 at a separation of similar to 50 '' (approximate to 6900 au). Conclusions. The detection of only half of the outer ring might be due to shadowing by a misaligned inner disk. A potential substellar companion can cause the misalignment of the inner structures and can be responsible for clearing the detected gap from scattering material. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a non-detection due to our limited signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), combined with brightness azimuthal asymmetry. From our data we can exclude companions more massive than 10 M-jup within the gap at a separation of similar to 230 mas (approximate to 35 au). Additional data are required to characterize the disk's peculiar morphology and to set tighter constraints on the potential perturber's orbital parameters and mass.	[Bohn, A. J.; Kenworthy, M.

The global diabatic circulation of the stratosphere as a metric for the Brewer-Dobson circulation	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ANTARCTIC OZONE HOLE; TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE; MEAN AGE; INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; TAPE-RECORDER; WATER-VAPOR; AIR TRENDS; MODEL; CLIMATE	The circulation of the stratosphere, also known as the Brewer-Dobson circulation, transports water vapor and ozone, with implications for radiative forcing and climate. This circulation is typically quantified from model output by calculating the tropical upwelling vertical velocity in the residual circulation framework, and it is estimated from observations by using time series of tropical water vapor to infer a vertical velocity. Recent theory has introduced a method to calculate the strength of the global mean diabatic circulation through isentropes from satellite measurements of long lived tracers. In this paper, we explore this global diabatic circulation as it relates to the residual circulation vertical velocity, stratospheric water vapor, and ozone at interannual timescales. We use a comprehensive climate model, three reanalysis data products, and satellite ozone data. The different metrics for the circulation have different properties, especially with regards to the vertical autocorrelation. In the model, the different residual circulation metrics agree closely and are well correlated with the global diabatic circulation, except in the lowermost stratosphere. In the reanalysis products, however, there are more differences throughout, indicating the dynamical inconsistencies of these products. The vertical velocity derived from the time series of water vapor in the tropics is significantly correlated with the global diabatic circulation, but this relationship is not as strong as that between the global diabatic circulation and the residual circulation vertical velocity. We find that the global diabatic circulation in the lower to middle stratosphere (up to 500 K) is correlated with the total column ozone in the high latitudes and in the tropics. The upper-level circulation is also correlated with the total column ozone, primarily in the subtropics, and we show that this is due to the correlation of both the circulation and the ozone with upper-level temperatures.

Characterization and evaluation of AIRS-based estimates of the deuterium content of water vapor	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; SINGLE-FOOTPRINT RETRIEVALS; AURA TES; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; MODEL; PROFILES; CH4; CALIBRATION; CONVECTION	Single-pixel tropospheric retrievals of HDO and H2O concentrations are retrieved from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) radiances using the optimal estimation algorithm developed for the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) project. We evaluate the error characteristics and vertical sensitivity of AIRS measurements corresponding to 5 d of TES data (or five global surveys) during the Northern Hemisphere summers between 2006 and 2010 (similar to 600 co-located comparisons per day). We find that the retrieval characteristics of the AIRS deuterium content measurements have similar vertical resolution in the middle troposphere as TES but with slightly less sensitivity in the lowermost troposphere, with a typical degrees of freedom (DOFS) in the tropics of 1.5. The calculated measurement uncertainty is similar to 30 parts per thousand (parts per thousand relative to the deuterium composition of ocean water) for a tropospheric average between 750 and 350 hPa, the altitude region where AIRS is most sensitive, compared to similar to 15 parts per thousand for the TES data. Comparison with the TES data also indicates that the uncertainty of a single target AIRS HDO/H2O measurement is similar to 30 parts per thousand. Comparison of AIRS and TES data between 30 degrees S and 50 degrees N indicates that the AIRS data are biased low by similar to -2.6 parts per thousand with a latitudinal variation of similar to 7.8 parts per thousand. This latitudinal variation is consistent with the accuracy of TES data compared to in situ measurements, suggesting that both AIRS and TES have similar accuracy. Copyright statement.

J	Eldering, A; Taylor, TE; O'Dell, CW; Pavlick, R				Eldering, Annmarie; Taylor, Thomas E.; O'Dell, Christopher W.; Pavlick, Ryan			The OCO-3 mission: measurement objectives and expected performance based on 1 year of simulated data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; SATELLITE; DIOXIDE; RETRIEVAL; SPACE; FLUX; UNCERTAINTIES; SPECTROMETER	The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) is NASA's next instrument dedicated to extending the record of the dry-air mole fraction of column carbon dioxide (XCO2) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) measurements from space. The current schedule calls for a launch from the Kennedy Space Center no earlier than April 2019 via a Space-X Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The instrument will be installed as an external payload on the Japanese Experimental Module Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) of the International Space Station (ISS) with a nominal mission lifetime of 3 years. The precessing orbit of the ISS will allow for viewing of the Earth at all latitudes less than approximately 52 degrees, with a ground repeat cycle that is much more complicated than the polar-orbiting satellites that so far have carried all of the instruments capable of measuring carbon dioxide from space. The grating spectrometer at the core of OCO-3 is a direct copy of the OCO-2 spectrometer, which was launched into a polar orbit in July 2014. As such, OCO-3 is expected to have similar instrument sensitivity and performance characteristics to OCO-2, which provides measurements of XCO2 with precision better than 1 ppm at 3 Hz, with each viewing frame containing eight footprints approximately 1.6 km by 2.2 km in size. However, the physical configuration of the instrument aboard the ISS, as well as the use of a new pointing mirror assembly (PMA), will alter some of the characteristics of the OCO-3 data compared to OCO-2. Specifically, there will be significant differences from day to day in the sampling locations and time of day. In addition, the flexible PMA system allows for a much more dynamic observation-mode schedule. This paper outlines the science objectives of the OCO-3 mission and, using a simulation of 1 year of global observations, characterizes the spatial sampling, time-of-day coverage, and anticipated data quality of the simulated L1b. After application of cloud and aerosol prescreening, the L1b radiances are run through the operational L2 full physics retrieval algorithm, as well as post-retrieval filtering and bias correction, to examine the expected coverage and quality of the retrieved XCO2 and to show how the measurement objectives are met. In addition, results of the SIF from the IMAP-DOAS algorithm are analyzed. This paper focuses only on the nominal nadir-land and glint-water observation modes, although on-orbit measurements will also be made in transition and target modes, similar to OCO-2, as well as the new snapshot area mapping (SAM) mode.

The devices are 4 mm long by 4 mu m wide, and each emits 8 mW of average optical power. The spectroscopic sensing performance is demonstrated by measurements of methane and hydrogen chloride with optical multi-pass cell sensitivity enhancement. The system provides a spectral coverage of 33 cm(-1) (1 THz), 0.32 cm(-1) (9.7 GHz) frequency sampling interval, and peak signal-to-noise ratio of similar to 100 at 100 mu s integration time. The monolithic design, low drive power, and direct generation of mid-infrared radiation are highly attractive for portable broadband spectroscopic instrumentation in future terrestrial and space applications.

As part of this mission, the NASA-led Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will make a kinetic impactor collide with the smaller secondary of Didymos to test kinetic impact asteroid deflection technology, while the ESA-led Hera mission will evaluate the efficiency of the deflection by conducting detailed on-site observations. Research has shown that the larger primary of Didymos is spinning close to its critical spin, and the DART-impact-driven ejecta would give kinetic energy to the primary. It has been hypothesized that such an energy input might cause structural deformation of the primary, affecting the mutual orbit period, a critical parameter for assessing the kinetic impact deflection by the DART impactor. A key issue in the previous work was that the secondary was assumed to be spherical, which may not be realistic. Here, we use a second-order inertia-integral mutual dynamics model to analyze the effects of the shapes of the primary and the secondary on the mutual orbit period change of the system. We first compare the second-order model with three mutual dynamics models, including a high-order inertia-integral model that takes into account the detailed shapes of Didymos. The comparison tests show that the second-order model may have an error of similar to 10% for computing the mutual orbit period change, compared to the high-order model. We next use the second-order model to analyze how the original shape and shape deformation change the mutual orbit period. The results show that when the secondary is elongated, the mutual orbit period becomes short. Also, shape deformation of the secondary further changes the mutual orbit period. A better understanding of this mechanism allows for detailed assessment of DART's kinetic impact deflection capability for Didymos. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ground-based measurements can be complemented by new light-weight sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or laser scans from canopy cranes or towers. However, it is still largely unknown how much of the forest canopy volume can be sampled and how occlusion is spatially distributed. We present an approach for highly detailed 3D structure measurements based on TLS on the ground and above canopy measurements from a canopy crane or UAV platform, and assess their spatial sampling in terms of occlusion. Comparing the application in a dense tropical and temperate forest, we demonstrate the ability to sample the complete canopy volume with < 2% occlusion at very high spatial resolution when combining ground and above canopy measurements. This is necessary for a full canopy reconstruction. Ground-based TLS can provide sufficient coverage when no sampling of leaves and branches at top of canopy is required, whereas UAV or tower-based measurements show considerable occlusion in the mid- and understory. We therefore recommend to perform above canopy measurements under leaf off conditions, in sparse forests, or as an addition to ground measurements if a full representation of the whole canopy is required at very high spatial resolution. The latter can pave the way for studies on light availability, micrometeorology, sensor simulations and algorithm testing and development.

How bias correction goes wrong: measurement of X-CO2 affected by erroneous surface pressure estimates	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; VALIDATION; DIOXIDE; CALIBRATION; INSTRUMENT; FLUXES	All measurements of X-CO2 from space have systematic errors. To reduce a large fraction of these errors, a bias correction is applied to X-CO2 retrieved from GOSAT and OCO-2 spectra using the ACOS retrieval algorithm. The bias correction uses, among other parameters, the surface pressure difference between the retrieval and the meteorological reanalysis. Relative errors in the surface pressure estimates, however, propagate nearly 1 V 1 into relative errors in biascorrected X-CO2. For OCO-2, small errors in the knowledge of the pointing of the observatory (up to similar to 130 arcsec) introduce a bias in X-CO2 in regions with rough topography. Erroneous surface pressure estimates are also caused by a coding error in ACOS version 8, sampling meteorological analyses at wrong times ( up to 3 h after the overpass time). Here, we derive new geolocations for OCO-2' s eight footprints and show how using improved knowledge of surface pressure estimates in the bias correction reduces errors in OCO-2' s v9 X-CO2 data.

Desorption Kinetics and Binding Energies of Small Hydrocarbons	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrochemistry; methods: laboratory: molecular; protoplanetary disks	AMORPHOUS SOLID WATER; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; INFRARED-SPECTRA; THERMAL-DESORPTION; ICE; CHEMISTRY; H2O; MOLECULES; ACETYLENE; RELEVANT	Small hydrocarbons are an important organic reservoir in protostellar and protoplanetary environments. Constraints on desorption temperatures and binding energies of such hydrocarbons are needed for accurate predictions of where these molecules exist in the ice versus gas phase during the different stages of star and planet formation. Through a series of temperature programmed desorption experiments, we constrain the binding energies of 2- and 3-carbon hydrocarbons (C2H2-acetylene, C2H4-ethylene, C2H6-ethane, C3H4-propyne, C3H6-propene, and C3H8-propane) to 2200-4200 K in the case of pure amorphous ices, to 2400-4400 K on compact amorphous H2O, and to 2800-4700 K on porous amorphous H2O. The 3-carbon hydrocarbon binding energies are always larger than the 2-carbon hydrocarbon binding energies. Within the 2- and 3-carbon hydrocarbon families, the alkynes (i.e., least-saturated) hydrocarbons exhibit the largest binding energies, while the alkane and alkene binding energies are comparable. Binding energies are similar to 5%-20% higher on water ice substrates compared to pure ices, which is a small increase compared to what has been measured for other volatile molecules such as CO and N-2.

Weak-lensing Mass Calibration of ACTPol Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Clusters with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: observations; galaxies: clusters: general; gravitational lensing: weak	ATACAMA COSMOLOGY TELESCOPE; GALAXY CLUSTERS; DARK-MATTER; SHEAR CALIBRATION; SCALING RELATIONS; SQUARE DEGREES; SIMULATIONS; LOCUSS; MODEL; GAS	We present weak-lensing measurements using the first-year data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program on the Subaru telescope for eight galaxy clusters selected through their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal measured at 148 GHz with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter experiment. The overlap between the two surveys in this work is 33.8 square degrees, before masking bright stars. The signal-to-noise ratio of individual cluster lensing measurements ranges from 2.2 to 8.7, with a total of 11.1 for the stacked cluster weak-lensing signal. We fit for an average weak-lensing mass distribution using three different profiles, a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, a dark-matter-only emulated profile, and a full cosmological hydrodynamic emulated profile. We interpret the differences among the masses inferred by these models as a systematic error of 10%, which is currently smaller than the statistical error. We obtain the ratio of the SZ-estimated mass to the lensing-estimated mass (the so-called hydrostatic mass bias 1-b) of 0.74(-0.12)(+0.13), which is comparable to previous SZ-selected clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and from the Planck Satellite. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for cosmological parameters inferred from cluster abundances compared to cosmic microwave background primary anisotropy measurements.

The polarimetric imagery resolve a broken ring structure surrounding HD 163296 that peaks at a distance along the major axis of 0 ''.65 (66 au) and extends out to 0 ''.98 (100 au) along the major axis. Our 2011 H-band data exhibit clear axisymmetry, with the NW and SE side of the disk exhibiting similar intensities. Our data are clearly different from 2016 epoch H-band observations of the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE), which found a strong 2.7 x asymmetry between the NW and SE side of the disk. Collectively, these results indicate the presence of time-variable, non-azimuthally symmetric illumination of the outer disk. While our SCExAO/CHARIS data are sensitive enough to recover the planet candidate identified from NIRC2 in the thermal infrared (IR), we fail to detect an object with JHK brightness nominally consistent with this object. This suggests that the candidate is either fainter in JHK bands than model predictions, possibly due to extinction from the disk or atmospheric dust/clouds, or that it is an artifact of the data set/data processing, such as a residual speckle or partially subtracted disk feature. Assuming standard hot-start evolutionary models and a system age of 5 Myr, we set new, direct mass limits for the inner (outer) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)-predicted protoplanet candidate along the major (minor) disk axis of of 1.5 (2) M-J.

Evaluation of CESM1 (WACCM) free-running and specified dynamics atmospheric composition simulations using global multispecies satellite data records	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC WATER-VAPOR; SOLAR PROTON EVENTS; TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; OZONE TRENDS; SAGE II; CHEMISTRY; MODEL; LAYER; LIMB	We have analyzed near-global stratospheric data (and mesospheric data as well for H2O) in terms of absolute abundances, variability, and trends for O-3, H2O, HCl, N2O, and HNO3, based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data, as well as longer-term series from the Global OZone Chemistry And Related trace gas Data records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS). While we emphasize the evaluation of stratospheric models via data comparisons through 2014 to free-running (FR-WACCM) and specified dynamics (SD-WACCM) versions of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), we also highlight observed stratospheric changes, using the most recent data from MLS. Regarding highlights from the satellite data, we have used multiple linear regression to derive trends based on zonal mean time series from Aura MLS data alone, between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. In the upper stratosphere, MLS O-3 shows increases over 2005-2018 at similar to 0.1-0.3% yr(-1) (depending on altitude and latitude) with 2 sigma errors of similar to 0.2% yr(-1). For the lower stratosphere (LS), GOZCARDS O-3 data for 1998-2014 point to small decreases between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N, but the trends are more positive if the starting year is 2005. Southern midlatitudes (30-60 degrees S) exhibit near-zero or slightly positive LS trends for 1998-2018. The LS O-3 trends based on 2005-2018 MLS data are most positive (0.1-0.2% yr(-1)) at these southern midlatitudes, although marginally statistically significant, in contrast to slightly negative or near-zero trends for 2005-2014. Given the high variability in LS O-3, and the high sensitivity of trends to the choice of years used, especially for short periods, further studies are required for a robust longer-term LS trend result. For H2O, upper-stratospheric and mesospheric trends from GOZCARDS 1992-2010 data are near zero (within similar to 0.2% yr(-1)) and significantly smaller than trends (within similar to 0.4-0.7% yr(-1)) from MLS for 2005-2014 or 2005-2018. The latter short-term positive H2O trends are larger than expected from changes resulting from long-term increases in methane. We note that the very shallow solar flux maximum of solar cycle 24 has contributed to fairly large shortterm mesospheric and upper-stratospheric H2O trends since 2005. However, given known drifts in the MLS H2O time series, MLS H2O trend results, especially after 2010, should be viewed as upper limits. The MLS data also show regions and periods of small HCl increases in the lower stratosphere, within the context of the longer-term stratospheric decrease in HCl, as well as interhemispheric-latitudinal differences in short-term HCl tendencies. We observe similarities in such short-term tendencies, and interhemispheric asymmetries therein, for lower-stratospheric HCl and HNO3, while N2O trend profiles exhibit anti-correlated patterns. In terms of the model evaluation, climatological averages for 2005-2014 from both FR-WACCM and SD-WACCM for O3, H2O, HCl, N2O, and HNO3 compare favorably with Aura MLS data averages over this period. However, the models at mid-to high latitudes overestimate mean MLS LS O-3 values and seasonal amplitudes by as much as 50 %-60 %; such differences appear to implicate, in part, a transport-related model issue. At lower-stratospheric high southern latitudes, variations in polar winter and spring composition observed by MLS are well matched by SD-WACCM, with the main exception being for the early winter rate of decrease in HCl, which is too slow in the model. In general, we find that the latitude-pressure distributions of annual and semiannual oscillation amplitudes derived from MLS data are properly captured by the model amplitudes. In terms of closeness of fit diagnostics for model-data anomaly series, not surprisingly, SD-WACCM (driven by realistic dynamics) generally matches the observations better than FR-WACCM does. We also use root mean square variability as a more valuable metric to evaluate model-data differences. We find, most notably, that FR-WACCM underestimates observed interannual variability for H2O; this has implications for the time period needed to detect small trends, based on model predictions. The WACCM O-3 trends generally agree (within 2 sigma uncertainties) with the MLS data trends, although LS trends are typically not statistically different from zero. The MLS O3 trend dependence on latitude and pressure is matched quite well by the SD-WACCM results. For H2O, MLS and SD-WACCM positive trends agree fairly well, but FRWACCM shows significantly smaller increases; this discrepancy for FR-WACCM is even more pronounced for longerterm GOZCARDS H2O records. The larger discrepancies for FR-WACCM likely arise from its poorer correlations with cold point temperatures and with quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) variability. For HCl, while some expected decreases in the global LS are seen in the observations, there are interhemispheric differences in the trends, and increasing tendencies are suggested in tropical MLS data at 68 hPa, where there is only a slight positive trend in SD-WACCM. Although the vertical gradients in MLS HCl trends are well duplicated by SD-WACCM, the model trends are always somewhat more negative; this deserves further investigation. The original MLS N2O product time series yield small positive LS tropical trends (2005-2012), consistent with models and with rates of increase in tropospheric N2O. However, longerterm series from the more current MLS N2O standard product are affected by instrument-related drifts that have also impacted MLS H2O. The LS short-term trend profiles from MLS N2O and HNO3 at midlatitudes in the two hemispheres have different signs; these patterns are well matched by SD-WACCM trends for these species. These model-data comparisons provide a reminder that the QBO and other dynamical factors affect decadal variability in a major way, notably in the lower stratosphere, and can thus significantly hinder the goals of robustly extracting (and explaining) small underlying long-term trends. The data sets and tools discussed here for model evaluation could be expanded to comparisons of species or regions not included here, as well as to comparisons between a variety of chemistry-climate models.

This campaign was organized under the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) joint initiative for HYperSpectral Imaging (HYSI) programme. To support the campaign, synchronous field campaigns and ground measurements were also carried out over these sites spanning themes related to crop, soil, forest, geology, coastal, ocean, river water, snow, urban, etc. AVIRIS-NG measures the spectral range from 380 to 2510 nm at 5 nm sampling with a ground sampling distance ranging from 4 to 8 m and flight altitude of 4-8 km. On-board and ground-based calibration and processing were carried out to generate level 0 (L0) and level 1 (L1) products respectively. An atmospheric correction scheme has been developed to convert the measured radiances to surface reflectance (level 2). These spectroscopic signatures are intended to discriminate surface types and retrieve physical and compositional parameters for the study of terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric properties. The results from this campaign will support a range of objectives, including demonstration of advanced applications for societal benefits, validation of models/techniques, development of state-of-the-art spectral libraries, testing and refinement of automated tools for users, and definition of requirements for future space-based missions that can provide this class of measurements routinely for a range of important applications.

An empirical comparison of calibration and validation methodologies for airborne imaging spectroscopy	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Hyperspectral measurements; radiative transfer; reflectance; vicarious calibration	ABSOLUTE RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; VICARIOUS CALIBRATION; SENSORS; SITES; ASTER	To date, a large number of existing applications in India have used multi-band observations from airborne and spaceborne platforms. New sensors are providing additional capabilities thanks to special aerial missions with the compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI), the short-wave infrared (SWIR) full spectrum imager (SFSI) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Next Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). Opportunities to exploit quantitative spectroscopic signatures and high spatial resolution have garnered great interest among the scientific community, and the success of these missions will rely on accurate calibration. Here we focus on a vicarious calibration experiment conducted for the AVIRIS-NG India campaign. We discuss initial validation results, with descriptions of in situ and remote calibration and measurement protocols, geometric processing with precise position and attitude data, and atmospheric simulations used to validate the remote measurement. A partnership between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA investigators proved a unique opportunity to assess the empirical variability in results, indicating their sensitivity to modelling choices and assumptions. The vicarious calibration exercise uses multiple radiative transfer models, including MODTRAN 6.0 and a new version of the 6S radiative transfer code, viz. 6SV2.1, which is capable of accounting for polarization.

Self-Assembling Ice Membranes on Europa: Brinicle Properties, Field Examples, and Possible Energetic Systems in Icy Ocean Worlds	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Europa; Brinicles; Icy ocean worlds; Ice membranes; Chemical gardens	CHEMICAL GARDENS; SEA-ICE; SUBSURFACE WATER; SHELL THICKNESS; CHAOS FORMATION; ORIGIN; GENERATION; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; SEAWATER	Brinicles are self-assembling tubular ice membrane structures, centimeters to meters in length, found beneath sea ice in the polar regions of Earth. We discuss how the properties of brinicles make them of possible importance for chemistry in cold environments-including that of life's emergence-and we consider their formation in icy ocean worlds. We argue that the non-ice composition of the ice on Europa and Enceladus will vary spatially due to thermodynamic and mechanical properties that serve to separate and fractionate brines and solid materials. The specifics of the composition and dynamics of both the ice and the ocean in these worlds remain poorly constrained. We demonstrate through calculations using FREZCHEM that sulfate likely fractionates out of accreting ice in Europa and Enceladus, and thus that an exogenous origin of sulfate observed on Europa's surface need not preclude additional endogenous sulfate in Europa's ocean. We suggest that, like hydrothermal vents on Earth, brinicles in icy ocean worlds constitute ideal places where ecosystems of organisms might be found.

The explosion impact	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; ISM: kinematics and dynamics; ISM: clouds; evolution; ISM: molecules; ISM: individual objects: Orion KL	SYSTEM; NEBULA	The chemistry of complex organic molecules in interstellar dark clouds is still highly uncertain in part because of the lack of constraining observations. Orion is the closest massive star-forming region, and observations making use of ALMA allow us to separate the emission regions of various complex organic molecules (COMs) in both velocity and space. Orion also benefits from an exceptional situation, in that it is the site of a powerful explosive event that occurred similar to 550 years ago. We show that the closely surrounding Kleinmann-Low region has clearly been influenced by this explosion; some molecular species have been pushed away from the densest parts while others have remained in close proximity. This dynamical segregation reveals the time dependence of the chemistry and, therefore allows us to better constrain the formation sequence of COMs and other species, including deuterated molecules.

ATLAS probe: Breakthrough science of galaxy evolution, cosmology, Milky Way, and the Solar System	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						Galaxies: evaluation; cosmology: observations; space vehicles: instruments	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; EMISSION-LINE; DARK ENERGY; KUIPER-BELT; LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS; ULTRAVIOLET-SPECTRA; MAIN-SEQUENCE; DWARFS	Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy Probe is a concept for a National Aeronautics and Space Administration probe-class space mission that will achieve ground-breaking science in the fields of galaxy evolution, cosmology, Milky Way, and the Solar System. It is the follow-up space mission toWide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), boosting its scientific return by obtaining deep 1-4 mu m slit spectroscopy for similar to 70% of all galaxies imaged by the similar to 2 000 deg(2) WFIRST High Latitude Survey at z > 0.5. Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy will measure accurate and precise redshifts for similar to 200M galaxies out to z < 7, and deliver spectra that enable a wide range of diagnostic studies of the physical properties of galaxies over most of cosmic history. Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy Probe and WFIRST together will produce a 3D map of the Universe over 2 000 deg(2), the definitive data sets for studying galaxy evolution, probing dark matter, dark energy and modifications of General Relativity, and quantifying the 3D structure and stellar content of the Milky Way. Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy Probe science spans four broad categories: (1) Revolutionising galaxy evolution studies by tracing the relation between galaxies and darkmatter from galaxy groups to cosmic voids and filaments, from the epoch of reionisation through the peak era of galaxy assembly; (2) Opening a new window into the dark Universe by weighing the dark matter filaments using 3D weak lensing with spectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energy and modification of General Relativity using galaxy clustering; (3) Probing the Milky Way's dust-enshrouded regions, reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and (4) Exploring the formation history of the outer Solar System by characterising Kuiper Belt Objects. Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy Probe is a 1.5m telescope with a field of view of 0.4 deg(2), and uses digital micro-mirror devices as slit selectors. It has a spectroscopic resolution of R = 1 000, and a wavelength range of 1-4 mu m. The lack of slit spectroscopy from space over a wide field of view is the obvious gap in current and planned future space missions; Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy fills this big gap with an unprecedented spectroscopic capability based on digital micro-mirror devices (with an estimated spectroscopic multiplex factor greater than 5 000). Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy is designed to fit within theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration probe-class space mission cost envelope; it has a single instrument, a telescope aperture that allows for a lighter launch vehicle, and mature technology (we have identified a path for digital micro-mirror devices to reach Technology Readiness Level 6 within 2 yr). Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy Probe will lead to transformative science over the entire range of astrophysics: from galaxy evolution to the dark Universe, from Solar System objects to the dusty regions of the MilkyWay.

To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14months and analyzed upon return to Earth.ResultsThe cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 10(4) to 10(9) CFU/m(2) depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured.ConclusionsThe results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

A small number of these systems contain gaseous debris discs, visible through emission lines. We report a stable 123.4-minute periodic variation in the strength and shape of the Ca II emission line profiles originating from the debris disc around the white dwarf SDSS J122859.93+104032.9. We interpret this short-period signal as the signature of a solid-body planetesimal held together by its internal strength.

Tactile Sensing and Control of Robotic Manipulator Integrating Fiber Bragg Grating Strain-Sensor	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						robotics; manipulation tasks; fiber bragg gratings; tactile sensors; sensorized hand	DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION; HUMAN HAND; SYSTEM; SKIN; TECHNOLOGIES; DESIGN; UNITS	Tactile sensing is an instrumental modality of robotic manipulation, as it provides information that is not accessible via remote sensors such as cameras or lidars. Touch is particularly crucial in unstructured environments, where the robot's internal representation of manipulated objects is uncertain. In this study we present the sensorization of an existing artificial hand, with the aim to achieve fine control of robotic limbs and perception of object's physical properties. Tactile feedback is conveyed by means of a soft sensor integrated at the fingertip of a robotic hand. The sensor consists of an optical fiber, housing Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) transducers, embedded into a soft polymeric material integrated on a rigid hand. Through several tasks involving grasps of different objects in various conditions, the ability of the system to acquire information is assessed. Results show that a classifier based on the sensor outputs of the robotic hand is capable of accurately detecting both size and rigidity of the operated objects (99.36 and 100% accuracy, respectively). Furthermore, the outputs provide evidence of the ability to grab fragile objects without breakage or slippage e and to perform dynamic manipulative tasks, that involve the adaptation of fingers position based on the grasped objects' condition.

OSIRIS-REx Team	The unexpected surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu	NATURE			English	Article							LIGHTCURVE; REGOLITH; ORIGIN	NASA'S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic molecules and volatiles such as water to Earth(1). Bennu is a lowalbedo B-type asteroid(2) that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites(3). Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine-that is, not affected by these processes(4). The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu's global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale(5-11). Here we consider early OSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid's properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu's thermal inertia(12) and radar polarization ratios(13)-which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles-resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling strategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres(4). We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success.	[Lauretta, D.

Ara			Visualizing vibrational normal modes of a single molecule with atomically confined light	NATURE			English	Article							TIP-ENHANCED RAMAN; SPECTROMICROSCOPY; SCATTERING; RESOLUTION; ATOMS; FIELD	The internal vibrations of molecules drive the structural transformations that underpin chemistry and cellular function. While vibrational frequencies are measured by spectroscopy, the normal modes of motion are inferred through theory because their visualization would require microscopy with angstrom-scale spatial resolution-nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit in optics(1). Using a metallic tip to focus light and taking advantage of the surface-enhanced Raman effect(2) to amplify the signal from individual molecules, tip-enhanced Raman spectromicroscopy (TER-SM)(3,4) reaches the requisite sub-molecular spatial resolution(5), confirming that light can be confined in picocavities(6-10) and anticipating the direct visualization of molecular vibrations(11-13). Here, by using TER-SM at the precisely controllable junction of a cryogenic ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope(14-16), we show that angstrom-scale resolution is attained at subatomic separation between the tip atom and a molecule in the quantum tunnelling regime of plasmons(6,8,9,17). We record vibrational spectra within a single molecule, obtain images of normal modes and atomically parse the intramolecular charges and currents driven by vibrations. Our analysis provides a paradigm for optics in the atomistic near-field.	[Lee, Joonhee; Crampton, Kevin T.; Tallarida, Nicholas; Apkarian, V.

The algorithm is based on direct nonlinear least squares fitting of radiances from the spectral range 319.0-347.5 nm. Radiances are modeled from the solar irradiance, attenuated by contributions from BrO and interfering gases, and including rotational Raman scattering, additive and multiplicative closure polynomials, correction for Nyquist undersampling and the average fitting residual spectrum. The retrieval uses albedo- and wavelength-dependent air mass factors (AMFs), which have been pre-computed using a single mostly stratospheric BrO profile. The BrO cross sections are multiplied by the wavelength-dependent AMFs before fitting so that the vertical column densities (VCDs) are retrieved directly. The fitting uncertainties of BrO VCDs typically vary between 4 and 7 x 10(12) molecules cm(-2) (similar to 10 %20 % of the measured BrO VCDs). Additional fitting uncertainties can be caused by the interferences from O-2-O-2 and H2CO and their correlation with BrO. AMF uncertainties are estimated to be around 10 % when the single stratosphericonly BrO profile is used. However, under conditions of high tropospheric concentrations, AMF errors due to this assumption of profile can be as high as 50 %. The retrievals agree well with GOME-2 observations at simultaneous nadir overpasses and with ground-based zenith-sky measurements at Harestua, Norway, with mean biases less than -0.22 +/- 1.13 x 10(13) and 0.12 +/- 0.76 x 10(13) molecules cm(-2), respectively. Global distribution and seasonal variation of OMI BrO are generally consistent with previous satellite observations. Finally, we confirm the capacity of OMBRO retrievals to observe enhancements of BrO over the US Great Salt Lake despite the current retrieval setup considering a stratospheric profile in the AMF calculations. OMBRO retrievals also show significant BrO enhancements from the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, although the BrO retrievals are affected under high SO2 loading conditions by the sub-optimum choice of SO2 cross sections.

A unique bio-physical dataset at high-resolution collected by a southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) reveals a conspicuous increase in foraging activity at the standing meander site up to 5 times larger than during the rest of her three-month trip west of the Kerguelen Islands. Here, we propose a physical explanation for such high biological activity based on the study of small-scale fronts with scales of 5 to 20 km, also called submesoscales. The standing meander is associated with intensified frontal dynamics at submesoscale, not observed in the rest of the region. Results shed new light on the spatial distribution of submesoscale fronts in the under-sampled area west of the Kerguelen plateau and emphasize their importance for upper trophic levels. Despite that most elephant seals target foraging grounds east of the Kerguelen Plateau, our findings suggest that excursions to the west are not accidental, and may be explained by the recurrently elevated physical and biological activity of the site. As such, other standing meanders of the ACC may also act as biological hotspots where trophic interactions are stimulated by submesoscale turbulence.

The glacial isostatic adjustment is accounted for by a regional model that is constrained by global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) uplift observations. Further corrections are applied concerning the effect of mass variations in the ocean, in the continental water storage, and of the Antarctic ice sheet. The 161 monthly GRACE gravity field solutions are inverted in the spatial domain through the adjustment of scaling factors applied to a-priori ice mass change patterns based on published remote sensing results for the Southern and Northern Patagonian Icefields, respectively. We infer an ice mass change rate of -24.4 +/- 4.7 Gt/a for the Patagonian Icefields between April 2002 and June 2017, which corresponds to a contribution to the eustatic sea level rise of 0.067 +/- 0.013 mm/a. Our time series of monthly ice mass changes reveals no indication for an acceleration in ice mass loss. We find indications that the Northern Patagonian Icefield contributes more to the integral ice loss than previously assumed.

The risk of Staphylococcus skin infection during space travel and mitigation strategies	MICROBIAL RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						ISS microbial observatory; Staphylococcus aureus; Skin infection; Cleaning regimen; Microbial transfer rate; QMRA	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS; AUREUS INFECTIONS; GROWTH; FLIGHT; MICROGRAVITY; EXPRESSION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ANTIBIOTICS; SPACEFLIGHT	Among numerous challenges facing space travellers, microbial infection is one of the unknown risks associated with human spaceflight. Prevention and control of microbial infections are of critical concern during space missions. The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to model the risk of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection and mitigation strategies that may effectively reduce skin infection risks. QMRA was carried out by incorporating the level of S. aureus contamination from International Space Station Microbial Observatory Experiment, bacterial transfer rate to skin, growth pattern of S. aureus on skin, space travellers' daily behaviour and dose-response model. The results demonstrate that a daily skin cleaning regimen has a significant effect on reducing the skin infection risks. Once a day skin cleaning reduces infection risk by 84.2% and twice a day skin cleaning can reduce the risk of skin infection by 96.1% during a seven-day space mission. Frequency of contact with contaminated surfaces and time elapsed between cleaning events are the most important input parameters that contribute to the overall risk outcome. There are degrees of uncertainties associated with the predicted outcomes when interpreted by itself due to the limitation of microbial data and the dose-response model that derived from a short-term clinical study on Earth. The comparative risk analysis as used in this study offers a scientific basis regarding the effectiveness of interventions (skin cleaning regimens) in mitigating skin infection risks during spaceflight.

Thanks to the high effective galaxy number density of similar to 17 arcmin(-2), even after conservative cuts such as a magnitude cut of i < 24.5 and photometric redshift cut of 0.3 <= z <= 1.5, we obtain a high-significance measurement of the cosmic shear power spectra in four tomographic redshift bins, achieving a total signal-to-noise ratio of 16 in the multipole range 300 <= l <= = 1900. We carefully account for various uncertainties in our analysis including the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, scatters and biases in photometric redshifts, residual uncertainties in the shear measurement, and modeling of the matter power spectrum. The accuracy of our power spectrummeasurement method as well as our analytic model of the covariance matrix are tested against realistic mock shear catalogs. For a flat Lambda cold dark matter model, we find S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(alpha) = 0.800(-0.028)(+0.029) for alpha = 0.45 (S-8 = 0.780(-0.033)(+0.030) for alpha = 0.5) from our HSC tomographic cosmic shear analysis alone. In comparison with Planck cosmic microwave background constraints, our results prefer slightly lower values of S8, although metrics such as the Bayesian evidence ratio test do not show significant evidence for discordance between these results. We study the effect of possible additional systematic errors that are unaccounted for in our fiducial cosmic shear analysis, and find that they can shift the best-fit values of S-8 by up to similar to 0.6 sigma in both directions. The full HSC survey data will contain several times more area, and will lead to significantly improved cosmological constraints.

Recent yield studies of direct-imaging missions have focused primarily on yield methods and trade studies using "toy" models of missions. Here, we increase the fidelity of these calculations substantially, adopting more realistic exoplanet demographics as input, an improved target list, and a realistic distribution of exozodi levels. Most importantly, we define standardized inputs for instrument simulations, use these standards to directly compare the performance of realistic instrument designs, include the sensitivity of coronagraph contrast to stellar diameter, and adopt engineering-based throughputs and detector parameters. We apply these new high-fidelity yield models to study several critical design trades: monolithic versus segmented primary mirrors (PMs), on-axis versus off-axis secondary mirrors, and coronagraphs versus starshades. We show that as long as the gap size between segments is sufficiently small (<0.1% of telescope diameter), there is no difference in yield for coronagraph-based missions with monolithic off-axis telescopes and segmented off-axis telescopes, assuming that the requisite engineering constraints imposed by the coronagraph can be met in both scenarios. We show that there is currently a factor of similar to 2 yield penalty for coronagraph-based missions with on-axis telescopes compared to off-axis telescopes, and note that there is room for improvement in coronagraph designs for on-axis telescopes. We also reproduce previous results in higher fidelity, showing that the yields of coronagraph-based missions continue to increase with aperture size while the yields of starshade-based missions turnover at large apertures if refueling is not possible. Finally, we provide absolute yield numbers with uncertainties that include all major sources of astrophysical noise to guide future mission design.

Response of the Geospace System to the Solar Wind Dynamic Pressure Decrease on 11 June 2017: Numerical Models and Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							MAGNETOSPHERIC VORTICES; ENHANCEMENT; SIMULATION; AURORA; IMPULSE; PULSE	On 11 June 2017, a sudden solar wind dynamic pressure decrease occurred at 1437 UT according to the OMNI solar wind data. The solar wind velocity did not change significantly, while the density dropped from 42 to 10 cm(-3) in a minute. The interplanetary magnetic field B-Z was weakly northward during the event, while the B-Y changed from positive to negative. Using the University of Michigan Block Adaptive Tree Solarwind Roe Upwind Scheme global magnetohydrodynamic code, the global responses to the decrease in the solar wind dynamic pressure were studied. The simulation revealed that the magnetospheric expansion consisted of two phases similar to the responses during magnetospheric compression, namely, a negative preliminary impulse and a negative main impulse phase. The simulated plasma flow and magnetic fields reasonably reproduced the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms and Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft in situ observations. Two separate pairs of dawn-dusk vortices formed during the expansion of the magnetosphere, leading to two separate pairs of field-aligned current cells. The effects of the flow and auroral precipitation on the ionosphere-thermosphere (I-T) system were investigated using the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model driven by simulated ionospheric electrodynamics. The perturbations in the convection electric fields caused enhancements in the ion and electron temperatures. This study shows that, like the well-studied sudden solar wind pressure increases, sudden pressure decreases can have large impacts in the coupled I-T system. In addition, the responses of the I-T system depend on the initial convection flows and field-aligned current profiles before the solar wind pressure perturbations.

UV Study of the Fourth Positive Band System of CO and O I 135.6 nm From Electron Impact on CO and CO2	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROMETER EXPERIMENT; EMISSION CROSS-SECTIONS; KINETIC-ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS; OXYGEN-CONTAINING MOLECULES; DISSOCIATIVE EXCITATION; VACUUM-ULTRAVIOLET; EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET; CARBON-MONOXIDE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; METASTABLE FRAGMENTS	We have measured the 30 and 100 eV far ultraviolet (FUV) emission cross sections of the optically allowed Fourth Positive Group (4PG) band system (A(1)Pi -> X-1 Sigma(+)) of CO and the optically forbidden O (S-5(o) -> P-3) 135.6 nm atomic transition by electron-impact-induced-fluorescence of CO and CO2. We present a model excitation cross section from threshold to high energy for the A(1)Pi state, including cascade by electron impact on CO. The A(1)Pi state is perturbed by triplet states leading to an extended FUV glow from electron excitation of CO. We derive a model FUV spectrum of the 4PG band system from dissociative excitation of CO2, an important process observed on Mars and Venus. Our unique experimental setup consists of a large vacuum chamber housing an electron gun system and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph optical engineering unit, operating in the FUV (110-170 nm). The determination of the total O I (S-5(o)) at 135.6 nm emission cross section is accomplished by measuring the cylindrical glow pattern of the metastable emission from electron impact by imaging the glow intensity about the electron beam from nominally zero to similar to 400 mm distance from the electron beam. The study of the glow pattern of O I (135.6 nm) from dissociative excitation of CO and CO2 indicates that the O I (S-5(o)) state has a kinetic energy of similar to 1 eV by modeling the radial glow pattern with the published lifetime of 180 mu s for the O I (S-5(o)) state. Plain Language Summary Both Mars and Venus have upper atmospheres that are similar in composition: mostly CO2, CO, and N-2 are dominant molecular gases, with nearly identical UV spectra. The modeling studies of atmospheric UV emissions cannot presently be accurately conducted to the same accuracy as the planetary UV measurements, which avail themselves with state-of-the-art calibrated spectrographs. This dichotomy in accuracy between planetary observation and model occurs because the atomic and molecular emission cross sections with uncertainties of certain transitions are greater than 100%. Furthermore, the analysis is complicated by the spectral blending of the various emissions of the low-resolution spectral spaceborne instruments. We present in this paper a UV laboratory instrument unique in the world at the University of Colorado that can measure for the first time the excitation mechanisms with accurate emission cross sections of both allowed and optically forbidden transitions that are occurring in a planetary atmosphere.

Avoiding Conflicts between Future Freshwater Algae Production and Water Scarcity in the United States at the Energy-Water Nexus	WATER			English	Article						algal biofuels; water allocation; water temperature; bioenergy; sustainability indicators; water scarcity; trade-offs; instream flow; energy-water nexus; visualization	BIOFUEL PRODUCTION; MICROALGAE CULTIVATION; RENEWABLE DIESEL; FLOW; FOOTPRINT; EMISSIONS; BIOENERGY; RESOURCE; INCREASE; IMPACTS	Sustainable production of algae will depend on understanding trade-offs at the energy-water nexus. Algal biofuels promise to improve the environmental sustainability profile of renewable energy along most dimensions. In this assessment of potential US freshwater production, we assumed sustainable production along the carbon dimension by simulating placement of open ponds away from high-carbon-stock lands (forest, grassland, and wetland) and near sources of waste CO 2. Along the water dimension, we quantified trade-offs between water scarcity and production for an upstream' indicator (measuring minimum water supply) and a downstream' indicator (measuring impacts on rivers). For the upstream indicator, we developed a visualization tool to evaluate algae production for different thresholds for water surplus. We hypothesized that maintaining a minimum seasonal water surplus would also protect river habitat for aquatic biota. Our study confirmed that ensuring surplus water also reduced the duration of low-flow events, but only above a threshold. We also observed a trade-off between algal production and the duration of low-flow events in streams. These results can help to guide the choice of basin-specific sustainability targets to avoid conflicts with competing water users at this energy-water nexus. Where conflicts emerge, alternative water sources or enclosed photobioreactors may be needed for algae cultivation.

Moreover, their stochastic extensions have enabled risk-aware path planning, which explicitly limits the probability of failure to a user-specified bound. However, a major challenge of those path planning methods is constraint violation between discrete time steps. In the existing approach, a path is represented by a sequence of waypoints and the safety constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) are imposed on waypoints. Therefore, the trajectory between waypoints could violate the safety constraints. A naive continuous-time extension results in unrealistic computation cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to ensure constraint satisfaction between waypoints without employing a continuous-time formulation. The key idea is to enforce that the same inequality constraint is satisfied on any two adjacent time steps, under assumptions of polygonal obstacles and straight line trajectory between waypoints. The resulting problem encoding is MILP, which can be solved efficiently by commercial solvers. Thus, we also introduce novel extensions to risk-allocation path planners with improved scalability for real-world scenarios and run-time performance. While the proposed encoding approach is general, the particular emphasis of this paper is placed on the chance-constrained, nonconvex path-planning problem (CNPP). We provide extensive simulation results on CNPP to demonstrate the path safety and scalability of our encoding and related path planners.

Quantum Network of Cooperative Unmanned Autonomous Systems	UNMANNED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Unmanned systems; quantum network; quantum entanglement; quantum cryptography; networked dynamical systems; multi-agent networks; autonomous vehicles; distributed control; quantum robots	ENTANGLEMENT; CONSENSUS; AGENTS	A quantum network may be realized by the entanglement of particles communicated by qubits between quantum computers, where the entangled photons of light are transferred for communication purposes. This technology has been proven to be feasible experimentally through free-space distribution of entangled photon pairs. Sending photons of light through nonlinear crystals produces correlated photon pairs, by splitting each photon into two half particles with each particle having the same level of energy, which results in entangled pairs. This entanglement is represented by photons, having both either horizontal or vertical polarization. This paper investigates collaborative robotic tasks of unmanned systems in a network where the agents are entangled. For instance, a leader robot sends two identical photons (e.g. with vertical polarization) to two follower robots/autonomous vehicles to communicate information about various tasks such as swarm, formation, trajectory tracking, path following and collaborative tasks. The potential advantages of quantum cooperation of robotic agents is the speed of the process, the ability to achieve security with immunity against cyberattacks, and fault tolerance, through entanglement. If a Quantum Network is implemented in a robotic application, it would present an effective solution; for example, for a group of unmanned systems working securely together. An analytical basis of such systems is investigated in this paper, and the formulation of quantum cooperation of unmanned systems is presented and discussed. The concept of experimental quantum entanglement, as well as quantum cryptography (QC), for robotics applications is presented.

J	Anderson, MS				Anderson, Mark S.			The Detection of Long-Chain Bio-Markers Using Atomic Force Microscopy	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						long-chain bio-markers 2; AFM 3; tip enhanced spectroscopy	SPECTROSCOPY; BIOMARKERS	The detection of long-chain biomolecules on mineral surfaces is presented using an atomic force microscope (AFM). This is achieved by using the AFM's ability to manipulate molecules and measure forces at the pico-newton scale. We show that a highly characteristic force-distance signal is produced when the AFM tip is used to detach long-chain molecules from a surface. This AFM force spectroscopy method is demonstrated on bio-films, spores, fossils and mineral surfaces. The method works with AFM imaging and correlated tip enhanced infrared spectroscopy. The use of AFM force spectroscopy to detect this class of long chain bio-markers has applications in paleontology, life detection and planetary science.

Both eruptions were characterized by a rapid and intense initial phase, with multiple eruptive vents, leading to the formation of large 'a'(a) over bar lava fields and scarce pahoehoe mostly associated with the waning phases. The 1982 eruption started on 28 August from an intra-caldera vent that produced high lava fountains, as well as a radial fissure on the SE flank. The whole eruption lasted for at least 9 days and generated similar to 52.5E + 6 m(3) DRE (dense rock equivalent) of lava. The 2015 eruption started on 25 May from a circumferential fissure that produced high lava fountains and deposited reticulite scoria on the flanks of the volcano. For the first time since the onset of volcano monitoring in Galapagos, we report cryptotephra from the 2015 eruption reaching and depositing in mainland Ecuador, 1400 km away from the source. Lava from the 2015 circumferential vents covered similar to 18.5 km(2) on the SE and E flanks. On 13 June 2015, the eruption switched to an intra-caldera vent that was active until 30 June, and produced lava flows that covered most of the caldera floor. The 2015 eruption lasted 36 days and produced similar to 87E + 6 m(3) DRE of lava, making it the fourth largest eruption in Galapagos since the eruption of Sierra Negra in 1979. We use combined ground-based geophysical surveillance, remote sensing, eyewitness accounts, and detailed field work to constrain the eruptive dynamics of this remote volcano. Our approach allows quantification of eruption rates, which are critical for understanding volcanic systems and for hazard assessment. First order rheological calculations permit us to further constrain the eruption dynamics and emplacement of the lava fields. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deanne; Niles, Paul B.; Cuadros, J.; Ashley, James W.; Johnson, Sarah Stewart			The Geology and Astrobiology of McLaughlin Crater, Mars: An Ancient Lacustrine Basin Containing Turbidites, Mudstones, and Serpentinites	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; clay minerals; astrobiology; infrared; abiogenesis; serpentine	MAWRTH VALLIS REGION; LONAR LAKE; SURFACE; IDENTIFICATION; MINERALS; STRATIGRAPHY; SUBSURFACE; CHRONOLOGY; DIVERSITY; MIXTURES	McLaughlin crater is a 92-km diameter complex crater that formed on Mars 4 billion years ago. The resulting basin was the site of a large (3,000km(2)), deep (500m), voluminous (1,500km(3)) Martian lake circa 3.8Ga. While there is strong evidence that hundreds of lakes have existed on Mars at some point during the same time period, the geology of McLaughlin crater is extraordinary for a number of reasons. Detailed spectral analyses show that the deep-water sediments include detrital inputs of olivine and pyroxene, but the lake-floor sediments include lithologies with abundant Fe-rich, Mg-bearing smectite, serpentine-rich deposits, and ferrihydrite. For astrobiologists, this site provides a treasure trove of high-priority targets. Serpentinization reactions are thought to have played a key role in abiogenesis on Earth, and within McLaughlin crater, deposits of subterranean and probably sublacustrine serpentinites are well preserved. In addition, delta sequences are well exposed throughout the east side of the basin; such deposits are endorsed by some as the highest priority targets for preservation of organics on Mars. Yet deep-water turbidites, which might have flowed through hydrothermal environments, may be the most intriguing aspect of this geology. Such rapid sedimentation could have sequestered and preserved any potential organic materials for future exploration by a rover. Plain Language Summary Though Mars is cold, dry, and inhospitable today, it contains evidence for many dry lake bedsrelics of an ancient climate that was at least episodically warmer and wetter. Considering that lakes can be an excellent environments for life on Earth, a common thread of Mars research has been to characterize the environmental conditions under which Martian lakes formed in order to better understand their implications for past habitability of the red planet. The goal of this work is to characterize the geology of McLaughlin crater, where a lake existed on Mars over 3.8 billion years ago. McLaughlin lake was vast, deep (500m), and probably long lived. Many characteristics of McLaughlin lake are unlike those seen in any other ancient lake basins on Mars. This lake contained a range of sedimentary environments including delta deposits, shallow-water fan deposits, and deep-water, fine-grained materials. It is the only known place on Mars where fine-grained, subaqueous landslides called turbidites are identified, and these are important because we know that such deposits can be sites of excellent preservation of organic matter on Earth (due to rapid burial).

Recently Formed Crater Clusters on Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						impact cratering; Mars; crater clusters	METEORITE IMPACTS; RATES; SIZE; AGE	This study maps and measures assorted properties of new dated crater clusters that formed recently when impactors fragmented in the atmosphere of Mars. We report these statistics for 77 clusters: number of craters, size of cluster, dispersion of cluster, direction (azimuth) from which the impactor approached, and an estimate of the angle from vertical of the impact. Clusters range from a few to hundreds of craters, with most containing tens of craters. They are most commonly dispersed over hundreds of meters, with extents ranging from a few meters to a few kilometers. We find that dispersion generally does not correlate with topographic elevation. However, when the highest elevations are disregarded, clusters are more dispersed at lower elevations, as expected. Impact azimuths are randomly distributed and do not express a clear directionality of incoming meteoroids. Results suggest impacts occur closer to horizontal than expected, which could be due to observational effects. The characteristics we report here provide important constraints for future work in understanding atmospheric fragmentation processes; properties of the impactors themselves, such as density and orbital parameters; and the seismic detectability of impacts. These are critical aspects to understand, as approximately half of current impacts are observed to be clusters. Plain Language Summary We studied clusters of new craters that formed in the last few years when meteoroids broke up in the atmosphere of Mars. We studied 77 clusters and measured the number of craters, the sizes of the clusters, how spread out the clusters are, the direction the impactors came from, and the angle of the impacts. Clusters range from a few to hundreds of craters, with most containing tens of craters. They are usually spread out over hundreds of meters, ranging from a few meters to a few kilometers. Except for the highest areas, clusters are more spread out at lower elevations, as expected. Impactors come from all different directions. Impacts are closer to horizontal than expected. This information will be used to understand breakup in the Martian atmosphere; properties of the incoming meteoroids, such as their density and orbits; and how well we would be able to detect impacts with a seismometer. This is important because about half of current impacts at Mars are clusters.	[Daubar, I. J.; Golombek, M. P.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Banks, M.

J	Galetto, F; Bagnardi, M; Acocella, V; Hooper, A				Galetto, Federico; Bagnardi, Marco; Acocella, Valerio; Hooper, Andrew			Noneruptive Unrest at the Caldera of Alcedo Volcano (Galapagos Islands) Revealed by InSAR Data and Geodetic Modeling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						caldera; unrest; Alcedo; InSAR; resurgence	SIERRA NEGRA VOLCANO; WESTERN GALAPAGOS; LITHOSPHERIC STRUCTURE; SURFACE DEFORMATION; SPREADING-CENTER; MELTING BENEATH; MAGMA; MORPHOLOGY; ARCHIPELAGO; STRESS	Understanding volcanic unrest is crucial to forecasting eruptions. At active mafic calderas unrest culminates in eruption more frequently than at felsic calderas. However, the mafic caldera of Alcedo Volcano (Ecuador) has experienced repeated episodes of unrest without erupting, since at least 1992, when geodetic monitoring began. Here we investigate the unrest that occurred between 2007 and 2011 using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and geodetic modeling. We observe an initial asymmetric uplift of the southern caldera floor (30cm of vertical motion) from 2007 to 2009, followed by subsidence of the uplifted area and contemporary uplift of the northwestern caldera rim between January and June 2010. Finally, from June 2010 through March 2011, caldera uplift resumed. The first uplift episode is best explained by inflation of a sill and the activation of an inner ring fault. Successive caldera subsidence and rim uplift are compatible with the withdrawal of magma from the previously inflated sill and its northwestern migration. The resumption of uplift is consistent with the repressurization of the sill. This evolution suggests episodic magma emplacement in a shallow reservoir beneath the caldera, with aborted lateral magma migration, probably due to the discontinuous supply from depth. This short-term deformation pattern matches well geological observations showing a longer-term (hundreds of years at least) asymmetric uplift of the caldera floor, culminating in a weak resurgence of 30m. We propose that the monitored episodes of uplift represent short-term stages of the rarely observed incremental growth of a resurgent basaltic caldera.

In this paper, we analyze four years (2015-2018) of global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) XCO2 anomalies and their annual variations and seasonal patterns. We show that the anomaly patterns in the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction, XCO2, are robust and consistent from year-to-year. We evaluate the method by comparing the anomalies to fluxes from anthropogenic, biospheric, and biomass burning and to model-simulated local concentration enhancements. We find that, despite the simplicity of the method, the anomalies describe the spatio-temporal variability of XCO2 (including anthropogenic emissions and seasonal variability related to vegetation and biomass burning) consistently with more complex model-based approaches. We see, for example, that positive anomalies correspond to fossil fuel combustion over the major industrial areas (e.g., China, eastern USA, central Europe, India, and the Highveld region in South Africa), shown as large positive XCO2 enhancements in the model simulations. We also find corresponding positive anomalies and fluxes over biomass burning areas during different fire seasons. On the other hand, the largest negative anomalies correspond to the growing season in the northern middle latitudes, characterized by negative XCO2 enhancements from simulations and high solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) values (indicating the occurrence of photosynthesis). The largest discrepancies between the anomaly patterns and the model-based results are observed in the tropical regions, where OCO-2 shows persistent positive anomalies over every season of every year included in this study. Finally, we demonstrate how XCO2 anomalies enable the detection of anthropogenic signatures for several local scale case studies, both in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. In particular, we analyze the XCO2 anomalies collocated with the recent TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument NO2 observations (used as indicator of anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion) over the Highveld region in South Africa. The results highlight the capability of satellite-based observations to monitor natural and man-made CO2 signatures on global scale.

Robert			L-Band Passive Microwave Data from SMOS for River Gauging Observations in Tropical Climates	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						hydrology; SMOS; satellite gauging; times series; tropical climate; GFDS; altimetry	TOPEX/POSEIDON SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; SOIL-MOISTURE; FLOOD; DISCHARGE; BASIN; HYDROLOGY; PATTERNS; SYSTEM; EXTENT	The Global Flood Detection Systems (GFDS) currently operated at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) is a satellite-based observation system that provides daily stream flow measurements of global rivers. The system was initially established using NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning RadiometerEarth Observing System (AMSR-E) Ka-band passive microwave satellite data. Since its initiation in 2006, the methodology and the GFDS database have been further adapted for data acquired by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) GOES Precipitation Index (GPI), the AMSR2 sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission - Water satellite (GCOM-W1), and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) sensor. This paper extends the same flow monitoring methodology to low frequency (L-band) passive microwave observations obtained by the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sensor that was launched in 2009. A primary focus is tropical climate regions with dense rainforest vegetation (the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the Congo basins) where high-frequency microwave observations from GFDS reveal a significant influence of vegetation cover and atmospheric humidity. In contrast, SMOS passive microwave signatures at the much lower L-band frequency exhibit deeper penetration through the dense vegetation and minimal atmospheric effects, enabling more robust river stage retrievals in these regions. The SMOS satellite river gauging observations are for 2010-2018 and are compared to single-sensor GFDS data over several river sites. To reduce noise, different filtering techniques were tested to select the one most suitable for analysis of the L-band time series information. In-situ water level (stage) measurements from the French Observation Service SO Hybam database were used for validation to further evaluate the performance of the SMOS data series. In addition to GFDS data, water stage information from Jason-2 and Jason-3 altimetry was compared to the microwave results. Correlation of SMOS gauging time series with in-situ stage data revealed a good agreement (r = 0.8-0.94) during the analyzed period of 2010-2018. Moderate correlation was found with both high frequency GFDS data series and altimetry data series. With lower vegetation attenuation, SMOS signatures exhibited a robust linear relationship with river stage without seasonal bias from the complex hysteresis effects that appeared in the Ka-band observations, apparently due to different attenuation impacts through dense forests at different seasonal vegetation stages.

J	Xu, F; Diner, DJ; Dubovik, O; Schechner, Y				Xu, Feng; Diner, David J.; Dubovik, Oleg; Schechner, Yoav			A Correlated Multi-Pixel Inversion Approach for Aerosol Remote Sensing	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						correlated aerosol inversion; radiative transfer; multiangle radiometry; polarimetry	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS; INTEGRAL EQUATIONS; SURFACE REFLECTION; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; NUMERICAL SOLUTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHM; RADIANCE; MODEL	Aerosol retrieval algorithms used in conjunction with remote sensing are subject to ill-posedness. To mitigate non-uniqueness, extra constraints (in addition to observations) are valuable for stabilizing the inversion process. This paper focuses on the imposition of an empirical correlation constraint on the retrieved aerosol parameters. This constraint reflects the empirical dependency between different aerosol parameters, thereby reducing the number of degrees of freedom and enabling accelerated computation of the radiation fields associated with neighboring pixels. A cross-pixel constraint that capitalizes on the smooth spatial variations of aerosol properties was built into the original multi-pixel inversion approach. Here, the spatial smoothness condition is imposed on principal components (PCs) of the aerosol model, and on the corresponding PC weights, where the PCs are used to characterize departures from the mean. Mutual orthogonality and unit length of the PC vectors, as well as zero sum of the PC weights also impose stabilizing constraints on the retrieval. Capitalizing on the dependencies among aerosol parameters and the mutual orthogonality of PCs, a perturbation-based radiative transfer computation scheme is developed. It uses a few dominant PCs to capture the difference in the radiation fields across an imaged area. The approach is tested using 27 observations acquired by the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) during multiple NASA field campaigns and validated using collocated AERONET observations. In particular, aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, aerosol size, and refractive index are compared with AERONET aerosol reference data. Retrieval uncertainty is formulated by accounting for both instrumental errors and the effects of multiple types of constraints.

Ultraviolet Spectroscopy and Photochemistry of SO2/H2O Ices	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						far ultraviolet; photochemistry; spectroscopy; sulfur dioxide; Europa	SULFURIC-ACID; WATER ICE; EUROPA; DIOXIDE; SO2; IMPLANTATION; RADIOLYSIS; SURFACE; ION; RELEVANCE	The presence of sulfur dioxide on the trailing hemisphere of Europa's surface is well-established, and both its presence and its chemistry are influenced by sulfur ion implantation. Particle irradiation is known to be a significant radiolysis source, particularly on the trailing surface, which is subject to particles in Jupiter's plasma torus. Photochemistry driven by solar ultraviolet (UV) photons is also significant. To date, most studies have investigated the effects of vacuum UV radiation, while photochemistry at longer wavelengths is less wellstudied. This work investigates chemical changes in thin, cryogenic films of SO2/H2O at temperatures and pressuresrelevant to Europa's surface when subjected to temperature changes and UV radiation at 147, 206, 254, and 284 nm. Spectra were collected in both the mid-infrared range and the UV range, which elucidates electronic transitions that are less diagnostic but perhaps more applicable to reflectance spectra of solar system bodies. These experiments show irreversible red shifting of the (B) over tilde <- (X) over tilde absorption peak upon heating likely as a result of crystallization and/or thermal chemical reactions. Further, photons with wavelengths up to 284 nm are shown to induce significant chemistry in SO2/H2O mixtures. This in conjunction with the increased solar flux compared to more energetic wavelengths and the strong C <- (X) over tilde and (B ) over tilde <- (X) over tilde absorption bands in SO2 suggests that far-UV radiation plays a significant role in the sulfur cycle on Europa.

The Dominant Global Modes of Recent Internal Sea Level Variability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						sea level; regional; global; variability	EL-NINO; PACIFIC; RISE; OSCILLATION; SHIFT	The advances in the modern sea level observing system have allowed for a new level of knowledge of regional and global sea level in recent years. The combination of data from satellite altimeters, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, and Argo profiling floats has provided a clearer picture of the different contributors to sea level change, leading to an improved understanding of how sea level has changed in the present and, by extension, may change in the future. As the overlap between these records has recently extended past a decade in length, it is worth examining the extent to which internal variability on timescales from intraseasonal to decadal can be separated from long-term trends that may be expected to continue into the future. To do so, a combined modal decomposition based on cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions is performed simultaneously on the three data sets, and the dominant shared modes of variability are analyzed. Modes associated with the trend, seasonal signal, El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and Pacific decadal oscillation are extracted and discussed, and the relationship between regional patterns of sea level change and their associated global signature is highlighted.

J	Hasson, A; Farrar, JT; Boutin, J; Bingham, F; Lee, T				Hasson, Audrey; Farrar, John Thomas; Boutin, Jacqueline; Bingham, Frederick; Lee, Tong			Intraseasonal Variability of Surface Salinity in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Associated With Mesoscale Eddies	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						eddies; mesoscale; salinity; pacific	SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; TEHUANTEPEC; SIGNATURE; FRONTS; RINGS; WAVES; PLUME	Strong variability in sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETPac) on intraseasonal to interannual timescales was studied using data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, Soil Moisture Active Passive, and Aquarius satellite missions. A zonal wave number-frequency spectral analysis of SSS reveals a dominant timescale of 50-180days and spatial scale of 8 degrees-20 degrees of longitude with a distinct seasonal cycle and interannual variability. This intraseasonal SSS signal is detailed in the study of 19 individual ETPac eddies over 2010-2016 identified by their sea level anomalies, propagating westward at a speed of about 17cm/s. ETPac eddies trap and advect water in their core westward up to 40 degrees of longitude away from the coast. The SSS signatures of these eddies, with an average anomaly of 0.5-pss magnitude difference from ambient values, enable the study of their dynamics and the mixing of their core waters with the surroundings. Three categories of eddies were identified according to the location where they were first tracked: (1) in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, (2) in the Gulf of Papagayo, and (3) in the open ocean near 100 degrees W-12 degrees N. They all traveled westward near 10 degrees N latitude. Category 3 is of particular interest, as eddies seeded in the Gulf of Tehuantepec grew substantially in the vicinity of the Clipperton Fracture Zone rise and in a region where the mean zonal currents have anticyclonic shear. The evolution of the SSS signature associated with the eddies indicates the importance of mixing to their dissipation. Plain Language Summary Large (150-250km) and slow-moving (westward 14.5km/day) eddies formed near the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica show anomalies in sea surface salinity. The recent satellite missions (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, Soil Moisture Active Passive, and Aquarius) help us characterize the sea surface salinity signal within the eddies during their entire lifelong journey. We show evidence along the latitude of 10 degrees N that these eddies trap and move waters within their cores with reduced exchanges with outside waters for 1,000 to 2,000km. Three categories of eddies were established according to the location where they first reach detection threshold. Eddies detected in the open ocean are of particular interest, as they are greatly affected (growing rates, timing, and pathways) by the bathymetry of the Clipperton fracture zone (between 5,000 and 2,000m deep) even though their only reach a few hundred meters of depth.

The cloud-free global energy balance and inferred cloud radiative effects: an assessment based on direct observations and climate models	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL; SURFACE IRRADIANCES; SOLAR ABSORPTION; WATER-VAPOR; SHORTWAVE; TOP; SYSTEM; PERSPECTIVE; BUDGETS; CODES	In recent studies we quantified the global mean Earth energy balance based on direct observations from surface and space. Here we infer complementary referenceestimates for its components specifically under cloud-free conditions. While the clear-sky fluxes at the top of atmosphere (TOA) are accurately known from satellite measurements, the corresponding fluxes at the Earth's surface are not equally well established, as they cannot be directly measured from space. This is also evident in 38 global climate models from CMIP5, which are shown to greatly vary in their clear-sky surface radiation budgets. To better constrain the latter, we established new clear-sky reference climatologies of surface downward shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes from worldwide distributed Baseline Surface Radiation Network sites. 33 out of the 38 CMIP5 models overestimate the clear-sky downward shortwave reference climatologies, whereas both substantial overestimations and underestimations are found in the longwave counterparts in some of the models. From the bias structure of the CMIP5 models we infer best estimates for the global mean surface downward clear-sky shortwave and longwave radiation, at 247 and 314 Wm(-2), respectively. With a global mean surface albedo of 13.5% and net shortwave clear-sky flux of 287 Wm(-2) at the TOA this results in a global mean clear-sky surface and atmospheric shortwave absorption of 214 and 73 Wm(-2), respectively. From the newly-established diagrams of the global energy balance under clear-sky and all-sky conditions, we quantify the cloud radiative effects not only at the TOA, but also within the atmosphere and at the surface.

The distribution of differences suggests inconsistencies between the transport simulated by the models, most likely due to the representation of vertical motion. We further demonstrate that these transport differences result in systematic differences in surface CO2 flux estimated by a collection of global atmospheric inverse models using TM5 and GEOS-Chem and constrained by in situ and satellite observations. While the impact on inferred surface fluxes is most easily illustrated in the magnitude of the seasonal cycle of surface CO2 exchange, it is the annual carbon budgets that are particularly relevant for carbon cycle science and policy. We show that inverse model flux estimates for large zonal bands can have systematic biases of up to 1.7PgC/year due to large-scale transport uncertainty. These uncertainties will propagate directly into analysis of the annual meridional CO2 flux gradient between the tropics and northern midlatitudes, a key metric for understanding the location, and more importantly the processes, responsible for the annual global carbon sink. The research suggests that variability among transport models remains the largest source of uncertainty across global flux inversion systems and highlights the importance both of using model ensembles and of using independent constraints to evaluate simulated transport.

Gravity Versus Tectonics: The Case of 2016 Amatrice and Norcia (Central Italy) Earthquakes Surface Coseismic Fractures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						coseismic fractures; nontectonic coseismic surface deformation; Newmark method; Amatrice and Norcia 2016 earthquakes; gravity-induced displacement; quantitative geomorphological analysis	CENTRAL APENNINES; INDUCED LANDSLIDES; LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM; LOMA-PRIETA; DEFORMATIONS; QUATERNARY; DISPLACEMENTS; NORTHRIDGE; FEATURES; VETTORE	The 2016 central Apennines earthquake sequence was caused by slip on an extensional fault system and resulted in sizable coseismic surface deformation. The most evident effects occurred along the western slope of Mount Vettore, a geologically and morphologically complex mountain ridge. Steep topography and rheological contrasts are known to have strongly controlled the coseismic deformation pattern during a number of different earthquakes that occurred in mountainous areas worldwide. Nevertheless, so far the role of seismically induced slope failures has not been taken into account in the interpretation of the surface fractures caused by the 2016 earthquake sequence. We modeled the static and dynamic slope stability along the western flank of Mount Vettore and in the underlying Piano Grande plain. Combining the slope stability analysis with geomorphic and geological analyses, we show that the coseismic fractures are distributed along the most unstable areas of the western flank of Mount Vettore and can be partly explained by shaking-induced mechanisms such as gravity-driven displacement, compaction, and secondary ground failure. Conversely, in the Piano Grande plain the fracture pattern is not affected by topography or rheology contrasts, suggesting that it is positively caused by tectonic faulting. Different processes, such as gravitational and erosional-depositional phenomena, may contribute to the exposure of fault scarps during both the coseismic and interseismic periods. Attributing the surface deformation entirely to tectonic faulting, especially in complex mountainous terrains such as the Apennines, may lead to an incorrect assessment of fault displacement and fault slip rate and hence of seismic hazard.

Future of Planetary Atmospheric, Surface, and Interior Science Using Radio and Laser Links	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						radio metrics; telecommunications links; CubeSats; radio science; Doppler tracking; occultations	OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS; GRAVITY RECOVERY; SPACECRAFT; WINDS; FIELD; MOON	Scientific studies using spacecraft radio links, which are shared with communications and navigation functions, have been carried out on almost every solar system exploration mission in the past five decades. They have led to numerous scientific discoveries as well as technological advances. These radio science experiments have investigated the interior structure of every planet in the solar system and several of their satellites, the Moon, and several comets and asteroids and sounded the atmospheres of every planet in the solar system except Mercury, and the atmospheres of Pluto and several large satellites, the Io Plasma Torus, Saturn's and Uranus' rings, and the solar corona. Future experiments at Mercury, the Jovian system, asteroid Psyche, and other targets are currently in various planning and development phases. Over the next 30years, significant advances in radio and laser link science technologies, including one order of magnitude improvement achievable in range rate and range accuracy and advanced calibration techniques, could enable many additional scientific breakthroughs. Future exploration concepts focus on applications of small spacecraft and entry probes and can include constellations for studies of atmospheric dynamics, interior structures, and surface properties. Selected science-enabling technologies specific to small spacecraft instrumentation on future missions are under study. Examples include field tests of radio scattering to determine surface properties, constellations for high-resolution spatial and temporal atmospheric sounding, small science-quality software-defined transponders, miniature ultrastable oscillators, and advanced radio-metric calibrations at the Deep Space Network.

On the Relative Sensitivity of a Tropical Deep Convective Storm to Changes in Environment and Cloud Microphysical Parameters	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Deep convection; Cloud microphysics; Sensitivity studies; Cloud parameterizations; Data assimilation; Ensembles	VERTICAL WIND SHEAR; COLUMN WATER-VAPOR; PART I; CUMULUS-ENSEMBLE; RESOLVING MODEL; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; SURFACE PROCESSES; MOIST CONVECTION; TRMM LBA; PRECIPITATION	Monte Carlo and Morris screening techniques are used to examine the relative sensitivity of deep convective simulations to changes in initial conditions (IC) versus changes to microphysical parameters (MP). IC are perturbed using a set of empirical orthogonal function-principal component pairs obtained from a database of tropical soundings, while MP are perturbed consistent with their range of realistic values. Monte Carlo experiments provide a broad overview of parameter-output response, while Morris screening techniques identify the most significant influences on specific model output variables. Changes to MP produce a similar order-of-magnitude response in convective hydrologic cycle, dynamics, and latent heating as changes to IC. Changes in IC appear to have a larger effect on radiative fluxes than perturbations to MP. The distribution of low-level latent heating reveals that changes in MP have a larger influence on cold pool properties than changes to the environment. The dominant effects are produced by a subset of cloud MP and thermodynamic structure functions, indicating perturbation of a subset of the control factors may be used to produce most of the variability in a short-term convective-scale ensemble forecast. The most influential MP are the autoconversion threshold, the rain particle size distribution intercept, and the ice particle fall speed parameters. The most influential EOFs are those that correspond to variability in lower- to midtropospheric temperature and water vapor, as well as zonal low-level shear. The results have implications for both the understanding of what influences convective development and the design of ensemble-based prediction and data assimilation systems.

Surface Clutter Discrimination Analysis for Radar Sounding Interferometry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article							SUBSURFACE; ANTARCTICA; GLACIER; ZONE	This paper reports a method to analyze surface clutter discrimination for radar sounding interferometry. Nadir-looking low-frequency radar sounders cannot easily resolve off-nadir surface echoes from subsurface nadir echoes. Sounders equipped with multichannel receivers can use interferometric phase to discriminate whether a feature is at nadir or not. We developed a method to evaluate the performance of this application of interferometry and used it to analyze the selected Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON) instrument on NASA's Europa Clipper mission to Jupiter's moon Europa.

As one of the main data transport protocols of DTN, Licklider transmission protocol (LTP) was proposed by the NASA for reliable data delivery in challenging space environments in which the existing transport protocols of DTN, TCP, and UDP do not perform effectively. Pair-wise comparisons among LTP, TCP, and UDP running in the DTN stack have previously been done using statistical methods; evaluation results and performance analysis are available in the existing LTP research literature. However, there is as yet no solid analytical model of LTP performance in the presence of link disruptions. In this paper, we present an analytical method to predict transmission performance of LTP for reliable file delivery in space vehicle communications with focus on the expected file delivery delay (or latency) over space channels characterized by random link disruptions. Realistic file-transmission experiments using a PC-based infrastructure are presented to validate the analytical models. The analysis and study results presented in this paper are expected to be useful in understanding the impact of transmission conditions and configurations, on the efficiency of LTP when deployed for reliable data delivery in space missions using communication links that are subject to frequent and random interruptions.

However, most SiC sensors require an external power supply, which cannot operate at high temperatures. This letter develops a new sensing technology in a SiC platform based on near field communication to eliminate the requirement for wired power sources. The 3C-SiC temperature sensors were fabricated from a SiC-on-insulator substrate formed by anodic bonding. The sensors functioned based on the thermoresistance of the SiC films with the high TCR of -13 000 ppm/K at 300 K and -3 000 ppm/K at 600 K. The resistancechangeof the sensors was wirelessly measured using a reading coil placed outside of the heating chamber, showing a significant resonant-frequency-shift (-400 ppm/K at 600 K) of the coupling impedance under temperature variation. The proposed technique is promising for the development of wireless wide-band-gap sensors used in extreme conditions.

Operation of YBCO kinetic-inductance bolometers for outer solar system missions	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							NOISE	We developed superconducting kinetic inductance bolometers (KIBs) for hyperspectral imaging in outer solar system missions. Each bolometer is a microwave L-C resonator that will act as an individual pixel in the focal plane of an imaging Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Our devices are fabricated from high temperature superconductor yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), with a superconducting transition temperature of similar to 85 K. The inductors are suspended on thin Si3N4 membranes. Each resonator operates at a unique resonant frequency, and hence, many can be multiplexed on a single feed line using a large number of carrier frequencies. The resonators function as detectors because their resonant frequencies decrease with increasing temperature as the bolometers absorb incident radiation. In this paper, we discuss the thermal properties of a YBCO KIB and its response to signal power to verify that the response is near theoretical predictions. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

OSIRIS-REx Team	Evidence for widespread hydrated minerals on asteroid (101955) Bennu	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE PROPERTIES; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY; ION IRRADIATION; CM; SURFACE; CLASSIFICATION; ORGANICS; ICE; IR	Early spectral data from the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRISREx) mission reveal evidence for abundant hydrated minerals on the surface of near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu in the form of a near-infrared absorption near 2.7 mu m and thermal infrared spectral features that are most similar to those of aqueously altered CM-type carbonaceous chondrites. We observe these spectral features across the surface of Bennu, and there is no evidence of substantial rotational variability at the spatial scales of tens to hundreds of metres observed to date. In the visible and near-infrared (0.4 to 2.4 mu m) Bennu's spectrum appears featureless and with a blue (negative) slope, confirming previous ground-based observations. Bennu may represent a class of objects that could have brought volatiles and organic chemistry to Earth.	[Hamilton, V. E.; Kaplan, H. H.; Bottke, W. F.; Walsh, K.

T. Burbine, F. S. Anderson and J. Joseph provided considerable assistance with early software development for the spectral analysis working group. H. Campins, R. Binzel and E. Dotto participated in discussions of space weathering and the spectral results. C. Wolner provided helpful copyediting support. The J-Asteroid software tool and development team at ASU enabled visualization of the spectral data that was critical to the analysis. The authors also extend their gratitude to the following people without whom this work would not have been possible: the instrument teams at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center (GSFC) and Arizona State University; the spacecraft teams at GSFC, KinetX and Lockheed Martin; the science planning and operations teams at the University of Arizona; and the Science Processing and Operations Center staff at the University of Arizona. INAF is supported by Italian Space Agency agreement no. 2017-37-H.0. The French co-authors acknowledge support from CNES. B.R. acknowledges the support of the Royal Astronomical Society in the form of a research fellowship.		55	50	50	6	41	NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP	LONDON	MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND	2397-3366			NAT ASTRON	Nat.

OSIRIS-REx Team	Properties of rubble-pile asteroid (101955) Bennu from OSIRIS-REx imaging and thermal analysis	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; COLOR VARIATIONS; 433 EROS; SURFACE; REGOLITH; SIZE; DISTRIBUTIONS; LIGHTCURVE; YARKOVSKY; MISSION	Establishing the abundance and physical properties of regolith and boulders on asteroids is crucial for understanding the formation and degradation mechanisms at work on their surfaces. Using images and thermal data from NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft, we show that asteroid (101955) Bennu's surface is globally rough, dense with boulders, and low in albedo. The number of boulders is surprising given Bennu's moderate thermal inertia, suggesting that simple models linking thermal inertia to particle size do not adequately capture the complexity relating these properties. At the same time, we find evidence for a wide range of particle sizes with distinct albedo characteristics. Our findings imply that ages of Bennu's surface particles span from the disruption of the asteroid's parent body (boulders) to recent in situ production (micrometre-scale particles).

OSIRIS-REx Team	The dynamic geophysical environment of (101955) Bennu based on OSIRIS-REx measurements	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							ASTEROIDS	The top-shaped morphology characteristic of asteroid (101955) Bennu, often found among fast-spinning asteroids and binary asteroid primaries, may have contributed substantially to binary asteroid formation. Yet a detailed geophysical analysis of this morphology for a fast-spinning asteroid has not been possible prior to the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission. Combining the measured Bennu mass and shape obtained during the Preliminary Survey phase of the OSIRIS-REx mission, we find a notable transition in Bennu's surface slopes within its rotational Roche lobe, defined as the region where material is energetically trapped to the surface. As the intersection of the rotational Roche lobe with Bennu's surface has been most recently migrating towards its equator (given Bennu's increasing spin rate), we infer that Bennu's surface slopes have been changing across its surface within the last million years. We also find evidence for substantial density heterogeneity within this body, suggesting that its interior is a mixture of voids and boulders. The presence of such heterogeneity and Bennu's top shape are consistent with spin-induced failure at some point in its past, although the manner of its failure cannot yet be determined. Future measurements by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will provide insight into and may resolve questions regarding the formation and evolution of Bennu's top-shape morphology and its link to the formation of binary asteroids.

J	Rabinovitch, J; Katz, I				Rabinovitch, Jason; Katz, Ira			Surface deposition of molecular contaminants in the mars 2020 rover wake	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							WINDS	The Mars 2020 rover has very strict contamination control requirements as it will cache samples on the surface of Mars for possible future return. It is known that the rover will outgas a minor amount of molecular contaminant on the surface of Mars, and numerical simulations using STAR-CCM+ are performed in order to predict the magnitude of the contaminant deposition to the Martian surface in the vicinity of the rover. Outgassing from the Rover Warm Electronics Bay (WEB) is predicted to be the dominant source of contamination for this scenario, and is therefore considered in this work. A flat terrain (i.e., no local topography) and a nominal rover orientation (i.e., no rocks under rover wheels, etc.) is also assumed. This analysis is performed in order to determine whether or not the M2020 rover WEB could self-contaminate a potential sampling site if the rover were to remain in the same location for an extended period of time. Simulations are performed under a variety of surface wind conditions, and it is determined that the predicted level of molecular contaminant deposition to the surface near the rover due to WEB outgassing and the model considered could be a maximum of 9 ng of organic contaminant in one specific location near the rover if the rover were to remain stationary for 100 sols.

Constraints on Mars Aphelion Cloud Belt phase function and ice crystal geometries	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; Mars; Atmosphere; Mars; Climate; Image processing	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; GALE CRATER; DUST; ATMOSPHERE; SCATTERING; AEROSOL	This study constrains the lower bound of the scattering phase function of Martian water ice clouds (WICs) through the implementation of a new observation aboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). The Phase Function Sky Survey (PFSS) was a multiple pointing all-sky observation taken with the navigation cameras (Navcam) aboard MSL. The PFSS was executed 35 times during the Aphelion Cloud Belt (ACB) season of Mars Year 34 over a solar longitude range of L-s = 61.4 degrees - 156.5 degrees. Twenty observations occurred in the morning hours between 06:00 and 09:30 LTST, and 15 runs occurred in the evening hours between 14:30 and 18:00 LTST, with an operationally required 2.5 h gap on either side of local noon due the sun being located near zenith. The resultant WIC phase function was derived over an observed scattering angle range of 18.3 degrees - 152.61 degrees, normalized, and compared with 9 modeled phase functions: seven ice crystal habits and two Martian WIC phase functions currently being implemented in models. Through statistical chi-squared probability tests, the five most probable ice crystal geometries observed in the ACB WICs were aggregates, hexagonal solid columns, hollow columns, plates, and bullet rosettes with p-values greater than or equal to 0.60, 0.57,0.56,0.56, and 0.55, respectively. Droxtals and spheres had p-values of 0.35, and 0.2, making them less probable components of Martian WICs, but still statistically possible ones. Having a better understanding of the ice crystal habit and phase function of Martian water ice clouds directly benefits Martian climate models which currently assume spherical and cylindrical particles.

DES Collaboration	First Cosmology Results Using SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey: Analysis, Systematic Uncertainties, and Validation	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmological parameters; dark energy; supernovae: general	SUPERNOVA LEGACY SURVEY; LIGHT CURVES; HOST GALAXIES; REDSHIFT; CONSTRAINTS; PARAMETERS; AGE; SPECTROSCOPY; PHOTOMETRY; SELECTION	We present the analysis underpinning the measurement of cosmological parameters from 207 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia from the first 3 years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN), spanning a redshift range of 0.017 < z < 0.849. We combine the DES-SN sample with an external sample of 122 low-redshift (z < 0.1) SNe. Ia, resulting in a "DES-SN3YR" sample of 329 SNe Ia. Our cosmological analyses are blinded: after combining our DES-SN3YR distances with constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background, our uncertainties in the measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w, are 0.042. (stat) and 0.059 (stat+syst) at 68% confidence. We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly equal contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias corrections, and instrumental bias corrections. We also include several new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample is less than one-third the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on w are only larger by 1.4x, showing the impact of the DES-SN. Ia light-curve quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization parameters of the DES-SNe. Ia are in agreement with earlier SN. Ia samples such as Pan-STARRS1 and the Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find smaller intrinsic scatter about the Hubble diagram (0.077 mag). Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble residual step (0.007 +/- 0.018 mag) as a function of host-galaxy mass for the DES subset, in 2.4 sigma tension with previous measurements. We also present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe. Ia inserted in DECam images and using large catalog-level simulations to test for biases in our analysis pipelines.

Our analysis takes advantage of comprehensive kinematic information for the dense gas in all of these regions made publicly available through the Green Bank Ammonia Survey Data Release 1, which is used to estimate internal support against collapse. We combine this information with ancillary data used to estimate other important properties of the cores, including continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Gould Belt Survey for core identification, core masses, and core sizes. Additionally, we used Planck- and Herschel-based column density maps for external cloud weight pressure and Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (CO)-C-13 observations for external turbulent pressure. Our self-consistent analysis suggests that many dense cores in all three star-forming regions are not bound by gravity alone, but rather require additional pressure confinement to remain bound. Unlike a recent, similar study in Orion. A, we find that turbulent pressure represents a significant portion of the external pressure budget. Our broad conclusion emphasizing the importance of pressure confinement in dense core evolution, however, agrees with earlier work.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Detection of Intracluster Light at Redshift similar to 0.25	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution	BRIGHTEST CLUSTER GALAXIES; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; DIFFUSE OPTICAL LIGHT; MASSIVE GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION; VIRGO CLUSTER; HALO; SIMULATIONS; REDMAPPER; PROFILE	Using data collected by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we report the detection of intracluster light (ICL) with similar to 300 galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2-0.3. We design methods to mask detected galaxies and stars in the images and stack the cluster light profiles, while accounting for several systematic effects (sky subtraction, instrumental point-spread function, cluster selection effects, and residual light in the ICL raw detection from background and cluster galaxies). The methods allow us to acquire high signal-to-noise measurements of the ICL and central galaxies (CGs), which we separate with radial cuts. The ICL appears as faint and diffuse light extending to at least 1 Mpc from the cluster center, reaching a surface brightness level of 30 mag arcsec(-2). The ICL and the cluster CG contribute 44% +/- 17% of the total cluster stellar luminosity within 1 Mpc. The ICL color is overall consistent with that of the cluster red sequence galaxies, but displays the trend of becoming bluer with increasing radius. The ICL demonstrates an interesting self-similarity feature-for clusters in different richness ranges, their ICL radial profiles are similar after scaling with cluster R-200(m), and the ICL brightness appears to be a good tracer of the cluster radial mass distribution. These analyses are based on the DES redMaPPer cluster sample identified in the first year of observations.	[Zhang, Y.; Yanny, B.; Palmese, A.; Annis, J.; Diehl, H.

Mars is of particular interest in this regard because of evidence of a (perhaps transient) warm and wet climate in its past. To date, space missions to Mars have primarily used pyrolysis technique to extract organic compounds from the Martian regolith, but it has not enabled a clear detection of unaltered native Martian organics. The elevated temperatures required for pyrolysis extraction can cause native Martian organics to react with perchlorate salts in the regolith, possibly resulting in the chlorohydrocarbons that have been detected by mass spectrometry, a commonly used in situ technique for space applications. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction technique is a powerful alternative to pyrolysis that may be capable of extracting and delivering unaltered native organic species to an analyser. In this study, we report the SCCO2 extraction of unaltered amino acids (AAs) with simple laboratory analyses of extracts by capillary electrophoresis laser-induced fluorescence (CE/LIF) and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques. The extraction efficiencies of several representative AAs using SCCO2 with small amounts of pure water (similar to 1-5%) as a co-solvent were determined. Glass beads were used as a model substrate to examine the effects of several experimental parameters and Johnson Space Center (JSC) Mars-1A Martian regolith simulant was used to study the effect of complex matrix on extraction efficiencies. With optimized experimental conditions (75C and 5% of water), extraction efficiencies from doped JSC Mars-1A were found to be similar to 40% for glycine, alanine and serine and similar to 10% for lysine. Extraction of native organics from undoped JSC Mars-1A suggests that SCCO2/water solvent system can extract both organics extractable with pure SCCO2 and those extractable with pure water. Additionally, species not extracted by either pure SCCO2 or pure water were extracted with SCCO2/water solvent. Despite the preliminary nature of this work, it paves the path for more comprehensive extraction studies of astrobiologically relevant samples with thorough analyses of resulting extracts.

These observations were carried out using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope and cover the wavelength range 200-550 nm at low resolution. The targets include objects from both of the Trojan color subpopulations (less-red and red). We do not observe any discernible absorption features in these spectra. Comparisons of the averaged UV spectra of less-red and red targets show that the subpopulations are spectrally distinct in the UV. Less-red objects display a steep UV slope and a rollover at around 450 nm to a shallower visible slope, whereas red objects show the opposite trend. Laboratory spectra of irradiated ices with and without H2S exhibit distinct UV absorption features; consequently, the featureless spectra observed here suggest H2S alone is not responsible for the observed color bimodality of Trojans, as has been previously hypothesized. We propose some possible explanations for the observed UV-visible spectra, including complex organics, space weathering of iron-bearing silicates, and masked features due to previous cometary activity.

Determining the Depth of Jupiter's Great Red Spot with Juno: A Slepian Approach	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitation; hydrodynamics; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: gaseous planets	GIANT PLANETS; GRAVITY; EQUATION; FLOW	One of Jupiter's most prominent atmospheric features, the Great Red Spot (GRS), has been observed for more than two centuries, yet little is known about its structure and dynamics below its observed cloud level. While its anticyclonic vortex appearance suggests it might be a shallow weather-layer feature, the very long time span for which it was observed implies it is likely deeply rooted, otherwise it would have been sheared apart by Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere. Determining the GRS depth will shed light not only on the processes governing the GRS, but on the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere as a whole. The Juno mission single flyby over the GRS (PJ7) discovered using microwave radiometer measurements that the GRS is at least a couple hundred kilometers deep. The next flybys over the GRS (PJ18 and PJ21), will allow high-precision gravity measurements that can be used to estimate how deep the GRS winds penetrate below the cloud level. Here we propose a novel method to determine the depth of the GRS based on the new gravity measurements and a Slepian function approach that enables an effective representation of the wind-induced spatially confined gravity signal, and an efficient determination of the GRS depth given the limited measurements. We show that with this method the gravity signal of the GRS should be detectable for wind depths deeper than 300 km, with reasonable uncertainties that depend on depth (e.g., +/- 100 km for a GRS depth of 1000 km).

Active volcanoes continuously but variably emit CO2 through diffuse emissions on their flanks, exposing the overlying ecosystems to elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. We found tight correlations (r(2) = 0 : 86 and r(2) = 0 : 74) between wood stable carbon isotopic composition and co-located volcanogenic CO2 emissions for two of three investigated species (Oreopanax xalapensis and Buddleja nitida), which documents the long-term photosynthetic incorporation of isotopically heavy volcanogenic carbon into wood biomass. Measurements of leaf fluorescence and chlorophyll concentration suggest that volcanic CO2 also has measurable short-term functional impacts on select species of tropical trees. Our findings indicate significant potential for future studies to utilize ecosystems located on active volcanoes as natural experiments to examine the ecological impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 in the tropics and elsewhere. Results also point the way toward a possible future utilization of ecosystems exposed to volcanically elevated CO2 to detect changes in deep volcanic degassing by using selected species of trees as sensors.

Two outburst events around 2009 and 2017 were observed. The coma and tail of the comet consist of dust grains of similar to 10 mu m in radius, ejected protractedly at speeds. 50 m s(-1) near the subsolar point, and are subjected to the Lorentz force, solar gravitation, and radiation pressure force all together. The prolonged activity indicates that sublimation of supervolatiles (e.g., CO, CO2) is at play, causing a net mass-loss rate. 1 kg s(-1). To sustain the mass loss, the nucleus radius has to be. 0.1 km. The color of the cometary dust, similar to other long-period comets, is redder than the solar colors, but we also observed potential color variations when the comet was at 10 < r(H) < 15 au, concurrent with the onset of crystallization of amorphous water ice, if at all. Using publicly available and our refined astrometric measurements, we estimated the precise trajectory of the comet and propagated it backward to its previous perihelion. We found that the comet visited the planetary region 1.96 +/- 0.04 Myr ago, with barycentric perihelion distance q = 8.364 +/- 0.004 au. Thus, C/2010 U3 (Boattini) is almost certainly a dynamically old comet from the Oort cloud, and the observed activity cannot be caused by retained heat from the previous apparition.

In such settings, connections between aquifers could strongly affect the flow dynamics, water quality and availability as well as karst formation and landscape evolution. Geological structures such as folds and faults are central to aquifer connectivity, yet their role on groundwater flow is poorly understood. Herein, we perform mapping of exposed and buried structural features in the Qatar Peninsula using Landsat, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PaISAR scenes, correlated with field, GPR and isotopic data to assess their role in aquifer connections and groundwater dynamics. Our results suggest that ENE-WSW oriented fold-related faults act as vertical conduits along which artesian upward leakages from the deep Aruma aquifer take place into the shallower main aquifer unit (i.e. Umm er Radhuma and Rus) in southern Qatar Peninsula. On the other hand, downward leakage from the freshwater lens in the Dammam aquifer take place in northern Qatar Peninsula. The deep, brackish, and gaseous-rich waters ascending along faults in south Qatar Peninsula, in addition to degrading the water quality in the main aquifer unit, enhance dissolution of carbonates and evaporites leading to strong karstification that produces abundant collapse features. Our findings suggest that structure controls can add significant complexity to recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics in fossil aquifers. Future large-scale radar subsurface mapping will be essential to resolve the variability of the water heads in such areas and its correlation to structural discontinuities.

Protoplanetary discs: sensitivity of the chemical composition to various model parameters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						astrochemistry; Planetary systems; protoplanetary discs; ISM: abundances; ISM: individual objects: DM Tau; ISM: molecules	DM-TAU; INTERSTELLAR CHEMISTRY; GRAIN CHEMISTRY; LKCA 15; DISKS; GAS; CLOUDS; MOLECULES; CORES; H-2	Protoplanetary discs are challenging objects for astrochemical models due to strong density and temperature gradients and due to the UV photons 2D propagation. In this paper, we have studied the importance of several model parameters on the predicted column densities of observed species. We considered: (1) two-phase (gas and homogeneous grains) or three-phase (gas, surface, and bulk of grains) models, (2) several initial compositions, (3) grain growth and dust settling, and (4) several cosmic-ray ionization rates. Our main result is that dust settling is the most crucial parameter. Including this effect renders the computed column densities sensitive to all the other model parameters, except cosmic-ray ionization rate. In fact, we found almost no effect of this parameter for radii larger than 10 au (the minimum radius studied here) except for N2H+. We also compared all our models with all the column densities observed in the protoplanetary disc around DM Tau and were not able to reproduce all the observations despite the studied parameters. N2H+ seems to be the most sensitive species. Its observation in protoplanetary discs at large radius could indicate enough N-2 in the gas phase (inhibited by the three-phase model, but boosted by the settling) and a low electron abundance (favoured by low C and S elemental abundances).

A low-flux state in IRAS 00521-7054 seen with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton: relativistic reflection and an ultrafast outflow	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; X-rays: individual: (IRAS 00521-7054)	X-RAY SOURCE; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLE; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; ACCRETION-DISK; WARM ABSORBER; DISCOVERY; AGN; ABSORPTION	We present results from a deep, coordinated XMM-Newton + NuSTAR observation of the Seyfert 2 galaxy IRAS 00521-7054. The NuSTAR data provide the first detection of this source in high-energy X-rays (E > 10 keV), and the broad-band data show this to be a highly complex source which exhibits relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disc, further reprocessing by more distant material, neutral absorption, and evidence for ionized absorption in an extreme, ultrafast outflow (v(out) similar to 0.4c). Based on lamppost disc reflection models, we find evidence that the central supermassive black hole is rapidly rotating (a > 0.77), consistent with previous estimates from the profile of the relativistic iron line, and that the accretion disc is viewed at a fairly high inclination (i similar to 59 degrees). Based on extensive simulations, we find the ultrafast outflow is detected at similar to 4 sigma significance (or greater). We also estimate that the extreme outflow should be sufficient to power galaxy-scale feedback, and may even dominate the energetics of the total output from the system.	[Walton, D. J.; Fabian, A.

We find that SFR does depend on environment, but only for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies (10(10.1) < M-*/M-circle dot < 10(10.8)) wherein the median SFR at the highest densities is 0.2-0.3 dex less than at lower densities at a significance of 4 sigma. Galaxies that are more/less massive than this have SFRs that vary at most by approximate to 20 per cent across all environments, but show no statistically significant trend. We further split galaxies into low-redshift (z similar to 0.8) and high-redshift (z similar to 1.05) subsamples and observe nearly identical behaviour. We devise a simple toy model to explore possible star formation histories for galaxies evolving between these redshifts. The key assumption in this model is that star-forming galaxies in a given environment-stellar mass bin can be described as a superposition of two exponential time-scales (SFR proportional to e(-t/tau)): a long-tau time-scale with tau = 4 Gyr to simulate 'normal' star-forming galaxies, and a short-tau time-scale with free tau (between 0.3 <= tau/Gyr <= 2) to simulate galaxies on a quenching trajectory. In general, we find that galaxies residing in low/high environmental densities are more heavily weighted to the long-tau/short-tau pathways, respectively, which we argue is a signature of environmental quenching. Furthermore, for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies this transition begins at intermediate-density environments suggesting that environmental quenching is relevant in group-like haloes and/or cluster infall regions.

Due to the size of our data set (>2Tb), we developed an extensive open source set of python libraries to reduce our images, including astrometry, coaddition, and PSF photometry. Our survey consists of 29 x 3 deg(2) fields in the UCL and LCC subgroups of Sco-Cen and the creation of a catalogue with over 11 million point sources. We create a prioritized list of UCL and LCC candidate members, with 118 best and another 348 good candidates. We show that the luminosity and mass functions of our low mass and substellar candidates are consistent with measurements for the younger Upper Scorpius subgroup and estimates of a universal IMF, with spectral types ranging from M1 down to L1.

DES Collaboration	More out of less: an excess integrated Sachs-Wolfe signal from supervoids mapped out by the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; large-scale structure of Universe	COLD SPOT; CROSS-CORRELATION; COSMIC VOIDS; IMPRINT; SUPERSTRUCTURES; COSMOLOGY; MAPS; BIAS; ISW	The largest structures in the cosmic web probe the dynamical nature of dark energy through their integrated Sachs-Wolfe imprints. In the strength of the signal, typical cosmic voids have shown good consistency with expectation A(ISW) = Delta T-data/Delta T-theory = 1, given the substantial cosmic variance. Discordantly, large-scale hills in the gravitational potential, or supervoids, have shown excess signals. In this study, we mapped out 87 new supervoids in the total 5000 deg(2) footprint of the Dark Energy Survey at 0.2 < z < 0.9 to probe these anomalous claims. We found an excess imprinted profile with A(ISW) approximate to 4.1 +/- 2.0 amplitude. The combination with independent BOSS data reveals an ISW imprint of supervoids at the 3.3 sigma significance level with an enhanced A(ISW) approximate to 5.2 +/- 1.6 amplitude. The tension with Lambda CDM predictions is equivalent to 2.6 sigma and remains unexplained.

DES Collaboration	Finding high-redshift strong lenses in DES using convolutional neural networks	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: statistical	STRONG GRAVITATIONAL LENSES; STAR-FORMING GALAXY; SPACE WARPS; SAMPLE; ARCS; HALO; II.	We search Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 imaging data for galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses using convolutional neural networks. We generate 250 000 simulated lenses at redshifts > 0.8 from which we create a data set for training the neural networks with realistic seeing, sky and shot noise. Using the simulations as a guide, we build a catalogue of 1.1 million DES sources with 1.8 < g - i < 5, 0.6 < g - r < 3, r_mag > 19, g_mag > 20, and i_mag > 18.2. We train two ensembles of neural networks on training sets consisting of simulated lenses, simulated non-lenses, and real sources. We use the neural networks to score images of each of the sources in our catalogue with a value from 0 to 1, and select those with scores greater than a chosen threshold for visual inspection, resulting in a candidate set of 7301 galaxies. During visual inspection, we rate 84 as 'probably' or 'definitely' lenses. Four of these are previously known lenses or lens candidates. We inspect a further 9428 candidates with a different score threshold, and identify four new candidates. We present 84 new strong lens candidates, selected after a few hours of visual inspection by astronomers. This catalogue contains a comparable number of high-redshift lenses to that predicted by simulations. Based on simulations, we estimate our sample to contain most discoverable lenses in this imaging and at this redshift range.

This highlights the significance of reliable, integrated information for guiding and assessing actions and policies aimed at managing and sustaining the many functions and benefits of species. Here we synthesize the types of data and approaches that are required to achieve such an integration and conceptualize 'essential biodiversity variables' (EBVs) for a unified global capture of species populations in space and time. The inherent heterogeneity and sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We define the species population EBVs as a space-time-species-gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or species data, this fundamental species population information directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem function indicators. The unified concept we present links disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for species population monitoring in which data collection is closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support effective biodiversity assessment.

J	Abotalib, AZ; Heggy, E				Abotalib, Abotalib Z.; Heggy, Essam			A deep groundwater origin for recurring slope lineae on Mars	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							HAUGHTON IMPACT STRUCTURE; VALLES MARINERIS; DEVON ISLAND; LIQUID WATER; CRATER; RSL; TECTONICS; GULLIES; FLOWS	The recurring slope lineae on Mars have been hypothesized to originate from snow melting, deliquescence, dry flow or shallow groundwater. Except for the dry flow origin, these hypotheses imply the presence of surficial or near-surface volatiles, placing the exploration and characterization of potential habitable environments within the reach of existing technology. Here we present observations from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, heat-flow modelling and terrestrial analogues, which indicate that the source of recurring slope lineae could be natural discharge along geological structures from briny aquifers within the cryosphere, at depths of approximately 750 m. Spatial correlation between recurring slope lineae source regions and multi-scale fractures (such as joints and faults) in the southern mid-latitudes and in Valles Marineris suggests that recurring slope lineae preferably emanate from tectonic and impact-related fractures. We suggest that deep groundwater occasionally surfaces on Mars in present-day conditions.

OSIRIS-REx Team	Craters, boulders and regolith of (101955) Bennu indicative of an old and dynamic surface	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							ASTEROID FAMILIES; IMPACT; RADAR	Small, kilometre-sized near-Earth asteroids are expected to have young and frequently refreshed surfaces for two reasons: collisional disruptions are frequent in the main asteroid belt where they originate, and thermal or tidal processes act on them once they become near-Earth asteroids. Here we present early measurements of numerous large candidate impact craters on near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) mission, which indicate a surface that is between 100 million and 1 billion years old, predating Bennu's expected duration as a near-Earth asteroid. We also observe many fractured boulders, the morphology of which suggests an influence of impact or thermal processes over a considerable amount of time since the boulders were exposed at the surface. However, the surface also shows signs of more recent mass movement: clusters of boulders at topographic lows, a deficiency of small craters and infill of large craters. The oldest features likely record events from Bennu's time in the main asteroid belt.	[Walsh, K. J.; Bottke, W. F.; Morrison, V.; Killgore, M.; Hamilton, V. E.; Kaplan, H. H.; Walsh, K.

During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay's upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980 s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn's future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.

In the past two decades, several satellites were launched carrying on board either radiometer (passive) or radar (active) or both sensors in different frequency bands with various spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture algorithms are in rapid development and their improvements/revisions are ongoing. The latest SM retrieval products and versions of products that have been recently released are not yet, to our knowledge, comprehensively evaluated and inter-compared over different ecoregions and climate conditions. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the most recent microwave-based SM retrieval products available from NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite, ESA's led mission (European Space Agency) SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite, ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) sensor on board the meteorological operational (Metop) platforms Metop-A and Metop-B, and the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) blended long-term SM time series. More specifically, in this study we compared SMAPL3 V4, SMOSL3 V300, SMOSL2 V650, ASCAT H111, and CCI V04.2 and the new SMOS-IC (V105) SM product. This evaluation was achieved using four statistical scores: Pearson correlation (considering both original observations and anomalies), RMSE, unbiased RMSE, and Bias between remotely-sensed SM retrievals and ground-based measurements from > 1000 stations from 17 monitoring networks, spread over the globe, disseminated through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The analysis reveals that the performance of the remotely-sensed SM retrievals generally varies depending on ecoregions, land cover types, climate conditions, and between the monitoring networks. It also reveals that temporal sampling of the data, the frequency of data in time and the spatial coverage, affect the performance metrics. Overall, the performance of SMAP and SMOS-IC products compared slightly better with respect to the ISMN in situ observations than the other remotely-sensed products.

Plant species' spectral emissivity and temperature using the hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES) sensor	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Thermal infrared; Spectral emissivity; Plant species; Land surface temperature (LST); HyTES; Remote sensing; Hyperspectral; Random forest	LEAF WATER-CONTENT; LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CANOPY TEMPERATURE; MU-M; INFRARED-SPECTRA; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; DROUGHT DEVELOPMENT; STRESS; RETRIEVAL; REFLECTANCE	The thermal domain (TIR; 2.5-15 mu m) delivers unique measurements of plant characteristics that are not possible in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, these TIR measurements have largely been restricted to laboratory leaf level or coarse spatial resolutions due to the lack of suitable data from airborne and spaceborne instruments. The airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) provides an opportunity to retrieve high spectral resolution emissivity and land surface temperature (LST) that can be exploited for canopy level vegetation research. This study is a high spatial resolution analysis of plant species' emissivity and LST using HyTES imagery acquired in the Huntington Botanical Gardens on 2014 July 5 and 2016 Jan 25. Leaf and canopy emissivity variation was identified among 24 plant species and used to determine leaf to canopy scaling capabilities. HyTES LST patterns among species and dates were quantified and correlated to LiDAR derived tree canopy attributes. At the leaf scale, one third of the species showed distinct spectral separation from other species. However, at the canopy scale most species were not spectrally separable. Random forest classification demonstrates the high level of confusion between species with overall accuracies < 40%. LST data, derived from TIR measurements, showed that species exhibited significantly different distributions between dates and species. These distributions were largely explained by canopy structure (e.g. tree height and canopy density) and composition of neighboring pixels (e.g. presence of pavement versus trees). While species do not exhibit unique emissivity signatures at the canopy level, the LST variation among species provides a stronger understanding of LST variability in coarser resolution TIR imagery. This study represents the analysis of vegetation characteristics using the NASA's HyTES TIR sensor, opening the door for future remote sensing vegetation studies that include using the recently launched ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission.

David			Deep Convective Organization, Moisture Vertical Structure, and Convective Transition Using Deep-Inflow Mixing	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Deep convection; Entrainment; Mesoscale systems; Convective-scale processes; Humidity; Hydrologic cycle	COLUMN WATER-VAPOR; DIURNAL CYCLE; PRECIPITATING CONVECTION; TROPICAL CONVECTION; CLOUD CLUSTERS; SHALLOW; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; ENTRAINMENT; SIMULATION	It is an open question whether an integrated measure of buoyancy can yield a strong relation to precipitation across tropical land and ocean, across the seasonal and diurnal cycles, and for varying degrees of convective organization. Building on previous work, entraining plume buoyancy calculations reveal that differences in convective onset as a function of column water vapor (CWV) over land and ocean, as well as seasonally and diurnally over land, are largely due to variability in the contribution of lower-tropospheric humidity to the total column moisture. Over land, the relationship between deep convection and lower-free-tropospheric moisture is robust across all seasons and times of day, whereas the relation to boundary layer moisture is robust for the daytime only. Using S-band radar, these transition statistics are examined separately for mesoscale and smaller-scale convection. The probability of observing mesoscale convective systems sharply increases as a function of lower-free-tropospheric humidity. The consistency of this with buoyancy-based parameterization is examined for several mixing formulations. Mixing corresponding to deep inflow of environmental air into a plume that grows with height, which incorporates nearly equal weighting of boundary layer and free-tropospheric air, yields buoyancies consistent with the observed onset of deep convection across the seasonal and diurnal cycles in the Amazon. Furthermore, it provides relationships that are as strong or stronger for mesoscale-organized convection as for smaller-scale convection.	[Schiro, Kathleen A.; Neelin, J.

J	Allen, RJ; Hassan, T; Randles, CA; Su, H				Allen, Robert J.; Hassan, Taufiq; Randles, Cynthia A.; Su, Hui			Enhanced land-sea warming contrast elevates aerosol pollution in a warmer world	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE; MODELS; SIMULATIONS; ATMOSPHERE; MORTALITY; CYCLE	Many climate models simulate an increase in anthropogenic aerosol species in response to warming(1), particularly over the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes during June, July and August. Recently, it has been argued that this increase in anthropogenic aerosols can be linked to a decrease in wet removal associated with reduced precipitation(2), but the mechanisms remain uncertain. Here, using a state-of-the-art climate model (the Community Atmosphere Model version 5), we expand on this notion to demonstrate that the enhanced aerosol burden and hydrological changes are related to a robust climate change phenomenon-the land-sea warming contrast(3,4). Enhanced land warming is associated with continental reductions in lower-tropospheric humidity that drive decreases in low clouds-particularly large scale (stratus) clouds-which, in turn, lead to reduced large-scale precipitation and aerosol wet removal. Idealized model simulations further show that muting the land-sea warming contrast weakens these hydrological changes, thereby suppressing the aerosol increase. Moreover, idealized simulations that only feature land warming yield enhanced continental aridity and an increase in aerosol burden. Thus, unless anthropogenic emission reductions occur, our results add confidence that a warmer world will be associated with enhanced aerosol pollution.

ICARUS			English	Article						Tectonics; Satellites; Dynamics; Europa; Ganymede; Enceladus	EUROPA; SUBDUCTION; BAND; LITHOSPHERE; SENSITIVITY; FRICTION	The outer H2O ice shell of Europa, a Galilean satellite of Jupiter thought to exhibit a global interior water ocean, shows evidence for plate-like surface motions along tectonic boundaries. In this study, we investigate whether forces similar to those that drive plate tectonics on Earth may drive plate motions on icy satellites. We focus on whether the forces of slab pull and ridge push, driven by thermal and compositional buoyancy, can overcome the mechanical forces resisting plate motions to sustain interaction between surface ice and the interior ocean. We find that Earth-like plate tectonics is implausible within the outer ice shell of icy satellites because the forces resisting self-sustaining plate cycling are of significantly greater order than the driving forces. In the case of Ganymede and Triton, if it has a thick shell, plate tectonics would require warm, low-viscosity slabs to remain intact for timescales that are orders of magnitude longer than those of interior convection.

Leeb hardness of salty Europa ice analogs exposed to high-energy electrons	ICARUS			English	Article						Europa; Ices; Mechanical properties; Radiation effects	RESTITUTION COEFFICIENTS; WATER ICE; SURFACE; MACHINABILITY; STRENGTH; IRRADIATION; MINERALS; SYSTEM; ION	Constraint of Europa's surface material properties is critical for future lander missions to Europa, particularly for drilling and sample retrieval. Surface ice on Europa, which is thought to contain water, hydrated acids and salts, and other trace materials at temperatures of similar to 80 K at the polar regions to similar to 120 K at the equator, is drenched in radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere. Because Europa's ice composition and surface structure are not yet fully characterized, technological requirements for mobility, drilling, and caching mechanisms are also not well constrained. To begin to understand the physical properties of ice under these extreme environments, we have initiated a set of laboratory studies to examine the effect of temperature, composition, and radiation on ice hardness. By utilizing a commercially-available Leeb rebound hardness tester, we have determined that ice containing salts such as NaCl and MgSO4 exhibit increased hardness relative to pure water ices at Europa relevant temperatures. However, exposure of these ices to 10-25 MeV electron radiation (such as is received by the trailing hemisphere of Europa) led to measurable softening, which indicates that the 'worst-case scenarios' (upper limits) for hardness of ice on Europa may be somewhat tempered by surface radiation effects. We found that hydrated MgSO4 (close to 1:1 by mass with H2O) is the hardest of these materials at Europa-relevant temperatures and the Leeb Hardness (HL) ranges from 477 to 527.

Spectrophotometric-modeling and mapping of Ceres	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroid Ceres; Asteroids, surfaces; Photometry; Spectrophotometry	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; HAPKE PHOTOMETRIC MODEL; IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION; ASTEROID 21 LUTETIA; INFRARED SPECTROPHOTOMETRY; RESOLVED PHOTOMETRY; GALILEO PHOTOMETRY; SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; SURFACE; ICE	We report a comprehensive analysis of the global spectrophotometric properties of Ceres using the images collected by the Dawn Framing Camera through seven color filters from April to June 2015 during the RC3 (rotational characterization 3) and Survey mission phases. We derived the Hapke model parameters for all color filters. The single-scattering albedo of Ceres at 555 nm wavelength is 0.14 +/- 0.04, the geometric albedo is 0.096 +/- 0.006, and the bolometric Bond albedo is 0.037 +/- 0.002. The asymmetry factors calculated from the best-fit two-term Henyey-Greenstein (HG) single-particle phase functions (SPPFs) show a weak wavelength dependence from 0.04 at 438 nm increasing to 0.002 at > 900 nm, suggesting that the phase reddening of Ceres is dominated by single-particle scattering rather than multiple scattering or small-scale surface roughness. The Hapke roughness parameter of Ceres is derived to be 20 6, with no wavelength dependence. The phase function of Ceres presents appreciably strong scattering around 90 phase angle that cannot be fitted with a single-term HG SPPF, suggesting possible stronger forward scattering component than other asteroids previously analyzed with spacecraft data. We speculate that such a scattering characteristic of Ceres might be related to its ubiquitous distribution of phyllosilicates and high abundance of carbonates on the surface. We further grouped the reflectance data into a 1 latitude-longitude grid over the surface of Ceres, and fitted each grid independently with both empirical models and the Hapke model to study the spatial variations of photometric properties. Our derived albedo maps and color maps are consistent with previous studies [Nathues, A., et al., 2016, Planet. Space Sci. 134, 122-127; Schroder, S.E., et al., 2017, Icarus 288, 201-225]. The SPPF over the surface of Ceres shows an overall correlation with albedo distribution, where lower albedo is mostly associated with stronger back scattering and vice versa, consistent with the general trend among asteroids. On the other hand, the Hapke roughness parameter does not vary much across the surface of Ceres, except for the ancient Vendimia Planitia region that is associated with a slightly higher roughness. Furthermore, the spatial distributions of the SPPF and the Hapke roughness do not depend on wavelength. Based on the wavelength dependence of the SPPF of Ceres, we hypothesize that the regolith grains on Ceres either contain a considerable fraction of mu m-sized or smaller particles, or are strongly affected by internal scatterers of this size.

Emissions from H-3(+), a major ion in Saturn's ionosphere, were previously analyzed from these observations, indicating that peaks in emission at specific latitudes were consistent with an influx of charged water products from the rings known as 'ring rain'. Subsequent modeling showed that these peaks in emission are best explained by an increase in H-3(+) density, rather than in column averaged H-3(+) temperatures, as a local reduction in electron density (due to charge exchange with water) lengthens the lifetime of H-3(+) However, what has been missing until now is a direct derivation of the H-3(+) parameters temperature, density and radiative cooling rates, which are required to confirm and expand on existing models and theory. Here we present measurements of these H-3(+) parameters for the first time in the non-auroral regions of Saturn, using two H-3(+) lines, Q(1,0(-)) and R(2,2). We confirm that H-3(+) density is enhanced near the expected 'ring rain' planetocentric latitudes near 45 degrees N and 39 degrees S. A low H-3(+) density near 31 degrees S, an expected prodigious source of water, may indicate that the rings are 'overflowing' material into the planet such that H-3(+) destruction by charge-exchange with incoming neutrals outweighs its lengthened lifetime due to the aforementioned reduction in electron density. Derived H-3(+) temperatures were low while the density was high at 39 degrees S, potentially indicating that the ionosphere is most affected by ring rain in the deep ionosphere. Saturn's moon Enceladus, a known water source, is connected with a dense region of H-3(+) centered on 62 degrees S, perhaps indicating that charged water from Enceladus is draining into Saturn's southern mid-latitudes. We estimated the water product influx using previous modeling results, finding that 432 - 2870 kg s(-1) of water delivered to Saturn's mid latitudes is sufficient to explain the observed 10-metre H-3(+) densities. Assuming that our Saturn northern Spring measurement represents all seasons, and that the rings are able to reorganize over time, the ring rain mechanism alone will drain Saturn's rings to the planet in 292(-124)(+818) million years.

A Study on the Reliability of Thermoelectric Couple Networks	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	37th International Conference on Thermoelectrics (ICT)	JUL 01-05, 2018	Caen, FRANCE			Systems engineering; reliability; thermoelectrics; RTG; TEG		Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) rely on a network of individual thermoelectric couples that collectively contribute to the overall power output of the system. As individual couples experience catastrophic failure, complete generator failure occurs when the power output fails to meet the required threshold. A series-parallel wiring arrangement accommodates failure of individual couples without catastrophic failure of the generator, however there exist failure paths that interrupt electrical continuity of the network. In assessing the reliability of a TEG system, the probability of success is measured according to a network's ability to meet both the power level and electrical continuity criteria. A closed-form probabilistic model based on Karr's mathematical formulation (Karr in IEEE Trans Reliab 19(3):116-119, 1970) is used to assess the implications of catastrophic thermoelectric couple failure on the reliability of a complete network. A system-level analysis is performed to evaluate the reliability effects of various network configurations, based on the distribution of a finite number of couples across different numbers of strings. The study explores the tradeoff between redundancy and reliability by assessing the effect of additional couples added to parallel strings and continuing to satisfy acceptable power margins. This model is shown to be a useful tool for designing and understanding the electrical network wiring configurations of TEGs and other power devices.	[Matthes, Christopher S.

Rover-IRL: Inverse Reinforcement Learning With Soft Value Iteration Networks for Planetary Rover Path Planning	IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS			English	Article						Space robotics and automation; deep learning in robotics and automation; learning from demonstration	AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION	Planetary rovers, such as those currently on Mars, face difficult path planning problems, both before landing during the mission planning stages as well as once on the ground. In this work, we present a new approach to these planning problems based on inverse reinforcement learning using deep convolutional networks and value iteration networks (VIN) as important internal structures. VIN are an approximation of the value iteration (VI) algorithm implemented with convolutional neural networks to make VI fully differentiable. We propose a modification to the value iteration recurrence, referred to as the soft value iteration network (SVIN). SVIN is designed to produce more effective training gradients through the VIN. It relies on an internal soft policy model, where the policy is represented with a probability distribution over all possible actions, rather than a deterministic policy that returns only the best action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in both a grid world dataset as well as a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated from currently deployed rover mission planning tools and real Mars imagery.

Diffraction of light by plasma in the solar system	JOURNAL OF OPTICS			English	Article						diffraction; solar plasma; Mie theory; Debye potentials; eikonal approximation	TERMINATION SHOCK; SCATTERING; APPROXIMATION; SCINTILLATION; DISTANCE; LENS	We study the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the solar system and develop a Mie theory that accounts for the refractive properties of the free electron plasma in the extended solar corona. We use a generic model for the electron number density distribution and apply the eikonal approximation to find a solution in terms of Debye potentials, which is then used to determine the EM field both within the inner solar system and at large heliocentric distances. As expected, the solution for the EM wave propagating through the solar system is characterized by a plasma-induced phase shift and related change in the light ray's direction of propagation. Our approach quantitatively accounts for these effects, providing a wave-optical treatment for diffraction in the solar plasma. As such, it may be used in practical applications involving big apertures, large interferometric baselines or otherwise widely distributed high-precision astronomical instruments.

Since June 2015, EPIC has been providing observations of the sun-lit side of the Earth with its 10 spectral channels ranging from the UV to the near-infrared. A suite of algorithms has been developed to generate the standard EPIC Level 2 cloud products that include cloud mask, cloud effective pressure/height, and cloud optical thickness. The EPIC cloud mask adopts the threshold method and utilizes multichannel observations and ratios as tests. Cloud effective pressure/height is derived with observations from the O-2 A-band (780 and 764 nm) and B-band (680 and 688 nm) pairs. The EPIC cloud optical thickness retrieval adopts a single-channel approach in which the 780 and 680 nm channels are used for retrievals over ocean and over land, respectively. Comparison with co-located cloud retrievals from geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites shows that the EPIC cloud product algorithms are performing well and are consistent with theoretical expectations. These products are publicly available at the Atmospheric Science Data Center at the NASA Langley Research Center for climate studies and for generating other geophysical products that require cloud properties as input.

We generalize the definition of a cosmic shear tomographic bin to be a set of commonly labeled voxels in photometric color space; rather than bins defined directly in redshift. We explore this approach by using a self-organizing map to define the multidimensional color space, and a we define a "label space" of connected regions on the self-organizing map using overlapping elliptical disks. This allows us to then find optimal labeling schemes by searching the label space. We use a metric that is the signal-to-noise ratio of a dark energy equation of state measurement, and in this case we find that for up to five tomographic bins the optimal color-space labeling is an approximation of an equally spaced binning in redshift; that is in all cases the best configuration. We also show that such a redefinition is more robust to photometric redshift outliers than a standard tomographic bin selection.

Indigenous Organic-Oxidized Fluid Interactions in the Tissint Mars Meteorite	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; meteorite; organics; salts; fluids	MARTIAN METEORITE; GALE CRATER; MATTER; SEARCH; ORIGIN; WATER; SOIL; PERCHLORATE; PYROLYSIS; COMPONENT	The observed fall and rapid recovery of the Tissint Mars meteorite has provided minimally contaminated samples of the Martian surface. We report analyses of Tissint for organic compounds by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and for soluble salts by ion chromatography. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis shows the presence of organic compounds similar to those in the Mars EETA79001 and Nakhla meteorites. The organic profile is dominated by aromatic hydrocarbons, including oxygen and nitrogen-containing aromatics, and sulfur-containing species including thiophenes. The soluble salts in Tissint are dominated by sulfate and various oxidation states of chlorine, including perchlorate. The organic compounds and salts in the soils from the Tissint recovery strewn field differ significantly from those found in Tissint suggesting minimal terrestrial contamination. Our results support the hypothesis that the soluble inorganic components of Tissint are most likely a result of indigenous fluid inclusion, thus providing a glimpse into the composition of early Martian fluids. Plain Language Summary Meteorites that come from Mars usually become contaminated after landing on Earth. One Mars meteorite, named Tissint, was seen falling in the dry Moroccan desert, and many of its pieces were collected within months. We analyzed the meteorite and the local soil for organic compounds and soluble salts. We found differences between the Tissint meteorite and the local soil that suggest that Tissint is uncontaminated. The analyses also showed that the soluble salts in Tissint most likely came from Martian fluids that were similar to terrestrial seawater.

Here we use bathymetric data to map the distribution of more than 50 major moraines in SE Greenland fjords. Inner-fjord moraines are widespread along the SE Greenland margin, occurring in 65% of the surveyed fjords. We identify, for the first time, nine midfjord moraines that span the approximately 150-km-long eastern margin of the Julianehab Ice Cap. In contrast, midfjord moraines are generally absent from the deeper and wider fjords of the SE GIS. The variable distribution of midfjord moraines along the SE Greenland margin reveals contrasting behavior of the SE GIS and the eastern Julianehab Ice Cap during the last deglaciation, which probably reflects differences in fjord geometry and exposure to ocean heat.

Emissions of methane in Europe inferred by total column measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; NATURAL-GAS; TROPOSPHERIC METHANE; SOURCE ATTRIBUTION; CO EMISSIONS; 4 CORNERS; ETHANE; CALIBRATION; CH4; INVERSION	Using five long-running ground-based atmospheric observatories in Europe, we demonstrate the utility of long-term, stationary, ground-based measurements of atmospheric total columns for verifying annual methane emission inventories. Our results indicate that the methane emissions for the region in Europe between Orleans, Bremen, Bialystok, and Garmisch-Partenkirchen are overestimated by the state-of-the-art inventories of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v4.2 FT2010 and the high-resolution emissions database developed by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) as part of the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate project (TNO-MACC_III), possibly due to the disaggregation of emissions onto a spatial grid.

Measurement and Modeling of Air-Broadened Methane Absorption in the MERLIN Spectral Region at Low Temperatures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						MERLIN; atmospheric methane; absorption cross section; line shape	DIODE-LASER MEASUREMENTS; SPEED DEPENDENCE; H2O TRANSITIONS; PARAMETERS; SIMULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; COLLISIONS; SHAPE; CH3F	The ability to precisely model methane absorption in the R(6) manifold of the 2 nu(3) band at atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions is a key technical requirement of the German-French, Methane Remote Sensing Lidar (MERLIN) space mission. To this end, 27 high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise-ratio absorption spectra of air-broadened (CH4)-C-12 were recorded using a variable-temperature frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy apparatus. The measurement conditions corresponded to sample temperature, pressure, and methane molar fraction values spanning 220-290K, 4-110kPa, and 4-7 mol/mol, respectively. The measured spectra were fit using the sum of isolated Hartmann-Tran profiles with the addition of line mixing. For each line within the manifold, all spectroscopic parameters at room temperature were fixed to our previously obtained values (Delahaye et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JD024524) and only the temperature dependences of the model parameters were adjusted. The results show that the fitted model agrees with the measured methane absorption to better than 0.3% for the entire R(6) manifold spectral region and to within 0.1% at the online position of the MERLIN for all considered pressure and temperature conditions. A first comparison with ground-based atmospheric measurement was also made showing significant improvement with respect to existing spectroscopic modeling of methane absorption.

Here we synthesized mineral membranes involving iron(II), iron(lll), and other divalent metal cations (calcium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, and nickel) and tested their ability to catalyze the formation of pyrophosphate from phosphate and acetyl phosphate across steep pH gradients in microfluidic devices. We studied the chemical compositions of the precipitate membranes (which included vivianite, goethite, and green rust) using in situ and ex situ micro-Raman spectroscopy. The yields of pyrophosphate were determined by aqueous P-31 NMR spectroscopy. We found that Fe(2+ )and Ca2+ were the best catalysts for pyrophosphate synthesis among investigated ions; Fe3+ and mixed-valence iron membranes were also able to promote pyrophosphate formation. In addition, the pH gradients across the membranes affected the pyrophosphate yields and the smallest pH gradient resulted in the highest yield. These results suggest a possible route of substrate phosphorylation in prebiotic hydrothermal systems.

Intrinsic Timing Jitter and Latency in Superconducting Nanowire Single-photon Detectors	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							FILMS	We analyze the origin of the intrinsic timing jitter in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors in terms of fluctuations in the latency of the detector response, which is determined by the microscopic physics of the photon-detection process. We demonstrate that fluctuations in the physical parameters, which determine the latency, give rise to the intrinsic timing jitter. We develop a general description of latency by introducing the explicit time dependence of the internal detection efficiency. By considering the dynamic Fano fluctuations together with static spatial inhomogeneities, we study the details of the connection between latency and timing jitter. We develop both a simple phenomenological model and a more general microscopic model of detector latency and timing jitter based on the solution of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for the 1D hotbelt geometry. While the analytical model is sufficient for qualitative interpretation of recent data, the general approach establishes the framework for a more quantitative analysis of detector latency and the fundamental limits of intrinsic timing jitter. These theoretical advances can be used to interpret the results of recent experiments measuring the dependence of detection latency and timing jitter on photon energy to the few-picosecond level.

Selective Reduction of CO2 to CO by a Molecular Re(ethynyl-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl Catalyst and Attachment to Carbon Electrode Surfaces	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							COVALENT ATTACHMENT; SUBSTITUENT; LIGANDS; AZIDE; ELECTROCATALYSTS	The catalytic properties of Re(ethynyl-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl and Re(vinyl-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl were studied and compared with those of the previously reported Re(tBu-bpy))CO)(3)Cl. As a molecular catalyst, Re(ethynyl-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl reduces CO2 to CO with lower overpotential (eta approximate to 0.525 V), higher selectivity for CO (FE 96%), and higher reaction rate (I-cat/I-p = 27) compared to similar catalysts reported to date. The catalyst undergoes electropolymerization at the surface of a glassy carbon electrode in dry acetonitrile solution, creating a polymer film that is electroactive under a CO2 atmosphere. In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) (pK(a) 35.4, MeCN) these films exhibit high efficiencies for CO (FECO 97%). On the basis of preliminary studies, these electrodes show promise as heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Further optimization and understanding of deactivation pathways will be required to make these systems practical. The ethynyl functionalized Re(ethynyl-bpy)(CO)(3)Cl catalyst also can be attached to graphitic carbon electrodes through the "click" reaction. This represents the first example of attachment of a CO2 reduction catalyst to an electrode surface by "click" chemistry.

J	Sciacovelli, L; Bellan, J				Sciacovelli, Luca; Bellan, Josette			The influence of the chemical composition representation according to the number of species during mixing in high-pressure turbulent flows	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						general fluid mechanics; turbulent mixing	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; MASS DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; NONUNIFORM SYSTEM; FREE-ENERGY; COMBUSTION; LAYER; OXIDATION; HEPTANE; PREDICTION; REDUCTION	Mixing of several species in high-pressure (high-p) turbulent flows is investigated to understand the influence of the number of species on the flow characteristics. Direct numerical simulations are conducted in the temporal mixing layer configuration at approximately the same value of the momentum ratio for all realizations. The simulations are performed with mixtures of two, three, five and seven species to address various compositions at fixed number of species, at three values of initial vorticity-thickness-based Reynolds number, Re-0, and two values of the free-stream pressure, p(0), which is supercritical for each species except water. The major species are C7H16, O-2 and N-2, and the minor species are CO, CO2, H-2 and H2O. The extensive database thus obtained allows the study of the influence not only of Re-0 and p(0), but also of the initial density ratio and of the initial density difference between streams, Delta rho. The results show that the layer growth is practically insensitive to all of the above parameters; however, global vortical aspects increase with Re-0; p(0) and the number of species; nevertheless, at the same Re-0; p(0) and density ratio, vorticity aspects are not influenced by the number of species. Species mixing produces strong density gradients which increase with p(0) and otherwise scale with Delta rho but, when scaled by Delta rho, are not affected by the number of species. Generalized Korteweg-type equations are developed for a multi-species mixture, and a priori estimates based on the largest density gradient show that the Korteweg stresses, which account for the influence of the density gradient, have negligible contribution in the momentum equation. The species-specific effective Schmidt number, Sc ff;eff, is computed and it is found that negative values occur for all minor species - particularly for H-2 - thus indicating uphill diffusion, while the major species experience only regular diffusion. The probability density function (p.d.f.) of Sc ff;eff shows strong variation with p(0) but weak dependence on the number of species; however, the p.d.f. substantially varies with the identity of the species. In contrast, the p.d.f. of the effective Prandtl number indicates dependence on both p(0) and the number of species. Similar to Sc ff;eff, the species-specific effective Lewis-number p.d.f. depends on the species, and for all species the mean is smaller than unity, thus invalidating one of the most popular assumptions in combustion modelling. Simplifying the mixture composition by reducing the number of minor species does not affect the crucial species-temperature relationship of the major species that, for accuracy, must be retained in combustion simulations, but this relationship is affected for the minor species and in regions of uphill diffusion, indicating that the reduction is nonlinear in nature.

Long-Term Impacts of Selective Logging on Amazon Forest Dynamics from Multi-Temporal Airborne LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						tropical forests; forest degradation; selective logging; forest structure; laser scanning	REDUCED-IMPACT; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; CARBON STOCKS; LOGGED FOREST; CANOPY DAMAGE; TREES; GAPS; REGENERATION; LANDSCAPE; RECOVERY	Forest degradation is common in tropical landscapes, but estimates of the extent and duration of degradation impacts are highly uncertain. In particular, selective logging is a form of forest degradation that alters canopy structure and function, with persistent ecological impacts following forest harvest. In this study, we employed airborne laser scanning in 2012 and 2014 to estimate three-dimensional changes in the forest canopy and understory structure and aboveground biomass following reduced-impact selective logging in a site in Eastern Amazon. Also, we developed a binary classification model to distinguish intact versus logged forests. We found that canopy gap frequency was significantly higher in logged versus intact forests even after 8 years (the time span of our study). In contrast, the understory of logged areas could not be distinguished from the understory of intact forests after 6-7 years of logging activities. Measuring new gap formation between LiDAR acquisitions in 2012 and 2014, we showed rates 2 to 7 times higher in logged areas compared to intact forests. New gaps were spatially clumped with 76 to 89% of new gaps within 5 m of prior logging damage. The biomass dynamics in areas logged between the two LiDAR acquisitions was clearly detected with an average estimated loss of -4.14 +/- 0.76 MgC ha(-1) y(-1). In areas recovering from logging prior to the first acquisition, we estimated biomass gains close to zero. Together, our findings unravel the magnitude and duration of delayed impacts of selective logging in forest structural attributes, confirm the high potential of airborne LiDAR multitemporal data to characterize forest degradation in the tropics, and present a novel approach to forest classification using LiDAR data.

With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Choco across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass (AGB) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and AGB at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests. Results: Upland Choc6 forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and AGB of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and AGB (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar AGB as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest AGB (244.3 +/- 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 +/- 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon. Conclusions: Our assessment of carbon stocks and forest degradation can be used as a reference for reporting on the state of the Choco forests to REDD+ projects and to encourage restoration efforts through conservation and climate mitigation policies.

Internal variability may have amplified the observed retreat in recent years, but reliable attribution and projection requires accurate representation of relevant physics. Most current GCMs do not fully represent falling ice radiative effects (FIREs), and here we show that the small set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models that include FIREs tend to show faster observed retreat. We investigate this using controlled simulations with the CESM1-CAM5 model. Under 1pctCO2 simulations, including FIREs results in the first occurrence of an "ice-free" Arctic (monthly mean extent < 1 x 10(6) km(2)) at 550 ppm CO2, compared with 680 ppm otherwise. Over 60-90 degrees N oceans, snowflakes reduce downward surface shortwave radiation and increase downward surface longwave radiation, improving agreement with the satellite-based CERES EBAF-Surface dataset. We propose that snowflakes' equivalent greenhouse effect reduces the mean sea ice thickness, resulting in a thinner pack whose retreat is more easily triggered by global warming. This is supported by the CESM1-CAM5 surface fluxes and a reduced initial thickness in perennial sea ice regions by approximately 0.3 m when FIREs are included. This explanation does not apply across the CMIP5 ensemble in which inter-model variation in the simulation of other processes likely dominates. Regardless, we show that FIRE can substantially change Arctic sea ice projections and propose that better including falling ice radiative effects in models is a high priority.

We present an initial overview of the filamentary structure in the Orion A molecular cloud utilizing a high angular and velocity resolution (CO)-O-18(1-0) emission map that was recently produced as part of the CARMA-NRO Orion Survey. Aims. The main goal of this study is to build a credible method to study varying widths of filaments which has previously been linked to star formation in molecular clouds. Due to the diverse star forming activities taking place throughout its similar to 20 pc length, together with its proximity of 388 pc, the Orion A molecular cloud provides an excellent laboratory for such an experiment to be carried out with high resolution and high sensitivity. Methods. Using the widely-known structure identification algorithm, DisPerSE, on a three-dimensional (PPV) (CO)-O-18 cube, we identify 625 relatively short (the longest being 1.74 pc) filaments over the entire cloud. We studied the distribution of filament widths using FilChaP, a python package that we have developed and made publicly available. Results. We find that the filaments identified in a two square-degree PPV cube do not overlap spatially, except for the complex OMC-4 region that shows distinct velocity components along the line of sight. The filament widths vary between 0.02 and 0.3 pc depending on the amount of substructure that a filament possesses. The more substructure a filament has, the larger is its width. We also find that despite this variation, the filament width shows no anticorrelation with the central column density which is in agreement with previous Herschel observations.

DES Collaboration	First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey: Photometric Pipeline and Light-curve Data Release	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: observations; supernovae: general; techniques: photometric		We present griz light curves of 251 SNe Ia from the first 3 years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program's (DES-SN) spectroscopically classified sample. The photometric pipeline described in this paper produces the calibrated fluxes and associated uncertainties used in the cosmological parameter analysis by employing a scene modeling approach that simultaneously models a variable transient flux and temporally constant host galaxy. We inject artificial point sources onto DECam images to test the accuracy of our photometric method. Upon comparison of input and measured artificial supernova fluxes, we find that flux biases peak at 3 mmag. We require corrections to our photometric uncertainties as a function of host galaxy surface brightness at the transient location, similar to that seen by the DES Difference Imaging Pipeline used to discover transients. The public release of the light curves can be found at https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/sn.	[Brout, D.; Sako, M.; D'Andrea, C.

After adopting a smooth window function, we calibrate the analytical model with numerical simulations from the "effective theory of structure formation" (ETHOS) project and fix the model parameters in the high-mass regime, M-h greater than or similar to 3 x 10(10) M-circle dot. We also perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with halo masses down to M-h similar to 10(8) M-circle dot to cover a wide mass range for comparison. Although the model is calibrated with ETHOS1 and cold dark matter simulations for high halo masses at redshift z = 0, it successfully reproduces simulations for two other ETHOS models in the low-mass regime at low and high redshifts. As an application, we compare the cumulative number density of halos to that of observed galaxies at z = 6, and find that the interacting dark matter models with a kinetic decoupling temperature below 0.5 keV is disfavored. We also perform the abundance-matching analysis and derive the stellar-halo mass relation for these models at z = 4. Suppression in halo abundance leads to less massive halos that host observed galaxies in the stellar mass range M-* similar or equal to 10(5)-10(7) M-circle dot.

Rapid "Turn-on" of Type-1 AGN in a Quiescent Early-type Galaxy SDSS1115+0544	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: nuclei; stars: flare; supernovae: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; HIGH-IONIZATION LINES; BLACK-HOLE MASSES; TIDAL DISRUPTION; EMISSION; QUASAR; EVOLUTION; STARS; POPULATION; SUPERNOVA	We present a detailed study of a transient in the center of SDSS1115+0544 based on the extensive UV, optical, mid-IR light curves (LCs) and spectra over 1200 days. The host galaxy is a quiescent early-type galaxy at z = 0.0899 with a black hole mass of 2 x 10(7) M-circle dot. The transient underwent a 2.5 mag brightening over similar to 120 days, reaching a peak V-band luminosity (extinction corrected) of -20.9 mag, then fading 0.5 mag over 200 days, settling into a plateau of >600 days. Following the optical brightening are the significant mid-IR flares at 3.4 and 4.5 mu m, with a peak time delay of similar to 180 days. The mid-IR LCs are explained as the echo of UV photons by a dust medium with a radius of 5 x 10(17) cm, consistent with E(B - V) of 0.58 inferred from the spectra. This event is very energetic with an extinction corrected L-bol similar to 4 x 10(44) erg s(-1). Optical spectra over 400 days in the plateau phase revealed newly formed broad H alpha, beta emission with a FWHM of similar to 3750 km s(-1) and narrow coronal lines such as [Fe VII], [Ne V]. This flare also has a steeply rising UV continuum, detected by multi-epoch Swift data at +700 to +900 days post optical peak. The broad Balmer lines and the UV continuum do not show significant temporal variations. The slow evolving LCs over 1200 days, the constant Balmer lines, and UV continuum at late times rule out tidal disruption event and SN IIn as the physical model for this event. We propose that this event is a "turn-on" AGN, transitioning from a quiescent state to a type-1 AGN with a sub-Eddington accretion rate of 0.017 M-circle dot yr(-1). This change occurred on a very short timescale of similar to 120-200 days. The discovery of such a rapid "turn-on" AGN poses challenges to accretion disk theories and suggests more future detections of similar events.

We performed environmental sensitivity tests of a 2 mu m semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) laser, self-injection locked to a high-Q crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator. Measured acceleration sensitivity of the laser is below 5 x 10(-1)(1) g(-1) in the 1-200 Hz frequency bandwidth and thermal sensitivity does not exceed 12 MHz/degrees C. The laser's frequency noise is below 50 Hz/Hz(1/)(2) at 10 Hz, reaching 0.4 Hz/Hz(1/)(2) at 400 kHz. The instantaneous linewidth of the laser is improved by nearly 4 orders of magnitude compared to the free-running DFB laser and is measured to be 50 Hz at 0.1 ms measurement time. The Allan deviation of the laser frequency is on the order of 10(-9) from 1 to 1000 s. All these features make the laser attractive for metrology applications involving low-noise 2 mu m seed lasers.

J	Hosseini, S				Hosseini, Sona			Characterization of cyclical spatial heterodyne spectrometers for astrophysical and planetary studies	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							BROAD-BAND; SPECTROSCOPY; EXPLORATION; EMISSION	High-resolution spectroscopy can make key science measurements for a variety of astrophysics and planetary targets, including solar system planetary atmospheres, comets, solar wind charge exchange emission, and interstellar and interplanetary medium. With the ability to record adjacent spectral lines simultaneously key isotopic ratios such as D/H, C-12/C-13, O-16/O-18, etc., can be measured precisely. Traditional high spectral resolution spectrometers usually must couple to large optics to compensate for their low throughput, which prohibits achieving compactness, in particular in space and remote field applications. Also, the high cost of construction and maintenance limit their quantity and usage for the long duration temporal measurement of the sources. Spatial heterodyne spectrometers (SHS) are increasingly used in scientific observations and industry. To date, SHS instruments come in two major architectures: Michelson design and cyclical design. Cyclical SHS, also known as reflective SHS, can offer significant advantages over traditional spectrometers in obtaining high-resolution spectra in shorter wavelengths. Although cyclical SHSs have been introduced before, there has been no mathematical or performance characterization of their technique. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical design and performance expectations of the cyclical tunable SHS technique to enable and expand its usage in a variety of platforms and applications, in the industry and astronomical observations from ground and space telescopes.

As grains grow from their initial interstellar-medium-like size distribution, settling depletes the disk's upper layers of dust and decreases the optical depth, cooling the interior. Here we investigate the effect of collisional growth of dust grains and their dynamics on the thermal and optical profile of the disk, and explore the possibility that cooling induced by grain growth and settling could lead to gravitational instability. We develop a Monte Carlo dust collision model with a weighting technique and allow particles to collisionally evolve through sticking and fragmentation, along with vertical settling and turbulent mixing. We explore three disk models and perform simulations for both constant and spatially variable turbulence profile. We then calculate mean wavelength-dependent opacities for the evolving disks and perform radiative transfer to calculate the temperature profile. Finally, we calculate the Toomre Q parameter, a measure of the disk's stability against self-gravity, after it reaches a steady-state dust-size distribution. We find that even weak turbulence can keep submicrometer-sized particles stirred in the disk's upper layer, affecting its optical and thermal profiles, and the growth of large particles in the midplane can make a massive disk optically thick at millimeter wavelengths, making it difficult to calculate the surface density of dust available for planet formation in the inner disk. Also, for all our initially marginally stable annuli, we find a small but noticeable reduction in Q.

Homogeneous internal structure of CM-like asteroid (41) Daphne	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: general; minor planets, asteroids: individual: Daphne; methods: observational; techniques: high angular resolution	MAIN-BELT ASTEROIDS; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES; PHOTOMETRIC GEODESY; REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PARENT BODIES; MASS; DENSITY	Context. CM-like asteroids (Ch and Cgh classes) are a major population within the broader C-complex, encompassing about 10% of the mass of the main asteroid belt. Their internal structure has been predicted to be homogeneous, based on their compositional similarity as inferred from spectroscopy and numerical modeling of their early thermal evolution. Aims. Here we aim to test this hypothesis by deriving the density of the CM-like asteroid (41) Daphne from detailed modeling of its shape and the orbit of its small satellite. Methods. We observed Daphne and its satellite within our imaging survey with the Very Large Telescope extreme adaptive-optics SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera and complemented this data set with earlier Keck/NIRC2 and VLT/NACO observations. We analyzed the dynamics of the satellite with our Genoid meta-heuristic algorithm. Combining our high-angular resolution images with optical lightcurves and stellar occultations, we determine the spin period, orientation, and 3D shape, using our ADAM shape modeling algorithm. Results. The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde orbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape model of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact craters. The mass determined from this orbit combined with the volume computed from the shape model implies a density for Daphne of 1.77 +/- 0.26 g cm(-3) (3 sigma). This density is consistent with a primordial CM-like homogeneous internal structure with some level of macroporosity (approximate to 17%). Conclusions. Based on our analysis of the density of Daphne and 75 other Ch/Cgh-type asteroids gathered from the literature, we conclude that the primordial internal structure of the CM parent bodies was homogeneous.

These surprisingly large and sometimes rapid transitions challenge accepted models of quasar physics and duty cycles, offer several new avenues for study of quasar host galaxies, and open a wider interpretation of the cause of differences between broad and narrow-line AGN. To better characterize extreme quasar variability, we present follow-up spectroscopy as part of a comprehensive search for CLQs across the full Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint using spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the SDSS DR7 catalog. Our primary selection requires large-amplitude (vertical bar Delta g vertical bar > 1mag, vertical bar Delta r vertical bar > 0.5 mag) variability over any of the available time baselines probed by the SDSS and Pan-STARRS. 1 surveys. We employ photometry from the Catalina Sky Survey to verify variability behavior in CLQ candidates where available, and confirm CLQs using optical spectroscopy from the William Herschel, MMT, Magellan, and Palomar telescopes. For our adopted signal-to-noise ratio threshold on variability of broad H beta emission, we find 17 new CLQs, yielding a confirmation rate of greater than or similar to 20%. These candidates are at lower Eddington ratio relative to the overall quasar population, which supports a disk-wind model for the broad line region. Based on our sample, the CLQ fraction increases from 10% to roughly half as the continuum flux ratio between repeat spectra at 3420 angstrom. increases from 1.5 to 6. We release a catalog of more than 200 highly variable candidates to facilitate future CLQ searches.

New Horizons Photometry of Pluto's Moon Charon	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Kuiper belt: general; Kuiper belt objects: individual (Charon, Pluto); planets and satellites: surfaces; techniques: photometric	BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; SURFACE-PROPERTIES; PHASE CURVES; ALBEDOS; PHOEBE; IMAGER; RALPH; COLOR; RHEA	The New Horizons spacecraft extended the range in solar phase angle coverage for Pluto's moon Charon from 1 degrees.8-the maximum observable from Earth-to 170 degrees. This extraordinary expansion in range has enabled photometric modeling and a robust determination of Charon's phase integral and Bond albedo at visible wavelengths. Photometric modeling shows that Charon is similar in its photometric properties to other icy moons, except that its single particle phase function is more isotropic, suggesting the Kuiper Belt may represent a new regime for surface alteration processes. Charon's phase integral is 0.70 +/- 0.04 and its Bond albedo is 0.29 +/- 0.05.	[Buratti, B. J.; Hicks, M. D.; Abgarian, M.; Hofgartner, J.

Source Apportionment of Ambient Methane Enhancements in Los Angeles, California, To Evaluate Emission Inventory Estimates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; COMPOUNDS VOCS; LIGHT ALKANES; CLARS-FTS; LANDFILL; GAS	Rapid increase in atmospheric methane (CH4) mixing ratios over the past century is attributable to the intensification of human activities. Information on spatially explicit source contributions is needed to develop efficient and cost-effective CH4 emission reduction and mitigation strategies to addresses near-term climate change. This study collected long-term ambient CH4 measurements at Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) in Los Angeles, California, to estimate the annual CH4 emissions from the portion of Los Angeles County that is within the South Coast Air Basin (SCLA). The measurement-based CH4 emission estimates for SCLA ranged from 3.95 to 4.89 million metric tons (MMT) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year between 2012 and 2016. Source apportionment of CH4, CO, CO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measurements were used to evaluate source categories that contributed to ambient CH4 mixing ratio enhancements (Delta CH4) at SCLA between 2014 and 2016. Results suggested Delta CH4 contributions of 56-79% from natural gas sources, 7-31% from landfills, and 4-15% from transportation sources. The SCLA-specific CH4 emission estimate made using a research grade gridded CH4 emission inventory suggested contributions of 47% from natural gas sources and 50% from landfills. Subsequent airborne measurements determined that CH4 emissions from two major CH4 sources in SCLA were significantly smaller in magnitude than previously thought. This study highlights the importance of studying the variabilities of CH4 emissions across California for policy makers and stakeholders alike.

OSIRIS-REx Team	The operational environment and rotational acceleration of asteroid (101955) Bennu from OSIRIS-REx observations	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PHASE FUNCTION; MODEL; LIGHTCURVE; SATELLITES; PHOTOMETRY; RADAR	During its approach to asteroid (101955) Bennu, NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft surveyed Bennu's immediate environment, photometric properties, and rotation state. Discovery of a dusty environment, a natural satellite, or unexpected asteroid characteristics would have had consequences for the mission's safety and observation strategy. Here we show that spacecraft observations during this period were highly sensitive to satellites (sub-meter scale) but reveal none, although later navigational images indicate that further investigation is needed. We constrain average dust production in September 2018 from Bennu's surface to an upper limit of 150 g s(-1) averaged over 34 min. Bennu's disk-integrated photometric phase function validates measurements from the pre-encounter astronomical campaign. We demonstrate that Bennu's rotation rate is accelerating continuously at 3.63 +/- 0.52 x 10(-6) degrees day(-2), likely due to the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, with evolutionary implications.

Comprehensive analysis of anomalous ANITA events disfavors a diffuse tau-neutrino flux origin	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC SHOWERS; RADIO PULSES; ENERGY; SIMULATIONS	Recently, the ANITA collaboration reported on two upward-going extensive air shower events consistent with a primary particle that emerges from the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet. These events may be of nu(tau) origin, in which the neutrino interacts within the Earth to produce a tau lepton that emerges from the Earth, decays in the atmosphere, and initiates an extensive air shower. In this paper we estimate an upper bound on the ANITA acceptance to a diffuse nu(tau) flux detected via tau-lepton-induced air showers within the bounds of standard model uncertainties. By comparing this estimate with the acceptance of Pierre Auger Observatory and IceCube and assuming standard model interactions, we conclude that a nu(tau) origin of these events would imply a neutrino flux at least two orders of magnitude above current bounds.

Upper limits on CH3OH in the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk Evidence for a low gas-phase CH3OH-to-H2CO ratio	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; protoplanetary disks; submillimeter: stars	H2O-CO ICE; METHANOL; CHEMISTRY; MOLECULES; FORMALDEHYDE; TEMPERATURE; DESORPTION; DEPENDENCE; ENVELOPE; OUTER	Context. Methanol (CH3OH) is at the root of organic ice chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Its connection to prebiotic chemistry and its role in the chemical environment of the disk midplane make it an important target for disk chemistry studies. However, its weak emission has made detections difficult. To date, gas-phase CH3OH is detected in only one Class II disk, TW Hya. Aims. We aim to constrain the methanol content of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk. Methods. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to search for a total of four CH3OH emission lines in bands six and seven toward the disk around the young Herbig Ae star HD 163296. The disk-averaged column density of methanol and its related species formaldehyde (H2CO) were estimated assuming optically thin emission in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We compared these results to the gas-phase column densities of the TW Hya disk. Results. No targeted methanol lines were detected with Keplerian masking in the image plane nor with matched filter analysis in the uv plane individually nor after line stacking. The 3 sigma disk-integrated intensity upper limits are <51 mJy km s(-1) for the band six lines and <26 mJy km s(-1) for the band seven lines. The band seven lines provide the strictest 3 sigma upper limit on disk-averaged column density with N-avg < 5.0 x 10(11) cm(-2). The methanol-to-formaldehyde ratio is CH3OH/H2CO < 0.24 in the HD 163296 disk compared to a ratio of 1.27 in the TW Hya disk. Conclusions. The HD 163296 protoplanetary disk is less abundant in methanol with respect to formaldehyde compared to the disk around TW Hya. Differences in the stellar irradiation in this Herbig Ae disk as compared to that of a disk around a T Tauri star likely influence the gaseous methanol and formaldehyde content. Possible reasons for the lower HD 163296 methanol-to-formaldehyde ratio include: a higher than expected gas-phase formation of H2CO in the HD 163296 disk, uncertainties in the grain surface formation efficiency of CH3OH and H2CO, and differences in the disk structure and/or CH3OH and H2CO desorption processes that drive the release of the molecules from ice mantles back into the gas phase. These results provide observational evidence that the gas-phase chemical complexity found in disks may be strongly influenced by the spectral type of the host star.	[Carney, M. T.; Hogerheijde, M.

Marine liquid cloud geometric thickness retrieved from OCO-2's oxygen A-band spectrometer	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							MOLECULAR LINE ABSORPTION; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; EFFECTIVE RADIUS; INFORMATION-CONTENT; OPTICAL-THICKNESS; SCATTERING ATMOSPHERE; STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; WATER CLOUDS; TOP HEIGHT	This paper introduces the OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX product, which uses the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) hyperspectral A-band spectrometer. CALIPSO provides a prior cloud top pressure (P-top) for an OCO-2-based retrieval of cloud optical depth, P-top and cloud geometric thickness expressed in hPa. Measurements are of single-layer liquid clouds over oceans from September 2014 to December 2016 when collocated data are available. Retrieval performance is best for solar zenith angles <45 degrees and when the cloud phase classification, which also uses OCO-2's weak CO2 band, is more confident. The highest quality optical depth retrievals agree with those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with discrepancies smaller than the MODIS-reported uncertainty. Retrieved thicknesses are consistent with a substantially subadiabatic structure over marine stratocumulus regions, in which extinction is weighted towards the cloud top. Cloud top pressure in these clouds shows a 4 hPa bias compared with CALIPSO which we attribute mainly to the assumed vertical structure of cloud extinction after showing little sensitivity to the presence of CALIPSO-identified aerosol layers or assumed cloud droplet effective radius. This is the first case of success in obtaining internal cloud structure from hyperspectral A-band measurements and exploits otherwise unused OCO-2 data. This retrieval approach should provide additional constraints on satellite-based estimates of cloud droplet number concentration from visible imagery, which rely on parameterization of the cloud thickness.

An increasing trend in data discovery is to mine hidden relationships among users and metadata from the web usage logs to support the data discovery process. Web usage log mining is the process of reconstructing sessions from raw logs and finding interesting patterns or implicit linkages. The mining results play an important role in improving quality of search-related components, e.g., ranking, query suggestion, and recommendation. While researches were done in the data discovery domain, collecting and analyzing logs efficiently remains a challenge because (1) the volume of web usage logs continues to grow as long as users access the data; (2) the dynamic volume of logs requires on-demand computing resources for mining tasks; (3) the mining process is compute-intensive and time-intensive. To speed up the mining process, we propose a cloud-based log-mining framework using Apache Spark and Elasticsearch. In addition, a data partition paradigm, logPartitioner, is designed to solve the data imbalance problem in data parallelism. As a proof of concept, oceanographic data search and access logs are chosen to validate performance of the proposed parallel log-mining framework.

Rapid Geodetic Analysis of Subduction Zone Earthquakes Leveraging a 3-D Elastic Green's Function Library	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						subduction earthquake; rapid response; geodetic analysis; Green's function; finite element model; Mexico megathrust	HIGH-RATE GPS; COSEISMIC DEFORMATION; AMATRICE EARTHQUAKE; SURFACE DEFORMATION; FAULT SLIP; INSAR; SENSITIVITIES; INVERSIONS; GEOMETRY; GORKHA	The 2018 M7.2 Pinotepa earthquake ruptured a shallow slab section along the Middle America subduction zone. We demonstrate how a geodetic Green's function (GF) library and efficient modeling algorithm can rapidly resolve earthquake slip and contribute to early warning systems. The source is characterized with InSAR data and a finite-element model mimicking realistic slab geometry (Slab1.0) and velocity structures (CRUST2.0) that are not considered in the conventional homogeneous (HOM)- or layered(1-D)-crust solutions. The rupture is imaged 18 min after geodetic data are downloaded to a 16-CPU-thread workstation. Nearby M(w)8.6-megathrust scenarios are also studied with synthetic GPS data in the Guerrero/Oaxaca area. Our results show that earthquake slip solutions are sensitive to the materials of elastic-modeling domains. Attaining smaller misfits or sums of squared errors, models by 3-D GFs significantly better recover coseismic displacements than those estimated with 1-D GFs or HOM GFs at 95% confidence. Plain Language Summary A M(w)7.2 earthquake took place near the city of Pinotepa Nacinoal in Oaxaca, Mexico, on 16 February 2018 and became the third most significant event striking southern Mexico since mid-2017, after the M(w)8.2 Tehuantepec and M(w)7.1 Puebla-Morelos earthquakes. A new algorithm of deformation modeling is designed to use a fault library to efficiently characterize the earthquake source. This library accounts for fault slip within both rock and structural complexities documented within the Middle America subduction zone. We further study 100 M(w)8.6 megathrust scenarios and discover that an elastic model of these complexities is necessary to better recover the slip and surface displacements than the customary layered or uniform-crust solutions. These M(w)8.6 scenarios are the largest expected events based on historical records. Our algorithm images the Pinotepa earthquake rupture 18 min after the ground displacement data are downlinked from the satellite and processed in local machines, providing an alternative of evaluating the earthquake mechanism in addition to other seismological methods. The majority of fault slip (up to 1.2 m) is located over a gently dipping slab segment at a depth of similar to 21 km. These results illuminate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm for real-time analyses, without compromising model accuracy to analytical solutions.

To investigate its relationship with the stress changes induced by prior tectonic and magmatic activity, we model the coseismic slip distribution, preintrusion deformation, and dike intrusion using geodetic, seismic, and tsunami observations. The decollement beneath the south flank was creeping seaward by similar to 25cm/year. Diking started on 20 April and led to fissure eruption on 3 May. The magmatic activity and creep resulted in an onshore U-shaped zone of stress unloading, fringed by an off-shore zone of stress buildup that apparently guided the 2018 rupture. It takes only 20 to 35 years at the preintrusion rate to accumulate a moment deficit equivalent to the moment that was released in 2018. This event falls short of balancing the moment budget since the 1975 Mw 7.7 earthquake. Plain Language Summary As one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, Kilauea volcanos in Hawaii are responsible for various deformation sources including summit reservoirs, rift zones, decollement faults, and slumps, which result in thousands of earthquakes each year. While most of the minor earthquakes (M < 4) there are related to magma movement through conduits and cracks, the causes and mechanisms for less frequent but large and devastating events, such as the 1975 Ms 7.2 Kalapana earthquake and the 1868 similar to M 8 Great Kau earthquake, are still not fully understood, and only conceptual models were proposed partially due to poor observations at that time. We act to further the prior analysis to combine seismological and geodetic data sets to constrain the relationships of magmatic processes with large-scale triggered earthquakes, using the April 2018 Hawaiian eruption and the corresponding 4 May 2018 Mw 7.2 as a case study. Our results show the creep on the decollement constantly alter the stress accumulation, while dike intrusion trigger the occurrence of the large earthquakes. Besides, it will take about 20 to 35 years for such a damaging earthquake to reoccur on the decollement beneath the south flank of Kilauea.

The Role of Atmospheric Rivers for Extreme Ablation and Snowfall Events in the Southern Alps of New Zealand	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Atmospheric rivers; glacier mass balance; New Zealand	BREWSTER GLACIER; MASS-BALANCE; PRECIPITATION; CIRCULATION; SENSITIVITY; IMPACTS; RECORD; ENERGY; WEST; EAST	The role of atmospheric rivers (ARs) for extreme ablation and snowfall is examined at Brewster Glacier in the Southern Alps, the site of the longest glacier mass balance record in New Zealand. By global standards, New Zealand is strongly impacted by ARs. Here it is shown for the first time (in New Zealand) that ARs strongly contribute to extreme snowfall and ablation and thus mass balance overall. Vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) exceeds 1,600 (800) kg.m(-1).s(-1) for the largest ablation (snowfall) events, marking these as very strong ARs. The proximity to the freezing threshold during extreme snowfall events indicates the sensitivity of mass balance to temperature variation. Importantly, similarly high rates of IVT during some extreme ablation and snowfall events also occur outside of conventional AR spatial structures. This finding indicates that AR detection algorithms may substantially underestimate the importance of extreme IVT for New Zealand and elsewhere. Plain Language Summary New Zealand glaciers are very sensitive to climate variation and change-yet relatively little is known about the individual weather patterns that cause extreme ablation and accumulation events. Similarly, while the importance of atmospheric rivers (ARs) for extreme weather events in New Zealand is generally recognized, their importance for glacier mass balance has not been studied before. ARs are long, narrow corridors of very high atmospheric water vapor transport, with volumetric flow rates equivalent to the world's largest rivers. Here we show (for the first time) that ARs do play a key role for glacier mass balance in New Zealand. Importantly, we also show that some common methods for identifying ARs do not capture all of the most extreme ablation and melt events-even though they are driven by water vapor transport rates equivalent to conventionally defined ARs. As such, past studies have likely underestimated the importance of AR-type events, both in New Zealand and elsewhere.	[Little, K.; Kingston, D. G.; Cullen, N.

The development and trial of an unmanned aerial system for the measurement of methane flux from landfill and greenhouse gas emission hotspots	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Unmanned Aerial Systems; Greenhouse gases; Methane flux; Hotspots		This paper describes the development of a new sampling and measurement method to infer methane flux using proxy measurements of CO2 concentration and wind data recorded by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The flux method described and trialed here is appropriate to the spatial scale of landfill sites and analogous greenhouse gas emission hotspots, making it an important new method for low-cost and rapid case study quantification of fluxes from currently uncertain (but highly important) greenhouse gas sources. We present a case study using these UAS-based measurements to derive instantaneous methane fluxes from a test landfill site in the north of England using a mass balance model tailored for UAS sampling and co-emitted CO2 concentration as a methane-emission proxy. Methane flux (and flux uncertainty) during two trials on 27 November 2014 and 5 March 2015, were found to be 0.140 kg s(-1) (+/- 61% at 1 sigma), and 0.050 kg s(-1) (+/- 54% at 1 sigma), respectively. Uncertainty contributing to the flux was dominated by ambient variability in the background (inflow) concentration (>40%) and wind speed (>10%); with instrumental error contributing only similar to 1-2%. The approach described represents an important advance concerning the challenging problem of greenhouse gas hotspot flux calculation, and offers transferability to a wide range of analogous environments.

The mid-IR spectral effects of darkening agents and porosity on the silicate surface features of airless bodies	ICARUS			English	Article						spectroscopy; asteroids, composition; satellites, composition	CM CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; PARTICLE-SIZE; EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY; TROJAN ASTEROIDS; SPACE-TELESCOPE; DARK MATERIAL; MINERALOGY; IAPETUS; REFLECTANCE	We systematically measured the mid-IR spectra of different mixtures of three silicates (antigorite, lizardite, and pure silica) with varying effective porosities and amounts of darkening agent (iron oxide and carbon). These spectra have broad implications for interpretation of current and future mission data for airless bodies, as well as for testing the capabilities of new instruments. Serpentines, such as antigorite and lizardite, are common to airless surfaces, and their mid-IR spectra in the presence of darkening agents and different surface porosities would be typical for those measured by spacecraft. Silica has been measured in the plumes of Enceladus and presents exciting possibilities for other Saturn-system surfaces due to long-range transport of E-ring material. Results show that the addition of the IR-transparent salt, KBr, to simulate surface porosity affected silicate spectra in ways that were not predictable from linear mixing models. The strengthening of silicate bands with increasing pore space, even when only trace amounts of KBr were added, indicates that spectral features of porous surfaces are more detectable in the mid-IR. Combining iron oxide with the pure silicates seemed to flatten most of the silicate features, but strengthened the reststrahlen band of the silica. Incorporating carbon with the silicates weakened all silicate features, but the silica bands were more resistant to being diminished, indicating silica may be more detectable in the mid-IR than the serpentines. Finally, we show how incorporating darkening agents and porosity provides a more complete explanation of the mid-IR spectral features previously reported on worlds such as Iapetus.

The diameter of each point ablated by the ChemCam laser is in the range of medium to coarse sand in size. Thus, rocks with grains significantly smaller than the laser spot size produce bulk rock compositions at each LIBS point and low point-to-point chemical variability among LIBS points. In contrast, analyses of rocks with grains about the size of the spot or larger contain contributions from individual grains at each point and often have high point-to-point chemical variability. The Gini index, a statistical parameter, was used to calculate the point-to-point chemical variability in major-element oxide compositions derived from the ChemCam LIBS data. First, the total range of each LIBS major-element oxide composition was normalized from 0 to 1 across all LIBS observations. Then the Gini index was calculated for each oxide in each LIBS observation. Finally, the Gini indices of each oxide were averaged to derive a Gini index mean score, G(MEAN,) for each LIBS observation. A correlation between G(MEAN) and grain size was validated using sedimentary rocks of various grain sizes from the Yellowknife Bay formation and the Pahrump Hills member of the Murray formation in Gale crater. Overall, finer-grained rocks had smaller G(MEAN) than coarser-grained rocks. To calibrate G(MEAN) to grain size, grain size estimates based on visual assessment of high-resolution images were compared to G(MEAN) values for the same targets to create a calibrated scale. This calibrated scale was used to infer the grain size of rocks with unknown grain size. Overall, the grain sizes predicted for rocks with unknown grain size overlapped with those of known grain size from the same units and/or bedrock targets. The grain sizes inferred using the G(MEAN) based on ChemCam LIBS data are complimentary to those determined from images and both techniques can be used to improve interpretations of the depositional environments of rocks analyzed by Curiosity and future Mars missions with LIES, such as the Mars 2020 rover.

J	Fleury, B; Gudipati, MS; Couturier-Tamburelli, I; Carrasco, N				Fleury, Benjamin; Gudipati, Murthy S.; Couturier-Tamburelli, Isabelle; Carrasco, Nathalie			Photoreactivity of condensed acetylene on Titan aerosols analogues	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Titan, Atmosphere; Ices; Photochemistry	HUYGENS LANDING SITE; ORGANIC-CHEMISTRY; C4N2 ICE; ATMOSPHERE; SURFACE; SPECTRA; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; STRATOSPHERE; THERMOSPHERE; MESOSPHERE	Volatile organic molecules formed by photochemistry in the upper atmosphere of Titan can undergo condensation as pure ices in the stratosphere and the troposphere as well as condense as ice layers onto the organic aerosols that are visible as the haze layers of Titan. As solar photons penetrate through Titan's atmosphere, shorter-wavelength photons are attenuated and longer-wavelength photons make it into the lower altitudes, where aerosols become abundant. We conducted an experimental study to evaluate the long wavelength (lambda > 300 nm) photoreactivity of these ices accreted on the Titan aerosol-analogs (also known as tholins) made in the laboratory. We have focused on acetylene, the third most abundant hydrocarbon in Titan's atmosphere (after CH4 and C2H6). Further, acetylene is the most abundant unsaturated hydrocarbon in Titan's atmosphere. Our results indicate that the aerosols can act as activation centers to drive the photoreactivity of acetylene with the aerosols at the accretion interface at wavelengths where acetylene-ice alone does not show photoreactivity. We found that along with photochemistry, photodesorption plays an important role. We observed that about 15% of the initial acetylene is photodesorbed, with a photodesorption rate of (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-6) molecules.photon(-1) at 355 nm. This photodesorption is wavelength-dependent, confirming that it is mediated by the UV absorption of the aerosol analogues, similar to photochemistry. We conclude that the UV-Vis properties of aerosols would determine how they evolve further in Titan's atmosphere and on the surface through photochemical alterations involving longer-wavelength photons. Stronger extinction coefficients in the longer wavelength UV-Vis regions ( > 300 nm) of the aerosol give higher efficiencies of photodesorption of accreted volatiles as well as photochemical incorporation of unsaturated condensates (such as acetylene) into the aerosols.

Evidence for color dichotomy in the primordial Neptunian Trojan population	ICARUS			English	Article						Trojan asteroids; Trans Neptunian objects; Resonances; Orbital	SIZE DISTRIBUTION; KUIPER-BELT; CHAOTIC CAPTURE; GIANT PLANETS; ASTEROIDS; INCLINATION; ORIGIN; URANUS	In the current model of early Solar System evolution, the stable members of the Jovian and Neptunian Trojan populations were captured into resonance from the leftover reservoir of planetesimals during the outward migration of the giant planets. As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common origin with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members constitute today's trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations. The cold (low inclination and small eccentricity) classical TNOs are ultra-red, while the dynamically excited "hot" (high inclination and larger eccentricity) population of TNOs contains a mixture of ultra-red and blue objects. In contrast, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red Jovian Trojans can be readily explained by the sublimation of volatile material from their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation at 5 AU, the lack of ultra-red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation models. In this work we report the discovery by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of two new dynamically stable L4 Neptunian Trojans, 2013 VX30 and 2014 UU240, both with inclinations i > 30 degrees, making them the highest-inclination known stable Neptunian Trojans. We have measured the colors of these and three other dynamically stable Neptunian Trojans previously observed by DES, and find that 2013 VX30 is ultra-red, the first such Neptunian Trojan in its class. As such, 2013 VX30 may be a "missing link" between the Trojan and TNO populations. Using a simulation of the DES TNO detection efficiency, we find that there are 162 +/- 73 Trojans with H-r < 10 at the L4 Lagrange point of Neptune. Moreover, the blue-to-red Neptunian Trojan population ratio should be higher than 17:1. Based on this result, we discuss the possible origin of the ultra-red Neptunian Trojan population and its implications for the formation history of Neptunian Trojans.

Cassini RADAR Team	Compositional variations of Titan's impact craters indicates active surface erosion	ICARUS			English	Article						Cratering; Satellites surface; Titan surface; Radar observations; Infrared observations	CASSINI VIMS; GALILEAN SATELLITES; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; RADAR; CONSTRAINTS; TOPOGRAPHY; ATMOSPHERE; DUNES	Titan, the only moon in the solar system with a considerable atmosphere, is host to a variety of exogenic processes that shape its surface. These processes form features that are quite similar to features on Earth, including sand dunes, rivers, and lakes. The combination of a thick atmosphere and active surface processes also leads to a scarcity of impact craters on the surface of Titan. The compositions of these craters vary and may relate to the type and extent of erosion occurring at their location. In this work, we examined the composition of 12 impact features on Titan using Cassini's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and 2.18 cm emissivity data from the RADAR radiometer on board the probe. Comparisons were made between crater composition as inferred from VIMS and composition as inferred from emissivity data with corresponding crater characteristics such as latitude, longitude and erosional state. We see a correlation between crater subsurface composition as inferred from the emissivity data and its erosional state and location. Well-preserved craters typically are more enriched in water-ice than degraded, organic-rich craters, suggesting that variations in composition are partially controlled by erosion and infilling. Moreover, craters located in dune fields show more subsurface organic enrichment than craters within the plains, which indicates that the efficiency of erosion and infilling varies with location and geologic context. VIMS data provide complementary information about crater surficial composition. We note that VIMS spectra do not change with erosional state, but rather appear to depend on the crater location on the moon. We suggest that there are active surface processes occurring on Titan, such as wind or rain, which are actively clearing off its surface and filling in subsurface fractures with organic materials. These processes would act to change the emissivity of the craters over time but leave the surface sensed by VIMS unchanged.	[Werynski, A.; Neish, C.

Here, we extend this analysis to Gemini-North/NIFS observations of Neptune recorded in 2009 and find a similar detection of H2S spectral absorption features in the 1.57-1.58 mu m range, albeit slightly less evident, and retrieve a mole fraction of similar to 1 - 3 ppm at the cloud tops. We find a much clearer detection (and much higher retrieved column abundance above the clouds) at southern polar latitudes compared with equatorial latitudes, which suggests a higher relative humidity of H2S here. We find our retrieved H2S abundances are most consistent with atmospheric models that have reduced methane abundance near Neptune's south pole, consistent with HST/STIS determinations (Karkoschka and Tomasko, 2011). We also conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Neptune and Uranus data and found that in the 1.57-1.60 mu m range, some of the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) mapped closely to physically significant quantities, with one being strongly correlated with the modelled H2S signal and clearly mapping the spatial dependence of its spectral detectability. Just as for Uranus, the detection of H2S at the cloud tops constrains the deep bulk sulphur/nitrogen abundance to exceed unity (i.e. > 4.4 - 5.0 times the solar value) in Neptune's bulk atmosphere, provided that ammonia is not sequestered at great depths, and places a lower limit on its mole fraction below the observed cloud of (0.4-1.3) x 10(-5). The detection of gaseous H2S at these pressure levels adds to the weight of evidence that the principal constituent of the 2.5-3.5 bar cloud is likely to be H2S ice.	[Irwin, Patrick G.

The LCOGT network allows for regular monitoring of a sample of targets, such as that of NEOs for which we can attempt to measure the Yarkovsky effect. We have used LCOGT's global network of nine 1.0-m telescopes to measure the Yarkovsky effect on 36 asteroids through precise astrometric measurements using the Gaia-DR1 catalog; 18 (50%) of the 36 asteroids yielded > 3 sigma Yarkovsky detections. The target asteroids were selected through simulated observations each month to determine the objects for which new astrometry would yield the highest likelihood of a Yarkovsky detection. The Gaia-DR1 release has greatly improved the quality of the astrometry obtained, making the detection of the Yarkovsky effect more likely and secure by greatly reducing systematic catalog zonal errors. LCOGT is ideally suited to perform these observations due to its ability to monitor many targets over several days by employing dynamic scheduling, weather avoidance, and use of multiple sites around the globe.

Low-temperature specific heat capacity measurements and application to Mars thermal modeling	ICARUS			English	Article							MERIDIANI-PLANUM; MARTIAN SURFACE; ROCKS; IDENTIFICATION; ENTROPIES; CRATER; IMPACT; CONDUCTIVITY; DIVERSITY; MINERALS	Data returned from Martian missions have revealed a wide diversity of surface mineralogies, including in geological structures interpreted to be sedimentary or altered by liquid water. These terrains are of great interest because of their potential to document the environment at a time when life may have appeared. Intriguingly, Martian sedimentary rocks show distinctly low thermal inertia values (i.e. 300 - 700 Jm(-2)K(-1)s(-1/2), indicative of a combination of low thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density). These low values are difficult to reconcile with their competent bedrock morphologies, whereas hundreds of bedrock occurrences, interpreted as volcanic in origin, have been mapped globally and display thermal inertia values > 1200 Jm(-2)K(-1)s(-1/2). Bedrock thermal inertia values are generally assumed to be driven by their bulk thermal conductivity, which in turn is controlled by their micro- and macro-physical properties (i.e., degree and style of cementation in the case of detritic rocks, horizontal fractures and layering, etc.), and not by their density (well-known from terrestrial analog measurements, and with modest variability) or specific heat capacity (generally uncharacterized for non-basaltic materials below room temperature). In this paper, we demonstrate that specific heat capacity cannot be a potential cause for the differential thermophysical behavior between magmatic and sedimentary rocks through a series of experimental C-p(T) measurements at 100-350 K using differential scanning calorimetry. The results on 20 Martian-relevant minerals investigated in this work indicate that these materials exhibit very similar specific heats, ranging from 0.3-0.7 Jg(-1)K(-1) at 100 K to 0.6-1.7 Jg(-1)K(-1) at 350 K. When used in a Martian thermal model, this range of C-p values translate to very small surface temperature differences, indicating that uncertainty in composition (and its effect on the specific heat) is not a noticeable source of thermal inertia variability for indurated units on Mars. We therefore conclude that the low thermal inertia value of sedimentary rocks compared to magmatic/volcanic rocks is likely due to their low apparent bulk conductivity, which bears information on their internal physical' structure. Future work combining the analysis of thermal observations acquired at various local times and seasons will help further characterize this heterogeneity.

However, given the technical challenges and the costs associated with outer solar system exploration, direct analysis of the ocean appears unlikely in the foreseeable future. Therefore, constraints on the chemical composition of the ocean will need to be inferred, for example, from analysis of the surface ice, either via remote sensing or landed surface missions. In this paper, we combine our recent body of work studying the chemistry of frozen putative Europa ocean brines with new experiments to develop predictions of the sequence by which the hydrated minerals form when a four-ionic component ocean (Na+,Cl-, Mg2+, and SO42-) freezes as a function of relative ionic concentrations and pH. This in turn provides a means to begin linking observed surface chemistry and the chemical environment of the subsurface ocean as well as insight into endogenic versus exogenic origin of detected species.

In this work, we document the morphologic, textural, and chemical properties of these concretions throughout 300 m of Murray formation stratigraphy from Mars Science Laboratory observations between Sols 750-1900. We interpret these observations to constrain the timing and composition of post-depositional fluid events at Gale crater. We determine that the overall diversity of concretion morphology, size, texture, and chemistry throughout the Murray formation indicates that concretions formed in multiple, likely late diagenetic, episodes with varying fluid chemistries. Four major concretion assemblages are observed at distinct stratigraphic intervals and approximately correlate with major distinct chemical enrichments in Mg-S-Ni-Cl, Mn-P, and Ca-S, among other local enrichments. Different concretion size populations and complex relationships between concretions and veins also suggest multiple precipitation events at Gale crater. Many concretions likely formed during late diagenesis after sediment compaction and lithification, based on observations of concretions preserving primary host rock laminations without differential compaction. An upsection decrease in overall concretion size corresponds to an inferred upsection decrease in porosity and permeability, thus constraining concretion formation as postdating fluid events that produced initial cementation and porosity loss. The combined observations of late diagenetic concretions and distinct chemical enrichments related to concretions allow constraints to be placed on the chemistry of late stage fluids at Gale crater. Collectively, concretion observations from this work and previous studies of other diagenetic features (veins, alteration halos) suggest at least six post-depositional events that occurred at Gale crater after the deposition of the Murray formation.

In light of the recent Juno mission which is exploring the inner magnetosphere and the atmosphere of Jupiter, it is worthwhile to reconsider the original measurements of Cassini at Jupiter. The better instrument knowledge in combination with a better understanding of the ammonia distribution of Jupiter has allowed for revising the synchrotron flux density to 1.10 +/- 0.07 Jansky, a factor of 2.5 larger than the initial estimate (Bolton et al., 2002). The forward model reduced uncertainties pertaining to the spacecraft pointing using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and constrained simultaneously a brightness model of Jupiter with a disk-averaged brightness temperature of 158.6 +/- 2.4 K and depletion of ammonia at the poles (limb darking coefficient, p = 0.05). The flux density spectrum for the 2001 measurement campaign reveals a depletion of energetic electrons ( > 30 MeV) in contrast to an undisturbed electron population at lower energies. Comparing the Cassini radio maps to Very Large Array maps revealed a redistribution of energetic particles to higher latitudes, indicating enhanced pitch angle scattering for energetic particles. This kind of behavior has been observed in the terrestrial Van Allen belts and could be caused by the resonance of energetic electrons with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. We used a simplified analytic expression to determine the feasibility of this process at Jupiter. Although this process is not feasible under nominal conditions, a 10-fold enhancement of the cold plasma density, caused for example by extreme UV events, or volcanic eruptions on Io, could lead to rapid pitch angle scattering of electrons, and the subsequent removal of these particles by the atmosphere.

Even as data-model comparisons are becoming more common, many models simulating the behavior of the GrIS during the past rely on meshes with coarse horizontal resolutions (>= 10 km). In this study, we explore the impact of model resolution on the simulated nature of retreat across southwestern Greenland during the Holocene. Four simulations are performed using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM): three that use a uniform mesh and horizontal mesh resolutions of 20, 10, and 5 km, and one that uses a nonuniform mesh with a resolution ranging from 2 to 15 km. We find that the simulated retreat can vary significantly between models with different horizontal resolutions based on how well the bed topography is resolved. In areas of low topographic relief, the horizontal resolution plays a negligible role in simulated differences in retreat, with each model instead responding similarly to retreat driven by surface mass balance (SMB). Conversely, in areas where the bed topography is complex and high in relief, such as fjords, the lower-resolution models (10 and 20 km) simulate unrealistic retreat that occurs as ice surface lowering intersects bumps in the bed topography that would otherwise be resolved as troughs using the higher-resolution grids. Our results highlight the important role that high-resolution grids play in simulating retreat in areas of complex bed topography, but also suggest that models using nonuniform grids can save computational resources through coarsening the mesh in areas of noncomplex bed topography where the SMB predominantly drives retreat. Additionally, these results emphasize that care must be taken with ice sheet models when tuning model parameters to match reconstructed margins, particularly for lower-resolution models in regions where complex bed topography is poorly resolved.

Contemporary limnology of the rapidly changing glacierized watershed of the world's largest High Arctic lake	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ELLESMERE-ISLAND; GLACIAL MELTWATER; CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON; SALVELINUS-ALPINUS; NORTHERN LAKES; ORGANIC-CARBON; BAFFIN-ISLAND; ICE CAPS; SEDIMENT; HAZEN	Glacial runoff is predicted to increase in many parts of the Arctic with climate change, yet little is known about the biogeochemical impacts of meltwaters on downstream freshwater ecosystems. Here we document the contemporary limnology of the rapidly changing glacierized watershed of the world's largest High Arctic lake (Lake Hazen), where warming since 2007 has increased delivery of glacial meltwaters to the lake by up to 10-times. Annually, glacial meltwaters accounted for 62-98% of dissolved nutrient inputs to the lake, depending on the chemical species and year. Lake Hazen was a strong sink for NO3--NO2-, NH4+ and DOC, but a source of DIC to its outflow the Ruggles River. Most nutrients entering Lake Hazen were, however, particle-bound and directly transported well below the photic zone via dense turbidity currents, thus reinforcing ultraoligotrophy in the lake rather than overcoming it. For the first time, we apply the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum framework in a large glacierized Arctic watershed, and provide a detailed and holistic description of the physical, chemical and biological limnology of the rapidly changing Lake Hazen watershed. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of freshwater ecosystems to the changing cryosphere, with implications for future water quality and productivity at high latitudes.	[St Pierret, K.

Trends in global tropospheric ozone inferred from a composite record of TOMS/OMI/MLS/OMPS satellite measurements and the MERRA-2 GMI simulation	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							COLUMN OZONE; SURFACE OZONE; MODEL; EMISSIONS; CHEMISTRY; TRANSPORT; METHODOLOGY; DECLINE; PROFILE; GASES	Past studies have suggested that ozone in the troposphere has increased globally throughout much of the 20th century due to increases in anthropogenic emissions and transport. We show, by combining satellite measurements with a chemical transport model, that during the last four decades tropospheric ozone does indeed indicate increases that are global in nature, yet still highly regional. Satellite ozone measurements from Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) are merged with ozone measurements from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) to determine trends in tropospheric ozone for 1979-2016. Both TOMS (1979-2005) and OMI/MLS (2005-2016) depict large increases in tropospheric ozone from the Near East to India and East Asia and further eastward over the Pacific Ocean. The 38-year merged satellite record shows total net change over this region of about + 6 to +7 Dobson units (DU) (i.e., similar to 15 %-20 % of average background ozone), with the largest increase (similar to 4 DU) occurring during the 2005-2016 Aura period. The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model with time-varying emissions is used to aid in the interpretation of tropospheric ozone trends for 1980-2016. The GMI simulation for the combined record also depicts the greatest increases of +6 to +7 DU over India and East Asia, very similar to the satellite measurements. In regions of significant increases in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) the trends are a factor of 2-2.5 larger for the Aura record when compared to the earlier TOMS record; for India and East Asia the trends in TCO for both GMI and satellite measurements are similar to +3 DU decade(-1) or greater during 2005-2016 compared to about +1.2 to +1.4 DU decade(-1) for 1979-2005. The GMI simulation and satellite data also reveal a tropospheric ozone increases in similar to +4 to +5 DU for the 38-year record over central Africa and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Both the GMI simulation and satellite measured tropospheric ozone during the latter Aura time period show increases of similar to +3 DU decade(-1) over the N Atlantic and NE Pacific.

Redox and pH gradients drive amino acid synthesis in iron oxyhydroxide mineral systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						life emergence; iron hydroxides; hydrothermal vents; early Earth; gradients	GREEN RUST; REDUCTIVE AMINATION; ORIGIN; CHEMISTRY; LIFE; EVOLUTION; CATALYSTS; INSIGHTS; NITRITE; OXIDES	Iron oxyhydroxide minerals, known to be chemically reactive and significant for elemental cycling, are thought to have been abundant in early-Earth seawater, sediments, and hydrothermal systems. In the anoxic Fe2+-rich early oceans, these minerals would have been only partially oxidized and thus redox-active, perhaps able to promote prebiotic chemical reactions. We show that pyruvate, a simple organic molecule that can form in hydrothermal systems, can undergo reductive amination in the presence of mixed-valence iron oxyhydroxides to form the amino acid alanine, as well as the reduced product lactate. Furthermore, geochemical gradients of pH, redox, and temperature in iron oxyhydroxide systems affect product selectivity. The maximum yield of alanine was observed when the iron oxyhydroxide mineral contained 1: 1 Fe(II): Fe(III), under alkaline conditions, and at moderately warm temperatures. These represent conditions that may be found, for example, in iron-containing sediments near an alkaline hydrothermal vent system. The partially oxidized state of the precipitate was significant in promoting amino acid formation: Purely ferrous hydroxides did not drive reductive amination but instead promoted pyruvate reduction to lactate, and ferric hydroxides did not result in any reaction. Prebiotic chemistry driven by redox-active iron hydroxide minerals on the early Earth would therefore be strongly affected by geochemical gradients of E-h, pH, and temperature, and liquid-phase products would be able to diffuse to other conditions within the sediment column to participate in further reactions.

Progenitor observations in the Ks band in four epochs from 1 yr to 1 day before the explosion reveal no significant variability in the progenitor star greater than 6% that lasts longer than 200 days. SN 2017eaw is a typical SN II-P with near-IR and mid-IR photometric evolution similar to those of SNe 2002hh and 2004et, other normal SNe II-P in the same galaxy. Spectroscopic monitoring during the plateau phase reveals a possible high-velocity He I 1.083 mu m absorption line, indicative of a shock interaction with the circumstellar medium. Spectra between 389 and 480 days postexplosion reveal a strong CO first overtone emission at 389 days, with a line profile matching that of SN 1987A from the same epoch, indicating similar to 10(-3) M-circle dot of CO at 1800 K. From the 389 days epoch until the most recent observation at 566 days, the first overtone feature fades while the 4.5 mu m excess, likely from the CO fundamental band, remains. This behavior indicates that the CO has not been destroyed, but that the gas has cooled enough that the levels responsible for first overtone emissions are no longer populated. Finally, the evolution of Spitzer 3.6 mu m photometry shows evidence for dust formation in SN 2017eaw, with a dust mass of 10(-6) or 10(-4) M-circle dot assuming carbonaceous or silicate grains, respectively.

DES Collaboration	A Search for Optical Emission from Binary Black Hole Merger GW170814 with the Dark Energy Camera	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitational waves; stars: black holes; surveys; techniques: photometric		Binary black hole (BBH) mergers found by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo detectors are of immense scientific interest to the astrophysics community, but are considered unlikely to be sources of electromagnetic emission. To test whether they have rapidly fading optical counterparts, we used the Dark Energy Camera to perform an i-band search for the BBH merger GW170814, the first gravitational wave (GW) detected by three interferometers. The 87 deg(2) localization region (at 90% confidence) centered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint enabled us to image 86% of the probable sky area to a depth of i similar to 23 mag and provide the most comprehensive data set to search for electromagnetic (EM) emission from BBH mergers. To identify candidates, we perform difference imaging with our search images and with templates from pre-existing Dark Energy Survey (DES) images. The analysis strategy and selection requirements were designed to remove supernovae and to identify transients that decline in the first two epochs. We find two candidates, each of which is spatially coincident with a star or a high-redshift galaxy in the DES catalogs, and they are thus unlikely to be associated with GW170814. Our search finds no candidates associated with GW170814, disfavoring rapidly declining optical emission from BBH mergers brighter than i similar to 23 mag (L-optical similar to 5 x 10(41) erg s(-1)) 1-2 days after coalescence. In terms of GW sky map coverage, this is the most complete search for optical counterparts to BBH mergers to date.	[Doctor, Z.; Holz, D.

The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachon in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg(2) field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg(2) region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r similar to 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.

Miniaturized ring-down spectrometer for CubeSat-based planetary science	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							SPECTROSCOPY; METHANE; NOISE	A robust, miniaturized cavity ring-down spectrometer has been developed as a laboratory demonstration model for future CubeSat deployments of near- and mid-infrared spectrometers for in situ planetary science. The spectrometer is compact enough to ensure compatibility with standard CubeSat spacecraft buses, with a probed gas volume of less than 2.5 cc to ease mass, volume, and power requirements of sample gas handling subsystems. When operated at 1.39 mu m for water vapor isotope measurements, a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient of 3.7 x 10(-9) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) is obtained. Oxygen isotope measurements were performed to demonstrate scanning performance. The spectrometer has been designed to use only components with functional equivalents throughout the 1-5 mu m range to maintain flexibility across a wide array of planetary science targets. Preliminary results from a 3.27 mu m implementation intended for methane measurements are also presented. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America.

ZTF 18aaqeasu (SN2018byg): A Massive Helium-shell Double Detonation on a Sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual (SN2018byg); surveys; white dwarfs	I SUPER-NOVAE; LIGHT CURVES; EXPLOSION MODELS; LOW-RESOLUTION; SPECTRA	The detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf (WD) has been proposed as a possible explosion triggering mechanism for SNe Ia. Here, we report ZTF 18aaqeasu (SN 2018byg/ATLAS 18pqq), a peculiar Type I supernova, consistent with being a helium-shell double-detonation. With a rise time of approximate to 18 days from explosion, the transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of M-R approximate to -18.2 mag, exhibiting a light curve akin to sub-luminous SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia, albeit with an unusually steep increase in brightness within a week from explosion. Spectra taken near peak light exhibit prominent Si absorption features together with an unusually red color (g - r approximate to 2 mag) arising from nearly complete line blanketing of flux blueward of 5000 angstrom. This behavior is unlike any previously observed thermonuclear transient. Nebular phase spectra taken at and after approximate to 30 days from peak light reveal evidence of a thermonuclear detonation event dominated by Fe-group nucleosynthesis. We show that the peculiar properties of ZTF 18aaqeasu are consistent with the detonation of a massive (approximate to 0.15 M.) helium shell on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (approximate to 0.75 M-circle dot) WD after including mixing of approximate to 0.2 M-circle dot of material in the outer ejecta. These observations provide evidence of a likely rare class of thermonuclear supernovae arising from detonations of massive helium shells.

Statistical analysis of the SO2 plumes	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets; infrared: planetary systems	ATMOSPHERE; MESOSPHERE	Since January 2012 we have been monitoring the behavior of sulfur dioxide and water on Venus, using the Texas Echelon Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) imaging spectrometer at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF, Mauna Kea Observatory). We present here the observations obtained between January 2016 and September 2018. As in the case of our previous runs, data were recorded around 1345 cm(-1) (7.4 mu m). The molecules SO2, CO2, and HDO (used as a proxy for H2O) were observed, and the cloudtop of Venus was probed at an altitude of about 64 km. The volume mixing ratio of SO2 was estimated using the SO2/CO2 line depth ratios of weak transitions; the H2O volume mixing ratio was derived from the HDO/CO2 line depth ratio, assuming a D/H ratio of 200 times the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). As reported in our previous analyses, the SO2 mixing ratio shows strong variations with time and also over the disk, showing evidence of the formation of SO2 plumes with a lifetime of a few hours; in contrast, the H2O abundance is remarkably uniform over the disk and shows moderate variations as a function of time. We performed a statistical analysis of the behavior of the SO2 plumes, using all TEXES data between 2012 and 2018. They appear mostly located around the equator. Their distribution as a function of local time seems to show a depletion around noon; we do not have enough data to confirm this feature definitely. The distribution of SO2 plumes as a function of longitude shows no clear feature, apart from a possible depletion around 100E-150E and around 300E-360E. There seems to be a tendency for the H2O volume mixing ratio to decrease after 2016, and for the SO2 mixing ratio to increase after 2014. However, we see no clear anti-correlation between the SO2 and H2O abundances at the cloudtop, neither on the individual maps nor over the long term. Finally, there is a good agreement between the TEXES results and those obtained in the UV range (SPICAV/Venus Express and UVI/Akatsuki) at a slightly higher altitude. This agreement shows that SO2 observations obtained in the thermal infrared can be used to extend the local time coverage of the SO2 measurements obtained in the UV range.

A dichotomy between model responses of tropical ascent and descent to surface warming	NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE			English	Article							PACIFIC WALKER CIRCULATION; TEMPERATURE; CONVERGENCE; CLOUDS; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; CYCLE; TRMM; CO2	Simulations of tropical atmospheric circulation response to surface warming vary substantially across models, causing large uncertainties in projections of regional precipitation change. Understanding the physical processes that drive the model spread in tropical circulation changes is critically needed. Here we employ the basic mass balance and energetic constraints on tropical circulation to identify the dominant factors that determine multidecadal circulation strength and area changes in climate models. We show that the models produce a robust weakening of descent rate under warming regardless of surface warming patterns; however, ascent rate change exhibits inter-model spread twice as large as descent rate because of diverse model responses in the radiative effects of clouds, water vapor, and aerosols. As ascent area change is dictated by the disparate descent and ascent rate changes due to the mass budget and the inter-model spread in descent rate change is small, the model spread in ascent area change is dominated by that of ascent rate change, resulting in a strong anti-correlation of -0.85 between the fractional changes of ascent strength and area across 77 climate model simulations. This anti-correlation leads to a corresponding inverse relationship between the rates of precipitation intensifying and narrowing of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), suggesting tropical ascent area change can be potentially used to constrain the ITCZ precipitation change. Longwave cloud radiative effect at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) in the convective region is identified to be a major source of uncertainties for tropical ascent rate change and thus for regional precipitation change.

When pumped into a higher gain level, an MNP-QE composite nanostructure functions as a nanoplasmonic counterpart of a conventional laser, which is capable of operating at subwavelengths. The theory of plasmonic lasers is hitherto developed on the local optical response of the MNP, disregarding the nanoscale effects of its free electrons. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive quantum mechanical analysis of a complex MNP-QE composite nanostructure, capturing the size-dependent nonclassical effects through the nonlocal optical response of the MNP. Our study reveals that the nonlocal correction introduces significant deviations to the plasmon statistics of the hybrid particle suggested by the local calculations, becoming more prominent when the number of QEs coupled to the MNP increases. Furthermore, for the typical material parameter values used in the literature, we observed the initiation of quenching effects at lower pumping rates than suggested by the local response formalism. In essence, nonlocally assessed plasmon statistics of MNP-QE composite nanostructures demand the concerted coupling of an even higher number of QEs to compensate the deterioration in coherence and to sustain lasing.

It is shown that the crystallization temperature (Tx) of GeTe is dependent on the film thickness for thin films of less than approximate to 20 nm, which is exploited for color tuning. Four colors from the same physical structure are demonstrated by electrical heating, through novel optical and thermal engineering of a thin film stack that includes two GeTe layers with only a single integrated joule heater element. The selective sensitivity to incident light angle and low polarization dependence, as well as the low static power consumption of this device make it a good candidate for potential consumer electronics applications.

Here, we investigate the event-to-event hydroclimatic intensity, where an event is a pair of adjacent wet and dry spells, under future warming scenarios. According to a set of targeted multi-model large ensemble experiments, event-wise intensification will significantly increase globally for an additional 0.5 degrees C warming beyond 1.5 degrees C. In high latitudinal regions of the North American continent and Eurasia, this intensification is likely to involve overwhelming increases in wet spell intensity. Western and Eastern North America will likely experience more intense wet spells with negligible changes of dry spells. For the Mediterranean region, enhancement of dry spells seems to be dominating compared to the decrease in wet spell strength, and this will lead to an overall event-wise intensification. Furthermore, the extreme intensification could be 10 times stronger than the mean intensification. The high damage potential of such drastic changes between flood and drought conditions poses a major challenge to adaptation, and the findings suggest that risks could be substantially reduced by achieving a 1.5 degrees C target.

The FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS provides simultaneous molecular information relating to both the gas-and particle-phase samples and has been used to extract vapour pressures (VPs) of the compounds desorbing from the filter whilst giving quantitative concentrations in the particle phase. However, such extraction of vapour pressures of the measured particle-phase components requires use of appropriate, well-defined, reference compounds. Vapour pressures for the homologous series of polyethylene glycols (PEG) ((H-(O-CH2-CH2)(n)-OH) for n = 3 to n = 8), covering a range of vapour pressures (VP) (10(-1) to 10(-7) Pa) that are atmospherically relevant, have been shown to be reproduced well by a range of different techniques, including Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS). This is the first homologous series of compounds for which a number of vapour pressure measurement techniques have been found to be in agreement, indicating the utility as a calibration standard, providing an ideal set of benchmark compounds for accurate characterization of the FIGAERO for extracting vapour pressure of measured compounds in chambers and the real atmosphere. To demonstrate this, single-component and mixture vapour pressure measurements are made using two FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS instruments based on a new calibration determined from the PEG series. VP values extracted from both instruments agree well with those measured by KEMS and reported values from literature, validating this approach for extracting VP data from the FIGAERO. This method is then applied to chamber measurements, and the vapour pressures of known products are estimated.

Exploring, Mapping, and Data Management Integration of Habitable Environments in Astrobiology	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						astrobiology; habitable environments; authigenic minerals; Mars; cybertechnology; data management	MERIDIANI-PLANUM; GALE CRATER; RIO-TINTO; MICROBIAL BIOSIGNATURES; ISOTOPE COMPOSITION; MOLECULAR ANALYSIS; LIPID BIOMARKERS; ENDEAVOR CRATER; BURNS FORMATION; BORON ISOTOPES	New approaches to blending geoscience, planetary science, microbiology-geobiology/ecology, geoinformatics and cyberinfrastructure technology disciplines in a holistic effort can be transformative to astrobiology explorations. Over the last two decades, overwhelming orbital evidence has confirmed the abundance of authigenic (in situ, formed in place) minerals on Mars. On Earth, environments where authigenic minerals form provide a substrate for the preservation of microbial life. Similarly, extraterrestrial life is likely to be preserved where crustal minerals can record and preserve the biochemical mechanisms (i.e., biosignatures). The search for astrobiological evidence on Mars has focused on identifying past or present habitable environments - places that could support some semblance of life. Thus, authigenic minerals represent a promising habitable environment where extraterrestrial life could be recorded and potentially preserved over geologic time scales. Astrobiology research necessarily takes place over vastly different scales; from molecules to viruses and microbes to those of satellites and solar system exploration, but the differing scales of analyses are rarely connected quantitatively. The mismatch between the scales of these observations- from the macro- satellite mineralogical observations to the micromicrobial observations- limits the applicability of our astrobiological understanding as we search for records of life beyond Earth. Each-scale observation requires knowledge of the geologic context and the environmental parameters important for assessing habitability. Exploration efforts to search for extraterrestrial life should attempt to quantify both the geospatial context and the temporal/spatial relationships between microbial abundance and diversity within authigenic minerals at multiple scales, while assimilating resolutions from satellite observations to field measurements to microscopic analyses. Statistical measures, computer vision, and the geospatial synergy of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), can allow analyses of objective data-driven methods to locate, map, and predict where the "sweet spots" of habitable environments occur at multiple scales. This approach of science information architecture or an "Astrobiology Information System" can provide the necessary maps to guide researchers to discoveries via testing, visualizing, documenting, and collaborating on significant data relationships that will advance explorations for evidence of life in our solar system and beyond.

Bright carbonate surfaces on Ceres as remnants of salt-rich water fountains	ICARUS			English	Article							SCORIA CONES; SODIUM-SALTS; ICE; ERUPTION; SUBLIMATION; INSIGHTS; DEPOSITS; GROWTH; ASCENT; PINGOS	Vinalia and Cerealia Faculae are bright and salt-rich localized areas in Occator crater on Ceres. The predominance of the near-infrared signature of sodium carbonate on these surfaces suggests their original material was a brine. Here we analyze Dawn Framing Camera's images and characterize the surfaces as composed of a central structure, either a possible depression (Vinalia) or a central dome (Cerealia), and a discontinuous mantling. We consider three materials enabling the ascent and formation of the faculae: ice ascent with sublimation and carbonate particle lofting, pure gas emission entraining carbonate particles, and brine extrusion. We find that a mechanism explaining the entire range of morphologies, topographies, as well as the common composition of the deposits is brine fountaining. This process consists of briny liquid extrusion, followed by flash freezing of carbonate and ice particles, particle fallback, and sublimation. Subsequent increase in briny liquid viscosity leads to doming. Dawn observations did not detect currently active water plumes, indicating the frequency of such extrusions is longer than years.

Genomic analyses using EF-1 alpha sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study. IMPORTANCE This is the first study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.

Due to the universality of the geometry of aggregates, the conversion to a graupel-like particle is self-similar and independent from specific properties of the aggregate, when formulated in properly normalized variables. Hence, the particle habit of the primary crystals, the size of the aggregate or the density of the rime mass, does not lead to a structural change in the transition to graupel. Therefore, this transition can be parameterized by a similarity approach using simulations of many individual rimed aggregates. These parameterizations can replace the classic fill-in model used in many cloud models. The parameterizations are applied and tested in a one-dimensional Lagrangian superparticle model to simulate the growth of aggregates in a liquid layer. We find that the similarity model for the geometry of rimed snowflakes leads to a more rapid growth by riming and, hence, an increased precipitation rate compared to the fill-in model. The main reason for this is that the increase of the maximum dimension during the early stages of riming is properly taken into account by the similarity model, whereas it is neglected by the fill-in model.

In this study we examine the mesoscale-to-submesoscale (100 to 10km) transition in an eastern boundary current, the southern California Current System (CCS), using repeated acoustic Doppler current profiler transects, sea surface height from high-resolution nadir altimetry and output from a (1/48)degrees global model simulation. In the CCS, the submesoscale is as energetic as in western boundary current regions, but the mesoscale is much weaker, and as a result the transition lacks the change in kinetic energy (KE) spectral slope observed for western boundary currents. Helmholtz and vortex-wave decompositions of the KE spectra are used to identify balanced and unbalanced contributions. At horizontal scales greater than 70km, we find that observed KE is dominated by balanced geostrophic motions. At scales from 40 to 10km, unbalanced contributions such as inertia-gravity waves contribute as much as balanced motions. The model KE transition occurs at longer scales, around 125km. The altimeter spectra are consistent with acoustic Doppler current profiler/model spectra at scales longer than 70/125km, respectively. Observed seasonality is weak. Taken together, our results suggest that geostrophic velocities can be diagnosed from sea surface height on scales larger than about 70km in the southern CCS. Plain Language Summary Observations and numerical models are now able to resolve changes in velocity or sea surface height over distances of just a few kilometers. Geostrophically balanced flows dominate at large scales, while turbulence and waves dominate at small scales. One challenge is to characterize the transition between large and small scales. This study employs spectral analysis of high horizontal resolution observations and a numerical model simulation in order to determine the length scale of the transition from balanced to unbalanced motions in the southern California Current System. We find that in the California Current System, geostrophic motions dominate on scales larger than about 70km. Seasonality in the transition scale is also examined and is found to be weak.

Modeling the Recent Changes in the Arctic Ocean CO2 Sink (2006-2013)	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; SEA-ICE; UPTAKE CAPACITY; GREENLAND SEA; WIND-SPEED; FLUXES; SHELF; VARIABILITY; MARINE; IMPACT	The Arctic Ocean (AO) and its associated marginal seas have recently experienced rapid climate and environmental changes, most notably sea-ice area (SIA) loss and warming potentially impacting its uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2). We used the state-of-the-art ECCO2-Darwin coupled ocean-biogeochemistry model to simulate the 2006-2013 period and investigate the impact of changing SIA on the CO2 uptake of the AO. We find that the mean annual CO2 sink of the AO is 153 +/- 14 TgC a(-1) and the CO2 sink decreased at a rate of 3.6 TgC a(-1) even though SIA decreased by 8 x 10(4) km(2) a(-1) over the same period. Extreme SIA loss in 2007 resulted in a 185.4 TgC CO2 sink, an increase similar to 20% over the 2006-2013 mean. In contrast, extreme SIA loss of 2012 resulted in a CO2 sink of the AO of only 146.3 TgC due to two main factors: (1) increased both wind speed and stratification in the Eastern Siberian Sea absorbing less CO2 and (2) decreased primary production and area of air-sea gas exchange in the Chukchi and Nordic Seas. Our model captures a trend of decreasing CO2 sink in most of the Chukchi Sea during fall but does not show the changes in winter CO2 sink in the Nordic and Barents Seas as previous independent studies have suggested. Our results indicate that future AO-atmosphere CO2 exchange will be determined by complex interplay of SIA and other environmental drivers. Plain Language Summary The seasonal process of melting and formation of sea-ice area (SIA) in the Arctic Ocean (AO) is a key factor to control the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the upper ocean. We used a numerical model to understand the potential consequences of two drastic events of SIA reduction in both 2007 and 2012. Our model simulations show that the biological and chemical responses of the AO were different when we compared 2007 versus 2012. In 2007, the severe reduction of SIA was followed by a large uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2 , as also expected from theory) due to the increase in ice-free area and to the enhanced photosynthetic activity. However, in 2012, the response was different due to several factors: (1) increased wind speed and decreased primary production in the Eastern Siberian Sea in the summer causing less CO2 uptake and (2) the increase in the SIA in the fall in the Chukchi sea and in the summer in the Nordic Seas (close to Greenland) inhibiting the air-sea gas CO2 exchange. All these processes, when combined together, yielded a reduced CO2 sink of the AO in 2012 when compared to 2007.

Analyzing High-Frequency Soil Respiration Using a Probabilistic Model in a Semiarid, Mediterranean Climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						soil respiration; CO2 flux; semiarid region; Mediterranean climate; temperature sensitivity; conditional probability density function	TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; ECOSYSTEM; MOISTURE; DESERT; FLUXES; VEGETATION; PULSES	High-frequency (subhourly) changes in soil respiration (Rs), a critical component of the carbon cycle, are not well documented in semiarid ecosystems. We investigate the response of Rs to subhourly soil temperature (Tsoil) and soil volumetric water content (VWC) variation in a semiarid ecosystem across a year of highly variable weather. We propose a probabilistic model to estimate the likelihood of Rs exceeding its annual mean (1.2molCO(2)/m(2)s), conditioned on different Tsoil and VWC values. The results show that Rs follows a Gaussian-like pattern as Tsoil increases, where it follows an upward trend until similar to 18 degrees C, and then begins to decline. Rs remains constant at Tsoil beyond similar to 27 degrees C. Using our novel conditional probability model, we show both the increasing and decreasing response of Rs to rising Tsoil through two ranges (14-17 and 20-23 degrees C) where Rs observations show opposing responses. We demonstrate that an increase in Tsoil from 14 to 17 degrees C causes a rise in Rs by a factor of 1.4 relative to the mean. The proposed model also describes how Rs reduces as Tsoil continues to increase above similar to 18 degrees C. Considering VWC and Tsoil into the proposed model, we show that when Tsoil is low (e.g., 17 degrees C), a rise in VWC yields a decrease of Rs by a factor of 3.6. However, when Tsoil is high (e.g., 23 degrees C), Rs increases with increasing VWC by a factor of 2.5. Overall, the probabilistic model enables us to detect and characterize changes in Rs distribution in response to different environmental variables and thresholds.	[Anjileli, H.; Moftakhari, H.

Our study quantifies the distributions of bacteria and solutes between liquid and solid water phases during progressive freezing. We simulated lake ice formation in mesocosm experiments using water from perennially (Antarctica) and seasonally (Alaska and Montana, United States) ice-covered lakes. We then computed concentration factors and effective segregation coefficients, which are parameters describing the incorporation of bacteria and solutes into ice. Experimental results revealed that, contrary to major ions, bacteria were readily incorporated into ice and did not concentrate in the liquid phase. The organic matter incorporated into the ice was labile, amino acid-like material, differing from the humic-like compounds that remained in the liquid phase. Results from a control mesocosm experiment (dead bacterial cells) indicated that viability of bacterial cells did not influence the incorporation of free bacterial cells into ice, but did have a role in the formation and incorporation of bacterial aggregates. Together, these findings demonstrate that bacteria, unlike other solutes, were preferentially incorporated into lake ice during our freezing experiments, a process controlled mainly by the initial solute concentration of the liquid water source, regardless of cell viability. Plain Language Summary Most of the freshwater lakes on Earth are found in regions where temperatures are below freezing for either all or part of the year. Here we studied the impact of freezing on the chemical and biological components of lake water. We simulated lake ice formation using water from perennially and seasonally ice-covered lakes to describe and quantify the distributions of bacteria and solutes (chemical species) between the liquid and solid water phases during progressive freezing. The results of these simulations revealed that, contrary to solutes, bacteria are preferentially incorporated into the ice. Results from the control experiment, which used dead bacterial cells dispersed in lake water, indicated that the viability of the bacterial cells did not influence the incorporation of bacterial cells into ice; live and dead bacterial cells were incorporated into the ice equally. However, only live cells formed bacterial aggregates, which were also incorporated into the ice. The observed preferential incorporation of bacterial cells was mainly controlled by the initial solute concentration of the liquid water source. Our findings have implications not only for the habitability of cold environments on Earth and their impact on biogeochemical cycles on lakes but also for extraterrestrial environments (icy worlds: Europa, Enceladus).

ExoMars Schiaparelli Direct-to-Earth Observation using GMRT	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars communications; UHF links; Direct to Earth	DESCENT; TITAN; ENTRY	During the ExoMars Schiaparelli separation event on 16 October 2016 and Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) events 3days later, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, India, was used to directly observe UHF transmissions from the Schiaparelli lander as they arrive at Earth. The Doppler shift of the carrier frequency was measured and used as a diagnostic to identify key events during EDL. This signal detection at GMRT was the only real-time aliveness indicator to European Space Agency mission operations during the critical EDL stage of the mission. Plain Language Summary When planetary missions, such as landers on the surface of Mars, undergo critical and risky events, communications to ground controllers is very important as close to real time as possible. The Schiaparelli spacecraft attempted landing in 2016 was supported in an innovative way. A large radio telescope on Earth was able to eavesdrop on information being sent from the lander to other spacecraft in orbit around Mars. This provided real-time (after accounting for one-way light time) basic information to mission controllers.	[Esterhuizen, S.; Asmar, S.

Martin; Vitart, Frederic			Global evaluation of atmospheric river subseasonal prediction skill	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							EXTREME PRECIPITATION; SEASON; PREDICTABILITY; FORECASTS; IMPACTS; SURFACE	Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) forecasts of weather and climate extremes are being increasingly demanded by water resource managers, operational forecasters, and other users in the applications community. This study uses hindcast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S forecast system to evaluate global subseasonal prediction skill of atmospheric rivers (ARs), which are intense lower tropospheric plumes of moisture transport that often project strongly onto extreme precipitation. An aggregate quantity is introduced to assess AR subseasonal prediction skill, defined as the number of AR days occurring over a week-long period (AR1wk occurrence). The observed pattern of seasonal mean AR1wk occurrence strongly resembles the general pattern of daily AR frequency. The ECMWF S2S forecast system generally shows positive (negative) biases relative to reanalysis in the mid-latitude regions in summer (winter) of up to 0.5-1.0 AR days in AR1wk occurrence in regions of highest AR activity. ECMWF AR1wk occurrence forecast skill outperforms a reference forecast based on monthly climatology of AR1wk occurrence at week-3 (14-20days) lead over a number of subtropical to midlatitude regions, with slightly better skill evident in wintertime. The magnitude and subseasonal forecast skill of AR1wk occurrence are shown to vary interannually, and both quantities are modulated during certain phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, Pacific-North America teleconnection pattern, and Madden-Julian Oscillation.

A High-Resolution Data Assimilation Framework for Snow Water Equivalent Estimation across the Western United States and Validation with the Airborne Snow Observatory	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							LAND DATA ASSIMILATION; COLORADO RIVER-BASIN; SIERRA-NEVADA; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; MODEL	Numerical simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountain systems can be biased, and few SWE observations have existed over large domains. New approaches for measuring SWE, like NASA's ultra-high-resolution Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), offer an opportunity to improve model estimates by providing a high-quality validation target. In this study, a computationally efficient snow data assimilation (DA) approach over the western United States at 1.75-km spatial resolution for water years (WYs) 2001-17 is presented. A local ensemble transform Kalman filter implemented as a batch smoother is used with the VIC hydrology model to assimilate the remotely sensed daily MODIS fractional snow-covered area (SCA). Validation of the high-resolution SWE estimates is done against ASO SWE data in the Tuolumne basin (California), Uncompahgre basin (Colorado), and Olympic Peninsula (Washington). Results indicate good performance in dry years and during melt, with DA reducing Tuolumne basin-average SWE percent differences from -68%, -92%, and -84% in open loop to 0.6%, 25%, and 3% after DA for WYs 2013-15, respectively, for ASO dates and spatial extent. DA also improved SWE percent difference over the Uncompahgre basin (-84% open loop, -65% DA) and Olympic Peninsula (26% open loop, -0.2% DA). However, in anomalously wet years DA underestimates SWE, likely due to an inadequate snow depletion curve parameterization. Despite potential shortcomings due to VIC model setup (e.g., water balance mode) or parameterization (snow depletion curve), the DA framework implemented in this study shows promise in overcoming some of these limitations and improving estimated SWE, in particular during drier years or at higher elevations, when most in situ observations cannot capture high-elevation snowpack due to lack of stations there.

Cargo logistics for a Notional Mars Base using Solar Electric Propulsion	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Human; Mars; Exploration; Logistics; SEP		The current aim of NASA's Journey to Mars is a stepwise approach towards landing humans on the Red Planet, culminating in a sustained presence. There are many recent studies on how this could be achieved in an evolvable and affordable manner. Most architectures begin with crewed missions to Phobos or Mars orbit in the mid 2030's, progress toward short-stay missions on the surface, and then culminate with regular, long-stay missions at a permanent outpost in the 2040's. A common factor of these architectures is that many robotic launches would be required in order to support the crew by prepositioning mission elements and other needed supplies. In this paper, the use of 150 kW reusable Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and the surface is studied. The conceptual SEP tugs make use of continued technology developments that were initialized through the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. These SEP tugs would cycle (with loitering) between staging orbits in cislunar space and Mars orbit. The concepts presented here focus on the use of SEP for purposes of delivering cargo, and could potentially be complimentary to many human Mars architectures presented in the literature. In order to characterize mission design parameters such as dates, masses, and durations, thousands of optimized trajectories were run using low-thrust optimization software. Solutions are found for all launch/arrival date pairs for the years 2038-2053. They can be displayed as contour plots called Bacon plots - the SEP equivalent of porkchop plots. Possible mission architecture concepts for a steady-state human presence on Mars along with the cargo missions needed to keep it functioning are described and the relevant mission parameters such as launch dates, masses, arrival dates, etc., are given. It was found that the reusable SEP tug architecture would be highly beneficial to the logistics of a sustainable Mars outpost.

Exploring optical SETI's middle ground	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Photon counting; Star intensity time series; Periodic optical SETI signals; Power spectra	SEARCH; COMMUNICATION; INTERSTELLAR	The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in optical wavelengths has recently concentrated either on detecting intense short light pulses that briefly outshine the background star or on finding unique features that stand out in the star's spectrum. But there is a middle ground available where the temporal variation of an optical SETI source would distinguish it from its stellar background. Initial results are presented for frequency-domain searches, covering a signal range of 1-10,000 Hz, with an instrument that simultaneously measures two broad optical spectral bands. It is shown that signals a thousand times fainter than the background starlight can be detected using this instrument coupled to a meter-class telescope. Since these signals can be either positive or negative (i.e. a periodic obscuration), the intriguing possibility exists of detecting signals where no energy need be intentionally beamed toward Earth.

OMOTENASHI is a challenging mission - performing a semi-hard landing with a cubesat. One of the main challenges comes from the trajectory, which is characterized by a single deceleration maneuver instead of multiple ones for orbit insertion, descent, hovering and landing. After the deceleration maneuver, there is no time to correct for navigation and execution errors so the robustness of the trajectory is key. This paper presents the analysis and design of the OMOTENASHI landing phase. It studies the performance of the subsystems involved in the landing and proposes a deceleration maneuver to set to zero the vertical velocity at bum-out with a specified height over the Moon's surface, followed by a free-fall. In order to assess the robustness of the trajectory, it considers uncertainties in the state vector and deceleration maneuver execution. The flight path angle at lunar arrival has a great impact on the landing success rate, which imposes a very strong constraint on the design of the transfer phase trajectory. Under the current subsystems design, the most critical factors in the landing success rate are the maneuver orientation and thrust duration. Results suggest accuracy requirements for the landing devices, solid rocket motor and attitude accuracy, as well as for the transfer phase trajectory design. Finally, the navigation and maneuver execution errors may cause OMOTENASHI to prematurely impact against the surface during the solid rocket motor burn. This calls for a trade-off between the targeted final height and the maximum landing velocity.

Qualitative Assessment of Aerocapture and Applications to Future Missions	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERE	We examine the current state of readiness of aerocapture at several destinations of interest, to identify what technologies are needed and to determine if a technology demonstration mission is required, before the first use of aerocapture for a science mission. The study team concluded that the current state of readiness is destination dependent, with aerocaptured missions feasible at Venus, Mars, and Titan with current technologies. The use of aerocapture for orbit insertion at the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune requires at least additional study to assess the expected performance of new guidance, navigation, and control algorithms and possible development of new hardware, such as a mid-lift-to-drag entry vehicle shape or new thermal protection system materials. A variety of near-term activities could contribute to risk reduction for missions proposing the use of aerocapture, but an end-to-end, system-level technology demonstration mission is not deemed necessary before the use of aerocapture for a NASA science mission.

Our findings show that increasing water withdrawal in Iran, due to population growth and increased agricultural activities, has been the main source of historical water stress. Increased levels of water stress across Iran are expected to continue or even worsen over the next decades due to projected variability and change in precipitation combined with heightened water withdrawals due to increasing population and socio-economic activities. The greatest rate of decreased water storage is expected in the Urmia Basin, northwest of Iran, (varying from -8.3mm/year in 2010-2039 to -61.6mm/year in 2070-2099 compared with an observed rate of 4mm/year in 1976-2005). Human activities, however, strongly dominate the effects of precipitation variability and change. Major shifts toward sustainable land and water management are needed to reduce the impacts of water scarcity in the future, particularly in Iran's heavily stressed basins like Urmia Basin, which feeds the shrinking Lake Urmia.

Thermoelectric Properties of Scandium Sesquitelluride	MATERIALS			English	Article						thermoelectric; rare-earth telluride; scandium telluride	OXIDE; SC	Rare-earth (RE) tellurides have been studied extensively for use in high-temperature thermoelectric applications. Specifically, lanthanum and praseodymium-based compounds with the Th3P4 structure type have demonstrated dimensionless thermoelectric figures of merit (zT) up to 1.7 at 1200 K. Scandium, while not part of the lanthanide series, is considered a RE element due to its chemical similarity. However, little is known about the thermoelectric properties of the tellurides of scandium. Here, we synthesized scandium sesquitelluride (Sc2Te3) using a mechanochemical approach and formed sintered compacts through spark plasma sintering (SPS). Temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties were measured from 300-1100 K. Sc2Te3 exhibited a peak zT = 0.3 over the broad range of 500-750 K due to an appreciable power factor and low-lattice thermal conductivity in the mid-temperature range.

Seebeck and Figure of Merit Enhancement by Rare Earth Doping in Yb14-xRExZnSb11 (x=0.5)	MATERIALS			English	Article						thermoelectric; Seebeck; Yb14MnSb11; intermetallic; intermediate valence; valence fluctuation	ZINTL COMPOUNDS; YB14MNSB11; CHEMISTRY; VALENCE; PHASES	Yb14ZnSb11 has been of interest for its intermediate valency and possible Kondo designation. It is one of the few transition metal compounds of the Ca14AlSb11 structure type that show metallic behavior. While the solid solution of Yb14Mn1-xZnxSb11 shows an improvement in the high temperature figure of merit of about 10% over Yb14MnSb11, there has been no investigation of optimization of the Zn containing phase. In an effort to expand the possible high temperature p-type thermoelectric materials with this structure type, the rare earth (RE) containing solid solution Yb14-xRExZnSb11 (RE = Y, La) was investigated. The substitution of a small amount of 3+ rare earth (RE) for Yb2+ was employed as a means of optimizing Yb14MnSb11 for use as a thermoelectric material. Yb14ZnSb11 is considered an intermediate valence Kondo system where some percentage of the Yb is formally 3+ and undergoes a reduction to 2+ at 85 K. The substitution of a 3+ RE element could either replace the Yb3+ or add to the total amount of 3+ RE and provides changes to the electronic states. RE = Y, La were chosen as they represent the two extremes in size as substitutions for Yb: a similar and much larger size RE, respectively, compared with Yb3+. The composition x = 0.5 was chosen as that is the typical amount of RE element that can be substituted into Yb14MnSb11. These two new RE containing compositions show a significant improvement in Seebeck while decreasing thermal conductivity. The addition of RE increases the melting point of Yb14ZnSb11 so that the transport data from 300 K to 1275 K can be collected. The figure of merit is increased five times over that of Yb14ZnSb11 and provides a zT 0.7 at 1275 K.	[Wille, Elizabeth L.

We confront those theoretical calculations with the first similar to 150 deg(2) of DES data reaching nominal depth. From a catalogue containing similar to 5 million sources, similar to 26 000 were found to have observed-frame g - r versus r - i colours within the locus predicted for z similar to 4 massive galaxies. We further removed contamination by stars and artefacts, obtaining 606 galaxies lining up by the model selection box. We obtained their photometric redshifts and physical properties by fitting model templates spanning a wide range of star formation histories, reddening and redshift. Key to constrain the models is the addition, to the optical DES bands g, r, i, z, and Y, of near-IR J, H, K-s data from the Vista Hemisphere Survey. We further applied several quality cuts to the fitting results, including goodness of fit and a unimodal redshift probability distribution. We finally select 233 candidates whose photometric redshift probability distribution function peaks around z similar to 4, have high stellar masses [log (M*/M-circle dot) similar to 11.7 for a Salpeter IMF] and ages around 0.1 Gyr, i.e. formation redshift around 5. These propertiesmatch those of the progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the local Universe. This is an ideal sample for spectroscopic follow-up to select the fraction of galaxies which are truly at high redshift. These initial results and those at the survey completion, which we shall push to higher redshifts, will set unprecedented constraints on galaxy formation, evolution, and the re-ionization epoch.

A previous detection at similar to 1 cm of an unresolved clump along the outer ring of MWC758 (Clump 1), and buried inside more extended sub-mm continuum, motivates followup VLA observations. Deep multiconfiguration integrations reveal the morphology of Clump 1 and additional cm-wave components that we characterize via comparison with a deconvolution of recent 342 GHz data (similar to 1 mm). Clump 1, which concentrates similar to 1/ 3 of the whole disc flux density at similar to 1 cm, is resolved as a narrow arc with a deprojected aspect ratio x > 5.6, and with half the azimuthal width than at 342 GHz. The spectral trends in the morphology of Clump 1 are quantitatively consistent with the LyraLin prescriptions for dust trapping in an anticyclonic vortex, provided with porous grains (f similar to 0.2 +/- 0.2) in a very elongated (x similar to 14 +/- 3) and cold (T similar to 23 +/- 2K) vortex. The same prescriptions constrain the turbulence parameter a and the gas surface density Sigma(g) through log(10) (alpha x Sigma g/g cm(-2)) similar to -2.3 +/- 0.4, thus requiring values for Sigma(g) larger than a factor of a few compared to that reported in the literature from the CO isotopologues, if alpha less than or similar to 10(-3). Such physical conditions imply an appreciably optically thick continuum even at cm-wavelengths (tau(33GHz) similar to 0.2). A secondary and shallower peak at 342 GHz is about twice fainter relative to Clump 1 at 33 GHz. Clump 2 appears to be less efficient at trapping large grains.

We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters and groups in the similar to 2 deg(2) of the COSMOS field using all available X-ray observations from the XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories. We reach an X-ray flux limit of 3 x 10(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the 0.5-2 keV range, and identify 247 X-ray groups with M-200c = 8 x 10(12)-3 x 10(14)M(circle dot) at a redshift range of 0.08 <= z < 1.53, using the multiband photometric redshift and the master spectroscopic redshift catalogues of the COSMOS. The X-ray centres of groups are determined using high-resolution Chandra imaging. We investigate the relations between the offset of the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) from halo X-ray centre and group properties and compare with predictions from semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations. We find that BGG offset decreases with both increasing halo mass and decreasing redshift with no strong dependence on the X-ray flux and SNR. We show that the BGG offset decreases as a function of increasing magnitude gap with no considerable redshift-dependent trend. The stellar mass of BGGs in observations extends over a wider dynamic range compared to model predictions. At z < 0.5, the central dominant BGGs become more massive than those with large offsets by up to 0.3 dex, in agreement with model prediction. The observed and predicted log-normal scatter in the stellar mass of both low- and large-offset BGGs at fixed halo mass is similar to 0.3 dex.

Dark Energy Survey Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale in the distribution of galaxies to redshift 1	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; POWER-SPECTRUM; CENT DISTANCE; SAMPLE; COSMOLOGY; MODEL; HALO; BAO; I.	We present angular diameter distance measurements obtained by locating the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) scale in the distribution of galaxies selected from the first year of Dark Energy Survey data. We consider a sample of over 1.3 million galaxies distributed over a footprint of 1336 deg(2) with 0.6 < z(photo) < 1 and a typical redshift uncertainty of 0.03(1 + z). This sample was selected, as fully described in a companion paper, using a colour/magnitude selection that optimizes trade-offs between number density and redshift uncertainty. We investigate the BAO signal in the projected clustering using three conventions, the angular separation, the comoving transverse separation, and spherical harmonics. Further, we compare results obtained from template-based and machine-learning photometric redshift determinations. We use 1800 simulations that approximate our sample in order to produce covariance matrices and allow us to validate our distance scale measurement methodology. We measure the angular diameter distance, D-A, at the effective redshift of our sample divided by the true physical scale of the BAO feature, r(d). We obtain close to a 4 per cent distance measurement of D-A (z(eff )= 0.81)/r(d) = 10.75 +/- 0.43. These results are consistent with the flat A cold dark matter concordance cosmological model supported by numerous other recent experimental results.	[Abbott, T. M. C.; Smith, R. C.; Walker, A.

R-band light-curve properties of Type Ia supernovae from the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general; cosmology: observations	HOST GALAXIES; K-CORRECTIONS; RISE-TIME; PHOTOMETRY; REDSHIFT; DIVERSITY; UNIVERSE; STELLAR; LAMBDA; LEGACY	We present the best 265 sampled R-band light curves of spectroscopically identified Type Ia supernovae (SNe) from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; 2009-2012) survey and the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF; 2013-2017). A model-independent light-curve template is built from our data-set with the purpose to investigate average properties and diversity in our sample. We searched for multiple populations in the light-curve properties using machine learning tools. We also utilized the long history of our light curves, up to 4000 days, to exclude any significant pre- or post- supernova flares. From the shapes of light curves we found the average rise time in the R band to be 16.8(-0.6)(+0.5) days. Although PTF/iPTF were singleband surveys, by modelling the residuals of the SNe in the Hubble-Lemattre diagram, we estimate the average colour excess of our sample to be < E(B - V)> approximate to 0.05(2) mag and thus the mean corrected peak brightness to be M-R = -19.02 +/- 0.02 +5 log(H-0[ km s(-1) Mpc(-1)]/70) mag with only weak dependennce on light-curve shape. The intrinsic scatter is found to be sigma(R)= 0.186 +/- 0.033 mag for the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.1, without colour corrections of individual SNe. Our analysis shows that Malmquist bias becomes very significant at z = 0.13. A similar limitation is expected for the ongoing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey using the same telescope, but new camera expressly designed for ZTF.

Thermal balance and comparison of gas and dust properties of dense clumps in the Hi-GAL survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; stars: formation; stars: protostars; ISM: clouds; ISM: evolution	STAR-FORMING REGIONS; PLANE SURVEY HOPS; AMMONIA OBSERVATIONS; MASSIVE STARS; MILKY-WAY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; INITIAL CONDITIONS; MOLECULAR CLOUD; COMPLETE SAMPLE	We present a comparative study of physical properties derived from gas and dust emission in a sample of 1068 dense Galactic clumps. The sources are selected from the cross-match of the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey with 16 catalogues of NH3 line emission in its lowest inversion (1,1) and (2,2) transitions. The sample covers a large range in masses and bolometric luminosities, with surface densities above Sigma = 0.1 g cm(-2) and with low virial parameters alpha < 1. The comparison between dust and gas properties shows an overall agreement between T-kin and T-dust at volumetric densities n greater than or similar to 1.2 x 10(4)cm(-3), and a median fractional abundance chi (NH3) = 1.46 x 10(-8). While the protostellar clumps in the sample have small differences between T-kin and T-dust, prestellar clumps have a median ratio T-kin/T-dust = 1.24, suggesting that these sources are thermally decoupled. A correlation is found between the evolutionary tracer L/M and the parameters T-kin/T-dust and chi(NH3) in prestellar sources and protostellar clumps with L/M < 1 L circle dot M circle dot-1 . In addition, a weak correlation is found between non-thermal velocity dispersion and the L/M parameter, possibly indicating an increase of turbulence with protostellar evolution in the interior of clumps. Finally, different processes are discussed to explain the differences between gas and dust temperatures in prestellar candidates, and the origin of non-thermal motions observed in the clumps.

Is every strong lens model unhappy in its own way? Uniform modelling of a sample of 13 quadruply+ imaged quasars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: data analysis; galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD; galaxies: structure	DARK-MATTER SUBSTRUCTURE; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; INTEGRAL FIELD SPECTROSCOPY; INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; EDGE-ON DISC; HE 0435-1223; FLUX RATIOS; GALAXIES; DISCOVERY; STELLAR	Strong-gravitational lens systems with quadruply imaged quasars (quads) are unique probes to address several fundamental problems in cosmology and astrophysics. Although they are intrinsically very rare, ongoing and planned wide-field deep-sky surveys are set to discover thousands of such systems in the next decade. It is thus paramount to devise a general framework to model strong-lens systems to cope with this large influx without being limited by expert investigator time. We propose such a general modelling framework (implemented with the publicly available software LENsTRoNotvrv) and apply it to uniformly model threeband Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 images of 13 quads. This is the largest uniformly modelled sample of quads to date and paves the way for a variety of studies. To illustrate the scientific content of the sample, we investigate the alignment between the mass and light distribution in the deflectors. The position angles of these distributions are wellaligned, except when there is strong external shear. However, we find no correlation between the ellipticity of the light and mass distributions. We also show that the observed flux-ratios between the images depart significantly from the predictions of simple smooth models. The departures are strongest in the bluest band, consistent with microlensing being the dominant cause in addition to millilensing. Future papers will exploit this rich data set in combination with ground-based spectroscopy and time delays to determine quantities such as the IIubble constant, the free streaming length of dark matter, and the normalization of the initial stellar mass function.

P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) has previously been demonstrated as a powerful tool for characterizing the 3-D vertical structure of tropical forests, and its capability and potential to retrieve tropical forest structure has been discussed and assessed. On the other hand, the abilities of L-band TomoSAR are still in the early stages of development. Here, we aim to provide a better understanding of L-band TomoSAR capabilities for retrieving the 3-D structure of tropical forests and estimating the top height in dense forests. We carried out tomographic analysis using L-band UAVSAR data from the AfriSAR campaign conducted over Gabon Lope Park in February 2016. First, it was found that L-band TomoSAR was able to penetrate into and through the canopy down to the ground, and thus the canopy and ground layers were detected correctly. The resulting TomoSAR vertical profiles were validated with a digital terrain model and canopy height model extracted from small-footprint Lidar (SFL) data. Second, there was a strong correlation between the L-band Capon beam forming profile in HH and HV polarizations with Land Vegetation Ice Sensor (LVIS) Level 1B waveform Lidar over different kinds of forest in Gabon Lope National Park. Finally, forest top height from the L-band data was estimated and validated with SFL data, resulting in a root mean square error of 3 m and coefficient of determination of 0.92. The results demonstrate that L-band TomoSAR is capable of characterizing 3-D structure of tropical forests.

Impact of the Revisit of Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Observations on Evapotranspiration UncertaintyA Sensitivity Study Using AmeriFlux Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Evapotranspiration; remote sensing; revisit time period; AmeriFlux	LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE; LATENT-HEAT FLUX; EVAPORATIVE FRACTION; SENSED DATA; SELF-PRESERVATION; WATER; TIME; VEGETATION	Thermal infrared remote sensing observations have been widely used to provide useful information on surface energy and water stress for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). However, the revisit time of current high spatial resolution (<100 m) thermal infrared remote sensing systems, sixteen days for Landsat for example, can be insufficient to reliably derive ET information for water resources management. We used in situ ET measurements from multiple Ameriflux sites to (1) evaluate different scaling methods that are commonly used to derive daytime ET estimates from time-of-day observations; and (2) quantify the impact of different revisit times on ET estimates at monthly and seasonal time scales. The scaling method based on a constant evaporative ratio between ET and the top-of-atmosphere solar radiation provided slightly better results than methods using the available energy, the surface solar radiation or the potential ET as scaling reference fluxes. On average, revisit time periods of 2, 4, 8 and 16 days resulted in ET uncertainties of 0.37, 0.55, 0.73 and 0.90 mm per day in summer, which represented 13%, 19%, 23% and 31% of the monthly average ET calculated using the one-day revisit dataset. The capability of a system to capture rapid changes in ET was significantly reduced for return periods higher than eight days. The impact of the revisit on ET depended mainly on the land cover type and seasonal climate, and was higher over areas with high ET. We did not observe significant and systematic differences between the impacts of the revisit on monthly ET estimates that are based on morning or afternoon observations. We found that four-day revisit scenarios provided a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor surface ET reducing by around 40% the uncertainty of ET products derived from a 16-day revisit system, such as Landsat for instance.

Instead of single pixel analysis, we generate spatial segments (i.e., superpixels) based on local image statistics to track homogeneous patches of forest across a time-series of ALOS/PALSAR images. Forest loss detection is performed using an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on local radar backscatter features derived from superpixels. This method is applied to time-series of ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 radar images over a boreal forest within the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve in Quebec, Canada. We evaluate four spatial arrangements including (1) single pixels, (2) square grid cells, (3) superpixels based on segmentation of the radar images, and (4) superpixels derived from ancillary optical Landsat imagery. Detection of forest loss using superpixels outperforms single pixel and regular square grid cell approaches, especially when superpixels are generated from ancillary optical imagery. Results are validated with official Quebec forestry data and Hansen et al. forest loss products. Our results indicate that this approach can be applied to monitor forest loss across large study areas using L-band radar instruments such as ALOS/PALSAR, particularly when combined with superpixels generated from ancillary optical data.

Transfer learning for galaxy morphology from one survey to another	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: observational; methods: photometric; surveys; galaxies: structure	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DATA RELEASE; CLASSIFICATIONS; EVOLUTION; CATALOG	Deep learning (DL) algorithms for morphological classification of galaxies have proven very successful, mimicking (or even improving) visual classifications. However, these algorithms rely on large training samples of labelled galaxies (typically thousands of them). A key question for using DL classifications in future Big Data surveys is how much of the knowledge acquired from an existing survey can be exported to a new data set, i.e. if the features learned by the machines are meaningful for different data. We test the performance of DL models, trained with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, on Dark Energy Survey (DES) using images for a sample of similar to 5000 galaxies with a similar redshift distribution to SDSS. Applying the models directly to DES data provides a reasonable global accuracy (similar to 90 per cent), but small completeness and purity values. A fast domain adaptation step, consisting of a further training with a small DES sample of galaxies (similar to 500-300), is enough for obtaining an accuracy >95 per cent and a significant improvement in the completeness and purity values. This demonstrates that, once trained with a particular data set, machines can quickly adapt to new instrument characteristics (e.g. PSF, seeing, depth), reducing by almost one order of magnitude the necessary training sample for morphological classification. Redshift evolution effects or significant depth differences are not taken into account in this study.	[Sanchez, H. Dominguez; Huertas-Company, M.; Bernardi, M.; Fischer, J. L.; D'Andrea, C.

These excursions reveal themselves as sharp increases in the stellar total luminosity and/or effective temperature of the protostar and can last from hundreds to a few thousands of years, depending on the burst strength and characteristics of the protostar. During the excursions, low-mass protostars occupy the same part of the H-R diagram as young intermediate-mass protostars in the quiescent phase of accretion. Moreover, the time spent by low-mass protostars in these regions is on average a factor of several longer than that spent by the intermediate-mass stars in quiescence. During the excursions, low-mass protostars pass close to the position of most known FUors in the H-R diagram, but owing to intrinsic ambiguity the model stellar evolutionary tracks are unreliable in determining the FUor properties. We find that the photospheric luminosity in the outburst state may dominate the accretion luminosity already after a few years after the onset of the outburst, meaning that the mass accretion rates of known FUors inferred from the bolometric luminosity may be systematically overestimated, especially in the fading phase.

A gap in HD 92945's broad planetesimal disc revealed by ALMA	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability; circumstellar matter; stars: individual: HD 92945; techniques: interferometric; methods: numerical	DEBRIS DISCS; GIANT PLANETS; EXOCOMETARY GAS; BETA-PICTORIS; DUST; MIGRATION; SYSTEM; NEPTUNE; SPITZER; YOUNG	In the last few years, multiwavelength observations have revealed the ubiquity of gaps/rings in circumstellar discs. Here we report the first ALMA observations of HD 92945 at 0.86 mm, which reveal a gap at about 73 +/- 3 au within a broad disc of planetesimals that extends from 50 to 140 au. We find that the gap is 20(-8)(+10) au wide. If cleared by a planet in situ, this planet must be less massive than 0.6 M-Jup, or even lower if the gap was cleared by a planet that formed early in the protoplanetary disc and prevented planetesimal formation at that radius. By comparing opposite sides of the disc, we also find that the disc could be asymmetric. Motivated by the asymmetry and the fact that planets might be more frequent closer to the star in exoplanetary systems, we show that the gap and asymmetry could be produced by two planets interior to the disc through secular resonances. These planets excite the eccentricity of bodies at specific disc locations, opening radial gaps in the planetesimal distribution. New observations are necessary to confirm if the disc is truly asymmetric, thus favouring the secular resonance model, or if the apparent asymmetry is due to a background galaxy, favouring the in situ planet scenario. Finally, we also report the non-detection of CO and HCN gas, confirming that no primordial gas is present. The CO and HCN non-detections are consistent with the destruction of volatile-rich Solar system-like comets.	[Marino, S.; Yelverton, B.; Wyatt, M.

Ozone intensities in the rotational bands	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Ozone; Atmospheric absorption; Infrared intensities	INTERNAL PARTITION SUMS; ABSOLUTE INTENSITIES; MU-M; ABSORPTION; STARK	This note provides a citable reference to a database reconciliation effort for ozone pure rotational intensities. The permanent dipole moment and theoretical adjustments for centrifugal distortion are utilized in a predictive calculation that is compared to experimental measurements. This prediction has been available in the JPL spectral line catalog since 2005, but has been at odds with the HITRAN database, which was originally based on an atlas provided by Flaud (HITRAN 1992) and subsequently scaled by 4% (HITRAN 2004). Using a modified partition function and isotopic abundance factor, the JPL 2005 prediction has now been utilized to create a self-consistent entry as an interim update to the HITRAN2016 database. Ramifications of the intensity change for users of HITRAN versions 2004-2012 are discussed. New pure rotational intensity measurements were carried out supporting the validity of the JPL 2005 database. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to well-studied clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin, This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

We present precision 4.5 mu m Spitzer transit photometry of eight planet candidates discovered by the K2 mission: K2-52 b, K2-53 b, EPIC 205084841.01, K2-289 b, K2-174 b, K2-87 b, K2-90 b, and K2-124 b. The sample includes four sub-Neptunes and two sub-Saturns, with radii between 2.6 and 18 R-circle plus and equilibrium temperatures between 440 and 2000 K. In this paper we identify several targets of potential interest for future characterization studies, demonstrate the utility of transit follow-up observations for planet validation and ephemeris refinement, and present new imaging and spectroscopy data. Our simultaneous analysis of the K2 and Spitzer light curves yields improved estimates of the planet radii and multiwavelength information that helps validate their planetary nature, including the previously unvalidated candidate EPIC 205686202.01 (K2-289 b). Our Spitzer observations yield an order-of-magnitude increase in ephemeris precision, thus paving the way for efficient future study of these interesting systems by reducing the typical transit timing uncertainty in mid-2021 from several hours to a dozen or so minutes. K2-53 b, K2-289 b, K2-174 b, K2-87 b, and K2-90 b are promising radial velocity (RV) targets given the performance of spectrographs available today or in development, and the M3V star K2-124 hosts a temperate sub-Neptune that is potentially a good target for both RV and atmospheric characterization studies.

Short-term cloud feedbacks by cloud type are investigated both globally and locally by three different definitions in the literature: 1) the global-mean cloud feedback parameter lambda(GG) from regressing the global-mean cloud-induced TOA radiation anomaly Delta R-G with the global-mean surface temperature change Delta T-GS; 2) the local feedback parameter lambda(LL) from regressing the local Delta R with the local surface temperature change Delta T-S; and 3) the local feedback parameter lambda(GL) from regressing global Delta R-G with local Delta T-S. Observations show significant temporal variability in the magnitudes and spatial patterns in lambda(GG) and lambda(GL), whereas lambda(LL) remains essentially time invariant for different cloud types. The global-mean net lambda(GG) exhibits a gradual transition from negative to positive in the A-Train era due to a less negative lambda(GG) from low clouds and an increased positive lambda(GG) from high clouds over the warm pool region associated with the 2015/16 strong El Nino event. Strong temporal variability in lambda(GL) is intrinsically linked to its dependence on global Delta R-G, and the scaling of lambda(GL) with surface temperature change patterns to obtain global feedback lambda(GG) does not hold. Despite the shortness of the A-Train record, statistically robust signals can be obtained for different cloud types and regions of interest.

Improved line list of (CH4)-C-12 in the 3760-4100 cm(-1) region	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						High resolution spectra; CH4; Methane; Octad; Long path FFIR; Vibration-rotation states; Intensities; Infrared absorption; Effective Hamiltonian	ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM; 80 K; METHANE ABSORPTION; GLOBAL ANALYSIS; PARAMETERS; ASSIGNMENT; SHAPES; SYSTEM; SPECTROSCOPY; SURFACE	Eight spectra of normal samples of CH4 in the 3760-4100 cm(-1) region were recorded by using a Fourier transform spectrometer in Reims, France at long paths (202 m, 602 m, 1604 m and 1804 m) and different pressures. Additional spectra of (CH4)-C-12 covering the same region were obtained at 100 K and very low sample pressures, which was used for low-J line position identification. Line positions and intensities were retrieved by least squares curve-fitting procedures and analyzed using the effective Hamiltonian and the effective dipole. A new measured line list contains positions and intensities for 9000 features. Quantum assignments were made for more than 3500 new transitions, which represent similar to 95% of the integrated line intensity observed in this region. The resulting list of lines is much more accurate than the list of lines HITRAN 2016. All assigned 5703 line positions were fitted to RMS standard deviations of 0.0018 cm(-1). The sum of observed intensities between 3760 and 4100 cm(-1) fell within 2% of the predicted value from ab initio variational calculations reported in the TheoReTS database (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr; http://theorets.tsu.ru).

This structure type, of which the prototype is Ca14AlSb11, provides a flexible framework for tuning structure-property relationships and hence the physical and chemical properties of compounds. Compounds within this family show exceptional high temperature thermoelectric performance at temperatures above 300 K and unique magnetic and transport behavior at temperatures below 300 K.
